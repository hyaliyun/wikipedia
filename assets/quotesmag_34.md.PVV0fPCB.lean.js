On September 6, 2002, Plant was inducted into The Single-Handed Sailing Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island. Mike Plant was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on November 21, 1950, the third of Frank Plant Jr. and Mary Kennedy's five children. He spent his childhood in the Minneapolis suburb of Deephaven on the shores of Lake Minnetonka.Plant, Julia. Coyote Lost at Sea: The Story of Mike Plant, America‚Äôs Daring Solo Circumnavigator. (March 5, 2013) At the age of 9, Plant began sailing X Boats at Minnetonka Yacht Club, and by the age of 14, aboard Lucky Strike, had twice won the Interlake Regatta, the biggest regatta in the area, in which the top five boats from each of the large lakes in Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin competed at the end of the summer. After many adventures in his 20s, including trekking the length of South America (12,000 miles), Plant moved to Jamestown, Rhode Island, where he would later find his passion for single-handed sailing.

Although eliminated from the race after receiving help to rescue his boat after it ran aground in Perseverance Harbour at Campbell Island, New Zealand, Plant still set a record for the fastest American to sail single-handed around the world with a time of 135 days, bettering Dodge Morgan's time of 150 days set in 1985 aboard his 60-foot cutter, American Promise.Dodge Morgan, Who Sailed Around World, Dies at 78 The New York Times, September 17, 2010.

Once anchored, a storm caught him and began pushing Duracell toward a rocky shore‚Äôs certain destruction. On the island, four meteorologists saw the racer‚Äôs plight and motored out in their boat as the windspeed slowly increased. To save his boat with its dragging anchor, Plant had to accept the tow, but he knew that the outside assistance would disqualify him. The meteorologists suggested to Mike that he simply continue the race. They vowed eternal silence. No one would know. \\"Except I would,\\" Mike answered. Plant radioed the race committee that he had accepted outside help and that he would continue the race, though disqualified. He unofficially crossed the finish line in seventh place. Mike lost the race, but to the admiring French, he emerged a real hero. His determination and honesty did not go unnoticed: 25,000 people lined the breakwater in Les Sables d‚ÄôOlonne to give him a rousing hero‚Äôs welcome. Mike was the only American in the race. Herb McCormick, editor of Cruising World, and the Boating Editor of the New York Times wrote: \\"The tens of thousands of French men and women who greeted him at the finish understood something that largely was missed in this country. By forging on, by completing what he‚Äôd set out to do, by showing the highest respect for his competitors in a wonderful act of sportsmanship, Mike was as much a winner as the sailors who‚Äôd officially crossed the finish line.\\" Excerpt from Broken Seas by Marlin Bree Retrieved October 8, 2013 ** Plant's record as the fastest American to sail single-handed around the world stood until the 1994/95 BOC Challenge when Steve Pettengill, sailing Hunter's Child, bested the time with a circumnavigation in 128 days.

History Oklahoma Joe's was originally started by Joe Davidson as a smoker manufacturer, then a decade later launched its barbecue restaurant. The first Oklahoma Joe's opened in Stillwater, Oklahoma, in January 1996. A Kansas City location followed later that year, located inside a gas station at the corner of W 47th St and Mission Rd in Kansas City, Kansas. During the 1990s, Joe Davidson met Jeff and Joy Stehney while they were on the competition barbecue circuit with their team Slaughterhouse Five. Davidson and the Stehneys decided to go into the restaurant business together, and they opened Oklahoma Joe's in Stillwater, Oklahoma and in Kansas City, Kansas in 1996. Davidson sold Oklahoma Joe's Smokers in 1997 and moved to Texas. With Davidson out of Oklahoma, the partners decided to close the Stillwater location, and the Stehneys bought out Davidson's ownership and assumed full control of the Kansas location.Great American Bites: Award-winning Kansas City BBQ at Oklahoma Joe's - USATODAY.com When Joe Davidson returned to Oklahoma and opened his own version of a new Oklahoma Joe's in 2011, he made an agreement with the Stehneys to change the name of their Kansas City area restaurants. In August 2014, the Stehneys announced that the name of their three Kansas City area restaurants would be changed to Joe‚Äôs Kansas City Bar-B-Que. Davidson opened his first of the current Oklahoma Joe's restaurants in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma in 2011. He opened his second location in 2012 inside Cain's Ballroom in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 2014, Davidson announced that he was planning new locations in South Tulsa and in the Washington, DC area. The location in South Tulsa opened in May 2016. He also announced plans for a one-of-a kind Barbecue Factory in Oklahoma. A location in Lincoln, Nebraska's Haymarket District opened on July 25, 2017.

It produced 425 kW (570 hp) and powered several absolute world distance records as well as commercial passenger flights. Design and development During the second half of the 1920s Fiat introduced several water-cooled aircraft engines, including the A.20, A.22, A24, A.25 and A.30. They were all upright V-12s with 60¬∞ between the cylinder banks; capacities ranged between 18.7 L and 54.5 L (1,141-3,326 cu in) and power outputs between 320 kW and 745 kW (430-1,000 hp). Producing 425 kW (570 hp) from 27.5 L (1,678 cu in), the A.22 was towards the middle of these ranges. When Fiat were advised by the government to simplify their water-cooled product line, they focussed on the A.20, A.22 and A.30 models. The A.22 was first run in 1926 and a \\"few hundred\\" were built. The A.22 was developed into the Fiat AS.2 and AS.3 Schneider Trophy race engines. Operational history The A.22 was best known for its contribution to some world long distance record flights made by the single engine landplane Savoia-Marchetti S.64, which used the specially adapted A.22 T. version. Between 31 May and 2 June 1928 this aircraft flew non-stop for 7,665 km (4,763 mi) to capture the world closed circuit distance record. The flight lasted 58 hr 34 min; the two crew, Capt.

The image of the Hollywood Indian reflects neither contemporary nor historical Native American realities. Closely connected to myths and images created about Native Americans and the Wild West, the stereotype has undergone significant changes from the beginning of cinema to the present day. Stereotypical images of Native Americans History The War Bonnet (1914) The Hollywood Indian has his roots in the Western as a literary genre. Ideas such as the vanishing Indian, or the noble and ignoble savage, were made popular by authors such as James Fenimore Cooper. This popular wild west literature revolved around frontiersmen, pioneers, and settlers struggling against nature, lawlessness, and Native Americans.John A. Price, \\"The Stereotyping of North American Indians in Motion Pictures.\\" In G.M. Bataille and C.L.S. Silet, eds. The Pretend Indians: Images of Native Americans in the Movies (Ann Arbor: Books on Demand, 1994), 77. Drawing upon genres such as the captivity narrative, these novels rely on a variety of stereotypes. Although supposedly sympathetic to Native Americans, Cooper simplified and polarized Native characters and experiences. While portraying some of his Native main characters as regal, he also portrayed them as the last of their kind and thus enforced the image of the 'vanishing Indian'.Jacquelyin Kilpatrick, Celluloid Indians. Native Americans and Film (Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press, 1999), 3. This is one of the most persistent images carried into the 20th century. Literary models promoted the idea of Native Americans being either noble or ignoble, and the negative image legitimized concepts such as manifest destiny and the resulting need to eliminate the \\"Indian threat\\" to American civilization.Ken Nolley, \\"John Ford and the Hollywood Indian.\\" Film and History 23.1‚Äì4 (1993): 49. Wild West shows spread these stereotypes to even larger audiences. Some individual Natives were made famous by non- Natives, who then promoted the racist idea that one man could stand for all Native Americans.Ward Churchill, Norbert Hill, and Mary Ann Hill, \\"Media Stereotyping and Native Response: An Historical Overview.\\" The Indian Historian 11.4 (1978): 46. The mainstream image of Natives underwent a major change in the 19th century. While in the centuries before, European depictions of Native Americans had been characterized by a certain nakedness, from mid- century on the naked or partly naked \\"demi-god or cannibal\\" was replaced by the mounted, be-feathered, and 'decently' dressed warrior. Most characteristics of this latter stereotypical Native American were taken from various tribal groups of the Great Plains as they appeared in the 19th century ‚Äì such as the war bonnet, the teepee, the pipe, and the riding skills. Apparently, already Buffalo Bill picked the Sioux as his favourite \\"tribe\\" due to their riding skills and outer appearance.Churchill, Hill, Hill, \\"Media Stereotyping\\", 47.Hartmut Lutz, Approaches. Essays in Native North American Studies and Literatures (Augsburg: Wi√üner, 2002), 51. Theories of Indian stereotyping In the context of the Western movies, images ranged from 'the savage warrior' who took the shape of the noble savage ‚Äì the heroic and noble hunter/warrior who is most often stoic, in touch with nature, and peace-loving but willing to fight when necessary. Furthermore, derogatory images of the drunken Indian, and the shaman character, who was depicted as mysterious and deeply religious, exist.John Mihelich, \\"Smoke or Signals? American Popular Culture and the Challenge to Hegemonic Images of American Indians in Native American Film.\\" Wicazo Sa Review 16.2 (2001), 130. Jacquelyn Kilpatrick names three classes of these offensive stereotypes: mental, sexual, and spiritual. She attributes most meaning to the first class, which characterizes Native Americans as being inferior to Euro-Americans in terms of intellect, leading to a \\"dumb, dirty, and stupid\\" image of Native Americans. The second class portrays especially male Native Americans as intensely sexual beings who are more \\"creature than human\\", run around half-naked, and do little more than lusting after white maidens. The last category views the Native American as a spiritual being. Although this spirituality is perceived as an inherent closeness to nature and especially the earth, which gives Native peoples a \\"certain nature-based nobility\\", it is also regarded as simple and heathen.Kilpatrick, Celluloid Indians, xvii. The Hollywood Indian Hollywood Indians are usually based solely on stereotypes of the Plains Indians, such as the Lakota, Cheyenne, and Comanche, ignoring completely the cultural diversity of the many tribes in North America. Although the film industry \\"is (mostly) far from purposeful distortion\\", technical and business- related production decisions affect the Native American screen image.John E. O'Connor, \\"The White Man's Indian. An Institutional Approach.\\" In P.C. Rollins and John E. O'Connor, eds. Hollywood's Indian: The Portrayal of the Native American in Film (Lexington/KY: University Press of Kentucky, 2003), 30. O'Connor argues that audiences have certain expectations for characteristic representation ‚Äì such as easy comprehensibility of the storyline and the morality ‚Äì which they value over authenticity, and the same holds true for stereotypes.O'Connor, \\"The White Man's Indian\\", 32ff. While most of the above features also apply to literature or other media, specific business-related decisions influence film in a way that might advance the stereotypical depiction of Native Americans. The impact of the resulting distorted images in film can be considered in different terms than that of other media. While novels certainly reach a broad public, the worldwide distribution of films allows for a number of spectators on a totally different scale ‚Äì not only in numbers, but also emotionally by using filmic devices such as light, music, and camera angles.Vine Deloria, Jr., \\"Foreword/American Fantasy.\\" In G.M. Bataille and C.L.S. Silet, eds. The Pretend Indians: Images of Native Americans in the Movies. (Ann Arbor: Books on Demand, 1994), ix. As the dominant carrier of filmic misrepresentations of Native Americans, the Western genre emerged in the early days of cinema and remained popular through much of the 20th century. Crucial to the frontier myth, the settlement of the West, and the founding of white civilization are the antagonists, and the indigenous population, served as the opposition to the white Western hero personifying the \\"agent of civilization\\".Richard Berkhofer, The White Man's Indian. Images of the American Indian from Columbus to the Present (New York: Random House, 1978), 80. These antagonists in form of a fictional, homogenized celluloid Indian have never really existed except in the stories told by white Americans to white audiences.Kilpatrick, Celluloid Indians, 48. Stuart Hall explains how cinema and cultural identity go hand in hand. Identity is not a static fact, but rather something that can be continually reproduced. The ways that identities are portrayed in film are typically not the same as they are in reality. The interpretation of an identity in film is determined both by the filmmakers and the audience. Since the majority of films in the United States featuring Native Americans were made by Euro-American filmmakers up until the 1970s, Native Americans were not represented from an authentic perspective and were often cast in stereotypes. Twentieth-century images Early depictions of Native Americans in film are surprisingly diverse. Although the Indian as the villain, antagonist, or simple-minded savage was present, a complex array of characters populated the silent screens between 1909 and 1913, a period when Indian characters where especially popular: the villain could be white as well as Indian; lasting white‚ÄìIndian relationships emerged; and mixed-blood Indians could be villainous as well as sympathetic. Edwin Carewe (real name Jay Fox), a Chickasaw filmmaker from that era, made more than 60 feature films and directed the 1928 version of Ramona starring Delores Del Rio and Waner Baxter.Angela Aleiss, Making the White Man's Indian. Native Americans and Hollywood Movies (Westport/CT and London: Praeger, 2005), pp. 2, 25. By the late teens, the popularity of Indian movies and cowboy-and-Indian movies decreased, and even though Indian movies continued to be produced in moderate numbers, they only became popular again by the mid 1930s. One of the most notable directors from 1924's The Iron Horse to 1964's Cheyenne Autumn was John Ford, often working with John Wayne as his male protagonist. Ford's depiction of Native Americans actually showed both hostile and sympathetic Indians such as in Stagecoach (1939), but also in Fort Apache (1948) and Wagon Master (1950).Angela Aleiss, \\"A Race Divided: The Indian Westerns of John Ford,\\" American Indian Culture & Research Journal, 18 (2), Summer 1995, 25‚Äì34. The first two movies in the cavalry trilogy, Fort Apache and She Wore A Yellow Ribbon (1949) feature sympathetic Indians with speaking roles and the conflict is mostly the fault of white prejudice rather than the inherently bad nature of the typical screen Indians. Not all Indian portrayals were savage; by 1950, Delmer Daves' Broken Arrow had set the stage for a new era of Indian/white peaceful coexistence.Angela Aleiss, \\"Hollywood Addresses Postwar Assimilation: Indian/White Attitudes in Broken Arrow, American Indian Culture & Research Journal, 11 (1), 1987, 67‚Äì79. A gradual change in the American Indian's screen image did occur from the 1940s and 1950s onwards, at the height of the Western's popularity, when a turn towards \\"the gradual elimination of the stereotypes in big budget movies \\" is noticeable. The social and political consequences of the World War II paved the way, as Native Americans were no longer the principal antagonists and World War II supplied America with new enemies, namely, the Germans, Italians, and Japanese.Price, \\"The Stereotyping of North American Indians\\", 90. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw a decline in the production of Western films, thus also diminishing the representation of Native Americans.Price, \\"The Stereotyping of North American Indians\\", 82‚Äì83. Influenced heavily by the experiences of the Vietnam war, Native Americans symbolically came to signify any indigenous population threatened by annihilation at the hands of the United States.Lutz, Approaches, 57. In this way, though the typical savage disappeared almost entirely from the big screen, Native Americans in motion pictures were reduced to a vehicle of criticism of contemporary politics. The 1970s and especially the late 1980s saw the emergence of independent films outside the Western genre depicted contemporary Native life. The decisive difference was that \\"Native American characters become significant in and of themselves\\".Michael Hilger, From Savage to Nobleman. Images of Native Americans in Film (Lanham/MD and London: Scarecrow Press, 1995), 205. At a time when the Western was nearly extinct, this new image marked an important step towards a greater variety of Native American images on screen. By the mere fact that it involved Native Americans in the production process more than ever before ‚Äì by employing Native actors for Native parts, for telling stories from a Native perspective, sometimes basing them on Native novels ‚Äì these films contributed to the visibility of Native peoples. Some examples are House Made of Dawn (1972), Spirit of the Wind (1979), and Powwow Highway (1989), although none of these films attracted a large, mainstream audience. More accurate film representations were now being made, but they were reaching nowhere near the exposure of the earlier, stereotypical images in Westerns.James Sandos and Larry Burgess, \\"The Hollywood Indian versus Native Americans. Tell Them Willie Boy is Here (1969).\\" In P.C. Rollins and John E. O'Connor, eds. Hollywood's Indian: The Portrayal of the Native American in Film. Lexington/KY: University Press of Kentucky, 108. The release of Dances with Wolves (1990) unexpectedly revived the Western genre. Arguably the most influential Native American-themed film of the last few decades, it paid reasonably careful attention to the depiction of Lakota life, traditions and clothing, at least compared to earlier efforts. However, the basic formula of the Hollywood stereotypes ‚Äì at its heart the idea of the white lead 'going Native', the arrival of the 'White Saviour' ‚Äì was not transcended, and there were still cultural errors in the film. Thus, the evaluation of scholarly criticism boiled down to granting the film good intentions, but at the same time classifying the movie as a revisionist Western simply replaying the romantic Noble Savage with the white as the hero.Hilger, From Savage to Nobleman, 223.Seth Bovey, \\"Dances with Stereotypes: Western Films and the Myth of the Noble Red.\\" South Dakota Review 31.1 (1993), 119ff.Elizabeth Cook-Lynn, \\"The Radical Conscience in Native American Studies.\\" Wicazo Sa Review 7.2 (1993), 9. Dances with Wolves was followed by other sympathetic or revisionist Western blockbusters such as The Last of the Mohicans (1992), and Geronimo: An American Legend (1993) and caused mainstream media to put American Indians on their agenda, at least for a short while. One of the few Hollywood movies that portrays Native life outside the Old West and instead sets its story in contemporary times is Thunderheart. Contemporary Native American cinema In the past two decades, a striving Native American independent cinema has developed. Native Americans have formed their own production companies and political organizations to influence their own representations and to counter negative stereotypes. What distinguishes Native American cinema from Hollywood productions is the involvement of American Indians as directors, writers, and producers, such as Sherman Alexie, Chris Eyre, Sterlin Harjo, Hanay Geiogamah, and Greg Sarris. Two of the most characteristic features are the casting of Native actors for Native roles, and the setting of the stories in contemporary America as opposed to the 19th-century West. Lakota Woman (TV 1994), Skinwalkers (TV 2002), Smoke Signals (1998), The Business of Fancydancing (2002), Grand Avenue (TV 1996), and Edge of America (TV 2003) are some best- known examples.Joshua Brockman, \\"Telling the Truth from Inside Indian Country.\\" The New York Times (September 29, 2002). Note that Native American filmmakers made several movies after the article's publication. Additionally, new media is providing a platform for short films and videos by independent producers, comedians, and other content-creators. Filmmakers such as Hulleah J. Tsinhnahjinnie, Shelley Niro, and Sherman Alexie have incorporated the stereotypical images of Native Americans into their films and worked to reshape the meaning that has often been historically ascribed to them in cinema. These images include wildlife, beadwork, feathers, smoke, and nature. The stereotypes associated with these images are largely derived from a colonized, Euro-American perspective and are still fueled today by tourism and commercialism. While the stereotypical representations have not accurately portrayed Native American culture, the fact that the images exist and are historically preserved allow filmmakers to reference well-known aspects of their cultural heritage and then reshape the meaning associated with the images. The stereotypical images represent a piece of Native American heritage that was not assimilated or eliminated. From here, contemporary Native American artists have begun to claim visual sovereignty over the images circulated in media. Visual sovereignty provides Native Americans the authority to authentically portray that which belongs to them‚Äîthe images of their cultural heritage. This is a step towards retelling the legacy of colonization from a Native American perspective instead of the Euro-American perspective, and is also an opportunity to break the mold of stereotypes still around today that are largely driven by consumerism. Many of contemporary films include themes about identity. Often, at least one of the characters grapples with honoring and acknowledging their cultural heritage while also living in a colonized society. The films also use various rhetorical devices to convey other cultural beliefs, including spirituality, life and death, time and space. A short, but powerful representation of contemporary Native American film is Aboriginal World View (2003) by Hulleah J. Tsinhnahjinnie. The film was produced while the political climate was tense between the Middle East and the United States. The film shows a woman wrapped in a burqa made of American flags, looking out at the Navajo reservation. Powwow music plays in the background, which eventually transitions into the sound of the waves of the Pacific Ocean. Tsinhnahjinnie took the opportunity to create a piece from an indigenous person's perspective that spoke to the recurring history of war, land, diaspora, violence, oppression, and dispossession. The film It Started With a Whisper (1993) by Shelley Niro is another example of contemporary Native American cinema reshaping the semiotic system behind Native American stereotypes. The film has an all-Native cast and was filmed in the Six Nations/Brantford area of Canada. The protagonist in the film, Shanna Sabbath, is an 18-year-old girl who grew up on the reservation, leaves to establish herself in an urban life, and returns to tend to family matters. The opening scene is a compilation of shots that show beadwork, hands throwing dirt in the air, and smoke rising into the air, all while the narrator speaks in the past tense‚Äîindicating something that has passed or been lost. The brief shots then give glimpses of a woman walking in the forest. The stereotypical images are heavily used, yet the film uses them to confront many misrepresentations of Native American people. From the opening scene, the film continues with rich, metaphorical images juxtaposed with urban lifestyle, interracial relationships, and allusions to other Native American cultural beliefs about time, space, and death. Perhaps a more popular film amongst a mainstream audience is The Business of Fancydancing (2002) by Sherman Alexie. The film is about a young Native American man who grew up on a reservation and eventually lives his adult life as a gay poet in Spokane. The stark contrast between life on a reservation and life in a city open a more authentic glimpse into a modern experience of grappling with identity when one is part of both settings. Alexie chose to make a low-budget, independent film in order to maintain all financial and creative control over the film. The cast and crew are predominantly Native American. Alexie has stated that the primary audience is for the film is Native Americans. In an interview with Joelle Fraser in Iowa Review, he explained how the majority those who read his literature and poetry are white. He said, \\"There's something wrong with my not reaching Indians . . . Generally speaking Indians don't read books. It's not a book culture. That's why I'm trying to make movies. Indians go to movies; Indians own VCRs\\". The film breaks many stereotypes, and also uses dialogue incorporates tropes and subtle cultural nuances that are particularly familiar to a Native American audience.

It is said that the building of the church was sponsored by the thanksgiving offering of Dr.Lephine's family for the miraculous cure of his daughter. It took 10 years to complete the Chapel. And Rev.Fr.Tarbes a cousin brother of St. Bernadette, the visionary of Lourdes, was appointed as the Parish Priest of Villianur mission. Since he had a direct report of the apparitions of Our Lady of Lourdes, this chapel is the first in the world to be named after Our Lady of Lourdes outside Lourdes, France. Miraculous Statue Central Altar with the Miraculous Statue A parishioner of Our Lady of Lourdes commissioned a six foot tall statue for the site, which arrived in Puducherry on 4 April 1877. The box containing the statue was dropped three times on the way to the Cathedral, but arrived intact, and was sent on to Villianur. The statue was claimed to be associated with a number of miracles in the late nineteenth century. In 1885 the archbishop Laou√´nan went to Rome and provided a report of the alleged miracles that took place at the shrine to Pope Leo XIII. The archbishop received permission on 21 February 1886 to declare the site an official Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes, and to canonically crown the statue. On the archbishop's return from Rome on 8 May 1886, a pontifical high mass was held, with the celebration being witnessed by around 40,000 people. At the mass, the archbishop crowned the statue in the name of the pope, and declared the church as the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes, Villianur, attaching permanent plenary indulgences to the shrine. Sacred Pond Church Pond There was a natural pond in front of the chapel. it was once used as the water reservoir for the irrigation of the lands around and water came from the big Ousteri Lake which is 10 km away from here. And this pond was constructed by Fr. Lesbond, the Parish Priest, with donations from Zigon organized by Mr. Lesage. Mr. Larocgue from the people in Zigon got a statue from Lourdes and in 1924 and a solemn ceremony took place to install the statue in the middle of the sacred pond after the due consecration of the statue and the pond. It is believed by the people here that the pond water is miracles and has the ability to cure the sick and bring good fortune. This is the only Catholic church in Asia having a sacred pond in front of the church. The grotto 19 years after Lourdes apparitions, the first church and grotto for Our Lady of Lourdes was constructed in 1877. The centenary celebrations was celebrated on 10 September 1977. As a remembrance of the centenary celebrations, Rev.Fr.Duissen built a big grotto in the garden of the church, which was consecrated by bishop Venmani S. Selvanather on 10 October 1978. The grotto which was inside the church was modified according as per the instruction of the Second Vatican Council. The Stations of the Cross In 2009, The Stations of the Cross were constructed around the 'Sacred Pond'. The 125th Anniversary Celebrations In 08, October 2011, on the 125th anniversary of the crowning of the statue by the Pope, Archbishop Rev. Mgr. Antony Anandarayar crowned the Statue again with a diamond crown. A new Church As the existing Church could not accommodate the growing number of pilgrims, a new Church is planned with the approval of Archbishop Most. Rev.Dr.Antony Anandarayar. It is expected to be finished by 2014-2015. On 10 September 2011, Rev. Fr. A. Arulanandam, the Vicar General of Archdiocese blessed and officially commenced the construction work for the church. Rev.

It extended approximately 20 miles on either side of the railway. Although the land was initially under provincial control, the Government of British Columbia agreed to transfer control of the Railway Belt to the Government of Canada, as a condition of the British Columbia Terms of EntryBritish Columbia Terms of Union, para. 11. into Confederation. The federal Government then used the Railway Belt to further the building of the transcontinental railway, by granting portions of it to the CPR. The federal government also surveyed the Railway Belt under the Dominion Lands Survey. The CPR had relied on selling the lands to settlers to assist in financing the construction of the railway, the same technique it used in the Prairie provinces. However, in British Columbia the route of the CPR went through the mountains. Most of the land in the Railway Belt was not arable and therefore was not very valuable for settlers. To assist in the financing, in 1883 the Province agreed to transfer another block of land, the Peace River Block, to the control of the federal Government, which in turn granted portions to the CPR for land development. Federal control of the Railway Belt and the Peace River Block became an issue of controversy and provincial resentment after the CPR was built. Eventually, in 1930 the federal government agreed to transfer the Railway Belt and the Peace River Block back to the province. The transfer was done by the enactment of the Natural Resources Acts, passed by the Parliament of CanadaAn Act respecting the transfer of the Railway Belt and the Peace River Block, S.C, 1930, c. 37 and the Legislature of British Columbia, and then ratified by a constitutional amendment passed by the British Parliament.Constitution Act, 1930.

The modern-day area of Schoharie County once fell under the boundaries of the expansive Albany County. Numerous times after the 1683 creation of Albany County, partitions of its area were divided up reassigning parts of the land under new dominions. Partitions that were designated in a 1795 change rendered a parcel to be known as Schoharie County from portions of Albany County's territory. Although not an official county during the Revolution, modern-day Schoharie County highly regards the region‚Äôs historical presence of the time period relating to the American Revolution. Many local municipalities have long standing traditions associated with the late 18th century. Much of the folklore and heritage of the area in linked to the events of this era as well. Local communities pride themselves on the history of both the physical land, key figures and events in the area during the late 1700s. The land was of great significance during this time, both as a tactically strategic sight, and for its agricultural significance. Similar to today's Schoharie Valley, farms of this time period were substantial producers of vital crops for New England. Regularly referred to as \\"the breadbasket of the revolution,\\" the fertile valley was invaluable to the Revolutionary forces. The agricultural output of the region was responsible for much of the sustenance provided to General George Washington's Army during much of the war. In addition to the relevance of the area's crop output, the location along the Schoharie Creek was also a crucial aspect of its place in history. A considerable amount of the hostilities that occurred throughout the county were a result of the importance of the waterways surrounding the valley. Two major rivers within the northeast, the Mohawk and Hudson meet just north of Albany, NY, not far from Schoharie County. During the time of the American Revolution, the British looked to seize control of Albany, and therein control of the Hudson. The connection of the Hudson River from New England to the more southerly colonies was essential for the transportation of rations and supplies for the American forces. Severing this support system would have been devastating for the Continental troops, and the British forces knew this taking of the city would be extremely strategically advantageous. In 1777, three British armies were poised to advance on Albany, commanded by General John Burgoyne. Two of these Aamies had come from in Canada via the Mohawk River and Lake Champlain waterway . During their march on Albany, the path led past the region now known as Schoharie County. The advancement of British troops caused quite a stir amongst many residents of the area. The conflict that would soon ensue created a division throughout the area. While many sided with the fight for a free America, a large loyalist uprising in the area began to take hold. A number of notable historic figures of the Revolution played a part the uprising, in addition to Schoharie's involvement in the War. The Mohawk Sachem Joseph Brant (Thayendanega)) was famous throughout the war, as well as in local lore. Brant was widely known for his importance to the British forces, even having met with King George III at one time. Renowned for his role in recruiting loyalists and Natives Americans, Brant led these troops against the rebels for much of the war. Taking part in many major raids and battles in New York, Brant was feared by the rebels, and revered by the British. His presence was a factor in the outcome of many skirmishes throughout campaigns of the state. Most notably in the Schoharie area were Brant's role in the Battle of Cobleskill, the Battle of the Flockey, and his raids alongside Sir John Johnson in 1780. Along with Brant, some local residents garnered fame while aiding the loyalist uprising as well. Local tavern owner George Mann is also well known throughout the region for his support of the crown. Mann was at one time a Captain in the Schohary Militia, but defected and recruited from within the militia's ranks to aid the Tories. The tavern owned by Mann was utilized as a meeting place for Tories and Indians, loyal to the Crown. While the recognition of these individuals is for their loyalties to England, distinction is also given to those who fought for the side of Revolution. Known throughout the county, a hero of the Continental Army and Schoharie County during this era was Timothy Murphy. Murphy was a revered rifleman of Washington's army. During times of loyalist and British raids on the region, three forts had been erected to protect residents, due to the lack of proper military enforcement from the attacks. The Upper, Middle, and Lower Forts were spread apart along the banks of the Schoharie Creek. Murphy is credited with being an essential to the defense of the Middle Fort during an attack. Having already been admired as a hero of the Battle of Saratoga, he was able to largely partake in repelling attackers and leaving the residents unharmed. As the story goes, Murphy fired upon British forces that were coming to discuss the rebel surrender of the fort. Refusing to be taken prisoner, Murphy continued firing upon them, disregarding orders of a superior. This action led to the decision of the British command to back off of the fort and continue onward. Much of the folklore surrounding Murphy comes from his ability as rifleman, and his dedication as a patriot. Other significance throughout the region came in many details of the conflicts that had occurred. The Battle of the Flockey was remarkable in that it was a continued attempt of the British and Loyalist forces to attain their goal of control over Albany. The battle was eventually won by the Americans, as they were reinforced by the 2nd Continental Light Horse Division. The importance of this action was not only in that it dispersed loyalist and Native forces, but in that it was the first official cavalry charge of the United States Army. After this period, raids still occurred throughout the area; loyalists, Natives, and Brits often terrorized local settlements. The lack of a large Continental Army presence in the area created opportunity for these forces to use to their advantage. Burning fields, crops, and buildings, the people of these communities were left in danger and disarray. This put a drastic damper on the output of resources for Washington‚Äôs army and created a need for protection of those who remained in the area. This is where the idea for the three forts along the creek arose. Stockades and other reinforcements around these structures created a safe haven for those threatened by the raids. The forts of Schoharie County are a large part of the district's historical identity. Today much of the history of the American Revolution is still celebrated in Schoharie County. A number of historical sites and markers maintain a large portion of the area‚Äôs appeal for tourism. Just outside the village of Schoharie is the Old Stone Fort, which is a tourist attraction and part of a museum. During the Revolution, this was the stockade-reinforced Lower Fort, created to protect the local residents. Visitors can still see a cannonball hole in the outside of the structure from a loyalist and Indian raid, led by Joseph Brant and John Johnson. Along with the still-standing Old Stone Fort, the area around the fort is now a museum complex, with a number of structures representative of various eras in the county's history. Also outside of the village, restaurant and tavern \\"George Mann's Tory Tavern\\" may still be found. Although repaired and renovated, the tavern is still the same standing structure as was run by George Mann during the American revolution. Celebrated hero Timothy Murphy is remembered in the area by events in the region. Examples of such are that of the annual Timothy Murphy 10K run, and local theatre the Timothy Murphy Playhouse.

For this cantata, she quoted the Bible three times, taking a quotation from the Gospel as a starting point in movement 1 (verse 23), another one in movement 4 (verse 28), and a quotation from an epistle by Paul in movement 6 (). She concluded the text with the second stanza from Paul Gerhardt's hymn \\"\\". Much of her text was based on the \\"metaphysical\\" readings of the Gospel of John. Bach first performed the cantata on 20 May 1725.  Scoring and structure  This piece is scored for four solo voices (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), a four-part choir, three trumpets, timpani, two oboes, an oboe da caccia, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. The cantata has eight movements: #Chorus: #Aria (soprano): #Recitative (alto): #Aria (bass): #Aria (tenor): #Recitative (bass): #Aria (alto): #Chorale:  Music  The opening chorus of this cantata is shorter than average and is a substantial reworking of the opening chorus from , composed two years earlier and performed again the previous year. It employs a ritornello theme followed by a fanfare-like choral entry. The original movement was a two-part vocal entry; the expansion relies on imitative pairings, reflecting the earlier texture. Craig Smith suggests that this is one of Bach's most successful arrangements of his own work because it remakes the \\"patchy\\" and \\"hollow\\" duet into \\"something richly varied and exquisitely delicate\\". The movement is in C major and common time. The second movement is a soprano aria with oboe da caccia, a transposition of the bass and violin pairing of BWV 59. The new arrangement lends a \\"childlike openness\\" to the movement. It is in F major and common time. The third movement is a short alto recitative of only seven measures. It is characterized by the diminished chord which concludes the vocal line before the final cadence. The bass aria uses \\"sequences of 'treading' quavers in the continuo line\\" to suggest a stepping motion. The movement concludes with a long vocal melisma. The movement is in E minor. The piece then moves into a technically demanding tenor aria dominated by swirling string lines. The movement is in a combined ternary and ritornello form, adopting a heavy emphasis on the words komm and eilet (\\"come\\" and \\"hasten\\"), and concludes with a modulation to a minor key and darker harmonies. The bass recitative, like the earlier alto, is rather short and simple in comparison to the arias. It employs an unusual accompaniment of three oboes. The recitative modulates from E minor to C major. The seventh movement, an alto aria, has unusually dense texture and rich scoring. It opens with a fanfare-like ritornello followed by long melismatic passages with repeated notes in the instrumental parts. The short middle section moves to a less dense accompaniment and a minor key, with a \\"manic chortling\\" of triplets on the word lache (\\"laugh\\"). The closing chorale is a four-part setting of the melody of \\"\\". It is in a minor key, creating a sombre mood.

In many cases it functions like an advertorial, and manifests as a video, article or editorial. The word \\"native\\" refers to this coherence of the content with the other media that appear on the platform. These ads reduce a consumers' ad recognition by blending the ad into the native content of the platform, using somewhat ambiguous language such as \\"sponsored\\" or \\"branded\\" content. They can be difficult to properly identify due to their ambiguous nature. Product placement (embedded marketing) is a precursor to native advertising. The former places the product within the content, whereas in native marketing, which is legally permissible in the US to the extent that there is sufficient disclosure, the product and content are merged. Forms Despite the ambiguity surrounding native advertising's invention, many experts do consider the Hallmark Hall of Fame, a series which first aired in 1951 and still runs today, as among the earliest instances of the technique. According to Lin Grensing-Pophal, \\"The award-winning series is arguably one of the earliest examples of 'native' advertising‚Äîadvertising that is secondary to the message being delivered, but impactful through its association with valued content.\\" This 1901 advertisement for patent medicine begins by looking like an editorial on political developments in China. Contemporary formats for native advertising now include promoted videos, images, articles, commentary, music, and other various forms of media. A majority of these methods for delivering the native strategy have been relegated to an online presence, where it is most commonly employed as publisher-produced brand content, a similar concept to the traditional advertorial. Alternative examples of modern technique include search advertising, when ads appear alongside search results that qualify as native to the search experience. Popular examples include, Twitter's promoted Tweets, Facebook's promoted stories, and Tumblr's promoted posts. The most traditionally influenced form of native marketing manifests as the placement of sponsor-funded content alongside editorial content, or showing \\"other content you might be interested in\\" which is sponsored by a marketer alongside editorial recommendations. Most recently, controversy has arisen as to whether Content marketing is a form of native marketing, or if they are inherently separate ideologies and styles, with native market strategists claiming that they utilize content marketing techniques, and some content market strategists claiming not to be a form of native marketing.  Sponsored content (content marketing)  In most recent years of the millennium, the most notable form of native advertising has been sponsored content. The production of sponsored content (sometimes abbreviated as \\"sponcon\\"https://www.merriam- webster.com/words-at-play/what-is-sponcon-sponsored-content-influencer-slang- definition) involves inclusion of a third party along with a management company or a brand company's personal relations and promotional activities team in reaching out to aforementioned considerably popular third party content producers on social media, often independent, deemed \\"influencers\\" in an attempt to promote a product. Often quoted as the predecessor to traditional endorsed and/or contract advertising; which would instead be featuring celebrities, sponsored content has indubitably become more and more popular on social media platforms in recent years likely due to their cost- effectiveness, time efficiency, as well as the ability to receive instant feedback on the marketability of a product or service. A technique often used in traditional sponsored advertising is direct and indirect product placement (embedded marketing). Instead of embedded marketing's technique of placing the product within the content, in native marketing, the product and content are merged, and in sponsored content the product, content and active promotion occurs simultaneously across a number of platforms. Unlike traditional forms of Native Advertising, Sponsored content alludes to requirement of and desire for transparency and thrives on the concept of preexisting and/or built up trust between consumer and content producer rather than creating a masked net impression, which is a reasonable consumer‚Äôs understanding of an advertisement. The underlying motives of sponsored content, however, is similar to that of native advertising- which is to inhibit a consumers' ad recognition by blending the ad into the native content of the platform, making many consumers unaware they are looking at an ad to begin with. The sponsored content on social media, like any other type of native advertising, can be difficult to be properly identified by the Federal Trade Commission because of their rather ambiguous nature. Native advertising frequently bypasses this net impression standard, which makes them problematic.Lisk, J. (2018). 7 Great Examples Of Sponsored Content. [online] Media Planet.

According to the Federal Trade Commission, means of disclosure include visual cues, labels, and other techniques. The most common practices of these are recognizable by understated labels, such as ‚ÄúAdvertisement‚Äù, ‚ÄúAd‚Äù, ‚ÄúPromoted‚Äù, ‚ÄúSponsored‚Äù, ‚ÄúFeatured Partner‚Äù, or ‚ÄúSuggested Post‚Äù in subtitles, corners, or the bottoms of ads. A widespread tendency in such measures is to mention the brand name of the sponsor, as in ‚ÄúPromoted by [brand]‚Äù, ‚ÄúSponsored by [brand]‚Äù, or ‚ÄúPresented by [brand]‚Äù. These can vary drastically due to the publisher's choice of disclosure language (i.e. wording used to identify native advertising placement). In 2009, the Federal Trade Commission released their Endorsement Guideline specifically to increase consumer awareness of endorsements and testimonials in advertising given the rise in popularity of social media and blogging. The American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) released updated guidelines in 2015 reaffirming the need of publishers to distinguish editorial and advertising content. The ASME approach recommends both labels to disclose commercial sponsorship and in-content visual evidence to help the user distinguish native advertising from editorial. A study published by University of California researchers found that even labeled native advertising deceived about a quarter of survey research subjects. In the study, 27% of respondents thought that journalists or editors wrote an advertorial for diet pills, despite the presence of the \\"Sponsored Content\\" label. Because the Federal Trade Commission can bring cases concerning practices that mislead a substantial minority of consumers, the authors conclude that many native advertising campaigns are probably deceptive under federal law. The authors also explain two theories of why native advertising is deceptive. First, the schema theory suggests that advertorials mislead by causing consumers not to trigger their innate skepticism to advertising. Second, advertorials also cause source-based misleadingness problems by imbuing advertising material with the authority normally assigned to editorial content. Recognition percentages remain low even as native advertising has expanded in pervasiveness. An academic article published in 2017 has shown that only 17% of participants could identify native advertising and even if readers were primed, that number only increased to 27%. Moreover, when readers learned about covert advertising, their perceptions of the publications declined. Categories of online ads The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), the primary organization responsible for developing ad industry standards and conducting business research, published a report in 2013 detailing six different categories for differentiating types of native advertisements. # In- Feed Ad Units: As the name denotes, In-Feed ads are units located within the website's normal content feed, meaning they appear as if the content may have been written by or in partnership with the publisher's team to match the surrounding stories. A category that rose to popularity through sites like Upworthy and Buzzfeed's sponsored articles due to its effectiveness, In-Feed has also been the source of controversy for native marketing, as it is here the distinction between native and content marketing is typically asserted. # Search Ads: Appearing in the list of search results, these are generally found above or below the organic search results or in favorable position, having been sold to advertisers with a guarantee for optimal placement on the search engine page. They usually possess an identical appearance as other results on the page with the exception of disclosure aspects. # Recommendation Widgets: Although these ads are part of the content of the site, these do not tend to appear in like manner to the content of the editorial feed. Typically delivered through a widget, recommendation ads are generally recognizable by words which imply external reference, suggestions, and tangentially related topics. \\"You might also like\\"; \\"You might like\\"; ‚ÄúElsewhere from around the web\\"; \\"From around the web\\"; \\"You may have missed\\", or \\"Recommended for you\\" typically characterize these units. # Promoted Listings: Usually featured on websites that are not content based, such as e-commerce sites, promoted listings are presented in identical fashion with the products or services offered on the given site. Similarly justified as search ads, sponsored products are considered native to the experience in much the same way as search ads. # In-Ad (IAB Standard): An In-Ad fits in a standard IAB container found outside the feed, containing \\"...contextually relevant content within the ad, links to an offsite page, has been sold with a guaranteed placement, and is measured on brand metrics such as interaction and brand lift.\\" # Custom / Can't be Contained: This category is left for the odd ends and ads that do not conform to any of the other content categories. Digital platforms Native advertising platforms are classified into two categories, commonly referred to as \\"open\\" and \\"closed\\" platforms, but hybrid options are also utilized with some frequency. Closed platforms are formats created by brands for the purpose of promoting their own content intrinsically on their websites. Advertisements seen on these platforms will not be seen on others, as these ad types are generated for its sole use, and structured around exhibiting ad units within the confines of the website's specific agendas. Namely, advertisements distributed on closed platforms originate from the platform's brand itself. Popular examples include Promoted Tweets on Twitter, Sponsored Stories on Facebook, and TrueView Video Ads on YouTube. Open platforms are defined by the promotion of the same piece of branded content across multiple platforms ubiquitously, but through some variation of native ad formats. Unlike closed platforms, the content itself lives outside any given website that it appears on, and is usually distributed across multiple sites by a third party company, meaning that the advertisements appearing on open platforms namely are placed there by an advertiser. Hybrid platforms allow the content publishing platforms to install a private marketplace where advertisers have the option to bid on the inventory of ad space either through direct sales or programmatic auction through what is known as Real-Time Bidding (RTB). Therefore, advertisements distributed on hybrid platforms are placed there by the platform itself, the space having been sold to an open platform advertiser.

Bach composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig and first performed it on 8 April 1731. It is based on the hymn by Wolfgang Meuslin, a paraphrase of Psalm 23 written in 1530, sung to a melody by Nikolaus Decius. Bach, the Thomaskantor in Leipzig from May 1723, composed this cantata to complete his second cantata cycle of chorale cantatas, begun in 1724. He used the lyrics of the hymn unchanged, which reflect the psalm and Jesus as the Good Shepherd. Bach structured the work in five movements. The outer choral movements are a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, both on the hymn tune. Bach set the inner stanzas as aria ‚Äì recitative ‚Äì aria, with music unrelated to the hymn tune. He scored the cantata for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two oboes d'amore, strings and continuo. Bach scholars agree that the brass instruments, normally reserved for Feast days, could come from an earlier chorale fantasia of the same melody with the text of the German Gloria.  History and words  In his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, Bach composed chorale cantatas between the first Sunday after Trinity of 1724 and Palm Sunday of 1725, but for Easter he returned to cantatas on more varied texts. He had not composed a chorale cantata yet for the occasion , the second Sunday after Easter. The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from the First Epistle of Peter (Christ as a model ‚Äì ), and from the Gospel of John, (the Good Shepherd ‚Äì ). During the cycle of 1724/25, the text of the inner stanzas of a hymn was paraphrased by a contemporary poet with whom Bach collaborated. In this cantata however, Bach used the hymn text unchanged, a 1530 hymn in five stanzas written by Wolfgang Meuslin as a paraphrase of Psalm 23. The hymn is sung to the melody of \\"\\", the German Gloria, by Nikolaus Decius (1522). Meusin's hymn is different from the one with the same opening line by Cornelius Becker, but sung to the same melody, which Bach had used in his other two cantatas for the same occasion, and . The hymn's topic, the Lord as the Good Shepherd, has traditionally been used for Jesus and is thus related to the gospel. Bach first performed the cantata at the on 8 April 1731.  Music   Structure and scoring  Bach structured the cantata in five movements. The text and tune of the hymn are kept in the outer choral movements, a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, which frame an alternating arias and a recitative. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns (Co), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.  Movements  In the opening chorus, a chorale fantasia, the melody of the German \\"\\" is embedded in an orchestral concerto. The movement opens with calls derived from the chorale tune played on the two horns, leading to a free concerto with the strings and oboes. The cantus firmus is sung by the soprano in long notes, while the lower voices engage in imitation. John Eliot Gardiner compares the movement to the openings of the two former cantatas for the same occasion: \\"The presence of two horns ... reveals a much more regal portrait of the Good Shepherd than we have previously met.\\" Both Alfred D√ºrr and Klaus Hofmann assume that the music was not originally composed for this pastoral text, but previously, for the . Bach had composed a different chorale fantasia on the same melody in Auf Christi Himmelfahrt allein, BWV 128, with similar instrumentation. The inner three movements quote the text of the hymn without change, but their music is not related to the hymn tune. The alto aria is accompanied by an obbligato oboe. It is structured in two similar parts, and is in pastoral . The steady flow of the oboe can be seen as depicting the \\"pure water\\" mentioned in the text, the steps in the continuo as \\"the steps made on this significant journey\\" \\"on the pathway of the righteousness of His commandments\\". The central movement begins as an arioso, accompanied by the continuo, illustrating the walk through the \\"valley of darkness\\". The second part is a dramatic recitative with strings, first expressing \\"\\" (persecution, sorrow, trouble) in a broken melodic line against sustained string chords, then \\"Thy rod and Thy staff comfort me\\", where the \\"first violins weave a comforting little melody\\". The following duet expresses enjoyment at God's table in a dance, a bourr√©e. The cantata closes with a four-part chorale, most instruments playing colla parte, while the horns play different parts because of their limited range.

History and text  Bach composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig between 1728 and 1731 for no specific occasion, based on the hymn by Johann Jakob Sch√ºtz. Musicologist Julian Mincham suggests two possibilities: it may have been intended as a \\"general-purpose\\" cantata, able to be used for almost any occasion with only minimal changes; or it may have been written for a ceremony of some kind, likely a wedding.  Scoring and structure  The work is scored for three vocal soloists (alto, tenor, and bass), a four-part choir, two flutes, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. Despite being only twenty minutes long, the cantata includes nine movements. #Chorale: '''' #Recitative (bass): '''' #Aria (tenor): '''' #Chorale: '''' #Recitative (alto): '''' #Aria (bass): '''' #Aria (alto): '''' #Recitative (tenor): '''' #Chorale: ''''  Music  Simon Crouch remarks that this cantata is \\"pervaded with the spirit of the dance\\", particularly given its frequent use of triple meter and the dominance of the major mode. The opening chorus is a chorale fantasia wherein the soprano sings the chorale melody while the lower voices create chordal harmonies. The long instrumental ritornello, created by strings (doubled by oboes and flutes) and continuo, appears at the beginning of the movement and four bars before the voices finish at the end. The second movement is a bass recitative remarkable for its final line: Bach repeats the line four times in an arioso, accompanied by \\"a version of Schweitzer's three-note 'joy' motive\\" in the continuo. The text moves from a typical thanksgiving to encourage the listener to give honour to God. The tenor aria adopts the minor mode, despite the continued optimism of the text. Harmonically the movement consists of four contrapuntal lines created by the vocalist, continuo, and two oboes d'amore. Although there is no notated da capo, the music allows a recapitulation of the opening theme. The central chorale adopts the least optimistic text from the original hymn, contrasting with the mostly upbeat other movements. Unusually for a Bach cantata, it is a simple setting of the chorale melody placed in the middle of the cantata rather than at the end. The primary melody is based on a repeated note and modal motive. The alto recitative is quite similar to the bass recitative of the second movement, varying only in the fullness of the opening accompaniment. As with the earlier recitative, it concludes on an arioso repeating the last line of text, again with the \\"joy\\" motive in the continuo. The bass aria mirrors the earlier tenor aria in adopting the minor mode. The movement is remarkable for its \\"reaching\\" obbligato violin and for the multiple instances of word painting throughout the vocal line. The seventh movement is an alto aria in which the singer assumes a personal view of devotion. The accompaniment comprises flowing triplets in the flute, \\"the palpitations of an excited heartbeat\\", over repeated chords in the strings. The tenor recitative adopts the voice of a pastor preaching to his followers. The movement is \\"short but operatically declamatory\\" and modulates from the minor mode to G major to set up the final movement. Unusual for Bach who often closes cantatas with a simple four-part setting of a chorale, the closing chorus reprises the music of the first movement, with a text entreating the listener to sing and dance.

It is known to have been performed at a funeral, and was possibly a generic work intended for funerals.(accessed via Highbeam Research, subscription required) When the work was first published in the nineteenth century it was called a cantata, perhaps because it has an instrumental accompaniment. While it is not an a cappella work, modern scholarship accepts it is a motet.  History and text  This work was written around 1736 or 1737, and so may have been premiered before the first known performance at the grave-side ceremony for Count on October 11, 1740. The Count was Governor of Leipzig and known to Bach who had presented a couple of congratulatory works to him. The fact that the accompaniment exists in two versions suggests that there was a subsequent revival of the work in the 1740s. The text is a 1610 hymn by Martin Behm.  Music  \\"O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht\\" has been characterized as something between a cantata and a motet.\\"Something between a cantata movement and a motetic choral transcription\\". This work is a motet version of the chorale Ach Gott, wie manches Herzeleid. The lower voices of the choir sing counterpoint to the chorale melody line in the soprano. The accompaniment includes an ascending string motive.  Scoring and structure  The piece is scored for four-part choir. It is structured as a chorus, O Jesu Christ, mein's Lebens Licht, comprising chorale strophes separated by repeated instrumental interludes. The number of strophes sung would likely correspond to the length of the procession for which the work was used. There are two versions of the instrumental scoring: * The first version is unique among the Bach cantatas in not including strings, and also differs from the instrumentation of the motets, where that is specified. It is for two litui (an instrument which one source contends was a \\"horn\\" and \\"trumpet-like\\"), cornett, three trombones, and organ; * The second version is for two litui, strings, organ continuo, and optionally three oboes and bassoon. The first version is possibly intended for outdoor use where brass would be more effective than strings. (The inclusion of an organ part suggests a performance at least partly indoors, but a portable organ may have been used). The second version is more suitable for indoor acoustics. The available recordings of the piece (see section below) appear to have been performed indoors. A notable outdoor performance was that of John Eliot Gardiner and the Monteverdi Choir, who performed it outside Iona Abbey to mark the 250th anniversary of Bach‚Äôs death. However, this performance was not included in the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage set of recordings.His 1989 recording was made in St John's, Smith Square, London.  Publication  The work was published in 1876 in the first complete edition of Bach's works, the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe. The volume in question consisted of cantatas rather than motets and was edited by Alfred D√∂rffel. It was subsequently included among the motets in the New Bach Edition in a volume edited by Konrad Ameln.  Recordings  *Greifswalde Bach Tage Choir / Bach-Orchester Berlin. J.S.

Bach composed the chorale cantata in six movements in Leipzig for the Sunday after Christmas and first performed it on 31 December 1724. History and text Bach composed the cantata in his second year as in Leipzig for the Sunday after Christmas. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Galatians, \\"through Christ we are free from the law\\" (), and from the Gospel of Luke, Simeon and Anna talking to Mary (). The chorale cantata is based on a hymn by Cyriakus Schneega√ü (1597) with the same title as the cantata. The librettist is unknown. Bach first performed the cantata on 31 December 1724. Scoring and structure This work is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), a four-part choir, three recorders, two oboes, taille, two violins, viola, and basso continuo with organ. The cantata has six movements: #Chorale: #Aria (bass): #Recitative (soprano): #Aria (soprano, alto, tenor): #Recitative (bass): #Chorale: Music The opening chorus is a chorale fantasia with a long opening and closing ritornello bookending a chorale theme with four entries and lengthy interspersed episodes. The three lower voices imitate the soprano thrice in the chorale phrases and then move into a fast ascending figure. The second movement is a lengthy and chromatic bass aria discussing (sinning). This is the longest movement of the cantata. The continuo accompanying the vocal line is \\"tortuous and chromatically convoluted\\". The soprano recitative is accompanied by a simple recorder trio, a combination designed to represent the \\"aura of the angels\\". As this is the only movement to include the recorders, the parts were likely performed by the oboe and taille players. The fourth movement is a trio of the soprano, alto and tenor voices; the alto sings the chorale line with the strings while the soprano and tenor perform a duet aria. The movement is in D minor and time. The bass recitative begins in major before modulating to the G minor of the final movement. It is accompanied by high chordal strings and a continuo line. The closing chorale is fast and short. It is in block form. The \\"rather muted\\" music of the first chorus and the bass aria (the opening line of which translates as \\"O mortals, ye who sin daily\\") have been described by one writer as giving listeners a \\"moral hangover\\" after the possible overindulgence of the Christmas holidays.

Due to an erroneous attribution to Johann Sebastian Bach, it appears in the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV) as No. 141, but was moved to Anhang III, the Appendix of spurious works, in the 1990s second edition of that catalogue. The cantata's libretto by Johann Friedrich Helbig was published in 1720. Around 1723 Johann Balthasar K√∂nig copied the manuscript, attributing its authorship to Telemann. Its spurious attribution to Bach can be found in some of the manuscript copies produced in the second half of the 18th century.  History and text  The cantata was composed for the third Sunday of Advent in 1719 or 1720. The libretto is based on a reading of 1 Timothy 1:15 (opening chorus), and a text by Johann Friedrich Helbig (movements 2‚Äì4).  Scoring and structure  This piece is scored for three vocal soloists (alto, tenor, and bass), a four-part choir, two oboes, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. The cantata has four movements: #Chorus #Tenor aria #Alto recitative #Bass aria  Reception  Accepting the attribution to Bach, the Bach Gesellschaft published the cantata as his work in the second half of the 19th century (BGA Vol. 30, pp. 1‚Äì16). The attribution to Bach was however doubted in the Bach- Jahrbuch of 1912. In 1920 Charles Sanford Terry opined the cantata to be \\"one of the least agreeable of Bach's works\\", and quoted some earlier not much more favourable comments by Bach-biographers Spitta, Schweitzer and Parry.Johann Nikolaus Forkel, translated with notes and appendices by Charles Sanford Terry.

He appears to have composed the cantata for New Year's Day, probably when he was in his 20s, but whether it was first performed in M√ºhlhausen or Weimar is not known: the date of composition is unclear. Bach's authorship has been doubted because the cantata has several ununusual features; one of these is the scoring, it is the only Bach cantata to combine three corni da caccia with timpani. An unknown librettist drew mainly from Psalm 146 and from Jakob Ebert's hymn \\"\\" to develop seven movements, supplying only two of the movements himself. The text assembly is similar to Bach's early cantatas. The cantata is in seven movements which combine the three major text sources: psalm, hymn and contemporary poetry. The opening chorus is based on a psalm verse, followed by the first hymn stanza and another psalm verse as a recitative. An aria on poetry is followed by a third psalm verse as an aria. It is followed by another aria on poetry, which simultaneously quotes the hymn tune instrumentally. The last movement combines elements of a chorale fantasia on the third stanza of the hymn, with vivid counterpoint of \\"Hallelujah\\" which closes the psalm.  History and text  Portrait of the young Bach (disputed) Bach wrote the cantata for New Year's Day, which is also the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ. The prescribed readings for the day were from the Epistle to the Galatians, \\"by faith we inherit\\" (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the circumcision and naming of Jesus eight days after his birth. However, most of the text for the cantata was taken by the unknown librettist from , and from Jakob Ebert's hymn \\"\\", written in 1601. The text is compiled from psalm verses (verse 1 for movement 1, verse 5 for movement 3, and verse 10 for movement 5), and two stanzas from the hymn, the first as movement 2, the third as the final movement. Only movements 4 and 6 are free poetry, with the hymn tune sounding again instrumentally during movement 6. Due to its text structure, the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff dates the work to around 1710. The oldest (and also the only) manuscript was written in 1762, after Bach's death. The provenance of the cantata is disputed: some suggest that it may not be a Bach work because of its \\"unpretentious\\" nature and the lack of authoritative original music, or perhaps it was a transposition of an earlier work.Pommer, Max. Liner notes to Kantaten mit Corno da caccia, Thomanerchor Leipzig / Neues Bachisches Collegium Musicum, Eterna, 1984 Alternatively, part of the cantata may have been written by Bach, while other parts (likely the choruses and the bass aria) were added or amended by other composers. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, remarks on the stylistic similarity of the text structure to Bach's early cantatas written in M√ºhlhausen. He also sees similar musical expression to the cantata for the inauguration of a new town council there, Gott ist mein K√∂nig, BWV 71, written in 1708. While some musicologists assume that it may have been composed for the same occasion one year later (documentary evidence suggests that there was such a \\"lost\\" work), Gardiner proposes that it could either be a still earlier work, or that it \\"was, at least in part, an apprentice piece written in Weimar under Bach's direct tutelage. Bach's 19th-century biographer Philipp Spitta proposed that the cantata was first performed on New Year's Day of 1735. However, according to more recent research, the piece performed that day was Part IV of the Christmas Oratorio.  Scoring and structure  The cantata is scored festively for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T), and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of three corni da caccia (Co), timpani (Ti, listed with the winds), bassoon (Fg), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. It is the only Bach cantata to combine three corni da caccia with timpani. The cantata is structured in seven movements. It begins with a chorus on a verse from the psalm, followed by the first stanza from the hymn, sung by the soprano. Another psalm verse is rendered as a tenor recitative, followed by a tenor aria on free poetry. A third psalm verse is set as a bass aria, answered by another tenor aria on free poetry with an instrumental quotation of the hymn tune. The cantata is closed by a hybrid movement which combines like a chorale fantasia the third stanza of the hymn as cantus firmus with a vivid counterpoint of \\"Hallelujah\\" closing the psalm. In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.  Music  The opening chorus on the first verse of the psalm, \\"\\" (Praise the Lord, my soul.), is quite short, using imitative fanfare figures without much harmonic development. It employs a ritornello theme on the tonic and dominant chords, incorporating a descending-third sequence. The voices sing mostly in homophony. The soprano chorale, \\"\\" (O Prince of peace, Lord Jesus Christ), is accompanied by a violin obbligato. Although the vocal line is mostly undecorated, it is accompanied by a rhythmically active violin counterpoint following the circle of fifths. The obbligato line reaches a double cadence before the soprano entrance. The tenor recitative on another verse from the psalm, \\"\\" (It is fortunate for him, whose help the God of Jacob is), is quite short and is considered unremarkable. The fourth movement is a tenor aria in free verse, \\"\\" (Thousand-fold misfortune, terror). The vocal line is \\"convoluted and angular\\", reflecting the themes of misfortune, fear and death. The musicologist Julian Mincham suggests that these themes suggest that Salomon Franck may be the poet, as these were recurrent images in his texts, but also notes a lack of integration atypical of Franck's oeuvre. The bass aria on the tenth verse from the psalm, \\"\\" (The Lord is King eternally), employs a triadic motif similar to that of Gott ist mein K√∂nig, BWV 71. It is short and has a limited range of tonal development or chromatic variation. The voice is accompanied by the horns and timpani, without strings, illustrating God's power. The sixth movement is another tenor aria on free poetry, \\"\\" (Jesus, saver of Your flock), characterized by the layered scale figuration in the instrumental accompaniment. The voice, bassoon and continuo perform as a trio, while the chorale tune is heard in the violins and organ with the Vox humana stop. The closing chorus employs the third stanza of the chorale, \\"\\" (Think, Lord, at this time on Your office), as a cantus firmus in the soprano. It is not composed as the typical four-part setting, but the lower voices sing lively contrasting Alleluias, derived from the psalm.  Recordings  *Frankfurter Kantorei / Bach-Collegium Stuttgart.

It was incorporated into Flintshire following Edward I of England's conquest of northern Wales in the 13th century. Etymology The region's name was derived from the Deceangli, an Iron Age Celtic tribe which had inhabited the region and attested since the 1st century BC. Location The cantref formed the eastern part of Perfeddwlad (or Y Berfeddwlad) on the northern coast of Wales between the River Clwyd and Deeside. The territory is roughly equivalent to the modern county of Flintshire today. History Comprising the three commotes of Rhuddlan, Prestatyn and Coleshill (Cwnsyllt), the territory originally formed part of the Kingdom of Gwynedd until, in the late 8th century, it was conquered by the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Mercia. It remained under Mercian (or English) control for over three centuries until Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd recovered it in the 12th century. Edwin of Tegeingl (d.1073) was in the 11th century described as \\"lord\\" or \\"prince\\" of Tegeingl. He was succeeded as lord of Tegeingl by his son Owain who supported the Anglo-Normans' invasion of North Wales in the 1090s. The family remained powerful in North Wales until Owain's sons were killed in 1125 by a son of Gruffudd ap Cynan, Prince of Gwynedd.Wilcott, Darrell \\"The Ancestry of Edwin of Tegeingl\\" It then changed hands several times between England and Gwynedd, but was eventually seized by Edward I as part of his conquest of the Principality of Wales between 1277 and 1283.

He composed it in Leipzig for the third day of Christmas and first performed it on 27 December 1725.  History and text  Bach composed this solo cantata in late 1725 in Leipzig, in his third year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, as part of his third cantata cycle. He wrote it for the church service for the feast day of John the Evangelist, celebrated on the Third Day of Christmas. The Thomanerchor was used only for the final movement, as with other Bach works for a third consecutive feast day. The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Epistle to the Hebrews () and the prologue of the Gospel of John, also called Hymn to the Word (). Bach chose a text by Georg Christian Lehms, who was inspired by the epistle. The final movement is a setting of the final stanza of \\"Lobt Gott, ihr Christen alle gleich\\", a Christmas carol with words and melody by Nikolaus Herman published in 1560. Bach first performed the cantata on 27 December 1725. It was performed again between 1728 and 1731. The autograph score and parts are now held by the Kunstsammlungen der Veste Coburg in Germany.  Scoring and structure  The work is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), a four-part choir, flute, oboe d'amore, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. The cantata has five movements: #Aria (soprano): #Recitative (bass): #Aria (alto): #Recitative (tenor): #Chorale:  Music  Because of its intimate scoring and lack of large-scale opening chorus, the work is a \\"treasureable miniature\\" and \\"the most personal of Bach's Christmas cantatas\\". The opening aria begins with a lullaby-like molto adagio in 12/8 time. This movement \\"dominates and casts a glow over the entire work\\", with its \\"mood of iridescent transparency\\". It is in G major and is accompanied by obbligato flute and strings doubled by oboe d'amore. The flute line is highly embellished, almost an arabesque, and expands on the melodic arches of the soprano. The da capo aria includes a sharply contrasting middle section, \\"an ecstatic alla breve dance of joy, part gavotte, part gigue\\", built on a motif of \\"agile chains of triplets\\" forming a \\"mellifluous melody\\". The opening section then recurs to conclude the movement. John Eliot Gardiner suggests that this movement includes \\"music pre-echoes of both Gluck and Brahms\\" and \\"something authentically Levantine or even Basque in origin\\". Craig Smith notes that this is \\"the closest Bach gets to South German rococo architecture. One can almost see the putti and gold sunbursts of the many churches from this era in Bavaria and Austria\\". The second movement is a secco bass recitative. It provides a dual transition, both harmonically ‚Äì moving from a major key to minor to prepare the third movement ‚Äì and thematically ‚Äì \\"progressing (or retrogressing) from the state of celebration to a recognition of the humility of Christ's state\\". The da capo alto aria is accompanied by unison oboe d'amore and strings. It expands on the minor mode and theme of privation established in the second movement. The movement emphasizes the interval of the seventh and the technique of inversion to support the meaning of the text. It begins with a chromatic string line led by solo violin, which when the vocal line begins \\"becomes inextricably, even obsessively, intertwined\\" with the singer. The tenor recitative reverses the motion of the bass, modulating from minor to major and changing the emphasis of the text from humility to celebration. It is secco, short, and simple in its melody. The final movement is a four-part setting of the eighth and final stanza of Herman's chorale.  Recordings  * Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra & Choir, Ton Koopman. J. S. Bach: Complete Cantatas Vol. 18.

He composed it in Leipzig for the third Sunday after Epiphany and first performed it on 23 January 1729. The cantata is well known for its opening sinfonia for orchestra and oboe solo.  History and text  BWV 156 was Bach's fourth and last cantata for the Third Sunday after Epiphany. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the Epistle to the Romans, rules for life (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the healing of a leper (). The librettist was Picander. He incorporated two chorale tunes: \\"Machs mit mir, Gott, nach deiner G√ºt\\" by Johann Hermann Schein (1628) and \\"Herr, wie du willt, so schicks mit mir\\" by Kaspar Bienemann (1582). The sinfonia was likely derived from an earlier oboe concerto and was later adapted as part of Bach's Harpsichord Concerto in F minor.  Scoring and structure  The work is scored for three vocal soloists (alto, tenor, and bass), four-part choir, oboe, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. It has six movements: #Sinfonia #Chorale (soprano) and aria (tenor): '''' #Recitative (bass): '''' #Aria (alto): '''' #Recitative (bass): '''' #Chorale: ''''  Music  The opening sinfonia is scored for oboe, strings, and continuo. It is in F major and common time. Compared to the later version for harpsichord, the melody is straightforward and unembellished, and is harmonically conceived to prepare the second movement. The second movement is a combined tenor aria and soprano chorale with obbligato strings. Unusually, it begins with a syncopated continuo line under unison strings. The movement also features sequences and harmonic contrasts. Both bass recitatives are secco and in minor mode. The first, the third movement of the cantata, is characterized by a disjunct melodic line and a concluding arioso line. The second, the fifth movement, is comparatively \\"lighter in mood and spirit\\". It anticipates the melody of the final chorale setting. The alto aria is accompanied by oboe and violin in parallel thirds and sixths. The movement includes several instances of word painting. Formally, the movement is an altered da capo aria. It has a \\"generally sunny affect ... only momentarily disturbed by more charged harmonies\\". The final movement is a four-part setting of the chorale in C major. The phrase lengths are varied to provide a \\"hint of timelessness\\".  Recordings  *American Bach Soloists, Jeffrey Thomas. J. S. Bach: Cantatas Volume II.

She was the last male line member of the Flemish-origined Hanseatic Berenberg banking family in Hamburg, and ancestral mother of the von Berenberg-Gossler family, the current owners of Berenberg Bank. She is also noted as the only woman ever to serve as a partner and take an active leadership role (1790‚Äì1800) at Berenberg Bank since the company was established in 1590 by her family. Biography She belonged to the Berenberg family, a Flemish-origined family from Antwerp in today's Belgium, who came as religious refugees to Hamburg in 1585, where they founded Berenberg Bank and became, together with the closely related Amsinck family, one of the two most prominent families of the city-state's ruling class of Hanseaten.Richard J. Evans, Death in Hamburg, 1987 She was the daughter of owner of Berenberg Bank Johann Berenberg (1718‚Äì1772) and Anna Maria Lastrop (1723‚Äì1761), and was named for her grandmother Anna Elisabeth Amsinck (1690‚Äì1748). Her grandfather Rudolf Berenberg was elected a Senator in 1735 and her great-grandfather Cornelius Berenberg had become an hereditary grand burgher in 1684 and developed the Berenberg merchant house into a highly successful merchant bank. She was also descended from numerous other prominent merchant and banking families, such as the Welser family. Her only brother Rudolf Berenberg (1748‚Äì1768) was possibly mentally ill and died at 20 in Suriname, where his father had sent him to manage the family's business interests,Deutsches Geschlechterbuch, Vol. 200, C.A. Starke, 1996, p. xxxii and her uncle, Senator Paul Berenberg (1716‚Äì1768), died without heirs in the same year. Elisabeth Berenberg thus remained as the only heiress of Berenberg Bank. In 1768, she married Johann Hinrich Gossler, who had joined Berenberg Bank as an apprentice, and her father made Gossler a partner in 1769. After Johann Berenberg's death, Gossler became the sole owner and head of the company. The historian (and descendant) Percy Ernst Schramm describes their marriage as a marriage of convenience; she was not considered beautiful, but was intelligent, cultivated, kind, spoke many languages (including Latin) and became an exemplary wife and mother. She survived her husband by 32 years and after his death in 1790 managed the firm together with her son-in-law until 31 December 1800, from which point the company was run by her son-in-law and her son alone. She however retained a large account with the Berenberg company of several hundred thousand Mark Banco until her death.Percy Ernst Schramm, Neun Generationen: Dreihundert Jahre deutscher \\"Kulturgeschichte\\" im Lichte der Schicksale einer Hamburger B√ºrgerfamilie (1648‚Äì1948).

Berenberg, Gossler & Co. in 1791. She was the mother of Anna Henriette Gossler, who married Ludwig Erdwin Seyler, and of Senator Johann Heinrich Gossler. Her son- in-law, Seyler, became a partner in 1788 and head of Berenberg Bank in 1790. Her son Johann Heinrich Gossler joined the bank as a partner in 1798. Her grandson Hermann Gossler (1802‚Äì1877) became First Mayor and President of the Senate (head of state), whereas her great-grandson, Baron Johann von Berenberg-Gossler, was granted the name Berenberg-Gossler by the Senate of Hamburg in 1880, and subsequently ennobled by Prussia in 1888 and raised to baronial rank in 1910. From 1793 until her death in 1822, she used the Frustberg manor house as summer residence. Percy Ernst Schramm describes her as \\"a Maria Theresia in miniature\\" and \\"a practical woman, who until the end governed her family with undiminished vitality.\\" Her daughter Anna Henriette Gossler, married Seyler, once wrote that \\"we all love and revere her indescribably; she also deserves it entirely, because she only lives for her children. She is very alive and bright for her age.\\" She was well educated and made sure that both her daughters and sons also received a very good education.Schramm 1959 p. 110 Ancestry Gallery File:Johann Berenberg cropped BW.jpgHer father, Johann Berenberg (1718‚Äì1772) File:Johann Friedrich T√∂nnies.jpegHer great-grandfather, Hamburg merchant Johann Friedrich T√∂nnies (1662‚Äì1736) File:Rudolf Amsinck.jpegHer great-great-great-grandfather, Hamburg Senator Rudolf Amsinck (1577‚Äì1636) File:Isabeau (Isabella) de Hertoghe 1583.jpegHer great-great-great-grandmother, Isabeau (Isabella) de Hertoghe (1583‚Äì1636), a member of one of the seven noble houses of Brussels Literature *Joh.

Elton is also known for his work in Canada as a radio and television presenter. Early life Henry John Elton was born in Toronto, Ontario in 1930. When his father died in 1935, Elton's mother moved the family to Detroit, Michigan in the United States. Elton attended Wayne State University, and in 1951 he travelled to London where he studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art for one year. Despite being offered a scholarship at RADA, he returned to Detroit where he obtained his first job in television at WXYZ-TV. Career in Britain The fledgling ITV television franchises in the United Kingdom recruited a number of Canadians in the late 1950s, and Elton was hired as a drama producer for Granada in Manchester in 1957. At Granada, Elton produced series such as Shadow Squad, Biggles, The Verdict Is Yours and In Court Today. By 1960, he was executive producer for drama series and serials. While at Granada, Elton worked with a young writer named Tony Warren, who had become frustrated writing crime and adventure shows. Elton pointed outdoors through the window of his office and asked Warren to write about \\"a street out there\\", giving Warren 24 hours to generate an idea that would \\"take Britain by storm\\". Having already written about working class life in a Salford backstreet, Warren quickly turned in a script which prompted Elton to commission a second one, and ultimately a pilot episode. The reaction of Granada executives to the pilot was universally hostile, with one telling Elton: \\"Harry, you've made a horrible mistake.\\" Elton claimed that he knew that the drama, then called \\"Florizel Street\\", would be a success when a cleaning lady at Granada named Agnes was transfixed by the pilot airing on a closed-circuit television set in Elton's office. The show was renamed Coronation Street when Agnes contended that \\"Florizel\\" sounded like the name of a disinfectant. Elton finally persuaded sceptical network managers to proceed with the blue-collar drama, and they grudgingly gave the go-ahead for 13 episodes. Elton left Granada in 1963 to return to Canada. By this point, Coronation Street was one of the highest rated programmes on British television.Little, Daran (1998). The Women of Coronation Street, Boxtree. , p. 10 Warren credited Elton with the fate of the show, saying that Coronation Street would never have seen the light of day without Elton's \\"dogged determination\\". When BBC Four aired a movie in 2010 dramatizing the creation of the show, The Road to Coronation Street, the role of Harry Elton was played by Christian McKay. Career in Canada Upon returning to Canada in 1963, Elton discovered that Coronation Street was unknown to Canadians at that time. The show eventually debuted on Toronto's CBLT in July 1966 and later became a large success in Canada, and continues to run on CBC Television to this day. With his work in Britain still unappreciated in Canada in 1963, Elton first took work as a janitor in Toronto. He soon found employment in television as a story editor at CBC Television, later becoming a news anchor for the nightly newscasts on CJOH-TV in Ottawa. In 1972, Elton returned to the CBC as a host for CBC Radio, notably hosting Cross Country Checkup. He managed the CBC television station in Calgary from 1976 to 1979, and then he returned to radio and Ottawa to host CBO Morning on CBO-FM. From 1984 until his retirement in 1989, Elton hosted the Mostly Music classical music program on CBC Stereo. Around the time of his retirement, he remarried to his second wife, CBC Radio colleague Marguerite McDonald. In retirement, Elton became fascinated with China and its people, and he taught English to college students in China from 1994 to 1996. While serving on the board of the Ottawa chapter of the Canada-China Friendship Society, Elton died of a sudden heart attack in 2004 while in Lhasa for a celebration of the Society's Chinese counterpart.

He composed this dialogue cantata in Weimar for the Sunday after Christmas and first performed it on 30 December 1714.  History and words  On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar. As concertmaster, he assumed the principal responsibility for composing new works, specifically cantatas for the Schlosskirche (palace church), on a monthly schedule. He composed the cantata for the Sunday after Christmas. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Galatians, through Christ we are free from the law (), and from the Gospel of Luke, Simeon and Anna talking to Mary (). The gospel is the passage following the canticle of Simeon. The cantata text was written by Salomon Franck, the Weimar court poet, who published it in ' in 1715. The gospel refers to Isaiah () and Psalm 118 (), mentioning \\"a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence\\" and the \\"stone which the builders refused\\". The poet refers to it, stating that God laid the stone of foundation, and man should not take offence. Jesus is then addressed as a stone beyond all gems. The cantata text is a dialogue of Jesus and the Soul and concludes with a duet, asking to reject the \\"world\\" and follow Jesus. This cantata is the earliest extant example of a dialogue, used again in Bach's third annual cycle of cantatas written in Leipzig. Bach first performed the cantata on 30 December 1714.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for two soloists‚Äîsoprano and bass‚Äîand four solo instruments: recorder, oboe, viola d'amore, viola da gamba and basso continuo. Bach himself wrote in the extant score \\"Concerto √† 1 Flaut. 1 Hautb. 1 Viola d'Amour. 1 Viola da Gamba. Sopr. √® Ba√üo coll' Organo.\\" The cantata is Bach's only one using the viola d'amore. # Sinfonia # Aria (bass): # Recitative (bass): # Aria (soprano): # Recitative (bass): # Duet (soprano, bass):  Music  Viola d'amore The cantata is intimate chamber music for only two voices, soprano and bass, and four solo instruments. Christoph Wolff notes the \\"colourful and delicate effects achievable with these forces\\". The opening sinfonia in two sections is reminiscent of a French overture, which Bach had used with a meaning in Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland, BWV 61, a few weeks earlier. The theme of the fugue is similar to that of Bach's fugue for organ, BWV 536. The fugue is one of few instrumental fugues in Bach's cantatas. The first aria is given to the bass, who invites the Soul (and the listener) to \\"step upon the path of faith\\". It is accompanied by an obbligato oboe and seems to illustrate the path () in scales. The recitative is divided in two sections, following the contrast of \\"\\" (evil world) and \\"\\" (blessed Christian) in recitative and arioso. The words \\"\\" (for destruction) (literally: for fall) is pictured in a downward leap of a tenth. The second aria, sung by the soprano, is like a prayer. The middle section is only four measures long, and the da capo repeat is shortened. The voice is accompanied by recorder and viola d'amore. The final duet, a love duet of Jesus and the Soul, is structured in sections, separated by parts of the ritornello which is repeated completely in the end. Each section contains first dialogue, then a canon illustrating unity. Klaus Hofmann notes: \\"With its dance rhythm, reminiscent of a gigue, the music delightfully illustrates the image of the heart turning to holy unity\\".  Recordings  * Les Grandes Cantates de J. S.

He composed it in Leipzig in 1726/27. The first known performance was on 6 February 1727 in Pom√üen. The work is not to be confused with the motet Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159, which is probably by Bach and which takes its title from the same biblical quotation.  History and text  The work appears to have been commissioned as a funeral cantata for Johann Christoph von Ponickau (1652-1726), a Saxon chamberlain. Picander, Bach's librettist, clearly linked the cantata to Ponickau, publishing an extended funeral ode on his death, followed by the text of the cantata. The first known performance was at a memorial service for Ponickau on February 6, 1727 in the church of his home village, Pom√üen (20 km from Leipzig). The event is quite well documented in that there a printed commemoration sermon giving some information about the music performed, which included a second Bach cantata, now lost (Cantata BWV Anh. 209). We do not know if Bach was present, although some writers assume so. The cantata appears to have been adapted for performance as part of Leipzig's church music, specifically for the Feast of the Purification of Mary which was celebrated on 2 February. The existence of more than one version is implied in the earliest surviving manuscripts, from after Bach's death, copied by Christian Friedrich Penzel. The primary surviving score dates from 1755 and there are parts from the 1760s. The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the book of Malachi, \\"the Lord will come to his temple\\" (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the purification of Mary and the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, including Simeon's canticle Nunc dimittis (). The idea from Simeon's canticle to depart in peace has often been used as an image for the death of a Christian. Picander included a quotation from Genesis () in the first movement and the last stanza of the hymn \\"\\" by Christian Keymann in the fifth movement.  Scoring and structure  The work is scored for tenor and bass vocal soloists, four-part choir, flute, oboe, oboe d'amore, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. The work has five movements: # Duet aria (tenor and bass): # Aria (tenor): # Recitative (tenor): # Aria, recitative and arioso (bass): # Chorale:  Music  The opening movement sets only a single line: the biblical quotation from Genesis which became the title of the cantata. The movement has an eight-measure ritornello that opens, ends, and bisects the movement; it features a prominent imitative motif. The second movement is a tenor aria accompanied by continuo and obbligato oboe d'amore, which perform a long ritornello serving much the same structural function as in the first movement. Craig Smith suggests that this is \\"perhaps the single most difficult tenor aria in the whole repertoire\\", with \\"wild and extremely ornate melismas\\". The tenor recitative is scored for strings and continuo. It recalls some of the motivic material from the first movement. The fourth movement combines elements of aria, recitative, and arioso. It opens with a ritornello of violin, flute and continuo. Structurally, the movement completes most of a da capo aria before a recitative episode interrupts the reprise of the A section. The music moves between aria and recitative twice more before a final aria section ends the movement. The cantata ends with a four-part setting of the chorale with a conjunct melody and active continuo line.  Recordings  * Choir and Orchestra \\"Pro Arte\\" Munich, Kurt Redel. J. S.

He composed the work in Weimar for the twenty-third Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 24 November 1715. This work was part of Bach's sequence of monthly church cantatas for the Weimar court, which he began in 1714. It was the first piece performed after a mourning period of several months for Prince Johann Ernst. The text, written by the court poet Salomon Franck, is based on the prescribed gospel reading for the Sunday, \\"Render unto Caesar...\\", and includes several allusions to money and gold. The cantata has six movements, beginning with an aria for tenor, followed by two pairs of recitatives and arias, one for bass and the other for the duet of soprano and alto, and a concluding chorale. Similar to other cantatas on words by Franck, the work is scored for a small Baroque chamber ensemble of two violins, viola, two cellos and continuo. Bach composed a unique aria with a dark texture of a bass voice and two obbligato cellos. A duet has been described as a love duet and compared to operatic duets. The music of the closing chorale is lost, except for the continuo part. It is not clear if Bach set the stanza printed in the libretto from Heermann's \\"\\", or instead his \\"\\" by Christian Keymann, in a tune that appears as a cantus firmus in movement 5.  History and text  On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court orchestra (Kapelle) of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe- Weimar. As concertmaster, he assumed the principal responsibility for composing new works, specifically cantatas for the Schlosskirche (palace church), on a monthly schedule. Bach composed the cantata in 1715 for the 23rd Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Philippians, \\"our conversation is in heaven\\" (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the question about paying taxes, answered by \\"Render unto Caesar...\\" (). The librettist was Salomon Franck, the court poet in Weimar. He began with a paraphrase of the famous answer \\"Render unto Caesar\\" from the gospel, and included several allusions to money and gold (he was also the numismatist of the Weimar court). Franck included a stanza from a hymn by Johann Heermann as the sixth and last movement of this cantata, according to the printed libretto the final stanza of \\"Wo soll ich fliehen hin\\" (1630). The music of that chorale is lost; only the continuo part has survived. Recent scholarship found that Bach possibly chose to set a stanza from Heermann's \\"Meinen Jesum lass ich nicht\\" instead, in a tune he used instrumentally in movement 5, which would match the continuo part. Bach led the first performance on 24 November 1715. It was the first cantata performed after a period of mourning for Prince Johann Ernst from August to November. No account is extant of a later performance in Leipzig, but the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff writes: \\"it seems safe to assume that it was [revived]\\".  Scoring and structure  The cantata in structured in six movements, beginning with an aria for tenor (T), followed by two pairs of recitative and aria, one for bass (B), the other for the duet of soprano (S) and alto (A), and a concluding chorale when all four parts are united. As with several other cantatas on words by Franck, it is scored for a small Baroque chamber ensemble of two violins (Vl), viola (Va), two cellos (Vc) and basso continuo (Bc). In the following table of the movements, the scoring, keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.  Music  The opening da capo aria for tenor is based on a paraphrase of \\"Render to Caesar\\": \\"Nur jedem das Seine\\". The aria features an unusual ritornello in which the strings assume a motif introduced by the continuo, which is then repeated several times through all parts. The movement is a da capo aria emphasizing dualism and debt. Craig Smith remarks that it is \\"almost academic in its metrical insistence\\". The second movement is a secco bass recitative, \\"\\" (You are, my God, the Giver of all gifts). It has been described as \\"operatic in its intensity and subtle adjustments of character\\". The recitative is remarkable for its \\"aggressive, even belligerent\\" conclusion. The following bass aria, \\"\\" (Let my heart be the coin), has an unusual and unique accompaniment of two obbligato cellos with continuo. The cellos present an imitative motif to introduce the bass. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, comments that Bach \\"conjures up an irresistible picture of two coin-polishers at work, a sort of eighteenth-century sorcerer goading his apprentice\\", observing that \\"two cellos polish away in contrary motion with wide intervalic leaps\\". Bach was interested in coins and precious metals. The conductor Craig Smith compares the dark texture to the \\"descent into the earth in Wagner's Das Rheingold\\". The aria is in three thematic sections: \\"enjoining\\", \\"melodramatically rhetoric\\", and \\"imprecatory\\". The fourth movement is a soprano and alto duet recitative, \\"\\" (I would gladly, o God, give you my heart) It is rhythmically metrical and presents five sections based on mood and text. The recitative is \\"high and light but very complicated in its myriad of detail\\". The duet aria, \\"\\" (Take me from myself and give me to You!), again for soprano and alto, is in triple time. The tune of Johann Heermann's hymn \\"Meinen Jesum lass ich nicht\\" (I will not let go of my Jesus) is interwoven in the texture as a cantus firmus of the upper strings in unison. The movement is a \\"love duet\\" characterized by \\"antiphonal avowals of commitment\\" to God rather than a carnal desire. The musicologist Julian Mincham compares its presentation to Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea. The movement begins with sparse scoring and becomes more richly textured as it progresses, adding the chorale tune. The final movement, possibly \\"F√ºhr auch mein Herz und Sinn\\" (Also lead my heart and mind), is a four-part chorale setting, marked \\"Chorale in semplice stylo\\"; however, only the continuo line is extant. While the libretto shows that a stanza from Heermann's \\"Wo soll ich fliehen hin\\" was to be used, sung to a melody by Christian Friedrich Witt, the Bach scholar Andreas Gl√∂ckner found that the continuo part matches the tune in the previous movement, which appeared in a hymnal published by Witt.

He composed it in Leipzig for Trinity Sunday on a text by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler and first performed it on 27 May 1725, concluding his second year of cantata compositions in Leipzig.  History and words  Bach composed the cantata during his second year in Leipzig for Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Romans, reflecting \\"depth of wisdom\\" (), and from the Gospel of John, the meeting of Jesus and Nicodemus (). In his second year in Leipzig, Bach composed chorale cantatas between the first Sunday after Trinity Sunday and Palm Sunday, but for Easter returned to cantatas on more varied texts, possibly because he lost his librettist. Nine of his cantatas for the period between Easter and Pentecost are based on texts of Christiana Mariana von Ziegler, including this cantata. He later inserted most of them, including this one, in his third annual cantata cycle. Ziegler took the idea from the Gospel that Nicodemus came to speak with Jesus at night, possibly afraid to be seen with him, and deducted thoughts about the timidity of Christians in general. She opened her text with a paraphrase from Jeremiah, describing the heart of man as \\"\\", the conflicting attributes rendered for example as \\"daring and shy\\" or \\"contrary and despairing\\" (). Literally \\"trotzig\\" means \\"defiant\\", \\"verzagt\\" means \\"despondent\\". The poet continued with a paraphase of Nicodemus' words that nobody could act as Jesus if God was not with him. She used the eighth stanza of Paul Gerhardt's hymn \\"\\" (1653) as a closing chorale, sung to the same melody as \\"\\". Bach first performed the cantata on 27 May 1725. It was the conclusion of Bach's second year of cantata compositions in Leipzig.  Scoring and structure  The cantata is scored for three vocal soloists (soprano, alto, and bass), a four-part choir, two oboes, oboe da caccia, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. The work has six movements, as follows: # Chorus: # Recitative (alto): # Aria (soprano): # Recitative (bass): # Aria (alto): # Chorale:  Music  The opening chorus in C minor concentrates, without instrumental introduction, on a choral fugue. A complex theme illustrates both contrasting aspects that Jeremiah mentioned of the human heart, rendering \\"\\" (defiant) twice, once in a repeated high note reached by a triad fanfare, then in an upward run with a surprising modulation, whereas \\"\\" (timid) appears as a sighing motif in chromatism. The strings accompany \\"\\" marked forte, \\"\\" piano, while the oboes double the voices. Klaus Hofmann notes: \\"Bach has taken greater pleasure in depicting defiance than in representing timidity (and has thus departed to some extent from his librettist's intention). John Eliot Gardiner translates the text as \\"There is something stubborn (or defiant or wilful) and fainthearted (or disheartened or despairing) about the human heart\\", describes the movement as a \\"dramatic antithesis between headstrong aggression and lily-livered frailty\\", and wonders \\"whether this arresting comment on the human condition reflected Bach's own views\\". The soprano aria \\"\\" (Your dear bright light) is in contrast a \\"light-footed\\" gavotte, sometimes without continuo. Jesus and Nicodemus, by Crijn Hendricksz, 1616‚Äì1645 In the following recitative, Nicodemus speaks for the Christian. Bach added a quotation from the Gospel to Ziegler's printed text, \\"for whosoever believes in Thee, shall not perish\\" and stressed it by setting it as an arioso. In the alto aria, an unusual obbligato of three oboes in unison, including one oboe da caccia, alludes to the Trinity that is celebrated. The closing chorale is a four-part setting of the archaic modal melody of \\"\\". At the very end Bach adds two measures at a higher pitch on the words \\"\\" (one Being, three persons), reflecting the Trinity and a \\"remoteness of God from his relationship to humankind\\". Gardiner concludes that Bach \\"signs off his second Leipzig cycle with this cantata crammed with provocative thoughts and musical exegesis.

The piece has six movements: # Sinfonia # Aria (tenor): '''' # Recitative (bass): '''' # Aria (alto): '''' # Recitative (soprano): '''' # Chorale: ''''  Music  The opening sinfonia for solo organ and orchestra derives from the third movement of Bach's keyboard concerto in D minor, BWV 1052. The tenor aria has been compared to movements from both the French Suites and the Fifth English Suite. It opens with a string ritornello doubled by oboe; the two parts move into counterpoint after the tenor enters. Formally, the movement has an extended two-part A section before moving to a B section remarkable for its emphasis on instrumental arpeggiation. The bass recitative is secco and concludes with a pastoral arioso. The alto aria is \\"dark and dramatic\\", in E minor with cello and organ obbligato. The organ line is complex, contributing to a movement that is \\"a complex and ever-changing kaleidoscope of richly entwined rhythms and melodies\\". The soprano recitative is short and accompanied by chordal strings. The final movement is a four-part setting of the chorale tune, doubled by oboe, taille, and strings.

It is an incomplete cantata, because its tenor part is missing. It is a chorale cantata, setting the unmodified three stanzas of Martin Rinckart's \\"Nun danket alle Gott\\" (\\"Now Thank We All Our God\\"). It has been regarded as an expansion of Bach's chorale cantata cycle.  History and text  Bach composed Nun danket alle Gott as a chorale cantata for Trinity, setting the unmodified text of the three stanzas of Martin Rinckart's hymn of thanksgiving \\"Nun danket alle Gott\\". It was first performed on 4 June 1730. Alfred D√ºrr assumed that it could have been written for a wedding. It has also been regarded as a cantata for Reformation Day. The cantata is not always seen as included in Bach's chorale cantata cycle. The original score is held by the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin. The tenor part was lost and has been reconstructed by several scholars; e.g., G√ºnter Raphael and Alfred D√ºrr.  Scoring and structure  The cantata is scored for soprano and bass soloists, a four-part choir, two flutes, two oboes, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. The work has three movements: # Chorus: Nun danket alle Gott # Duet aria (soprano and bass): Der ewig reiche Gott # Chorus: Lob, Ehr und Preis sei Gott  Music  The cantata begins with a chorale fantasia. Unusually, the ritornello is not immediately followed by the chorale melody, but by a three-part or even four-part imitative preparation. The first phrase of the chorale melody appears in the soprano over further imitation in the lower voices and by staccato chords in the accompaniment. The other lines of the chorale are handled similarly. The duet aria is introduced by a ritornello \\"with a double hiatus suggestive of modesty or diffidence\\". The movement is structurally like a da capo aria but lacks a contrasting middle section. Unusually, the work ends not with a closing chorale, but with another chorale fantasia with a \\"rollicking gigue melody\\". Again, the soprano carries the chorale melody. As in the first movement, the lower voices sing imitative lines.  Recordings  * Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra & Choir, Ton Koopman. J. S. Bach: Complete Cantatas Vol. 20.

Summary of its contents  The law prohibits samurai and their retainers the buke hokonin, which were in turn divided into the chugen and the komono, from becoming peasants or merchants, and also bans peasants from abandoning their fields to engage in commerce or wage labor and warriors from employing buke hokonin who fled from their original masters. It lays down punishments for those who violate these provisions.Stephen Turnbull, Toyotomi Hideyoshi (Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2010), 59-60. Its purpose was to ensure stable revenue from the land tax and a pool of warriors in view of the imminent invasion of Korea.  Translation of the Edict  1\\\\. Townspeople and farmers should investigate if any samurai, chugen, or komono have become merchants or farmers since the expedition against Date Masamune in Oshu in the seventh month of last year. If any such people are found, they must be expelled. If any such people are hidden, the entire village will be punished. 2\\\\. If any peasant abandons his fields and engages in commerce or wage labor, not only the farmer himself but his fellow villagers will be punished. Those not involved in either military service or working the fields will be investigated and expelled. If an official does not execute these instructions, he will have his lands seized for negligence. If there is any concealment by townspeople or farmers, the whole county or town will be held accountable. 3\\\\. Do not employ anyone who has left his former master without permission whether he is a samurai or a komono. Thoroughly investigate an individual's background to ensure he has not done so. If he has done so, he shall be arrested and handed back to his former master. If this law is ignored or if a violator of the law is deliberately released then it is ordered that two or three people will be decapitated in the violator's place and their heads will be delivered to his former master. If this order is not carried out the person who sought to employ the violator will be punished.  Theory of Shosaku Takagi  Though the Separation Edict was widely considered to be the law that first established the rigid class system of the subsequent Tokugawa shogunate based on the four occupations, Japanese historian Shosaku Takagi has called this into question. He believes that during this period of history the word \\"samurai\\" did not refer to warriors, but rather to the wakato, who were retainers of warriors just like the chugen and the komono. Takagi thus believes that the draconian social class structures imposed by the Separation Edict were actually intended specifically for the buke hokonin, including the wakato, chugen, and komono, and not for most of the individuals engaged in military service. According to this theory, the feudal class structure in Japan was in fact not legally mandated in 1591, but much later in the Edo period.Takashi Tsukada, \\"Yado and Kuchiire,\\" Urbanscope, Volume 1 2010, 5. However, Takagi acknowledges that the portions of the Edict relating to the peasantry did contribute to class separation.Shosaku Takagi, Êó•Êú¨Ëøë‰∏ñÂõΩÂÆ∂Âè≤„ÅÆÁ°èÁ©∂ (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1990), 279.

R. R. Tolkien that is concerned with the legend of King Arthur. A posthumous first edition of the poem was published by HarperCollins in May 2013. The poem is alliterative, extending to nearly 1,000 verses imitating the Old English Beowulf metre in Modern English, and inspired by high medieval Arthurian fiction. The historical setting of the poem is early medieval, both in form (using Germanic verse) and in content, showing Arthur as a Migration period British military leader fighting the Saxon invasion. At the same time, it avoids the high medieval aspects of the Arthurian cycle, such as the Grail and the courtly setting. The poem begins with a British \\"counter-invasion\\" to the Saxon lands (Arthur eastward in arms purposed).The Guardian published the poem's first nine verses on 9 October 2012; Alison Flood, 'New' JRR Tolkien epic due out next year guardian.co.uk, Tuesday 9 October 2012. Composition history Tolkien wrote the poem during the earlier part of the 1930s when he was Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College, Oxford. He abandoned it at some point after 1934, most likely in 1937 when he was occupied with preparing The Hobbit for publication. HarperCollins cover text: \\"he evidently began it in the earlier nineteen-thirties, and it was sufficiently advanced for him to send it to a very perceptive friend who read it with great enthusiasm at the end of 1934 and urgently pressed him 'You simply must finish it!‚Äô But in vain: he abandoned it, at some date unknown, though there is some evidence that it may have been in 1937\\". Its composition thus dates to shortly after The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun (1930), a poem of 508 lines modelled on the Breton lay genre. The poem had been abandoned for nearly 20 years in 1955, and the publication was complete of The Lord of the Rings when Tolkien expressed his wish to return to his \\"long poem\\" and complete it.In a letter to Houghton Mifflin; the text of this letter was published as no. 165 in The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien (1981). But it remained unfinished, nonetheless. Publication history The existence of the poem was known publicly since the Tolkien biography by Humphrey Carpenter, published in 1977.Humphrey Carpenter, J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biography (1977 ed.), part IV chapter 6. Carpenter noted that the poem :\\"has alliteration but no rhyme. [...] In his own Arthurian poem [Tolkien] did not touch on the Grail but began an individual rendering of the Morte d'Arthur, in which the king and Gawain go to war in 'Saxon lands' but are summoned home by news of Mordred's treachery. The poem was never finished, but it was read and approved by E. V. Gordon, and by R. W. Chambers, Professor of English at London University, who considered it to be 'great stuff ‚Äì really heroic, quite apart from its value as showing how the Beowulf metre can be used in modern English'.\\" Carpenter also cited a passage from the text of the poem, to make the point that it is one of the very few instances in Tolkien's expansive work where sexual passion is given explicit literary treatment, in this case Mordred's \\"unsated passion\\" for Guinever: His bed was barren there black phantoms of desire unsated and savage fury in his brain had brooded till bleak morning After Tolkien's death, his Arthurian poem would come to be one of the longest-awaited unedited works of his. According to John D. Rateliff, Rayner Unwin had announced plans to edit the poem as early as 1985, but the edition was postponed in favour of \\"more pressing projects\\" (such as The History of Middle-earth edited 1983-1996), answering the demand for background on Tolkien's legendarium more than his literary production in other areas.Thursday, July 12, 2012 The Rumor \\"I remember Rayner Unwin, when I got to meet with him in 1985, telling me about this as one of the forthcoming projects already in the works, but which wdn't be coming out until some more pressing projects (like the HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH series, whose third volume I'd just picked up that same day).\\" See also *The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr√∫n References *Verlyn Flieger, \\"Arthurian Romance\\" in: J.R.R.

He composed it in Leipzig for dedication of the church and organ at St√∂rmthal on 2 November 1723. The cantata text was written by an anonymous poet, including two stanzas of Johann Heermann's hymn \\"\\" (1630) and two stanzas of Paul Gerhardt's \\"\\" (1647). Bach used an earlier secular cantata as a base for a structure in two parts of six movements each, beginning with an extended choral movement and concluding both parts with chorale stanzas. The inner movements are alternating recitatives and arias. The chorales are the only movements which were certainly newly composed for the occasion. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of three oboes, bassoon, strings and continuo. After the first performance in St√∂rmthal, Bach performed the cantata again in Leipzig for Trinity Sunday, first on 4 June 1724, a shortened version in 1726, and the complete version in 1731.  History and text  The first known performance of the cantata was at St√∂rmthal, a village near Leipzig. The church there had been rebuilt, and a new organ been built on a commission by Statz Friedrich von Fullen. The organ was an early work by Zacharias Hildebrandt. Von Fullen requested an approval of the instrument from Johann Sebastian Bach, who was then Thomaskantor in Leipzig. Bach was satisfied and composed this cantata for the dedication service for the church and the organ on 2 November 1723. The text deals with the inauguration of the church. The organ has no solo function in the cantata. The cantata text was written by an anonymous poet, who took Solomon's prayer for the dedication of the temple as a starting point to reflect the church as the house of God. Frequent Biblical references throughout the text suggest that the author was a theologian. He included as movement 6, ending Part I, stanzas 6 and 7 of Johann Heermann's hymn \\"\\" (1630), and as the closing chorale, stanzas 9 and 10 of Paul Gerhardt's \\"\\" (1647). Scholars such as John Eliot Gardiner assume that Bach based the cantata on a lost work (), probably composed at K√∂then for an unknown occasion. The music of movements 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10 is lost, and only instrumental parts of the other movements are extant. Bach added the chorales for the 1723 dedication service. H√∂chsterw√ºnschtes Freudenfest shows musical similarities also to Preise, Jerusalem, den Herrn, BWV 119, written for the inauguration of the Leipzig town council a few weeks earlier. Bach led the first performance at the dedication service in St√∂rmthal. The printed text mentions Bach as \\"Hochf√ºrstl. Anhalt-C√∂thenischen Capell-Meister, auch Directore Chori musici Lipsiensis\\" (Kapellmeister to the Prince of Anhalt- K√∂then and Director of the Choir at Leipzig), referring to his appointments in the service of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then. The organ of St√∂rmthal is notable as one of few such instruments still mostly unaltered since Bach's time. A restorer in 1934 remarked that it was tuned about a whole tone lower than 440, which may account for the unusually high vocal ranges. Bach demanded \\"top Cs\\" from the sopranos, which is unique in his sacred cantatas. The organ part prepared for the Leipzig revival is notated a minor third lower than the other instruments. Bach revived the cantata for performances in Leipzig for Trinity Sunday. The prescribed readings for Trinity were , and , the meeting of Jesus and Nicodemus. The general topic and even an \\"invocation of the Trinity\\" in movement 6 made for an easy transition. On 4 June 1724, Bach concluded his first cantata cycle with this work. On 16 June 1726, he presented a shortened version, with movements appearing in the order 12, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10. The 12-movement version was again performed on 20 May 1731.  Structure and scoring  Bach structured the cantata in two parts of six movements each. It is scored for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir (SATB), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of three oboes (Ob), bassoon (Fg), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from the Bach scholar Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.  Music  The music has an often dance-like character. All recitatives, the majority of the solo movements, are secco, accompanied only by the continuo. Most of them are followed by an aria performed by the same voice type. Part I begins with a chorus in the style of a French overture with a solemn opening and a fast fugal central section. The bass sings a recitative and an aria, accompanied by solo oboe and strings. The soprano sings a modulating recitative and an aria in the style of a gavotte. A four-part harmonization of the chorale ends the first part. Part II begins with the tenor singing a recitative and a da capo aria in a minor mode, characterized by its extensive use of dotted rhythms. A dialogue recitative for bass and soprano leads to a duet aria with oboes and continuo. After a declamatory bass recitative, the work ends with another four-part chorale setting.  Recordings  The entries are taken from the listing on the Bach Cantatas Website. Ensembles with period instruments in historically informed performance are marked by green background.

It uses two verses from Psalm 97 for the opening movement, and the first stanza auf Paul Gerhardt's hymn \\"\\" for the closing chorale. The librettist of the other movements is unknown.  History and text  Bach composed this cantata in Leipzig around 1727 for a wedding. The earliest version of the work is lost; an incomplete second version from 1742 and a complete revision from the late 1740s survive. These dates correspond with repeat performances of the work. The closing chorale is the first stanza of Paul Gerhardt's hymn \\"Nun danket all und bringet Ehr\\", with the melody of \\"Lobt Gott, ihr Christen alle gleich\\". The opening movement is based on ; the rest of the text is anonymous. Alfred D√ºrr derives from allusions in the text that the work was intended for the wedding of a lawyer.  Scoring and structure  The cantata is scored for soprano and bass vocal soloists, a four-part choir, three trumpets, timpani, two horns, two flutes, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, two violins, viola, violone, basso continuo. The work is divided into two parts, to be performed before and after the sermon. The original version had three movements in the second part, out of eight total. In the surviving version, the second part includes only the final of six movements. # Chorus: Dem Gerechten muss das Licht immer wieder aufgehen # Recitative (bass): Dem Freudenlicht gerechter Frommen # Aria (bass): R√ºhmet Gottes G√ºt und Treu # Recitative (soprano): Wohlan, so kn√ºpfet denn ein Band # Chorus: Wir kommen, deine Heiligkeit # Chorale: Nun danket all und bringet Ehr  Music  The cantata opens with a choral movement which combines two fugues, each on a psalm verse, with concertante parts. The vocal scoring indicates a ripieno group at times. The movement has an \\"energetic and ebullient\\" instrumental introduction. The first section highlights the contrast between ripieno and full chorus, while the second section is dance- like. The bass recitative is secco and \\"severe\\". It is accompanied by a triplet line that moves in semiquavers to end the movement. The bass aria is in modified ternary form and includes an instrumental ritornello with a characteristic Scotch snap. The middle section moves into a minor key to increase the intimacy of the personal expression. The movement concludes with a short coda. The soprano recitative \\"is a musical portrayal of the central part of the marriage ceremony\\" ‚Äì the blessing of the union. It is accompanied by chordal oboes and scalar flutes. The penultimate movement is a chorus, similar to that with which the cantata opened. It combines da capo and ritornello form. The first section is dominated by scalar motifs, while the middle section is chordal and \\"quasi-philosophical\\". The cantata ends with a four-part harmonization of the chorale tune, \\"Lobt Gott, ihr Christen alle gleich\\".

Movement 5 is a chorale stanza by Martin Luther, the final movement is by Georg Neumark; the rest of the poetry is anonymous.  Scoring and structure  The cantata is scored for three vocal soloists (soprano, alto, and bass), a four-part choir, three trumpets, timpani, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, bassoon, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. The work's ten movements are divided into two parts of five movements each, to be performed before and after the wedding sermon. ;Part 1 #Chorus: #Recitative (bass): #Aria (alto): #Recitative (bass): #Chorale: ;Part 2 # * Aria (bass): #Recitative (soprano): #Aria (soprano): #Recitative (bass): #Chorale:  Music  The opening movement is a chorus in da capo form with a prominent trumpet part and an active violin line. The vocal parts use fugal techniques. The bass recitative is secco and \\"set to a melody of almost childlike naivety and simplicity\\". The alto aria's structure combines elements of da capo and ritornello form; the instrumental introduction does not completely recur and the reprise differs significantly from the opening section. The fourth movement is a bass recitative with chordal strings. The section closes with a four-part setting of the chorale tune with varied phrase lengths. The second section opens with a bass aria that \\"has a lavishness of sound which is almost unparalleled\\". A two-part secco soprano recitative leads to an aria that was for bass in BWV 197.1 but in BWV 197.2 is scored for soprano. The aria is in the style of a siciliano. The penultimate movement is a bass recitative with chordal oboes and interjecting strings. The final chorale setting is relatively simple and in minor mode.

Bach later revised the piece into Gott ist unsre Zuversicht, BWV 197.2.Work at Bach Digital website.  Scoring and structure  The cantata is scored for solo alto and bass voices, a four-part choir, two flutes, oboe d'amore, two violins, viola, bassoon, cello, and continuo. The piece has seven movements (although there may also have been an opening sinfonia): #Chorus: #Aria: #Recitative: #Aria: #Recitative: #Aria: #Chorale:  Music  Only the last four movements of the piece are extant. The nineteen surviving bars of the fourth movement, an alto aria, demonstrate a rare bassoon obbligati and assume a combined ritornello- ternary form. The fifth movement is a bass recitative with only continuo accompaniment. It is a \\"harmonically adventurous\\", \\"forceful little movement marked by a robust melodic line\\". The following bass aria is accompanied by oboe d'amore and continuo, and is a \\"jaunty, pastoral dance\\" in 6/8 time and ritornello-ternary form.

The community was added to the St. Johns metropolitan region in the 1960s as part of the Canadian urban renewal project and fully integrated into St. Johns in 1984.

It was likely composed for a wedding, but scholars disagree on the dating which could be as early as Bach's tenure in Weimar, around 1714, while it has traditionally been connected to his wedding to Anna Magdalena on 3 December 1721 in K√∂then. It is one of Bach's frequently recorded cantatas. The aria \\"Sich √ºben im Lieben\\" (\\"To practice sweet courtship, to joyously cuddle\\" or \\"To cultivate love\\") is often performed as a concert piece.  History and text  The cantata music survives only in a copy from the 1730s, which features a surprising style used by Bach only until around 1714. The librettist is not known with certainty, but Harald Streck suspects Salomon Franck, the Weimar court poet.Streck, Harald. . Dissertation: Hamburg University 1971. Joshua Rifkin also argues for a Weimar date, rather than the more commonly assigned K√∂then period, based on stylistic elements such as the short recitatives ending arioso, the slow‚Äìfast- slow tempo of the first aria, which Bach used only rarely after 1714, and the specific relation of voice and obbligato oboe in the seventh movement, which rarely occurs after 1715. More traditionally, the composition was linked to Bach's time in K√∂then from 1718, and the occasion a wedding, possibly his own to Anna Magdalena in December 1721. The text relates beginning love to the arrival of spring after winter, mentioning shooting flowers in the first two movements, the sun climbing higher in the third movement, Cupid searching for \\"prey\\" in the following two movements, finally a bridal couple and good wishes for them. The tone is humorous and jesting, which suggests a civil wedding. The aria \\"Sich √ºben im Lieben\\" (\\"To practice sweet courtship, to joyously cuddle\\" or \\"To cultivate love\\") is frequently performed as a concert piece.  Scoring and structure  Bach structured the work in 9 movements, alternating arias with varied texture and recitative. He scored it for a solo soprano voice (S), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe (Ob), violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc). In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown. Music The first aria, \\"Weichet nur, betr√ºbte Schatten\\" (Dissipate, you troublesome shadows), is accompanied by all instruments. The strings play a repetitious motif illustrating the vanishing of winter, while the oboe leads with an expanded melody to the entry of the voice, then playing in duet with it. The opening section is marked Adagio, while the middle section, about Flora's pleasures, of a da capo form is marked Andante. It was described as painting \\"a sensuous picture of spring's lazy pleasures as the singer invites the depressing shades of winter to depart\\", a change \\"from shadow to sunlight, from winter's cold to spring's bursting flowers\\". A recitative, \\"Die Welt wird wieder neu\\" (The world becomes new again), leads to the second aria, \\"Phoebus eilt mit schnellen Pferden\\" (Phoebus hastes with rapid horses) which is accompanied only by the continuo. The trotting of the horse mentioned in the text is illustrated in the continuo. The movement was described as a \\"vividly melismatic depiction of warm breezes hurrying through the reborn world\\". The aria shows similarity to the last movement of Bach's Violin Sonata in G major, BWV 1019. A recitative, \\"Drum sucht auch Amor sein Vergn√ºgen\\" (Therefore Love himself seeks his pleasure), leads to the third aria, \\"Wenn die Fr√ºhlingsl√ºfte streichen\\" (When the springtime breezes caress), with a solo violin, in elegiac mood. The recitative \\"Und dieses ist das Gl√ºcke\\" (And this is good fortune) prepares the aria \\"Sich √ºben im Lieben, in Scherzen sich herzen\\" (To cultivate love, to cuddle in playful tenderness) with an obbligato oboe. The melody of the dance- like music in a triple metre alludes to folk music. A recitative, \\"So sei das Band der keuschen Liebe\\" (So may the bond of chaste love) leads to the final aria, marked as a Gavotte, again with all instruments, \\"Sehet in Zufriedenheit tausend helle Wohlfahrtstage\\" (May you see in contentment a thousand bright happy days). The cantata develops from highly artificial composition to popular dance writing.

Bach wrote the unusual work on an Italian libretto for a bass soloist and harpsichord.  Background  After an extended period at the court of Weimar, Bach was Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then between 1717 and 1723, directing a qualified musical ensemble. As the court was Reformed, he had no obligations to compose church music, but focused on instrumental works. He had no choir at his disposition, but several excellent singers who sometimes stayed for a short period. He later wrote about this period:  History and text  Bach composed this cantata in K√∂then in 1718 or 1719 for an unknown occasion. Its librettist and first performance are also unknown. Unusually for Bach, the text is Italian; only one other cantata (BWV 209) has Italian text. The text is very similar to the text of a cantata by Nicola Fago. The composition of Amore traditore may have been prompted by the visit of Johann Gottfried Riemschneider, a famous bass, at the court in K√∂then in 1718-19. Bach wrote a work to entertain, and to showcase two musicians, the singer and a virtuoso harpsichordist.  Scoring and structure  The cantata is based on the Italian solo cantata tradition. It is structured in three movements, alternating arias and a connecting recitative, and scored for a solo bass and keyboard (and possibly cello or viola da gamba). # Aria: '''' # Recitative: '''' # Aria: ''''  Music  The first aria includes a flowing bass line and strong ritornello theme. The movement is in da capo form and features long melismas and a very high vocal range. The secco recitative is short but not harmonically cohesive. The final movement is also a da capo aria, with three lines of counterpoint and a complex keyboard part.  Recordings  *Jacques Villisech, Gustav Leonhardt. J. S. Bach: Cantatas BWV 203 & BWV 209.

History and text  Bach wrote several works for celebrations of the Leipzig University, Festmusiken zu Leipziger Universit√§tsfeiern. He composed this congratulatory cantata to celebrate the appointment of Gottlieb Kortte as professor of Roman Law. The librettist of the work is unknown: it may have been Picander, who had been providing libretti for Bach from at least the previous year when they collaborated on another academic cantata, . Bach incorporated music from his first Brandenburg Concerto, which was composed years earlier, for the opening chorus. The concerto's third movement is used, with trumpets replacing the concerto's horns, and some of the instrumental music is given to the choir. Bach led the first performance on 11 December 1726. The cantata became the basis for a similar work Auf, schmetternde T√∂ne der muntern Trompeten, BWV 207.2.  Structure and scoring  Bach structured the cantata in ten movements, beginning with an instrumental march. He wrote it for four solo singers who represent allegorical figures: (Fortune, soprano), (Thankfulness, alto), (Diligence, tenor), and (Honour, bass). The cantata also features a four-part choir for the movements framing a sequence of recitatives and arias. Bach orchestrated it festively with three trumpets, timpani, two transverse flutes, two oboes d'amore, taille, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # March # Chorus: # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (tenor): # Duet recitative (bass and soprano): # Duet aria (bass and soprano) and ritornello: # Recitative (alto): # Aria (alto): # Recitative (SATB): # Chorus:  Recordings  * Berliner Solisten, Kammerorchester Berlin, Peter Schreier, Berlin Classics, 1985 * Collegium Vocale Gent, Philippe Herreweghe.

History  The BCDRC was established more than 20 years ago in response to citizens' requests to be informed about the activities of the Canadian military involving chemical and biological armaments, particularly but not exclusively those at CFB Suffield.CFB = Canadian Forces Base CFB Suffield, an army base located in southeastern Alberta near the hamlet of Ralston, is primarily a training and research facility. With its expansive and isolated testing grounds, it had been the site of numerous field tests by the British and American forces of chemical warheads during the World War II and Cold War eras. Since 1971, it has hosted the British Army Training Unit Suffield for large-scale armoured warfare exercises. Starting out as the Experimental Station Suffield in 1941 (as a replacement for the French/British experimental station at Beni Ounif in Algeria that had fallen to Axis powers in 1940), it was taken under the wing of the Defence Research Board in 1947, then renamed in 1967 to Defence Research Establishment ‚Äì Suffield (DRES). Meanwhile, CFB Suffield was formally established as a co-located army base in 1971, largely to take over support operations for DRES activities. Finally, as the Defence Research Board evolved to become the Research and Development Branch in 1974 and Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) in 2000, the establishment at Suffield became known as DRDC Suffield, one of a handful of defence research establishments in the country under the authority of the Assistant Deputy Minister ‚Äì Science and Technology of the Department of National Defence. Virtually all live-agent chemical and biological defence training and research activities are conducted at CFB Suffield. Responding to protests and concerns raised by citizen groups, notably Voice of Women and Science for Peace, and suspicion over the development of offensive weaponry, the then-Minister of National Defence Perrin Beatty commissioned William H. Barton, a distinguished diplomat and civil servant, to study the activities of the Department of National Defence (DND) in the area of biological and chemical warfare. The so-called Barton Report of 1988 made numerous recommendations, one of which was the establishment of an advisory committee of senior scientists to annually visit DND facilities and review its biological and chemical programs. The succeeding Minister, Bill McKnight, established the BCDRC in May 1990. Mandate Canada is a State Party to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (commonly called the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention) and to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (commonly called the Chemical Weapons Convention). However, the threat from such weapons persists and the Government has an obligation to ensure that members of the Canadian Forces are able to protect themselves against them, whether while deployed abroad or while supporting domestic responses to terrorist incidents or other emergencies involving these agents or related materials. Nevertheless, the Canadian public and the international community have the right to be assured that Canada maintains a strictly defensive capability in regard to such materials and that any research, development or training activities undertaken in this vein are conducted safely. The mandate of the BCDRC is to provide an independent, third party review of the Biological and Chemical Defence (BCD) research, development and training activities undertaken by the Department of National Defence (DND) and the Canadian Forces (CF) with a view to assessing whether they are defensive in nature and conducted in a professional manner with no threat to public safety or the environment. The committee's activities are funded under a renewable, five-year Contribution Agreement with DND. These activities vary somewhat from year to year, but always include lengthy and in-depth visits to DRDC Suffield, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa and the CF Health Services headquarters in Ottawa, where briefings and updates on a wide variety of matters are received. It also takes note of Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inspection reports. Other sites of recurring visits are DRDC Valcartier and the Canadian Forces Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (CFNBC) School in Borden, Ontario. CF naval, army and air force installations, other DND sites such as the Canadian Joint Incident Response Unit, and such organizations as the Centre for Security Science are also selected for occasional visits. Committee members also attend relevant conferences, workshops, training courses and symposia. The Committee's activities, role and arms'-length relationship are rather unusual among treaty signatories, and have been acknowledged overseas. Membership The Committee consists of three non-government scientific members and an Executive Officer who coordinates and administers the affairs of the Committee. The scientific members include a toxicologist nominated by the Society of Toxicology of Canada, a microbiologist nominated by the Canadian Society of Microbiologists and a chemist nominated by the Chemical Institute of Canada. The Executive Officer is a retired senior military officer. For all Committee members, the terms of service were initially set at three years, but have varied in length since then. One of the scientific members is chosen by the committee to act as the Committee's Chair. Reporting In its initial mandate, the committee reported to the Chair, Defence Science Advisory Board, who relayed the report to the Deputy Minister and the Chief of Defence Staff, who then could respond and eventually release the report to the public. Later, the reports were posted on a DND website dedicated to the BCDRC. Today, the BCDRC operates at arm's length from Government and operates its own website where its annual reports since 1991 are posted. Ahead of publication, the reports are still reviewed by the DND for national security reasons but have never been edited or censored. They are then translated into the other official language.

Bach composed it in Leipzig on a text by Picander and first performed it on 5 September 1733. It is also known as ''''' (The choice of Hercules) and ''''' (Hercules at the crossroads).  History and text  The work is a dramma per musica describing the story of \\"Hercules at the crossroads\\". Bach composed the cantata for the 11th birthday of Crown Prince Friedrich Christian of Saxony, to a text by Picander. It was first performed in Leipzig on 5 September 1733 at Zimmermann's coffeehouse, where Bach's Coffee Cantata was also first performed. Bach used the aria \\"\\" in a revised form in Und es waren Hirten in derselben Gegend, Part II of his Christmas Oratorio. A duet of the cantata and the duet \\"\\" from his Mass in B minor share a common lost base. The cantata is counted among the works for celebrations of the Leipzig University, Festmusiken zu Leipziger Universit√§tsfeiern.  Scoring and structure  The cantata has four vocal soloists: Lust (soprano), Hercules (alto), Virtue (tenor), and Mercury (bass). It is also scored for a four-part choir, two horns, oboe d'amore, two oboes, two violins, two violas (or viola and bassoon), and basso continuo. The cantata has 13 movements: # Chorus: # Recitative (alto): # Aria (soprano): # Duet recitative (soprano, tenor): # Aria (alto): # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (tenor): # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (alto): # Duet recitative (alto, tenor): # Duet aria (alto, tenor): # Recitative (bass): # Chorus:  Music  The opening movement presents a choir of deities giving homage to the young Hercules, with \\"lullaby-like\\" chordal instrumental accompaniment. In the first recitative, Hercules establishes the \\"crossroads\\" at which he finds himself: a choice between the right path and following his desires. Lust responds with a lullaby-like aria to lure Hercules. The duet recitative \\"encapsulates the age- old good angel/bad angel, good cop/bad cop dichotomy\\", leading into an aria in which Hercules is \\"vacillating between them\\". The aria adopts the \\"echo\\" form prominent in early Italian opera: another alto voice engages in imitative exchanges with Hercules and with the instrumental lines. Virtue proceeds with a secco recitative and \\"ebullient\\" aria entreating Hercules to follow the right path that he might \\"soar on his wings like an eagle to the stars\\". Virtue concludes with another secco recitative warning Hercules not to succumb to Lust's temptations. Hercules sings a da capo aria expressing his conviction to follow Virtue's advice. The accompanying instrumental lines represent the \\"writhing of serpents ... being torn apart\\" by his choice. He then sings a duet recitative with Virtue: \\"metaphorically she 'weds' herself to him and they end together with a vow of unity\\". This moves into a long duet aria \\"with all the quiet tranquility of a love song but, perhaps, one that commits minds and emotions rather than bodies\\". The character of Mercury appears for the first time in the penultimate movement, accompanied by a \\"haze of God-like mysticism\\" created by the strings. The closing chorus is combined with a bass arioso in which Mercury addresses the Crown Prince directly. The movement is stylistically a gavotte with a balanced structure contrasting orchestra and chorus with the bass solo.

He composed the ' (congratulatory cantata) or ' (drama in music) in Leipzig as a ' (Festive music for the court of the Electorate of Saxony) for the anniversary of the election of August III, Elector of Saxony, as King of Poland, and first performed it on 5 October 1734 in the presence of the Elector.  History and words  Bach wrote several works for celebrations of the Leipzig University, Festmusiken zu Leipziger Universit√§tsfeiern. The Neue Bach-Ausgabe has detailed background information about the events around the composition and first performance of this cantata, collected by Werner Neumann. August III, Elector of Saxony and of Poland, had announced his presence in Leipzig from 2 to 6 October 1734, on short notice. As the anniversary of his election as king on 5 October fell during this time, students of the University of Leipzig planned to perform a procession with torches and evening music on that day. The cantata text was written by Johann Christoph Clauder. He refers to the events of the last months. While other congratulatory cantatas often use allegorical figures, this work concentrates on the king and his qualities. When Augustus II the Strong died, August III followed him as both elector and king, but had to secure the throne against partisans of Stanis≈Çaw I Leszczy≈Ñski. Bach composed the music, probably in no more than three days. He used the first movement of his 1732 cantata Es lebe der K√∂nig, der Vater im Lande, BWV Anh 11, set for two four part choirs, as a base for the opening chorus. The former work, whose music has not survived, had been composed in 1732 for the (name day) of the previous elector August II. It seems likely that Bach also used other earlier music, but no specific pieces have been identified. A chronicle of Leipzig written by Johann Salomon Riemer reports the performance of the cantata on 5 October, in front of the Apel House, the Elector's palace in Leipzig, after a torch-light procession of six hundred students. The Elector and his family remained at the window as long as the music lasted and were pleased (\\"herzlich wohlgefallen\\"). 700 copies of the text were printed. The following day, the chronicle reports the death from a stroke of the trumpeter Gottfried Reiche, \\"Senior der Mus. Stadt Compagnie\\" (senior of the town music company), who had played first trumpet in the cantata. Possibly \\"over-exertion and/or the inhalation of smoke from the torches\\" played a role. Bach used the seventh movement, the soprano aria ', as the base for a bass aria in his Christmas Oratorio, Part V, '. He used the first movement as the base for the \\"\\" of his Mass in B minor.  Scoring and structure  Chronicle of Leipzig for 5 and 6 October 1734 The cantata in nine movements is scored for three soloists, soprano, tenor and bass, two four-part choirs, and a festive orchestra of three trumpets and timpani, two flauto traverso, two oboes, two violins, viola and basso continuo. # Chorus: '''' # Recitative (tenor): '''' # Aria (tenor): '''' # Recitative (bass): '''' # Aria (bass): '''' # Recitative (soprano): '''' # Aria (soprano): '''' # Recitative (soprano, tenor, bass): '''' # Chorus: ''''  Music  The opening chorus employs a double choir, unique in Bach's surviving cantatas. The movement begins with an instrumental ritornello and is in da capo form. The choir enters in a unison statement. While the model () had an upbeat of one note, it is a run of four notes here. The voices change between unison, homophonic seven-part sections and imitation. Musicologist Julian Mincham notes that Bach \\"makes great play of the dramatic interjections of one choir, often using the initial motive, against the uninterrupted flowing counterpoint of the other\\". The trumpets are silent in the middle section, where \\"Bach continues to play the two choirs off against each other before they unite, as the people are encouraged to do, at the end of this section\\". In the following two movements, recitative and aria, the tenor is accompanied by two oboes. The aria suggests the \\"aggression of war\\". The bass aria is a \\"rage aria\\" like in an opera seria. A soprano aria, accompanied by two flutes, appeals to the \\"king's grace, mercy and love for his subjects\\". All three soloists participate in a final recitative. The closing chorus provides \\"cheerful but undemanding conclusions\\".  Selected recordings  * J.S.

History and text  Bach composed this cantata for the wedding of Johann Heinrich Wolff and Susanna Regina Hempel. Susanna was the daughter of a customs official, and came from Zittau; her husband came from Leipzig, where the work was first performed on 5 February 1728. The text was written by Picander, who published it in his collection Ernst-Schertzhaffte und Satyrische Gedichte. Picander refers to the bride and groom by the rivers of their respective cities (the \\"Plei√üenstadt\\" of the title is Leipzig, the city on the river Plei√üe). There was a related work Erw√§hlte Plei√üenstadt: Apollo et Mercurius, BWV 216.2, the music of which is lost. This was written for Leipzig Town Council, and the text does not relate to Zittau.  Scoring and structure  The surviving music consists of parts for soprano and alto voices, representing the characters of Nei√üe and Plei√üe respectively. The instrumental forces are unknown, but for two numbers Bach drew on music he had composed for earlier cantatas, which may suggest a range of instrumental colour was called for. One parody source is a duet for alto and tenor from Zerrei√üet, zersprenget, zertr√ºmmert die Gruft, BWV 205, a festively scored work premiered in 1725. The parody source of movement 3 was Ich bin in mir vergn√ºgt, BWV 204, scored for soprano soloist, flauto traverso, two oboes, two violins, viola, and basso continuo and also premiered in the 1720s.

On the other hand, the present building was established and was composed of 2 floors for the teaching classes and a house for the principal and teachers living in the school dormitory. Miss Wilson stayed in managing the school for a whole of 15 years until she reached the retirement age. Then, Miss Helen Caselle took over her for three years; but for an unexpected situation, the intermediate classes were canceled in school. After that, Reverend James Welbi managed the school for one year. And when the American commission found that the school was passing in a very difficult financial situation because of the reduction in the number of students, it was decided to handle the school and all its responsibilities to the National Evangelical Synod in Syria & Lebanon.  National Evangelical Synod in Syria & Lebanon  And in summer 1963,the National Evangelical Synod decided to authorize the school's management to Mr. Bolous Botrus for one year. But with God's help and Mr. Boutrus enthusiasm and wise management, he was able to reorganize the school. As a result, the number of students increased in all sections of school, and the success percentage increased in Elementary Official Exams which encouraged him to reopen the Intermediate classes and add the Secondary level that excelled the other levels. This progress led to the increase in school's buildings. So the principal built the third floor in the teaching department and also the third floor in the dorm, in addition to enlarging the dining room. Then, he built a three floor building; the first one was for children, and the other was for the boys in the boarding department. He also expanded the playgrounds and bought new land that fit with the continuous prosperity of the school. And he put in charge specialized teachers for teaching in all levels. Since 1975, N.E.S.N. is a mixed school in all its stages, and it prepares its students for acquiring the Elementary Certificate and Secondary Certificate (first section) in both scientific & literary branches, in addition to \\"High School\\" Certificate that is granted to who successfully continues the second secondary class. Mr. Boutrus was transferred to Saida in 1975 for managing the Evangelical School of art, and Mr. Munther Antoun was assigned as a principal in the school in Nabatieh. In this period the security circumstances became worse in Nabatieh. The school had its share, and many people were injured and a number of its neighbors who had sheltered in the school basement, were injured too. Some of them were: Kamel Bidear Naser & Amer Issa and Safi Yassin. As a result, the school couldn't continue teaching. So the school's administration decided to wait for the end of the academic year. And the buildings of the Art's school in Saida were used in summer 1977 to complete the year, and the lessons of year 1978-1979 were hung up. Meanwhile, Mr. Antoun was assigned as a principal of Zahle Evangelical School, but the son of the South refused to move to Zahle; he decided to stay in Saida to manage Nabatieh school and take care of its students until they could return to Nabatieh. During the first invasion of South Lebanon in 1978 the school was bombarded again, and most of the people in the city emigrated. The close continued until 1982 when NESN reopened the elementary part. And it began to add one class each year till it reached the second secondary class. But it couldn't open the third secondary class because of the absence of the qualified teachers and the difficulty of bringing them to Nabatieh for the lack of security. Later, in 1999-2000, the school opened its third secondary class - Life Science - and saved its students transformation to other schools. NESN has proved a great success so far. Currently, Shadi El Hajjar is the principal of the school, and plans on multiple re-innovation plans.

Calvo was part of the \\"Generaci√≥n del Sesenta\\" (\\"Generation of Sixty\\"), a group of prominent Peruvian poets that came of age in the 1960s. Considered an important voice in the literature of Peru and the Amazon basin, his work has been celebrated in Latin America and a novel translated into Italian and English. Life and career Calvo was born in Iquitos, Loreto, Peru. He was a son of C√©sar Calvo de Araujo the Peruvian painter. His first chapbook of poetry was published in 1960 when he was twenty; it drew literary praise. At Universidades Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Lima, his subjects were literature, psychology, and law. He continued to write poetry. In 1974 Calvo was awarded First Prize of the Concurso Hispanoamericano de Literatura, by which he had been honorably mentioned in 1960. In 1976 his works won him the Premio Nacional de Poes√≠a of Peru. His occupation in journalism included his youthful founding of Expresso in Lima. For several decades he actively participated in newspapers, magazines, and later television. In politics on the left, Calvo was known to be friendly and spontaneous. Apparently he struck up conversations with a wide variety of people, making little distinction as to class, race, social position, or culture. He once led the Instituto Nacional de Cultura en Iquitos. He also served in Iquitos as Director of the Fundaci√≥n Pro Selva (\\"Foundation for the Forest\\"), involved in the protection of the Amazon ecology, both flora and fauna. He traveled widely; besides Iquitos, Lima, and Cuzco in Peru, he has resided in Londres, Paris, Roma, Madrid, and Barcelona.

He died suddenly, his last work Edipo entre los Inkas almost finished. Among his major works: *El Cetro de los Jovenes (Sceptre of the Youth) 1967 [poetry] *Cancionario (Song Book) 1967 {poetry] *Pedestal Para Nadie (Pedestal for No One) 1975 [poetry] *Las Tres Mitades de Ino Moxo y otros Brujos de la Amazon√≠a (Iquitos 1981) [novel] **The Three Halves of Ino Moxo: Teachings of the Wizard of the Upper Amazon (Rochester 1995)The novel was translated by K. A. Symington and published by Inner Traditions. Ino Moxo, the \\"Wizard of the Upper Amazon\\", refers to Manuel C√≥rdova-Rios. Literary corpus His Cancionario is a collection of his poems written in the form of songs, published in 1967. Later many were made the basis of compositions by various singers and musicians. Accordingly, he co-wrote with an Afro-Peruvian chanteuse, the great Chabuca Granda, the land√≥ \\"Mar√≠a land√≥\\". This song became internationally famous later when recorded by another Afro-Peruvian of renown, Susana Baca. It was released on the 1995 compilation CD The Soul of Black Peru.Among those who put his lyrics to music: Chabuca Granda, Jorge Madue√±o, Ra√∫l V√°squez, Juan Castro Nalli, Lucho Gonz√°les, V√≠ctor Merino. Among performers: Pablo Milan√©s, Silvio Rodr√≠guez, Alfredo Zitarrosa, Mercedes Sosa, Rafael, Eva Ayll√≥n, Susana Baca, Cecilia Barraza, Elsa Mar√≠a Elejalde, Miki Gonzalez.

Of Calvo's written works perhaps the best known internationally is his novel Las Tres Mitades de Ino Moxo y otros Brujos de la Amazon√≠a (The three halves of Ino Maxo and other wizards of the Amazon) 1981. This work is framed as a journey of Calvo and his cousin into the Amazon forest, to visit the revered shaman Manuel C√≥rdova known as Ino Moxo. Its poetic narrative adopts the intersubjective spiritual perception of Ino Moxo and addresses the tribal aftermath of the violent commercial conquests during the rubber boom. Later Calvo authored a trilogy about the background to the attempted assassination of John Paul II: Los Lobos Grises A√∫llan en Ingl√©s (The Grey Wolves howl in English) 1985; La Verdad y Solamente la Verdad (The Truth and only the Truth) 1985; and, Los Lobos A√∫llan contra Bulgaria (The Wolves howl against Bulgaria) 1990. His last publication was posthumous, a poetic essay entitled Edipo entre los Inkas (Oedipus among the Incas), 3 volumes, 2001. Calvo early worked as a journalist and editor for newspapers in Lima. His posts included: El Comercio, El Correo, La Republica, and El Popular. Earlier he had founded the daily Expresso in Lima. He contributed to other periodic publications: Gente, Caretas, and Si. He also appeared on television in Peru as a moderator and master of ceremonies.

Fish physiology is the scientific study of how the component parts of fish function together in the living fish. It can be contrasted with fish anatomy, which is the study of the form or morphology of fishes. In practice, fish anatomy and physiology complement each other, the former dealing with the structure of a fish, its organs or component parts and how they are put together, such as might be observed on the dissecting table or under the microscope, and the later dealing with how those components function together in the living fish.  Respiration  pike Most fish exchange gases using gills on either side of the pharynx (throat). Gills are tissues which consist of threadlike structures called filaments. These filaments have many functions and \\"are involved in ion and water transfer as well as oxygen, carbon dioxide, acid and ammonia exchange.Hoar WS and Randall DJ (1984) Fish Physiology: Gills: Part A ‚Äì Anatomy, gas transfer and acid-base regulation Academic Press. .Hoar WS and Randall DJ (1984) Fish Physiology: Gills: Part B ‚Äì Ion and water transfer Academic Press. . Each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing countercurrent exchange. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Fish from multiple groups can live out of the water for extended time periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, with the exception of the Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so- called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family. Breathing air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that is little more than wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns. Air breathing fish can be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African lungfish, are obligated to breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air if they need to and can otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators. Red represents a higher value (e.g. of temperature or the partial pressure of a gas) than blue so the property being transported in the channels flows from red to blue. In fish a countercurrent flow (lower diagram) of blood and water in the gills is used to extract oxygen from the environment. All basal vertebrates breathe with gills. The gills are carried right behind the head, bordering the posterior margins of a series of openings from the esophagus to the exterior. Each gill is supported by a cartilaginous or bony gill arch. The gills of vertebrates typically develop in the walls of the pharynx, along a series of gill slits opening to the exterior. Most species employ a countercurrent exchange system to enhance the diffusion of substances in and out of the gill, with blood and water flowing in opposite directions to each other, which increases the efficiency of oxygen-uptake from the water. Fresh oxygenated water taken in through the mouth is uninterruptedly \\"pumped\\" through the gills in one direction, while the blood in the lamellae flows in the opposite direction, creating the countercurrent blood and water flow, on which the fish's survival depends. The gills are composed of comb-like filaments, the gill lamellae, which help increase their surface area for oxygen exchange. When a fish breathes, it draws in a mouthful of water at regular intervals. Then it draws the sides of its throat together, forcing the water through the gill openings, so that it passes over the gills to the outside. The bony fish have three pairs of arches, cartilaginous fish have five to seven pairs, while the primitive jawless fish have seven. The vertebrate ancestor no doubt had more arches, as some of their chordate relatives have more than 50 pairs of gills. Higher vertebrates do not develop gills, the gill arches form during fetal development, and lay the basis of essential structures such as jaws, the thyroid gland, the larynx, the columella (corresponding to the stapes in mammals) and in mammals the malleus and incus. Fish gill slits may be the evolutionary ancestors of the tonsils, thymus gland, and Eustachian tubes, as well as many other structures derived from the embryonic branchial pouches. Scientists have investigated what part of the body is responsible for maintaining the respiratory rhythm. They found that neurons located in the brainstem of fish are responsible for the genesis of the respiratory rhythm.Rovainen, 1985 The position of these neurons is slightly different from the centers of respiratory genesis in mammals but they are located in the same brain compartment, which has caused debates about the homology of respiratory centers between aquatic and terrestrial species. In both aquatic and terrestrial respiration, the exact mechanisms by which neurons can generate this involuntary rhythm are still not completely understood (see Involuntary control of respiration). Another important feature of the respiratory rhythm is that it is modulated to adapt to the oxygen consumption of the body. As observed in mammals, fish \\"breathe\\" faster and heavier when they do physical exercise. The mechanisms by which these changes occur have been strongly debated over more than 100 years between scientists.Waldrop, Iwamoto and Haouzi, 2006 The authors can be classified in 2 schools: #Those who think that the major part of the respiratory changes are pre-programmed in the brain, which would imply that neurons from locomotion centers of the brain connect to respiratory centers in anticipation of movements. #Those who think that the major part of the respiratory changes result from the detection of muscle contraction, and that respiration is adapted as a consequence of muscular contraction and oxygen consumption. This would imply that the brain possesses some kind of detection mechanisms that would trigger a respiratory response when muscular contraction occurs. Many now agree that both mechanisms are probably present and complementary, or working alongside a mechanism that can detect changes in oxygen and/or carbon dioxide blood saturation.  Bony fish  The fish draws oxygen-rich water in through the mouth (left). It then pumps it over gills so oxygen enters the bloodstream, and allows oxygen- depleted water to exit through the gill slits (right) In bony fish, the gills lie in a branchial chamber covered by a bony operculum. The great majority of bony fish species have five pairs of gills, although a few have lost some over the course of evolution. The operculum can be important in adjusting the pressure of water inside of the pharynx to allow proper ventilation of the gills, so that bony fish do not have to rely on ram ventilation (and hence near constant motion) to breathe. Valves inside the mouth keep the water from escaping. The gill arches of bony fish typically have no septum, so that the gills alone project from the arch, supported by individual gill rays. Some species retain gill rakers. Though all but the most primitive bony fish lack a spiracle, the pseudobranch associated with it often remains, being located at the base of the operculum. This is, however, often greatly reduced, consisting of a small mass of cells without any remaining gill-like structure. Marine teleosts also use gills to excrete electrolytes. The gills' large surface area tends to create a problem for fish that seek to regulate the osmolarity of their internal fluids. Saltwater is less dilute than these internal fluids, so saltwater fish lose large quantities of water osmotically through their gills. To regain the water, they drink large amounts of seawater and excrete the salt. Freshwater is more dilute than the internal fluids of fish, however, so freshwater fish gain water osmotically through their gills. In some primitive bony fishes and amphibians, the larvae bear external gills, branching off from the gill arches. These are reduced in adulthood, their function taken over by the gills proper in fishes and by lungs in most amphibians. Some amphibians retain the external larval gills in adulthood, the complex internal gill system as seen in fish apparently being irrevocably lost very early in the evolution of tetrapods.Clack, J. A. (2002): Gaining ground: the origin and evolution of tetrapods. Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana. 369 pp  Cartilaginous fish  Like other fish, sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills. Unlike other fish, shark gill slits are not covered, but lie in a row behind the head. A modified slit called a spiracle lies just behind the eye, which assists the shark with taking in water during respiration and plays a major role in bottom‚Äìdwelling sharks. Spiracles are reduced or missing in active pelagic sharks. While the shark is moving, water passes through the mouth and over the gills in a process known as \\"ram ventilation\\". While at rest, most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water. A small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest. These species are obligate ram ventilators and would presumably asphyxiate if unable to move. Obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species. The respiration and circulation process begins when deoxygenated blood travels to the shark's two-chambered heart. Here the shark pumps blood to its gills via the ventral aorta artery where it branches into afferent brachial arteries. Reoxygenation takes place in the gills and the reoxygenated blood flows into the efferent brachial arteries, which come together to form the dorsal aorta. The blood flows from the dorsal aorta throughout the body. The deoxygenated blood from the body then flows through the posterior cardinal veins and enters the posterior cardinal sinuses. From there blood enters the heart ventricle and the cycle repeats. \\\\---- Sharks and rays typically have five pairs of gill slits that open directly to the outside of the body, though some more primitive sharks have six or seven pairs. Adjacent slits are separated by a cartilaginous gill arch from which projects a long sheet-like septum, partly supported by a further piece of cartilage called the gill ray. The individual lamellae of the gills lie on either side of the septum. The base of the arch may also support gill rakers, small projecting elements that help to filter food from the water. A smaller opening, the spiracle, lies in the back of the first gill slit. This bears a small pseudobranch that resembles a gill in structure, but only receives blood already oxygenated by the true gills. The spiracle is thought to be homologous to the ear opening in higher vertebrates.Laurin M. (1998): The importance of global parsimony and historical bias in understanding tetrapod evolution. Part I-systematics, middle ear evolution, and jaw suspension. Annales des Sciences Naturelles, Zoologie, Paris, 13e S√©rie 19: pp 1-42. Most sharks rely on ram ventilation, forcing water into the mouth and over the gills by rapidly swimming forward. In slow-moving or bottom dwelling species, especially among skates and rays, the spiracle may be enlarged, and the fish breathes by sucking water through this opening, instead of through the mouth. Chimaeras differ from other cartilagenous fish, having lost both the spiracle and the fifth gill slit. The remaining slits are covered by an operculum, developed from the septum of the gill arch in front of the first gill.  Lampreys and hagfish  Lampreys and hagfish do not have gill slits as such. Instead, the gills are contained in spherical pouches, with a circular opening to the outside. Like the gill slits of higher fish, each pouch contains two gills. In some cases, the openings may be fused together, effectively forming an operculum. Lampreys have seven pairs of pouches, while hagfishes may have six to fourteen, depending on the species. In the hagfish, the pouches connect with the pharynx internally. In adult lampreys, a separate respiratory tube develops beneath the pharynx proper, separating food and water from respiration by closing a valve at its anterior end.  Circulation  Two- chambered heart of a fish The circulatory systems of all vertebrates are closed, just as in humans. Still, the systems of fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds show various stages of the evolution of the circulatory system. In fish, the system has only one circuit, with the blood being pumped through the capillaries of the gills and on to the capillaries of the body tissues. This is known as single cycle circulation. The heart of fish is therefore only a single pump (consisting of two chambers). Fish have a closed-loop circulatory system. The heart pumps the blood in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation. In amphibians and most reptiles, a double circulatory system is used, but the heart is not always completely separated into two pumps. Amphibians have a three-chambered heart.  Digestion  Jaws allow fish to eat a wide variety of food, including plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger- shaped pouches called pyloric caeca, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption. In most vertebrates, digestion is a four-stage process involving the main structures of the digestive tract, starting with ingestion, placing food into the mouth, and concluding with the excretion of undigested material through the anus. From the mouth, the food moves to the stomach, where as bolus it is broken down chemically. It then moves to the intestine, where the process of breaking the food down into simple molecules continues and the results are absorbed as nutrients into the circulatory and lymphatic system. Although the precise shape and size of the stomach varies widely among different vertebrates, the relative positions of the oesophageal and duodenal openings remain relatively constant. As a result, the organ always curves somewhat to the left before curving back to meet the pyloric sphincter. However, lampreys, hagfishes, chimaeras, lungfishes, and some teleost fish have no stomach at all, with the oesophagus opening directly into the intestine. These animals all consume diets that either require little storage of food, or no pre-digestion with gastric juices, or both. The small intestine is the part of the digestive tract following the stomach and followed by the large intestine, and is where much of the digestion and absorption of food takes place. In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not clear, and the terms anterior or proximal intestine may be used instead of duodenum. The small intestine is found in all teleosts, although its form and length vary enormously between species. In teleosts, it is relatively short, typically around one and a half times the length of the fish's body. It commonly has a number of pyloric caeca, small pouch-like structures along its length that help to increase the overall surface area of the organ for digesting food. There is no ileocaecal valve in teleosts, with the boundary between the small intestine and the rectum being marked only by the end of the digestive epithelium. There is no small intestine as such in non-teleost fish, such as sharks, sturgeons, and lungfish. Instead, the digestive part of the gut forms a spiral intestine, connecting the stomach to the rectum. In this type of gut, the intestine itself is relatively straight, but has a long fold running along the inner surface in a spiral fashion, sometimes for dozens of turns. This valve greatly increases both the surface area and the effective length of the intestine. The lining of the spiral intestine is similar to that of the small intestine in teleosts and non-mammalian tetrapods. In lampreys, the spiral valve is extremely small, possibly because their diet requires little digestion. Hagfish have no spiral valve at all, with digestion occurring for almost the entire length of the intestine, which is not subdivided into different regions. The large intestine is the last part of the digestive system normally found in vertebrate animals. Its function is to absorb water from the remaining indigestible food matter, and then to pass useless waste material from the body. In fish, there is no true large intestine, but simply a short rectum connecting the end of the digestive part of the gut to the cloaca. In sharks, this includes a rectal gland that secretes salt to help the animal maintain osmotic balance with the seawater. The gland somewhat resembles a caecum in structure, but is not a homologous structure. As with many aquatic animals, most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. Some of the wastes diffuse through the gills. Blood wastes are filtered by the kidneys. Saltwater fish tend to lose water because of osmosis. Their kidneys return water to the body. The reverse happens in freshwater fish: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater. In sharks, digestion can take a long time. The food moves from the mouth to a J-shaped stomach, where it is stored and initial digestion occurs. Unwanted items may never get past the stomach, and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its mouth. One of the biggest differences between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines. This short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. The valve provides a long surface area, requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca. Endocrine system  Regulation of social behaviour  Oxytocin is a group of neuropeptides found in most vertebrate. One form of oxytocin functions as a hormone which is associated with human love. In 2012, researchers injected cichlids from the social species Neolamprologus pulcher, either with this form of isotocin or with a control saline solution. They found isotocin increased \\"responsiveness to social information\\", which suggests \\"it is a key regulator of social behavior that has evolved and endured since ancient times\\".Fish Version Of Oxytocin Drives Their Social Behavior Science 2.0, 10 October 2012. Effects of pollution Fish can bioaccumulate pollutants that are discharged into waterways. Estrogenic compounds found in pesticides, birth control, plastics, plants, fungi, bacteria, and synthetic drugs leeched into rivers are affecting the endocrine systems of native species. In Boulder, Colorado, white sucker fish found downstream of a municipal waste water treatment plant exhibit impaired or abnormal sexual development. The fish have been exposed to higher levels of estrogen, and leading to feminized fish. Males display female reproductive organs, and both sexes have reduced fertility, and a higher hatch mortality. Freshwater habitats in the United States are widely contaminated by the common pesticide atrazine. There is controversy over the degree to which this pesticide harms the endocrine systems of freshwater fish and amphibians. Non- industry-funded researchers consistently report harmful effects while industry-funded researchers consistently report no harmful effects.Rohr, J.R. (2018) \\"Atrazine and Amphibians: A Story of Profits, Controversy, and Animus\\". In: D. A. DellaSala, and M. I. Goldstein (eds.) Encyclopedia of the Anthropocene, volume 5, pages 141‚Äì148. Oxford: Elsevier. In the marine ecosystem, organochlorine contaminants like pesticides, herbicides (DDT), and chlordan are accumulating within fish tissue and disrupting their endocrine system. High frequencies of infertility and high levels of organochlorines have been found in bonnethead sharks along the Gulf Coast of Florida. These endocrine-disrupting compounds are similar in structure to naturally occurring hormones in fish. They can modulate hormonal interactions in fish by: * binding to cellular receptors, causing unpredictable and abnormal cell activity * blocking receptor sites, inhibiting activity * promoting the creation of extra receptor sites, amplifying the effects of the hormone or compound * interacting with naturally occurring hormones, changing their shape and impact * affecting hormone synthesis or metabolism, causing an improper balance or quantity of hormones Osmoregulation Movement of water and ions in saltwater fish Movement of water and ions in freshwater fish Two major types of osmoregulation are osmoconformers and osmoregulators. Osmoconformers match their body osmolarity to their environment actively or passively. Most marine invertebrates are osmoconformers, although their ionic composition may be different from that of seawater. Osmoregulators tightly regulate their body osmolarity, which always stays constant, and are more common in the animal kingdom. Osmoregulators actively control salt concentrations despite the salt concentrations in the environment. An example is freshwater fish. The gills actively uptake salt from the environment by the use of mitochondria-rich cells. Water will diffuse into the fish, so it excretes a very hypotonic (dilute) urine to expel all the excess water. A marine fish has an internal osmotic concentration lower than that of the surrounding seawater, so it tends to lose water and gain salt. It actively excretes salt out from the gills. Most fish are stenohaline, which means they are restricted to either salt or fresh water and cannot survive in water with a different salt concentration than they are adapted to. However, some fish show a tremendous ability to effectively osmoregulate across a broad range of salinities; fish with this ability are known as euryhaline species, e.g., salmon. Salmon has been observed to inhabit two utterly disparate environments -- marine and fresh water -- and it is inherent to adapt to both by bringing in behavioral and physiological modifications. In contrast to bony fish, with the exception of the coelacanth,Chemistry of the body fluids of the coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae the blood and other tissue of sharks and Chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to marine environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the bull shark, which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea. When a shark dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia. Sharks have adopted a different, efficient mechanism to conserve water, i.e., osmoregulation. They retain urea in their blood in relatively higher concentration. Urea is damaging to living tissue so, to cope with this problem, some fish retain trimethylamine oxide. This provides a better solution to urea's toxicity. Sharks, having slightly higher solute concentration (i.e., above 1000 mOsm which is sea solute concentration), do not drink water like fresh water fish. Thermoregulation Homeothermy and poikilothermy refer to how stable an organism's temperature is. Most endothermic organisms are homeothermic, like mammals. However, animals with facultative endothermy are often poikilothermic, meaning their temperature can vary considerably. Similarly, most fish are ectotherms, as all of their heat comes from the surrounding water. However, most are homeotherms because their temperature is very stable. Most organisms have a preferred temperature range, however some can be acclimated to temperatures colder or warmer than what they are typically used to. An organism's preferred temperature is typically the temperature at which the organism's physiological processes can act at optimal rates. When fish become acclimated to other temperatures, the efficiency of their physiological processes may decrease but will continue to function. This is called the thermal neutral zone at which an organism can survive indefinitely. H.M. Vernon has done work on the death temperature and paralysis temperature (temperature of heat rigor) of various animals. He found that species of the same class showed very similar temperature values, those from the Amphibia examined being 38.5 ¬∞C, fish 39 ¬∞C, Reptilia 45 ¬∞C, and various Molluscs 46 ¬∞C. To cope with low temperatures, some fish have developed the ability to remain functional even when the water temperature is below freezing; some use natural antifreeze or antifreeze proteins to resist ice crystal formation in their tissues. Most sharks are \\"cold-blooded\\" or, more precisely, poikilothermic, meaning that their internal body temperature matches that of their ambient environment. Members of the family Lamnidae (such as the shortfin mako shark and the great white shark) are homeothermic and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. In these sharks, a strip of aerobic red muscle located near the center of the body generates the heat, which the body retains via a countercurrent exchange mechanism by a system of blood vessels called the rete mirabile (\\"miraculous net\\"). The common thresher shark has a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature, which is thought to have evolved independently. Tuna can maintain the temperature of certain parts of their body above the temperature of ambient seawater. For example, bluefin tuna maintain a core body temperature of , in water as cold as . However, unlike typical endothermic creatures such as mammals and birds, tuna do not maintain temperature within a relatively narrow range. Tuna achieve endothermy by conserving the heat generated through normal metabolism. The rete mirabile (\\"wonderful net\\"), the intertwining of veins and arteries in the body's periphery, transfers heat from venous blood to arterial blood via a counter- current exchange system, thus mitigating the effects of surface cooling. This allows the tuna to elevate the temperatures of the highly aerobic tissues of the skeletal muscles, eyes and brain, which supports faster swimming speeds and reduced energy expenditure, and which enables them to survive in cooler waters over a wider range of ocean environments than those of other fish. In all tunas, however, the heart operates at ambient temperature, as it receives cooled blood, and coronary circulation is directly from the gills. * Homeothermy: Although most fish are exclusively ectothermic, there are exceptions. Certain species of fish maintain elevated body temperatures. Endothermic teleosts (bony fish) are all in the suborder Scombroidei and include the billfishes, tunas, including a \\"primitive\\" mackerel species, Gasterochisma melampus. All sharks in the family Lamnidae ‚Äì shortfin mako, long fin mako, white, porbeagle, and salmon shark ‚Äì are endothermic, and evidence suggests the trait exists in family Alopiidae (thresher sharks). The degree of endothermy varies from the billfish, which warm only their eyes and brain, to bluefin tuna and porbeagle sharks who maintain body temperatures elevated in excess of above ambient water temperatures. See also gigantothermy. Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central nervous system processing, and higher rates of digestion. In some fish, a rete mirabile allows for an increase in muscle temperature in regions where this network of vein and arteries is found. The fish is able to thermoregulate certain areas of their body. Additionally, this increase in temperature leads to an increase in basal metabolic temperature. The fish is now able to split ATP at a higher rate and ultimately can swim faster. The eye of a swordfish can generate heat to better cope with detecting their prey at depths of .David Fleshler(10-15-2012) South Florida Sun-Sentinel, *Swordfish heat their eyes  Muscular system  Cross section of a teleost Iridescent shark filets showing myomere structure Fish swim by contracting longitudinal red muscle and obliquely oriented white muscles. The red muscle is aerobic and needs oxygen which is supplied by myoglobin. The white muscle is anaerobic and it does not need oxygen. Red muscles are used for sustained activity such as cruising at slow speeds on ocean migrations. White muscles are used for bursts of activity, such as jumping or sudden bursts of speed for catching prey.Kapoor 2004 Mostly fish have white muscles, but the muscles of some fishes, such as scombroids and salmonids, range from pink to dark red. The red myotomal muscles derive their colour from myoglobin, an oxygen-binding molecule, which tuna express in quantities far higher than most other fish. The oxygen-rich blood further enables energy delivery to their muscles. Most fish move by alternately contracting paired sets of muscles on either side of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. A typical characteristic of many animals that utilize undulatory locomotion is that they have segmented muscles, or blocks of myomeres, running from their head to tails which are separated by connective tissue called myosepta. In addition, some segmented muscle groups, such the lateral hypaxial musculature in the salamander are oriented at an angle to the longitudinal direction. For these obliquely oriented fibers the strain in the longitudinal direction is greater than the strain in the muscle fiber direction leading to an architectural gear ratio greater than 1. A higher initial angle of orientation and more dorsoventral bulging produces a faster muscle contraction but results in a lower amount of force production. It is hypothesized that animals employ a variable gearing mechanism that allows self-regulation of force and velocity to meet the mechanical demands of the contraction. When a pennate muscle is subjected to a low force, resistance to width changes in the muscle cause it to rotate which consequently produce a higher architectural gear ratio (AGR) (high velocity). However, when subject to a high force, the perpendicular fiber force component overcomes the resistance to width changes and the muscle compresses producing a lower AGR (capable of maintaining a higher force output). Most fishes bend as a simple, homogenous beam during swimming via contractions of longitudinal red muscle fibers and obliquely oriented white muscle fibers within the segmented axial musculature. The fiber strain (Œµf) experienced by the longitudinal red muscle fibers is equivalent to the longitudinal strain (Œµx). The deeper white muscle fibers fishes show diversity in arrangement. These fibers are organized into cone-shaped structures and attach to connective tissue sheets known as myosepta; each fiber shows a characteristic dorsoventral (Œ±) and mediolateral (œÜ) trajectory. The segmented architecture theory predicts that, Œµx > Œµf. This phenomenon results in an architectural gear ratio, determined as longitudinal strain divided by fiber strain (Œµx / Œµf), greater than one and longitudinal velocity amplification; furthermore, this emergent velocity amplification may be augmented by variable architectural gearing via mesolateral and dorsoventral shape changes, a pattern seen in pennate muscle contractions. A red-to-white gearing ratio (red Œµf / white Œµf) captures the combined effect of the longitudinal red muscle fiber and oblique white muscle fiber strains. Buoyancy alt=Photo of white bladder that consists of a rectangular section and a banana-shaped section connectd by a much thinner element alt=Photo of shark surrounded by school of other fish The body of a fish is denser than water, so fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fishes have an internal organ called a swim bladder, or gas bladder, that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases. In this way, fish can stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. The bladder is only found in bony fishes. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, bichirs and lungfish, the bladder is open to the esophagus and double as a lung. It is often absent in fast swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel families. The condition of a bladder open to the esophagus is called physostome, the closed condition physoclist. In the latter, the gas content of the bladder is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels effecting gas exchange between the bladder and the blood. In some fish, a rete mirabile fills the swim bladder with oxygen. A countercurrent exchange system is utilized between the venous and arterial capillaries. By lowering the pH levels in the venous capillaries, oxygen unbinds from blood hemoglobin. This causes an increase in venous blood oxygen concentration, allowing the oxygen to diffuse through the capillary membrane and into the arterial capillaries, where oxygen is still sequestered to hemoglobin. The cycle of diffusion continues until the concentration of oxygen in the arterial capillaries is supersaturated (larger than the concentration of oxygen in the swim bladder). At this point, the free oxygen in the arterial capillaries diffuses into the swim bladder via the gas gland.Kardong, K. (2008). Vertebrates: Comparative anatomy, function, evolution, (5th ed.). Boston: McGraw-Hill. Unlike bony fish, sharks do not have gas-filled swim bladders for buoyancy. Instead, sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains squalene, and their cartilage, which is about half the normal density of bone. Their liver constitutes up to 30% of their total body mass. The liver's effectiveness is limited, so sharks employ dynamic lift to maintain depth when not swimming. Sand tiger sharks store air in their stomachs, using it as a form of swim bladder. Most sharks need to constantly swim in order to breathe and cannot sleep very long without sinking (if at all). However, certain species, like the nurse shark, are capable of pumping water across their gills, allowing them to rest on the ocean bottom. Sensory systems Most fish possess highly developed sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision that is at least as good as a human's (see vision in fishes). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Sharks can sense frequencies in the range of 25 to 50 Hz through their lateral line. Fish orient themselves using landmarks and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Fish behavior in mazes reveals that they possess spatial memory and visual discrimination. Vision Vision is an important sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes are similar to those of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rod cells and cone cells (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well- developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots.N. A. Campbell and J. B. Reece (2005). Biology, Seventh Edition. Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco, California. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment. Hearing Hearing is an important sensory system for most species of fish. Hearing threshold and the ability to localize sound sources are reduced underwater, in which the speed of sound is faster than in air. Underwater hearing is by bone conduction, and localization of sound appears to depend on differences in amplitude detected by bone conduction. Aquatic animals such as fish, however, have a more specialized hearing apparatus that is effective underwater. Fish can sense sound through their lateral lines and their otoliths (ears). Some fishes, such as some species of carp and herring, hear through their swim bladders, which function rather like a hearing aid. Hearing is well-developed in carp, which have the Weberian organ, three specialized vertebral processes that transfer vibrations in the swim bladder to the inner ear. Although it is hard to test sharks' hearing, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can possibly hear prey many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost. Chemoreception The shape of the alt=Eyelevel photo of hammerhead from the front Sharks have keen olfactory senses, located in the short duct (which is not fused, unlike bony fish) between the anterior and posterior nasal openings, with some species able to detect as little as one part per million of blood in seawater. Sharks have the ability to determine the direction of a given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each nostril.The Function of Bilateral Odor Arrival Time Differences in Olfactory Orientation of Sharks , Jayne M. Gardiner, Jelle Atema, Current Biology - 13 July 2010 (Vol. 20, Issue 13, pp. 1187-1191) This is similar to the method mammals use to determine direction of sound. They are more attracted to the chemicals found in the intestines of many species, and as a result often linger near or in sewage outfalls. Some species, such as nurse sharks, have external barbels that greatly increase their ability to sense prey. Magnetoception Electroreception alt=Drawing of shark head. Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt.Albert, J.S., and W.G.R. Crampton. 2005. Electroreception and electrogenesis. pp. 431‚Äì472 in The Physiology of Fishes, 3rd Edition. D.H. Evans and J.B. Claiborne (eds.). CRC Press. Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication. In sharks, the ampullae of Lorenzini are electroreceptor organs. They number in the hundreds to thousands. Sharks use the ampullae of Lorenzini to detect the electromagnetic fields that all living things produce. This helps sharks (particularly the hammerhead shark) find prey. The shark has the greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal. Sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting the electric fields they produce. Ocean currents moving in the magnetic field of the Earth also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation. * The ampullae of Lorenzini allow sharks to sense electrical discharges. * Electric fish are able to produce electric fields by modified muscles in their body. Pain Experiments done by William Tavolga provide evidence that fish have pain and fear responses. For instance, in Tavolga's experiments, toadfish grunted when electrically shocked and over time they came to grunt at the mere sight of an electrode.Dunayer, Joan, \\"Fish: Sensitivity Beyond the Captor's Grasp,\\" The Animals' Agenda, July/August 1991, pp. 12‚Äì18 In 2003, Scottish scientists at the University of Edinburgh and the Roslin Institute concluded that rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated with pain in other animals. Bee venom and acetic acid injected into the lips resulted in fish rocking their bodies and rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks, which the researchers concluded were attempts to relieve pain, similar to what mammals would do.Vantressa Brown, \\"Fish Feel Pain, British Researchers Say,\\" Agence France-Presse, 1 May 2003 Neurons fired in a pattern resembling human neuronal patterns. Professor James D. Rose of the University of Wyoming claimed the study was flawed since it did not provide proof that fish possess \\"conscious awareness, particularly a kind of awareness that is meaningfully like ours\\". Rose argues that since fish brains are so different from human brains, fish are probably not conscious in the manner humans are, so that reactions similar to human reactions to pain instead have other causes. Rose had published a study a year earlier arguing that fish cannot feel pain because their brains lack a neocortex.James D. Rose, Do Fish Feel Pain? , 2002. Retrieved 27 September 2007. However, animal behaviorist Temple Grandin argues that fish could still have consciousness without a neocortex because \\"different species can use different brain structures and systems to handle the same functions.\\" Animal welfare advocates raise concerns about the possible suffering of fish caused by angling. Some countries, such as Germany have banned specific types of fishing, and the British RSPCA now formally prosecutes individuals who are cruel to fish.Leake, J. \\"Anglers to Face RSPCA Check,\\" The Sunday Times ‚Äì Britain, 14 March 2004  Reproductive processes  Oogonia development in teleosts fish varies according to the group, and the determination of oogenesis dynamics allows the understanding of maturation and fertilisation processes. Changes in the nucleus, ooplasm, and the surrounding layers characterize the oocyte maturation process. Postovulatory follicles are structures formed after oocyte release; they do not have endocrine function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the apoptosis of follicular cells. A degenerative process called follicular atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages. Some fish are hermaphrodites, having both testes and ovaries either at different phases in their life cycle or, as in hamlets, have them simultaneously. Over 97% of all known fish are oviparous,Peter Scott: Livebearing Fishes, p. 13. Tetra Press 1997. that is, the eggs develop outside the mother's body. Examples of oviparous fish include salmon, goldfish, cichlids, tuna, and eels. In the majority of these species, fertilisation takes place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their gametes into the surrounding water. However, a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilisation, with the male using some sort of intromittent organ to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female, most notably the oviparous sharks, such as the horn shark, and oviparous rays, such as skates. In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified pelvic fins known as claspers. Marine fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column. The eggs have an average diameter of . The eggs are generally surrounded by the extraembryonic membranes but do not develop a shell, hard or soft, around these membranes. Some fish have thick, leathery coats, especially if they must withstand physical force or desiccation. These type of eggs can also be very small and fragile. File:Oeufs002b,57.pngEgg of lamprey File:Oeufs002b,54.pngEgg of catshark (mermaids' purse) File:Oeufs002b,55.pngEgg of bullhead shark File:Oeufs002b,56.pngEgg of chimaera The newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called larvae. They are usually poorly formed, carry a large yolk sac (for nourishment) and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed metamorphosis) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on zooplankton prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae. In ovoviviparous fish the eggs develop inside the mother's body after internal fertilisation but receive little or no nourishment directly from the mother, depending instead on the yolk. Each embryo develops in its own egg. Familiar examples of ovoviviparous fish include guppies, angel sharks, and coelacanths. Some species of fish are viviparous. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the placenta seen in mammals connecting the mother's blood supply with that of the embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches, splitfins, and lemon shark. Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy, in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. Intrauterine cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the grey nurse shark, but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. In many species of fish, fins have been modified to allow Internal fertilisation. Aquarists commonly refer to ovoviviparous and viviparous fish as livebearers. * Many fish species are hermaphrodites. Synchronous hermaphrodites possess both ovaries and testes at the same time. Sequential hermaphrodites have both types of tissue in their gonads, with one type being predominant while the fish belongs to the corresponding gender. Social behaviour Fish social behaviour called ‚Äòshoaling‚Äô involves a group of fish swimming together. This behaviour is a defence mechanism in the sense that there is safety in large numbers, where chances of being eaten by predators are reduced. Shoaling also increases mating and foraging success. Schooling on the other hand, is a behaviour within the shoal where fish can be seen performing various manoeuvres in a synchronised manner. The parallel swimming is a form of ‚Äòsocial copying‚Äô where fish in the school replicate the direction and velocity of its neighbouring fishes. Experiments done by D.M. Steven, on the shoaling behaviour of fish concluded that during the day, fish had a higher tendency to stay together as a result of a balance between single fish leaving and finding their own direction and the mutual attraction between fishes of the same species. It was found that at night the fish swam noticeably faster however, often singly and in no co-ordination. Groups of two or three could be seen frequently formed although were dispersed after a couple of seconds. Theoretically, the amount of time that a fish stays together in a shoal should represent their cost of staying instead of leaving. A past laboratory experiment done on cyprinids has established that the time budget for social behaviour within a shoal varies proportionally to the quantity of fishes present. This originates from the cost/benefit ratio which changes accordingly with group size, measured by the risk of predation versus food intake. When the cost/benefit ratio is favourable to shoaling behaviour then decisions to stay with a group or join one is favourable. Depending on this ratio, fish will correspondingly decide to leave or stay. Thus, shoaling behaviour is considered to be driven by an individual fish's constant stream of decisions.

' (Praise ye the Lord, all ye of his great armies), BWV1147, ', is a church cantata text by Christian Friedrich Hunold which was performed, most likely in a setting by Johann Sebastian Bach, for the twenty-fourth birthday of Prince Leopold of Anhalt-K√∂then on 10 December 1718. The composition is lost, but its libretto survives in a 1719 print.Work , Lobet den Herrn, alle seine Heerscharen, at Bach Digital website. History Johann Sebastian Bach had been a in K√∂then since 1717. During his employment by Prince Leopold there, which lasted until 1723, he composed mostly secular music. The vocal music he composed in K√∂then nearly exclusively consisted of secular cantatas on librettos by Christian Friedrich Hunold, who published such texts under the pen name Menantes. Bach's secular cantatas of this period are often congratulatory serenatas for occasions such as New Year and the birthday of the Prince. Around his twenty-fourth birthday Prince Leopold hired a number of visiting musicians, including the singers Prese and , as concertmaster and Johann Gottfried Vogler who was engaged at the , the Collegium Musicum and the of Leipzig in the late 1710s.Geck, Martin, translated by John Hargraves (2006). Johann Sebastian Bach: Life and Work. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. , p. 105 These musicians, and Bach, participated in the performance of two cantatas on the Prince's birthday, 10 December 1718: Lobet den Herrn, alle seine Heerscharen at St. Jakobs, and, also on a text by Hunold, the secular cantata Der Himmel dacht auf Anhalts Ruhm und Gl√ºck, BWV 66.1. The music of these cantatas did not survive: they are known through their librettos which were published by Hunold in 1719. Lobet den Herrn, alle seine Heerscharen is the only certain church cantata of Bach's K√∂then period: the court of Anhalt-K√∂then was Calvinist, a denomination known for its aversion to elaborate church music. Ihr wallenden Wolken, BWV 1150, an entirely lost New Year's Day cantata in honor of Prince Leopold, is often grouped with Bach's sacred music, but it may as well have been a secular work.Work , Der Himmel dacht auf Anhalts Ruhm und Gl√ºck (serenata), at Bach Digital website.Higuchi, Ryuichi (1990).

The cantata itself opens with a dictum, : \\"Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.\\" The cantata has six further movements: three recitatives, each of which is followed by an aria.Lobet den Herrn, alle seine Heerscharen: text at Bach Digital website.

Early life Joe Allbritton was born on December 29, 1924, in D'Lo, Mississippi, the sixth of seven children. His family soon relocated to Houston, Texas, where his father owned a small business. Allbritton served in the United States Navy during World War II. He completed his undergraduate degree and law degree from Baylor University, where he was a national champion debater.Notice of death of Joe Allbritton Business After naval service and law school, he borrowed $5,000 to buy land outside Houston, which was later used in the construction of a freeway connecting Houston and Galveston, earning Allbritton a small fortune. He also chaired Houston International Bank, Houston Citizens Bank and University Bankshares. In 1975, he purchased The Washington Star along with its television station and smaller stations in the south. In 1978, he was forced to divest the newspaper. This became the foundation of his company, Allbritton Communications, which includes WJLA-TV, NewsChannel 8, short lived Internet venture TBD, and Politico, now run by his son, Robert Allbritton. From 1981 to 2001, he was chairman of Riggs Bank, when he resigned due to prostate cancer during investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission involving oil money from Equatorial Guinea at the same time that Riggs was facing broader charges of money laundering; his son Robert assumed the chairman position after his resignation; the bank was later purchased by PNC in 2005. Philanthropy Allbritton and his wife, Barbara, were major contributors through to numerous organizations through the Allbritton Foundation. Organizations they donated to including the Baylor College of Medicine, the Allbritton Art Institute, the Oxford Scholars, and the establishment of the International School of Law, which has become the George Mason University School of Law. He sat on the boards of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, to which he donated the official White House portrait of President Reagan. He contributed to Washington National Cathedral, where he was made a Lay canon. Thoroughbred racing Allbritton also made a name for himself in thoroughbred horse racing. In 1991, his 3-year-old horse, Hansel, won two legs of the U.S. Triple Crown series, the Preakness and the Belmont stakes.

These games were chosen by the Museum of Modern Art in order to showcase design elements within them. Fourteen initial games were announced in November 2012, with plans to expand the collection to up to forty games over time, as the museum is able to acquire the display rights for them. Six more games were added to the collection in June 2013, as well a game console. Curated by Paola Antonelli, the collection was included in the exhibition Applied Design in the Philip Johnson Architecture and Design Galleries. In these galleries, around a hundred objects that represent contemporary design were displayed. Most games in the collection are playable on some level and all are displayed in a manner to minimize the influence of nostalgia. Background Pac-Man is placed near the elevator exit, as it was assumed to be one of the most popular games on display. The exhibition stirred up controversy, as video games are not commonly considered art among critics and therefore might not have a place in an art gallery. However, the collection is modeled after Philip Johnson‚Äôs 1934 exhibition \\"Machine Art,\\" in which pieces of machinery such as propeller blades were displayed in a minimalist fashion to lay focus on their mechanical design. This set-up would create a \\"strange distance, this shock, that made people realize how gorgeous formally, and also important functionally, design pieces were,\\" which, according to the exhibit's curator Paola Antonelli, is the desired effect of the exhibition. In order to minimize factors such as nostalgia, the games are displayed in a minimalist fashion where only a screen and controlling-device are visible on an otherwise blank wall. At least one other video game, namely Katamari Damacy, has been displayed in MoMA's design galleries before. The exhibition is part of a movement to include forms beyond traditional media that the Museum of Modern Art began in 2006, starting with digital fonts and later moving on to video games. MoMA has taken cautious care of traffic flow, as this had proved to be an \\"interesting\\" challenge. Games that are likely to be heavily played, such as Pac-Man, have been placed near entrances and exits to assure a constant flow from these games, while games that would require a larger amount of time to play have had a demo version developed for them, so that visitors can beat those and move on. Though the MoMA is mainly interested in acquiring a game's hardware and interface, the proprietary source code is considered the most valued. According to Antonelli, \\"when we cannot acquire the code, we acquire simulations, emulations, the cartridge, the hardware. But what we're interested in showing is the interaction by itself.\\" The collection leans towards the classic era of arcade machines and 8-bit consoles as, during this era, \\"a small number of visionaries laid the groundwork for where we are now.\\" According to Paul Galloway, many early, \\"seemingly simple games remain as vital and compelling today as they were\\" during the 1970s and 80s. Ralph H. Baer's Magnavox Odyssey console was added as it was considered both \\"a masterpiece of engineering and industrial design\\" as well as highly important during the birth of the video game industry. Collection The wave indicates when a game was added to the collection; wave 1 was included on , and wave 2 was included on .

Company history Will Richardson and his wife, who had worked as window-dressers, were given fabric samples by the Rit company, which Will declared he could do better. When challenged by Rit to prove it, Will and Eileen taught themselves in four days to tie-dye, producing a range of fabrics which met with the company's approval. The Richardsons subsequently showed their tie-dyed velvets and chiffons to fashion editors and designers, although with little success until Halston, who admired the technique's \\"limp, sensuous quality\\", placed a $5,000 order. When made up by Halston, Up Tied textiles were worn by the likes of Ali MacGraw, Naomi Sims, and Liza Minnelli. The Richardsons, after less than a year in business, were being called the \\"best tie-dyers in the city\\", namely, New York City where they had a studio near Chinatown, Manhattan, on the floor above the Chinese American Democratic Union. In 1970, they were awarded a Special Coty Award alongside a number of other designers, such as Giorgio di Sant' Angelo, Alexis Kirk and Clifton Nicholson; whose work combined ethnic themes and influences with fine craftsmanship and an appreciation of folk art techniques. Up Tied's use of what was described as an \\"ancient Oriental art\\" of dying textiles fitted in with this theme. For the Coty fashion show, Up Tied's section was modelled by six dancers choreographed by Murray Louis. Along with Halston, the fashion designers Donald Brooks and Gayle Kirkpatrick also used Up Tied fabrics. In 1971, the Richardsons gave a how-to lesson to Look where they demonstrated techniques for creating tie-dye fish and origami patterns upon alongside men's vests to create swimsuit tanks for women, alongside images of military surplus garments which they had customised by dying.

Playing career Congerton is the son of Rhyl player Dave Congerton. While being educated at Rhyl High School he played youth international football for Wales. He signed a semi-professional contract with Rhyl, before a professional trial at Wrexham where he met Brian Flynn. However, realising that he enjoyed coaching more than playing, Congerton signed a semi-professional contract with Colwyn Bay, allowing him to study for a degree. He then spent a spell at Weymouth, before signing a professional contract at Crewe Alexandra. Coaching His career at Crewe was blighted by injuries. It was then that Flynn, by then manager of Wrexham, offered Congerton a coaching position as Youth System Director. After Denis Smith took over as Wrexham manager Congerton joined the coaching team at Liverpool in 2002, before leaving the club in 2005 for Chelsea. At Chelsea, he was initially appointed youth team coach by Jose Mourinho. However, after the appointment of Frank Arnesen as Sporting Director, Congerton was appointed chief scout, alongside Brendan Rodgers as reserve-team coach, and academy manager Neil Bath. The team's purpose was to scout and then coach young players into the first team, which included: Ryan Bertrand; Daniel Sturridge; Gael Kakuta; Jeffrey Bruma; Scott Sinclair and Fabio Borini. The team worked through various Chelsea first team managers, including the appointment of Andre Villas Boas. After the sacking of Villas Boas, the entire sporting and youth team were dismissed. After Arnesen was appointed Sporting Director of Hamburg in 2011, Congerton was appointed Technical Director, working alongside head coach, Thorsten Fink. In October 2012, West Bromwich Albion approached Hamburg to request to appoint Congerton to replace their former Technical Director Dan Ashworth; this was immediately turned down by Hamburger SV. On 12 March 2014, Sunderland appointed Congerton as their Sporting Director. On 15 March 2017, Celtic appointed Congerton as their Head of Recruitment.

The principle behind such a structure is that if enough input is provided by multiple types of actors involved in a question, the eventual consensual decision gains more legitimacy, and can be more effectively implemented than a traditional state- based response. While the evolution of multistakeholder governance is occurring principally at the international level, public-private partnerships (PPPs) are domestic analogues. Stakeholders refer to a collection of actors from different social, political, economic spheres working intentionally together to govern a physical, social, economic, or policy area. The range of actors can include multinational corporations, national enterprises, governments, civil society bodies, academic experts, community leaders, religious figures, media personalities and other institutional groups. At a minimum a multistakeholder group must have two or more actors from different social, political, or economic groups. If not, then the group is a trade association (all business groups), a multilateral body (all governments), a professional body (all scholars), etc. Almost all multistakeholder bodies have at least one multinational corporation or business-affiliated body and at least one civil society organization or alliance of civil society organizations as key members. Alternative terminologies for multistakeholder governance include multi-stakeholder initiatives(MSIs)Utting, P. (2001). \\"Regulating Business Via Multistakeholder Initiatives: A Preliminary Assessment.\\" (Paper prepared in late 2001 under the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) research project \\"Promoting Corporate Environmental and Social Responsibility in Developing Countries: The Potential and Limits of Voluntary Initiatives\\".)

Multi- stakeholder Processes for Governance and Sustainability: Beyond Deadlock and Conflict. London: Earthscan., public-private partnerships (PPPs), transnational multistakeholder Partnerships (transnational MSPs), informal governance arrangements, and non-state regulation. The key term 'multistakeholder' (or 'multistakeholderism') is increasingly spelled without a hyphen to maintain consistency with its predecessor 'multilateralism' and to associate this new form of governance with one of the key actors involved that is also generally spelled without a hyphen; 'multinationals'. 'Multistakeholderism' is similarly used in parallel to bilateralism and regionalism. As an evolving global governance form, only a limited number of organizations and institutions are involved in multistakeholderism. In a number of arenas, opposing forces are actively challenging the legitimacy, accountability, and effectiveness of these experimental changes in global governance. Contemporary history and theory Stakeholder management theory, stakeholder project management theory, and stakeholder government agency theory have all contributed to the intellectual foundation for multistakeholder governance. The history and theory of multistakeholder governance however departs from these models in four ways. The earlier theories describe how a central institution (be it a business, a project, or a government agency) should engage more formally with related institutions (be it other organizations, institutions, or communities). In multistakeholder governance, the central element of multistakeholder undertaking is a public concern (e.g. protection of the climate, management of the internet, or the use of natural resources), not a pre-existing organization. Second, the earlier theories aimed to strengthen a pre-existing institution. In multistakeholder governance, multistakeholder groups can strengthen associated institutions but they can also marginalize institutions or functions of existing governance bodies (e.g. governmental regulatory authorities, UN system). As earlier theories were concerned with improving the operations of corporations and project management, they did not need to address the public governance consequences of multistakeholder decision-making. They also provide little or no guidance to autonomous multistakeholder groups on their internal rules of governance, as the pre-existing institution had its own functioning decision-making system. As multistakeholderism is an evolving system of governance, a good deal of its theoretical underpinning is a combination of formal theoretical writing and theory-derived from practice. The most extensive theoretical writing and most detailed practical proposals comes from the World Economic Forum's Global Redesign Initiative (GRI). Contribution of the World Economic Forum's Global Redesign Initiative The 600 page report \\"Everybody's Business: Strengthening International Cooperation in a More Interdependent World\\"WEF (2010). \\"Everybody‚Äôs Business: Strengthening International Cooperation in a More Interdependent World\\" Retrieved from report is a comprehensive proposal for re-designing global governance. The report seeks to change in fundamental ways the global governance system built since World War II. The report is a series of broad policy papers on multistakeholder governance authored by the leadership of the World Economic Forum and a broad array of theme-specific policy options. These policy and thematic program recommendations were designed to display the new governance structure's ability to respond to a range of global crisesHarris Gleckman (2012). \\"Readers' Guide: Global Redesign Initiative\\". University of Massachusetts Boston. Retrieved from . These global policy areas include investment flows; educational systems; systemic financial risk; philanthropy and social investing; emerging multinationals; fragile states; social entrepreneurship; energy security; international security cooperation; mining and metals; the future of government; ocean governance; and ethical values. What sets the World Economic Forum's proposal apart is that it was developed as a cooperative effort involving 750 experts from the international business, governmental, and academic communities working in sixty separate task forces for one and a half years (2009/2010). WEF also had over fifty years' experience convening leading stakeholders from the political, economic, cultural, civil society, religious, and other communities to discuss the way forward in global affairs. As the three co-chairs observed in their introduction to the GRI report: \\"The time has come for a new stakeholder paradigm of international governance analogous to that embodied in the stakeholder theory of corporate governance on which the World Economic Forum itself was founded.\\" This process of explicit theoretical writings combined with theory derived from practice has occurred also in the UN system, in independent self-standing global commissions, in debates on the governance of the internet, and in non-state private ethical and environmental standard setting bodies. Contributions of intergovernmental bodies in the UN system The United Nations effort to develop multistakeholder governance is widely regarded to have started with the 1992 U.N. Conference on Environment and Development (more commonly known at the Rio Conference). There, governments created nine major non-state groups which could be part of the official intergovernmental process. Ten years later in Johannesburg the follow up conference created a new multistakeholder implementation process called officially \\"type II conference outcomes,\\" where transnational corporations, NGOs, and governments pledged to work together to implement a specific section of the conference report Type II Partnerships. A separate government effort to define multistakeholder governance has been a series of United Nations General Assembly resolutions on 'partnerships'. The earliest resolution (2002) drew \\"the attention of Member States to multi-stakeholder initiatives, in particular, the Global Compact Initiative of the Secretary-General, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, the multi-stakeholder dialogue process of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the Information and Communication Technologies Task Force\\"United Nations. (2002). Resolution adopted by the General Assembly: Towards global partnerships. General Assembly, 56th Session. Retrieved from refworld.org. Over the next 17 years, the governments at the United Nations continued to evolve their understanding of multistakeholder governance by adopting eight other related resolutions. In the most recent partnership resolution (2019), governments identified a number of principles that should define a multistakeholder partnership. Governments ‚Äústresse[d] ...[A partnership should have a] common purpose, transparency, bestowing no unfair advantages upon any partner of the United Nations, mutual benefit and mutual respect, accountability, respect for the modalities of the United Nations, striving for balanced representation of relevant partners from developed and developing countries and countries with economies in transition, and not compromising the independence and neutrality of the United Nations system in general and the agencies in particular\\"United Nations. (2018). Towards global partnerships: a principle-based approach to enhanced cooperation between the United Nations and all relevant partners. General Assembly, 73rd Session. Retrieved from www.unglobalcompact.org. In the same resolution, government further defined the 'common purpose' and 'mutual benefit and respect' as voluntary partnerships and as \\"collaborative relationships between various parties, both public and non-public, in which all participants agree to work together to achieve a common purpose or undertake a specific task and, as mutually agreed, to share risks and responsibilities, resources and benefits\\"United Nations. (2019). Towards global partnerships: a principle-based approach to enhanced cooperation between the United Nations and all relevant partners. General Assembly. Retrieved from www.un.org. Contributions of civil society organizations involved in the UN system Civil society organizations have had a series of parallel but distinct exchanges on the theory and practice of multistakeholder governance. Two elements of the definition of multistakeholder governance that are not central to the intergovernmental debate are (1) the connection between democracy and multistakeholder governance and (2) the assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of multistakeholder projects. Dodds, a founder of the Stakeholder Forum, argues that \\"involving stakeholders in the decision- making process makes them more likely to partner with each other and with governments at all levels to help deliver on the commitments associated with [intergovernmentally adopted] agreements\\"Dodds, F. 2019 Stakeholder Democracy: Represented Democracy in a Time of Fear, London, Routledge. In this perspective, the evolution of multistakeholder governance marks a positive transformation from representative democracy to participatory stakeholder- based democracy. The Transnational Institute (TNI) in Amsterdam report on multistakeholderismBuxton, N. (2019). Multistakeholderism : a critical Look. TNI, Workshop Report, Amsterdam, March 2019. Retrieved from www.tni.org takes a different perspective. It considers that democracy is at great risk from multistakeholder governance. TNI sees the lack of a legitimate public selection process for 'stakeholders'; the inherent power imbalance between categories of 'stakeholders', particularly transnational corporations and community groups; and the intrusion of business interests in formal international decision-making as counter to the development of a globally representative democratic system. Gleckman, an associate of TNI and a senior fellow at the Center for Governance and Sustainability, UMass-Boston, advances other arguments on the inherently un-democratic character of multistakeholder governanceGleckman, H. (2018). Multistakeholder Governance and Democracy: A Global Challenge. New York, NY: Routledge. Contributions of international commissions The 1991-1994 Commission on Global Governance The Commission on Global Governance, under the leadership of Ingvar Carlsson of Sweden and Shridath Ramphal of Guyana, issued its recommendations in the report \\"Our Global Neighbourhood\\" in 1995, the 2003-2007 Helsinki Process on Globalisation and DemocracyThe Helsinki Process, under the leadership of the Foreign Ministers of Finland and Tanzania issued their final report under the title \\"A Case for Multi-Stakeholder Cooperation\\" in 2008. , and the 1998-2001 World Commission on Dams each addressed the evolution of the concept of multistakeholderism as a force in global governance. For example, The World Commission on Dams (WCD) was established in 1998 as a global multistakeholder body by the World Bank and the World Conservation Union (IUCN) in response to growing opposition to large dam projects. The twelve Commission members came from a variety of backgrounds, representing a broad spectrum of interests in large dams ‚Äì including governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), dam operators and grassroots people's movements, corporations and academics, industry associations and consultantsKhagram, S.

In WCD's final report, the chair Professor Kader Asmal described the Commissioners' views about multistakeholder governance. He wrote \\"We are a Commission to heal the deep and self-inflicted wounds torn open wherever and whenever far too few determine for far too many how best to develop or use water and energy resources. That is often the nature of power, and the motivation of those who question it. Most recently governments, industry and aid agencies have been challenged around the world for deciding the destiny of millions without including the poor, or even popular majorities of countries they believe to be helping. To confer legitimacy on such epochal decisions, real development must be people centred, while respecting the role of the state as mediating, and often representing, their interests...we do not endorse globalisation as led from above by a few men. We do endorse globalisation as led from below by all, a new approach to global water policy and development\\"World Commission on Dams (2000). Dams and Development: A New Framework for Decision Making. Earthscan Publications, London, England and Sterling, Virginia. Contributions of key parties in internet governance The role of multistakeholder processes in internet governance dominated the 2003-2005 World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). However the summit failed to address the digital divide to the satisfaction of developing countriesShawn M. Powers and Michael Jablonksi, The Real Cyberwar, University of Illinois Press (2015), p. 42, citing Milton M. Mueller, Networks and States, MIT Press (2010, 2013). The final outcome of the Summit, the Tunis Agenda (2005), enshrined a particular type of multistakeholder model for Internet governance, in which, at the urging of the United States, the key function of administration and management of naming and addressing was delegated to the private sector (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, ICANN)Shawn M. Powers and Michael Jablonksi, The Real Cyberwar, University of Illinois Press (2015), p. 46. This US policy of using multistakeholder processes in effect to favor privatization of functions that had been traditionally performed by government agencies was well expressed in a 2015 statement by Julie Napier Zoller, a senior official in the US Department of State's Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs. She argued that \\"Every meeting that is enriched by multistakeholder participation serves as an example and a precedent that opens doors for multistakeholder participation in future meetings and fora.\\"Julie Zoller.

Retrieved from www.isoc-ny.org Definition of a 'stakeholder' for multistakeholder governance There are generally accepted definitions for 'stakeholder' in management theory and generally accepted processes for selecting 'stakeholders' in project management theory . However there are no commonly accepted definition of 'stakeholder' and no generally recognized process to designate 'stakeholders' in multistakeholder governance. In a democracy, there is only one elemental category for public decision-making, the 'citizen'. Unlike the concept of 'citizen' in democratic governance theory, the concept of 'stakeholder' in multistakeholder governance theory and practice remains unsettled and ambiguous. In multistakeholder governance, there are three tiers of 'stakeholder' definitions: (1) the definition of the 'stakeholder category' (e.g. business); (2) the definition or the specification for selecting organizations or institutions within a 'stakeholder category' (e.g. micro-enterprises or women-owned businesses); and (3) the definition or the specification for selecting an individual person to represent a designated organization or institution within a stakeholder category (e.g. the CEO, the external affairs officer, or a professional staff member). In practice it is not uncommon for the founders of a multistakeholder groups to select a key individual to be a member of a multistakeholder group and then retroactively classify that individual and/or the individual's organization into an appropriate definitional category. Multiple definitions of categories of stakeholders within the UN system At the United Nations Rio conference in 1992, governments formally accepted nine Major Groups as 'stakeholder' categories. The designated Major Groups were Women, Children and Youth, Indigenous Peoples, Non-Governmental Organizations, Local Authorities, Workers and Trade Unions, Business and Industry, Scientific and Technological Community, and Farmers. Two decades later, the importance of effectively engaging these nine sectors of society was reaffirmed by the Rio+20 Conference. However that conference added other stakeholders, including local communities, volunteer groups and foundations, migrants and families, as well as older persons and persons with disabilities. Subsequently, governments also added as stakeholders United Nations. (2012).

Their 'Participants' category however includes a wide variety of social actors: (a) UN agencies and bodies, (b) civil society and non-governmental organizations and their networks, (c) international agricultural research systems, (d) international and regional financial institutions and (e) representatives of private sector associations and (f) private philanthropic foundations. Multiple definitions of categories of stakeholders outside the UN system (selected examples) Unlike the multiple definitions inside the UN system, the definition of stakeholder categories for autonomous multistakeholder groups are generally versions of \\"interest-based\\" definitions. The ISO defines a stakeholder individual or group \\"as one that has an interest in any decision or activity of an organization\\" (ISO 26000). Hemmati, a co-founder of the MSP Institute, a multistakeholder support organization, defines stakeholders as \\"those who have an interest in a particular decision, either as individuals or representatives of a group. This includes people who influence a decision, or can influence it, as well as those affected by it Hemmati, M., Minu, Dodds, F., Enayati. J., and McHarry, J. (2012). Multi-stakeholder Processes for Governance and Sustainability: Beyond Deadlock and Conflict, London: Earthscan, Box 1.1 STAKEHOLDERS.. The trade association of international environmental and social standard setting bodies, ISEAL, defines stakeholder groups as those \\"that are likely to have an interest in the standard or that are likely to be affected by its implementation, and provides them with mechanisms for participation that are appropriate and accessible.\\"ISEAL. (2014). Setting Social and Environmental Standards: ISEAL Code of Good Practice\\" Version 6.0. Retrieved from www.isealalliance.org Multiple definitions used to select organizations within individual stakeholder categories There is also no consistent definition or selection process to define the individual organization(s) that may \\"represent\\" a given category of stakeholders in a given multistakeholder group. For example, the 'government' category can involve government offices at the national, regional, county/provincial and municipal levels, regional inter-government organizations (e.g. European Commission, Organization of American States), intergovernmental secretariats (e.g. FAO, WHO) or include members of parliaments, regulatory bodies, technical experts in specific government departments and courts. The 'civil society' category could similarly involve non-state organizations at the international, regional and national levels, social movements, religious bodies, professional associations, development organizations, humanitarian groups or environmental NGOs. The 'business' stakeholder category could mean multinational corporations, medium-sized national enterprises, small- and micro- local businesses, business trade associations at the international, national, or local level; businesses from developing countries, minority own businesses, women-owned enterprises or green global businesses. When 'academics' are a stakeholder category, the category members could be social scientists, physicists, philosophers, environmental experts, professors of religion, lawyers, university administrators, or a professional association affiliated with scholarly work. Variety of definitions and procedures to select individuals to \\"represent\\" their designated stakeholder organization within a designated category Each organization designated to \\"represent\\" a stakeholder category can use its own method to select an individual to participate in a stakeholder group. Having an individual from a given organization participate in the leadership of a multistakeholder group does not necessary mean that the sponsoring organization (be it a business, civil society organization or a government) is itself on board. The participation of any given individual may only mean that a particular office or department has chosen to work with that multistakeholder group. The individual involved may have been granted permission to liaise with a given multistakeholder group, provided leave to participate in their personal, professional capacity, or formally designated to represent a specific organization. This ambiguity between commitment of the institution as a whole and the participation of a representative of a specific office or agency can affect a number of different roles inside and outside the multistakeholder group. The multistakeholder group may well appreciate being able to assert publicly that x governments or y transnational corporations are part of the multistakeholder group in order to garner greater political- economic recognition. Internally the other participants may believe that the institutional capacities and financial resources of the parent organization may be available to meet the goals of the multistakeholder groupGleckman, Harris 2018 Multistakeholder Governance and Democracy: A Global Challenge, Routledge, London. Uniquely governance issues in the use of the term 'stakeholder' There is no on-going international effort to standardize the core multistakeholder governance concept of 'stakeholder', nor any international efforts to standardize the procedure for designating an organization or an individual within any given stakeholder category. Unlike the use of 'stakeholder' in management theory and project management theory, there are a number of demographic, political, and social factors that can impact the use of the 'stakeholder' concept in governance. Among the identified issues are (a) the difficulty in balancing gender, class, ethnicity, and geographic representation in any given multistakeholder group; (b) the potential conflicts of interests between 'business' stakeholders and their commercial markets; (c) the asymmetric power of different categories of stakeholders and different organizations representing stakeholder categories within a multistakeholder group; and (d) the lack of a review structure or judicial mechanism to appeal the selection of stakeholder categories, stakeholder organizations within a category, or the selection of the person to represent a stakeholder organization.  Types of multistakeholder governance groups  Multistakeholder governance arrangements are being used - or are being proposed to be used - to address a wide range of global, regional, and national challenges. These governance challenges, often ones that have a significant political, economic, or security impact can be categorized as the following - (1) those involving the formulation of public policies with minimal or marginal government participation; (2) those involved in setting market-governing standards that were previously a state function; and (3) those involved in implementing large-scale projects, often large-scale infrastructure projects, with government participation.  Policy-oriented multistakeholder governance groups  Policy-oriented multistakeholder governance groups are used to address an international policy issue. These groups tend to arise when global actors believe a policy intervention is necessary but governments or intergovernmental organizations are unwilling or unable to resolve a policy matter. Most multistakeholder governance groups meet independently of multilateral organizations, while some may include the multilateral system for their endorsement or support Gleckman, H. (2018). Multistakeholder Governance and Democracy: A Global Challenge. New York, NY: Routledge.. Examples of policy-oriented multistakeholder governance groups: * World Economic Forum's Global Futures Councils https://www.weforum.org/communities/global-future-councils Global Agenda Councils * World Commission on Dams * Kimberley Process Certification Scheme * Renewable Policy Network for the 21st Century * Global Partnership for Oceans  Product, finance and process-oriented multistakeholder groups  Product, finance and process-oriented multistakeholder groups are organizations that set standards for internationally traded products and processes and/or provide financing with a multistakeholder board. For products, the goal is to facilitate ethical, environmental, and development- friendly products that are desired by consumers and beneficial for producers, manufacturers and retailers. Processes refer to new, rapidly evolving, complex and high impact technologies on the international market that lack domestic standards or regulatory oversight. The multistakeholder groups determine how the processes can best function internationally between competing commercial interests. These groups work with social justice civil society organizations, academic and government bodies to resolve conflicts and plan a path forward. Unlike traditional philanthropic organizations, finance-oriented multistakeholder groups operate with a governing body that explicitly designates individuals to \\"represent\\" the views of specific stakeholder categories. Examples of product-oriented multistakeholder groups: * Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) * Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) * Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) * Global Coffee Platform (GCP) * GoodWeave * Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) * Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) * Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) * Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance Examples of process-oriented multistakeholder groups: * ICANN * Fairtrade International (FLO) * FramingNano Project * Global Partnership for Business and Biodiversity * Carnegie Climate Geoengineering Governance Initiative * Internet Governance Forum (IGF) Examples of finance-oriented multistakeholder groups: * GAVI, The Vaccine Alliance * CGIAR (formerly the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research)  Project- oriented multistakeholder groups  Project-oriented multistakeholder groups accomplish global or national tasks that governments or the multilateral system are unable to accomplish. Global project-oriented groups accomplish governance goals implemented by the multilateral system. National project- oriented groups address a public need that the relevant government is not able to fulfill. These may operate on the local, state, or national level. Project- oriented multistakeholder groups are frequently called public-private partnerships (PPP). Examples of global project-oriented groups: * Alliance for Water Stewardship * Roll Back Malaria * Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh * Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition * The Global Polio Eradication Initiative * The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria * Sustainable Energy for All Examples of where national project- oriented groups may act: * Recreation areas * Transportation infrastructure * High-speed internet infrastructure * Supply of municipal drinking water Relationship of multistakeholderism with Multilateral system Different parts of the multilateral system are involved in different ways with all three types of multistakeholder groups. These include multistakeholder bodies which are called for by an intergovernmental body (e.g. goal 17 of SDGs); multistakeholder bodies organized by and legally dependent on the secretariat of the UN system itself (e.g. Global Compact); multistakeholder bodies which offer to financially support certain UN goals and projects; UN affiliated project development organizations which regard multistakeholder implementation as more effective and efficient than state or UN system implementation; non-UN sponsored multistakeholder bodies which formally align themselves with the UN system (e.g. WEF strategic partnership) and non-UN sponsored multistakeholder bodies where UN system staff are allowed to serve in their personal, professional capacities. On the other hand, some multistakeholder bodies are intentionally independent of the UN system. This form of disengagement from the UN system was formulated by the Global Redesign Initiative as ‚Äòplurilateral, often multi-stakeholder, coalitions of the willing and able‚Äù to work outside the intergovernmental framework WEF (2010). \\"Everybody‚Äôs Business: Strengthening International Cooperation in a More Interdependent World\\" Building Block Three.

Examples of this practice are multistakeholder bodies which explicitly seek autonomy from legally binding state regulations and the soft law of the intergovernmental system (e.g internet governance); standard setting multistakeholder bodies, which perceive that the UN system failed to address their concerns, consequently elect to operate without UN system engagementForest Stewardship Council; and international multistakeholder funding sources which opt to be independent of the relevant intergovernmental process (e.g. GAVI). Finally some multistakeholder bodies want to disengage from the UN system in their day to day activities but seek UN intergovernmental endorsement of the outcome of the autonomous arrangements (e.g. Kimberley Process Certification Scheme). i. Multilateral institutions‚Äô views of multistakeholder processes and governance As an evolving global governance system, different parts of the UN system describe the importance of multistakeholderism in different ways.

By far however the greatest number of TNCs that engage with multistakeholderism are those that participate in project-focused, public-private partnerships (PPP) at the national and international levels. These TNCs and related national enterprises can use the PPP form to address both state-failures to address a given social-economic- environmental need and to gain state-approval for the privatization of a given sector or region of an economy. These shifts in role of the business sector alters long standing public-private distinctions and, as such, has implications for global and national democratic decision-making. Civil society organizations / NGOs / social movements One of the drivers for the creation of civil society organizations (CSOs), non-governmental organizations or social movements is to be autonomous from governments and commercial interests. With the advent of multistakeholder governance, some institutions have intentionally shifted from this autonomous position in order to further specific institutional goals; others have joined multistakeholder groups, particularly PPPs, out of an anxiety of being cut off from crucial decisions, while the majority of these organizations remain autonomous of governments and commercial interests and unconnected with multistakeholder groups. In the first case, some CSOs have been founders of international standard setting bodies in partnership with a sector-specific TNCs and national enterprises Marine Stewardship Council; have joined high level multistakeholder policy groups WEF(n.d). Global Future Councils. Retrieved from ; participated with multistakeholder groups convened to implement UN system goals (e.g. SDG goal 17U.N. (n.d). Sustainable Development Goal 17. Sustainable Development Goals Knowledge Platform. Retrieved from ); and have joined international monitoring multistakeholder initiatives Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. In the second case, CSOs which have been confronted with the creation of a powerful PPP feel that non-participation would leave them at a severe local disadvantage; other CSOs would prefer that a government or the UN system would address a given topic and see no other way to set standards for that section (e.g. Global Coffee Platformhttps://www.globalcoffeeplatform.org/accelerate- your-coffee-sustainability). In the third case, CSOs, NGOs, and social movements have taken positive steps to dissuade governments, TNCs, and other CSOs, NGOs and social movements to not participate in multistakeholder groups need; some of these organizations have appealed to the UN Secretary General to withdraw from partnerships with multistakeholder bodiesTNI (2019). ‚ÄúEnd the United Nations/World Economic Forum Partnership Agreement.‚Äù Retrieved from . Governments, particularly policy making bodies, regulatory agencies, and infrastructure offices Some governments engage with multistakeholderism to develop public policies or to avoid developing public policies. These governments, or more precisely parts of governments, have supported multistakeholder groups that address complex public policy issues Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, have chosen to address sensitive intergovernmental issues without the involvement of the UN system Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, and have chosen to address para-military issues without the involvement of the UN system (e.g. International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers). Governments are not uniform in their use of multistakeholder bodies for policy making. In several cases, some governments use multistakeholderism as a public policy mechanism. On that same public policy issue, other governments oppose the use of multitakeholderism, preferring instead to consider an issue though multilateral or bilateral arrangements. The two clearest examples are internet governance and private international standard-setting bodies which operate without developing country participation (UNCTAD's Forum on Sustainability Standards). In the case of internet governance the major private actors in this area seek to have little or no engagement with governments. Governments all have product standard-setting regulatory institutions. Multistakeholderism presents an opportunity to have an alternative arrangement that shifts the process of formulating and monitoring standards to a multistakeholder body and shifts the standards from obligatory to voluntary. Examples of this use of multistakeholder groups by governments include opting to follow the advice of expert-based multistakeholder groups rather than establish separate expert government-based organizations IUCN Red List, welcoming efforts to have multistakeholder standards set by TNCs and civil society to avoid conflicts with home-country TNCs and other businesses (e.g. Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh) and supporting voluntary private standard setting for un- and under-governed spaces (e.g. oceans). Many of these cases represent an indirect privatization of public services and goods. Other governments or parts of government actively participate in project-based public-private partnerships. In PPP, governments agree to grant dejura or de facto governance over a natural resource (i.e. access public water) or the area around an infrastructure project to a given multistakeholder group. The degree of control explicitly or implicitly transferred to the PPP and the extent that the initial expectations for operations and prices are not met has become a contentious governance issue. Academy and professional associations While over 250 academics assisted the WEF in developing their Global Redesign InitiativeUniversity of Boston Massachusetts (2012). Experts Groups by Constituency. Center for Governance and Sustainability. Retrieved from , most members of the academic community and most professional associations are not involved with multistakeholder groups. Those academics that are involved in multistakeholder groups tend to participate in policy making multistakeholder groups or the development of international product and process standard setting. Some university-based experts join business-oriented multistakeholder bodies in a similar manner to joining the corporate boards of individual firms. However, unlike providing their expertise to a business as consultants or board member, scholars on the board of a multistakeholder governance organization, particularly ones that sets international product or process standards, have moved from an advisor and investor role to one that is functionally similar to a state regulatory official. In some cases, university faculty are recruited by major firms or governments to create an academic- business-governmental organization to open new markets for that business or those in their sector health care group. In other cases, multistakeholder groups and universities co-host multistakeholder events and research projects Kansas State University (2019). 9th Multistakeholder Partnership Meeting: Innovation for Sustainable Livestock Systems.

The association delivered education and programs focused on prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and support for all impacted by stroke.  History  National Stroke Association was formed in 1984 as a nonprofit healthcare organization focusing 100 percent of its resources on stroke. The organization is based in Centennial, Colorado. In 2006, the Annals of Neurology published National Stroke Association‚Äôs guidelines for the management of transient ischemic attacks. The final recommendations concluded that a TIA patient needs urgent evaluation and treatment. In 2019, the National Stroke Association announced that it would be dissolved and its activities folded into the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association.  Activities  The organization offered a variety of programs focused on informing the public about strokes, and supporting the victims of stroke and their caregivers. Careliving was an online social network targeting caregivers of stroke survivors, making information and resources available to them. NSA offered a series of webinars, called iHope, which were tailored to assist stroke survivors and caregivers by equipping them with the knowledge to take an active role in their post-stroke recovery. The Stroke Advocacy Network provided a venue for stroke survivors, caregivers and other stroke champions to communicate directly with elected officials. To raise awareness of the condition, the NSA initiated several campaigns. Faces of Stroke was launched in 2011 to show the personal side of strokes, featuring victims of stroke and their families. It highlighted the symptoms of stroke, and featured some celebrity spokespeople such as Henry Winkler. The organization, along with the American Heart Association spearheaded the efforts to have May declared \\"National Stroke Awareness Month\\", which was accomplished when President George H.W. Bush signed an official proclamation in May 1989. In 2011 the NSA instituted the \\"Raising Awareness in Stroke Excellence Awards\\" (RAISE), which recognize groups and individuals for their efforts to raise awareness about stroke.  Publications  National Stroke Association offered subscriptions to various publications designed to maintain an ongoing conversation about stroke. StrokeSmart was a free publication which reached 270,000 people in the United States, filled with real-life stories of people impacted by stroke. The magazine updated readers on new science and helpful products and tips for recovery and lifestyle, as well as stroke survivor and caregiver experiences. In 2013, the magazine was redesigned and launched a new website. Brain Alert was a free monthly e-newsletter designed to keep stroke survivors, caregivers and healthcare professionals up to date on stroke news and information. Get Involved was a free bi-monthly e-newsletter designed to keep stroke survivors, caregivers and healthcare professionals informed about ways to be active against stroke. And the organization also produced The Professional Education Newsletter, a free monthly e-newsletter designed to keep healthcare professionals interested in stroke updated on educational offerings and important news from National Stroke Association.

Panama was the first state of The Americas on recognizing the SADR in July 1978, formal diplomatic relations were established on 1 June 1979. A Sahrawi embassy (the first on the American continent) was opened in Panama City in 1980, during the Aristides Royo government. Chronology On 27 June 2007, President of the SADR Mohamed Abdelaziz received the press- attach√© of the Foreign Minister of Panama. In 2009, the Inter-Parliamentary Friendship Group was established for the exchange of legislative experience. On 4 June 2009, Ali Mahamud Embarek presented his credentials as the new Ambassador of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in Panama. On 17 March 2010, Vice President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and the Sahrawi Delegate Minister in Charge of Latin America Hash Ahmed signed a cultural and educational cooperation convention, giving Sahrawi students and professionals the opportunity of travelling to Panama to make advanced, specialized and grade studies. In September 2011, the Foreign Minister of Panama Roberto Henriquez while meeting the SADR Ambassador in Panama, stressed the importance of cooperation that both countries conducted in education and culture. In September 2012, The Saharawi Ambassador was received by the Dean of Panama's Chiriqu√¨ University, H√©ctor Requena N√∫√±ez, during a visit made by the Ambassador to the University. The University provides scholarships for Sahrawi students. Sahrawi students were studying medicine in Panama at the time of the visit. Panama was the first Latin American country to host Sahrawi students in its universities. On 4 April 2013, Foreign Minister Fernando Nunez Fabrega accepted the visit of the SADR Ambassador in Panama, Ali Mahamud Embarek.

Life  Life in Vienna  Bibring was born on January 11, 1899 in Vienna, Austria. She was the youngest child of a factory owner and his wife. Her siblings were two older brothers, Ernst and Fritz, and a sister, Rosi. Her upbringing was amongst a wealthy family that often hosted dinner parties and imparted to her an appreciation for music, science, and art. She attended Akademisches Gymnasium (Humanistic Gymnasium for Girls) until 1918, when she graduated. During her time at school, she excelled at Greek and Latin and became familiar with the works of Sigmund Freud. After graduation, she began studying at the University of Vienna in the same year. During her studies she met Edward Bibring, a fellow medical student and dissection class partner, who she later married in December 1921. She graduated from the University of Vienna in 1924, going on to specialize in neurology and psychiatry. Alongside joining the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, she also became one of the first students at the Vienna Training Institute in 1925. Bibring went on to work at a psychoanalytic clinic as a training analyst and instructor for some years, later becoming a member of the education committee of the Vienna Association in 1934.  Life in America  In May 1938, the invasion of Austria by the Nazis forced Bibring and her family flee to London. While in London, Grete Bibring became a member of the British Psycho-Analytical Society. Edward Bibring was then invited to teach at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts. He accepted the position and, in 1941, Grete and Edward Bibring, along with their children George and Thomas, emigrated to America. Once in Boston, the two were among a group of \\"second generation\\" Freudian Scholars from overseas who popularized the concept of ego psychology in America. Bibring officially became an American citizen in 1946 and continued her work and research, establishing many positions, consultancies, and fellowship in a variety of institutions and organizations. In 1959, at the age of 64, her husband passed away of Parkinson's Disease. Bibring carried on in the field of psychoanalysis and continued to treat clients up to her death on August 10, 1977 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She was 78.  Career  During her time in Vienna, Bibring published her first work on psychoanalysis in 1933 titled \\"The Phallic Phase and its Disturbances in Young Girls\\" for the journal Zeitschrift f√ºr psychoanalytische P√§dagogik. She held positions as a training analyst and teacher at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institution from 1933 to 1938, when the Anschluss drove her and her family to London first, then to America en 1941. In 1961, Bibring became the first female professor at Harvard Medical School. She also lectured on psychoanalytic psychology at Simmons College School of Social Work in Boston from 1942 to 1955. As well, she was the director of the psychiatry department at the Beth Israel Hospital from 1946 to 1955 in which time, she reorganized the psychiatric teaching unit. In 1955, she became director of psychiatric research and the hospital's psychiatrist-in-chief until her retirement in 1965. Even though she retired formally, she continued to dedicate herself to treating patients until two weeks before her death. Bibring was also affiliated with other institutions which included Radcliffe College in Cambridge, where she was a consultant for research, and the Children's Bureau in Washington, where she was a psychiatric consultant. Amongst professional societies, she was a training analyst at the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute and was elected its President in 1955, Vice President of the International Psychoanalytic Society and Institute from 1959 to 1963, and was President of the American Psychoanalytic Association in 1962‚Äì1963. In 1968, she accepted a fellowship at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Bibring's pioneering work included observations of the effects of environmental stress on individuals as well as how aspects of pregnancy are interpreted through a psychoanalytic lens, where she concluded that affective issues experienced by women during pregnancy might be brought on by environmental stresses that may affect women who are not pregnant in different ways.

The plot follows the adventures of a young girl trying to find her dog in Dublin. The film is directed by Fintan Connolly and features his then 10-year-old daughter Ella Connolly in the lead role.  Plot  Dublin. The present. Ten-year-old Lucy struggles to come to terms with her parents' separation. She adopts a dog, Eliot, from the local dog shelter. It is love at first sight and her life starts to improve. But tragedy strikes when Eliot goes missing and Lucy undertakes a dangerous journey to find him.Irish Film Board  Tagline  Sometimes it's hard to find what you're looking for  Cast  * Ella Connolly as Lucy * Ren√©e Weldon as Mother * David Wilmot as Tom * Joshua Brown as Ben * Des Fitzgerald as Window Cleaner * Lauren Stone as Cathy * Gerard Mannix Flynn as Garda * Vincent McCabe as DSPCA * Eliot as Eliot the dog  Production  Connolly developed and co-wrote the script for Eliot & Me with producer Fiona Bergin. \\"It was a bit of a family affair', says Connolly \\"we shot at weekends and school holidays, whenever Ella was free. We cast actors we'd worked with before, like Ren√©e Weldon, David Wilmot and Mannix Flynn. It was a real labour of love. We filmed all over the city, but mainly in Kilmainham.‚Äù Describing working with his daughter Ella he said: ‚ÄúAfter playing a spooky kid in Hammer horror Wake Wood, she wanted to be in a film she could watch. Having worked on that film which was shot in winter and involved prosthetics and special effects, this was relatively straightforward, She dug deep to play this little girl and to give her a vulnerability and strength in keeping with the story. She was a joy to work with. She did everything in a couple of takes. And I'm not just saying that because I'm her dad. It was fun.‚Äù Twelve-year-old Ella said about the experience \\"There is an awful lot of waiting around making films. It's not nearly as glamorous as people think. One of the good things about Eliot & Me was working with my dog. He's completely untrained, he hasn't got a clue, he didn't do anything he was asked. I thought that was hilarious. But he is the best thing in the film.\\"Irish Film Board [www.irishfilmboard.ie/irish_film_industry/news/Premiere_of_New_Irish_Drama_Eliot_amp_Me_on_RTE_This_Christmas/1822]  Reception  Richard Propes described the film as \\"a warm and gentle family film, featuring a wonderful performance from Ella Connolly and a heart and spirit that will warm dog lovers and family film lovers alike. The film bears an easy comparison to the British made version of Lassie, though that comparison is a tad unfair as Eliot & Me is a delight all its own. Its warm heart and winning spirit will likely breeze through your mind for days after watching the young Connolly and this adorable Yorkshire Terrier.\\"Propes, Richard  Accolades  The film had its world premiere as the opening film at the 52nd Zl√≠n Film Festival in the Czech Republic in May 2012. Subsequently, Eliot & Me was an official selection at the SCHLINGEL International Film Festival in Germany, Cinekid Festival in The Netherlands, Oulu International Children's and Youth Film Festival in Finland and the Olympia International Film Festival for Children and Young People in Greece.

History The Clyde Shipping Company or C. S. Co. was established in 1815 to provide steamship services out of Glasgow.Advertisement in Glasgow Herald, 1 February 1856 Although its very early history is unclear, it was almost certainly the oldest steamship company in existence when it was put up for sale ‚Äì along with its four tug steamers, three luggage steamers and eight lighters ‚Äì in February 1856. 1856 ‚Äì 1893 The C. S. Co. seemed an ideal investment to Archibald Glen Kidston (great- grandfather of ‚ÄòBentley Boy‚Äô Glen Kidston), who was looking for a Glasgow- based business to occupy his three sons, in particular his youngest, George Jardine, who was 21 years old at the time. Archibald Glen's own business, A. G. Kidston & Co., was thriving and as it owned sailing clippers as well as dealing in iron and steel, steam tugs were a natural evolution. While the partners in the newly purchased C. S. Co. were the three Kidston brothers, their cousin, and two others unrelated to the Kidston family, only George Jardine Kidston took an active role in running the company ‚Äì which he did for the next 53 years. George Kidston, who had nine children when he became a widower at the age of just 46, had a great love of outdoor sports, especially fox-hunting. Known to be a shy man, he was a kind and indulgent father ‚Äì said only to have caned his sons when they chose to saw the legs off the drawing- room chairs. Although reportedly remote from the staff of the C. S. Co., George Kidston had a reputation for discretion, wisdom, and a willingness to invest in potentially risky new ventures, usually with great success. The year 1856 saw the launch of the company's first regular coastal service to Cork and Waterford and to Galway Bay, the Shannon estuary and Limerick. A service to Plymouth was later extended to Southampton, Newhaven and London. From 1888, the deep-sea tramping trade saw the company heavily involved in the guano, nitrate and copper trade in the Pacific islands. George Jardine remained as Chairman when, in January 1893, the original partnership of the C. S. Co. was dissolved to form a limited liability company. By then, the seven river vessels and eight lighters of 1856 had expanded to a fleet of 15 coasters, two deep-sea ships and 25 tugs. Meanwhile, James Cuthbert was appointed Managing Director of the new limited company, an energetic young man who had contributed much to the C. S. Co.‚Äôs rapid expansion since he joined the company as a 21-year-old, eight years before. 1893 ‚Äì 1956 James Cuthbert remained as Managing Director until he died of a stroke in 1901. He was succeeded by his son, William Cuthbert, who held the role of Managing Director (and, from 1920, Chairman) for the next 45 years. Whereas staff spoke warily of James Cuthbert‚Äôs sense of humour, clearly unsure when he was joking and when he was not, his son William ‚Äì a committed church elder ‚Äì did much to create a congenial atmosphere around him, even through the difficult war years. In common with other merchant shipping companies, the Clyde Shipping Company saw various forms of requisition and multiple tragedies during the two world wars. In total, 14 of C. S. Co.‚Äôs ships were sunk in WWI and three in WWII, with almost 200 lives lost as a result. In 1917, two of the C. S. Co.‚Äôs vessels became ‚ÄòQ‚Äô ships, manned by the Royal Navy, while other vessels were occasionally requisitioned during WWI ‚Äì but most of the fleet continued to operate within the company. The Second World War was very different. The entire fleet was requisitioned, many as rescue ships, although the management remained with the C. S. Co. Company vessel SS Rathlin participating in the arctic convoys during the Second World War Having steered the C. S. Co. through two world wars, William Cuthbert died in April 1946. The obvious man to replace him as Chairman and Joint Managing Director was William Logan, a grandson of George Jardine Kidston, and a lively and ‚Äòunusual‚Äô man with no patience for bureaucracy. There was, it was said, never a dull moment in meetings, thanks to Logan's skills of mimicry and deliberate spoonerisms. But he was the ideal candidate in the difficult post-war period, his close personal interest in both technical details and the staff of the company proving a great asset at a time when the fleet was being decommissioned and a great deal of money spent on new diesel-engined ships built at Dundee. The Second World War not only suspended the company's trade but fundamentally changed the trading future. For many reasons ‚Äì from bomb damage and a scarcity of goods such as coal and butter, to the development of the road transport industry ‚Äì the decade that followed held new and difficult challenges. One such challenge led to the decision, in 1945, to accept that passenger trade was unlikely ever to be profitable again, and hence to run the fleet only for cargo services. The exception to this was the passenger service to Cork, always the most profitable, and that declined to the extent that it, too, was ended in 1952. The majority of the C. S. Co.‚Äôs passengers had always been pleasure-seekers, travelling purely for enjoyment. As the official history of the first 100 years of the Clyde Shipping CompanyClyde Shipping Company Limited ‚Äì A History, by Alan D. Cuthbert, privately printed by Robert Maclehose and Co. Ltd. at the University Press, Glasgow, 1956 published in 1956 pointed out, it was a sad business decision: \\"sentimental associations will be lacking which have meant much in past years\\". At the time the official centenary history was published, the future of the company was uncertain: \\"Today, with nationalisation of transport the avowed aim of one political party and penal taxation the practice of both, it is perhaps more natural to speculate not upon how long the Company has existed but upon how much longer it will continue so to do.\\" In 1963 the company acquired the shipping company of Ross and Marshall.The Light in the Glens, Len Paterson, Dundum. 1996 The company's Irish interests were sold to Mainport Holdings in 1974 and the rest of the company later forms part of Clyde Marine Group.

Amazon customers can select any Locker location as their delivery address, and retrieve their orders at that location by entering a unique pick-up code on the Locker touch screen. However, certain third party sellers on Amazon may not be able to ship to an Amazon Locker, due to their use of other shipping services such as FedEx or UPS that require a signature. There are several sizes but some parcels are too big for any of them. The Amazon Locker program addresses concerns of parcels being stolen or customers missing the mail delivery. Amazon Locker program was launched in September 2011 in New York City, Seattle, and London. As of June 2018, Lockers were available in over 2,800 locations in 70+ cities. Operation An Amazon Locker with the door open A customer orders a parcel from Amazon and has it delivered to a Locker location. Amazon's preferred carriers deliver to the locker, and the customer receives a digital pick-up code via email or text messaging. Once the unique pick-up code is entered into the locker's touch screen, the assigned door opens for package retrieval. Amazon customers have three days to collect their packages once they receive their pick-up code. Amazon customers can also return packages to select Amazon Lockers. Amazon Lockers can sometimes be full and therefore not available when a delivery is attempted. In that case customers will have to wait an unspecified amount of time until space is available. Locker locations An Amazon Locker near a supermarket in Fano, Italy Amazon partners with retail stores such as 7-Eleven and Spar to host Amazon Locker kiosks. Retailers receive a stipend from Amazon to host the kiosks. Staples and RadioShack joined the program briefly in 2012, only to withdraw the following year. 7-Eleven has kiosks in 186 locations in the US as of 2015. In the United Kingdom, Amazon has a partnership with Co-op Food and Morrisons. Lockers are located within some Co-op and Morrisons stores. Since 2012, libraries in West Sussex have also been operating Lockers. Large retail centres often have Amazon Lockers, for example there are two in One New Change in London, and there is one in Stratford Centre. The largest Amazon Locker in the world and the busiest in the UK is called Ivory. It has 115 lockers and is located near the Rootes building at the University of Warwick. Amazon has also expanded the Locker program in Canada, France, Spain, Germany and Italy. In 2017, Amazon announced plans to launch Amazon Locker in select Whole Foods Market locations. Amazon Hub An Amazon Hub at an apartment complex Amazon Hub is a delivery locker for apartment lobbies. The delivery locker accepts packages from all carriers.

The corridor follows the path of the former Woodinville Subdivision from Renton to the City of Snohomish at Snohomish Junction. The Northern portion was still in operation in 2017 by Eastside Freight Railroad. History Acquisition Cross Kirkland Corridor in 2013, prior to removal of rails and resurfacing The Port of Seattle acquired the right of way of the former Woodinville Subdivision from BNSF Railway through purchase and donation in 2008. On December 10, 2012 the King County Council approved purchase of of the right-of-way from Port of Seattle. A portion of the central corridor, named the Cross Kirkland Corridor, is owned by the City of Kirkland; a spur to Redmond, named the Redmond Central Connector, is owned by the City of Redmond; a portion in downtown Bellevue was purchased by Sound Transit, and a northern portion of the corridor remains Port property for dual use as a trail and freight line. Some state residents brought suit against the Port of Seattle because the purchase was not used for freight in its entirety. In 2016, Snohomish County acquired the right of way from the King‚ÄìSnohomish County line at Woodinville north to the city of Snohomish. Opening Cross Kirkland Corridor after official opening in 2015 In January, 2015, the Kirkland portion of the Eastside Rail Corridor, with compacted gravel surfacing, opened for pedestrians and bicyclists. The Kirkland‚ÄìBellevue section was opened in July 2018, connecting State Route 520 (and its bike trail) to the Spring District. It was christened as Eastrail on July 20, 2019. Eastside Greenway Alliance In January 2016, community leaders gathered in Bellevue, Washington, for a one day summit about transforming the Eastside Rail Corridor into a multi‚Äìuse trail. This was by no means the first such conversation; in fact, planning and construction of various corridor segments had been underway for years. The group envisioned a partnership of established and reputable regional and national nonprofits to collectively advocate for the trail. The Alliance would initially be co-led by Cascade Bicycle Club and The Trust for Public Land. Cities and connections Cities through which the corridor passes include: *Renton *Newcastle *Bellevue *Kirkland () *Redmond (Redmond Central Connector) *Woodinville *Snohomish Trail connections If constructed as proposed by King County, these other trails would or could link to the Eastside Rail Corridor: *Burke-Gilman Trail / Sammamish River Trail *East Lake Sammamish Trail *Cedar River Trail *Soos Creek Trail *Snoqualmie Valley Trail *Green River Trail *Interurban Trail *Snohomish County Centennial Trail *Lake-to-Lake Trail (Bellevue) *Lake-to-Sound Trail (Renton to Des Moines) *Mountains to Sound Greenway Trail (I-90) *State Route 520 Trail *Tolt Pipeline Trail Railroad Involvement BNSF sold the running rights to Tom Payne, GNP Railway, between Woodinville and Snohomish in conjunction with the sale to the Port of Seattle.GNP‚Äôs partner, Ballard Terminal Railroad, took over freight operations from BNSF Railway in January 2010. By 2011 Ballard Terminal Railroad was filing with other creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for an involuntary reorganization of GNP. A short line terminal railroad operating in Seattle, the Ballard Terminal Railroad, filed suit in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington and petitioned the Surface Transportation Board on April 1, 2013 seeking to prevent the city of Kirkland from removing the rail tracks for the planned trail. The Ballard Terminal Railroad says they want to keep the tracks intact for future rail freight use. On May 3, 2013 Federal District Court Judge Marsha Pechman granted the City of Kirkland‚Äôs motion to dismiss the case filed by Ballard Terminal Railroad Company seeking to prevent rail salvage on the Cross Kirkland Corridor. In her oral ruling, Judge Pechman stated the Federal District Court did not have jurisdiction to consider Ballard‚Äôs temporary restraining order (TRO) and that the Surface Transportation Board was the proper forum for adjudicating Ballard‚Äôs claims.

After leaving Robert Lightbourne High School, where he was a member of the cadet corp, he then became a police cadet and later enlisted in the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF). In 1985, he migrated to the United States and enlisted in the Armed Forces on 18 May 1988 after acquiring legal resident status in February 1988. A 1996 graduate of South Florida State College, he earned an associate degree in computer programming. In August 1996, as part of a negotiated plea agreement with the State of Florida and his attorney at law, Brown pleaded \\"no contest\\" to a charge of aggravated battery which stems from a domestic dispute and was placed on two years' probation. The presiding judge withheld the adjudication based on his status in the community. In August 1998, the probation was extended to August 2001 in order to satisfy the monetary part of the condition of the probation. On 30 September 1996, the US Congress passed and newly re-elected US President Bill Clinton signed into law the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), which lessened the chances of non-US citizens with certain kinds of convictions to remain in the country. An amendment to the IIRIRA categorized probation \\"as a sentence and a final order of conviction for deportation or removal purposes\\", so he was able to be deported\\". However, in 2001, the US Supreme Court in INS v St. Cyr, ruled that non-US citizens with convictions that occurred as a result of plea-agreements and who were not able to be deported at the time of the offence based on the law then in effect should be allowed to file \\"cancellation of removal\\" petitions in an effort to remain in the country. On 5 January 2001, Brown was convicted on one count of resisting arrest without violence by a jury, and sentenced to 9 months in jail. As a result of the conviction, Highlands County Circuit Judge J.D. Langford revoked the probation. Brown was sentenced to a maximum term of 46 months in prison, but was released after 24 months due to good conduct. He was handed over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement. After appearing before an immigration judge in September 2003, the judge ordered Brown deported to his native Jamaica. Brown was deported on 24 January 2004 after spending a total of 19 years in the United States, altogether. Despite Brown's military service, he had never applied for naturalization, making him eligible for deportation as a non-US citizen. Brown wrote The Jamaican Deportees....we are displaced, desperate, damaged, rich, resourceful, or dangerous.... Who am I? He resides in Jamaica and writes frequent published articles to the editor of the Daily Gleaner and The Jamaica Observer.

He was a prominent voice against the Church of England, and became an important settler of Plymouth Colony. Biography William Pontus was born in 1583, in the town of Dover, England. He was born to strict separatist parents, and fled to Holland as a young man, to avoid religious persecution, where he worked as a fustian worker. Once in Leyden, William joined the Pilgrims, and he and other fellow Pilgrims published a newspaper called \\"The Pilgrim Press,\\" which openly denounced and insulted the Church of England. Pontus knew full well that if he had published this scandalous material in England, he would've been hanged for heresy. On December 4, 1610, William married Wybra Hanson, a relative of future Plymouth Colony leader William Bradford. She was as radical as Pontus was: coming from a prominent family of separatists, she was arrested multiple times for her religious views, which made her hatred of the Church of England grow even stronger. At the age of 17, she escaped England, coming to live with her relative, William Bradford. When the Mayflower departed Holland in July 1620, the Pontus family did not accompany their fellow Pilgrims, but stayed behind in Leyden. In fact, The family did not leave Holland until 1630. When they arrived in Plymouth, William Pontus was in a financially bad shape. He was too poor to be taxed upon his arrival, probably due to the amount of money he had spent on travelling to The New World. However, he built up his fortune over the years, and became one of Plymouth's most influential colonists. He received multiple land grants from the governor of the colony, William Bradford, for repairing the Herring Weir for the town. William Pontus died in Plymouth on February 9, 1652. Children William Pontus and Wybra Hanson had two children: * Mary Pontus: Born around 1612. She married John Glass in 1645, and had one child: Wybra Glass. She later remarried to Phillipe Delano.

Operating for some years with only a few trading units, it today primarily forms a public passage between Talbot and Abbey Streets. History Opened in September 1979 by the chairman of Ireland's largest life assurance company, Irish Life, the Irish Life Mall was a second-phase element of the nine-building Irish Life buildings complex, originally built 1974‚Äì1977 and mostly comprising office space, as well as two blocks of apartments. The mall runs from the midpoint of Talbot Street to Northumberland Square and Abbey Street. It originally had two entrances on Talbot Street, with the passages merging at a central atrium; one entrance and passage were later absorbed into rental units. The mall's name was later expanded to Irish Life Shopping Mall. Irish Life, now part of the Canadian multinational Great-West Lifeco, were the original developers, and later also part-owners of the first full- scale city centre shopping centre, the Ilac Centre on Henry Street. By 2012, few shop units remained in operation, and the once-popular shopping facility had come to function primarily as a pedestrian route between Abbey Street and the Luas stop, and Talbot Street. A consultancy firm was engaged to study the situation and in an attempt to recover business, the centre was renamed in April 2013 as the Talbot Mall, as part of a broader rebranding which also saw some vacant units redesigned with 3D-visuals to look like prospective shops. Permission was sought and obtained in 2016 to merge multiple retail units, and parts of the public mall space, into bigger shop units, and to add new toilet facilities. A view of the gardens located between buildings of the office complex, 2011 Tenants and facilities The main entrance is on Talbot Street, leading to a short corridor, a central atrium with stairs to the car park, and a discreet rear passageway towards Abbey Street. The centre opened with 15 retail outlets. Past tenants of the shopping centre have included a full Easons branch on Talbot Street, Dealz, a pharmacy, hair and beauty salon, jewellers, travel agency, drapery stores, GP surgery, and Sasha and Hugh O'Regan's Life Bar (which for a time opened as Floridita). For many years only a few outlets remained operational: two eating places (Brasilia Caf√© and an O'Brien's Sandwich Bar), and one retail and one service unit. With the closure of the caf√© in August 2019, the only remaining internal retail unit is the sandwich bar, though there is also a GP surgery, operated by Dr. Suzanne Kenny, the Talbot Street Medical Centre. There is an underground car park, which opened with 375 spaces, with accesses on Abbey Street and Gardiner Street. Irish Life Centre The wider complex comprises nine buildings, two of which are primarily residential, the remainder mostly offering office space, with the mall running through the ground floor of one. The complex houses the principal offices of Irish Life, along with a fitness facility, including a swimming pool, and in addition to Comreg, the Irish Communications Regulator, and the Valuation Office of Ireland. The residential element comprises 50 apartments. The lead architect was Andrew Devane and the cost of the centre, before the setup of the shopping centre, was 20 million Irish pounds. A sculpture by Ois√≠n Kelly was at first directly in front of the Irish Life HQ building but was later moved to be closer to, and more visible from, Abbey Street.

It formed on November 18, 2003, from the monsoon trough to the west of the Marshall Islands. Early in its duration, it moved generally to the west or west-southwest. On November 21, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lupit, the 21st storm named by the Japan Meteorological Agency of the 2003 Pacific typhoon season. Two days later, it strengthened into a typhoon and developed an eye. Lupit later began a prolonged movement to the northwest, during which it passed near several islands in Yap State. The typhoon reached peak intensity on November 26, with peak 10‚Äëminute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). It later weakened due to increasing wind shear and drier air, and after recurving to the northeast, Lupit became extratropical south of Japan on December 2\\\\. Typhoon Lupit first affected Pohnpei with tropical storm-force winds, and later it damaged or destroyed about 200 homes in Chuuk State. There, high waves flooded roads and homes, while high winds damaged crops. Damage was heaviest in Yap State, mostly in the small Ulithi atoll and Fais Island. On both islands, the typhoon contaminated the water supply and wrecked crops. Rainfall reached 263 mm (10.35 in) on Ulithi, and gusts reached 158 km/h (98 mph). Throughout the FSM, damage totaled about $1.7 million, although there were no deaths. The damage prompted the FSM government to declare two states as disaster areas, as well as a disaster declaration from the United States federal government. While Lupit was becoming extratropical, it became the first typhoon in December to threaten Japan in 13 years. There, the storm dropped rainfall that resulted in mudslides and flight cancellations. Meteorological history The origins of Typhoon Lupit were from a tropical disturbance that persisted in the monsoon trough on November 14 to the northeast of Kwajalein Atoll. There was a weak circulation with pulsating convection (thunderstorms) and weak outflow. The system drifted to the southwest without much organization. On November 17, the circulation intensified, although convection was initially unable to persist. The next day, outflow increased to the northeast, and the thunderstorms developed over the center. At around 1200 UTC on November 18, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression to the west of the Marshall Islands. Due to low wind shear, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, indicating that tropical cyclogenesis was likely. Late on November 19, the JTWC issued its first advisory on Tropical Depression 26W when the system was about 465 km (290 mi) east-northeast of Pohnpei. With a ridge located to the north, the depression tracked to the west-southwest upon forming. Late on November 20, the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm following an increase in deep convection, although the thunderstorms were located south of the center. After it turned more to the west, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Lupit to the northwest of Pohnpei on November 21. Outflow gradually increased, and an eye feature was evident by November 22. Around that time, Lupit passed about 165 km (105 mi) north of Chuuk. Based on the development of a 30 km (18 mi) eye, the JTWC upgraded Lupit to a typhoon that day, and the JMA followed suit on November 23 when the storm was near the Caroline Islands. While the typhoon was intensifying, it briefly turned to the west-southwest on November 23, before a strengthening ridge to the southeast turned Lupit to the northwest. The eye gradually became better-defined as the typhoon strengthened, and it passed well to the south of Guam. On November 25, Lupit passed about 315 km (195 mi) north of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). The next day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a super typhoon, or a storm with maximum 1‚Äëminute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph). On November 26, the JMA estimated that Lupit attained peak 10‚Äëminute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) in the Philippine Sea, and the next day the JTWC estimated peak 1‚Äëminute winds of 270 km/h (165 mph). On November 27, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration classified the system as Super Typhoon \\"Yoyoy\\" after the storm entered the agency's area of warning responsibility. While around peak intensity, Typhoon Lupit had good outflow channels to the north and south. It had a 26 km (14 mi) eye, and gale-force winds reached a diameter of more than 740 km (460 mi). After peaking in intensity, Lupit underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, which caused the outflow to decrease and convection around the eye to diminish. Steady weakening began on November 28, accelerated by increasing wind shear, and late that day it weakened below super typhoon status. Lupit entered a weakness in the subtropical ridge, resulting in a turn to the north and later northeast into an area of cooler waters and drier air. The typhoon accelerated into the westerlies, and dry air entered the circulation while the convection rapidly diminished. While moving northeast off the southeast coast of Japan, Lupit weakened into a tropical storm on December 1. That day, the JTWC issued its last advisory on the storm, and the JMA declared Lupit as an extratropical cyclone on December 2\\\\. The next day, Lupit dissipated off the east coast of Japan. Impact Typhoon Lupit intensifying near the Caroline Islands on November 25 While it was first intensifying as a tropical storm, Lupit affected Pohnpei, passing about 120 km (75 mi) north of Oroluk. Wind gusts peaked at 69 km/h (43 mph), and the storm dropped 160 mm (6.28 in) of rainfall. Later, the storm affected Chuuk Atoll in the FSM on November 23\\\\. Tropical storm force winds were experienced through the state, and rainfall reached 162 mm (6.37 in) on Chuuk and 195 mm (7.68 in) on Ulul. The Chuuk state government helped people in low-lying areas to evacuate. High waves flooded homes, and damaged roads and seawalls. About 200 houses were damaged or destroyed, and many homes affected by the typhoon had unsanitary conditions, a contaminated water supply, or lack of food. High winds downed banana and palm trees, and salt water damaged or wrecked all of the food crops in Chuuk. Most of Yap State was affected by the typhoon, and the eye of Typhoon Lupit passed near the small atoll of Ulithi. The typhoon also passed near Fais, producing estimated gusts of over 185 km/h (115 mph). On both islands, Lupit produced waves of , causing severe beach erosion, and sea spray and flooding contaminated water supplies. In Fais, there was little flooding because it is an elevated island, although several buildings were damaged, mostly to roofs. On Ulithi, areas along the coast were flooded up to 1.5 m (5 ft) deep. Crops were wrecked on both islands, and on Ulithi, it was estimated that the soil would be unfit for growing for at least a year. Stations on Ulithi reported wind gusts of 158 km/h (98 mph), and 263 mm (10.35 in) of rainfall. Lupit affected other islands in Yap State with coastal flooding of around 1 m (3 ft), severe beach erosion, and wrecked crops. Several islands' water supply were contaminated. On Woleai, the storm downed trees and power lines, and the runway was closed for a week after being covered with water. Damage in Yap State was least on Yap, where winds gusted to 93 km/h (58 mph) and rainfall totaled 128 mm (5.02 in) in a 24‚Äëhour period. There, Lupit downed trees and damaged crops, while high seas flooded areas. There was moderate beach erosion, and some seawalls and coastal roads were damaged. Throughout the FSM, Typhoon Lupit caused about $1.7 million in damage, although there were no deaths or serious injuries. After the storm, the governor of the FSM declared Chuuk and Yap states as disaster areas. The government sent water to affected areas via a private airline, although damaged runways prevented 60% of flights from being delivered. A government boat was also used to deliver supplies, but its motor was damaged. After it was repaired, the boat delivered 25,312 litres of water and 730 bags of rice. On December 19, United States President George W. Bush declared Yap State as a federal disaster area, which allocated funds for repairing damaged public buildings and debris removal. FEMA also provided emergency food assistance to nine islands in Yap, including Ulithi and Fais. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs provided $10,000 for purchasing supplies to the most affected areas. As part of Operation Christmas Drop, Japanese and American Air Force units sent four planes to various islands with various supplies and gifts, including to areas affected by the typhoon. While Lupit was becoming extratropical, it produced a gust of 133 km/h (83 mph) on the Japanese island of Chichi-jima, and 130 km/h (81 mph) on Hachij≈ç-jima. The storm dropped heavy rainfall across Japan, peaking at in ≈åshima Subprefecture. In the Izu Islands, the high rains caused mudslides and flooding that affected eight buildings. Winds reached 83 km/h (51 mph) in Miyake-jima. In Yakushima, five flights were canceled due to the typhoon. Lupit was the first typhoon in 13 years to threaten Japan in the month of December.

Two 0-4-0 saddle-tank locomotives named Thebus and Stormberg, which were originally built for the Irrigation Department of the Public Works Department of the Cape of Good Hope in 1903, were acquired by the South African Railways in 1916 for use as harbour shunting engines. In railway service they were named instead of being classified and numbered. Origin During the First World War, when the South African Railways (SAR) experienced an acute shortage of locomotive power, it acquired a number of locomotives from private concerns and other government departments. x100px The Public Works Department (PWD) of the Cape Province had two locomotives, used by the Irrigation Department as dam construction engines, which it could spare. These two were donated to the SAR by the Department of Water Affairs in 1916. Numbered l and 2 by Water Affairs, they were saddle-tank locomotives which had been built by Hudswell, Clarke and Company Limited in 1903.Hardy, Clive. Hudswell Clarke & Company Ltd Locomotive Works List, (1st ed.).Soul of A Railway, System 7, Western Transvaal, based in Johannesburg, Part 7. Germiston Steam and Diesel Running Sheds (2nd section) by Les Pivnic. Caption 1. (Accessed on 7 April 2017) Names The locomotives were not classified or numbered by the SAR and were named instead. The first was named Thebus after the town Teebus on the line between Stormberg and Rosmead on the Cape Midland System, while the second was named Stormberg after the town of that name on the Cape Eastern System mainline from Springfontein to East London. Service The engine Thebus spent most of its SAR service life as dock shunter at the Port Elizabeth Harbour. The engine Stormberg spent most of its SAR service life as a dock shunter in East London Harbour until it was eventually semi-retired and used to test the steam-heating equipment on passenger coaches. During the Second World War, it was transferred to Cape Town for use as a construction locomotive during the expansion works at Table Bay Harbour. From there it went to Mosselbaai to once again serve as harbour shunting engine until it was transferred to Germiston in Transvaal, where it was retired and placed in storage for a number of years. By then, the engine Stormberg was sporting a balloon-type spark arrester on its chimney and a headlight mounted on a shelf attached to the front of the smokebox. Preservation In 1964, the engine Stormberg was refurbished at Germiston before being taken back to East London, where it was plinthed at East London station. It finally ended up as an exhibit in the Outeniqua Transport Museum in George. At some stage between being in storage at Germiston and becoming a museum exhibit, the spark arrester, headlight and headlight mount were removed. The engine Thebus was presumably scrapped.

It is one of the spirurid nematodes that infect a vast array of animals throughout the world. Infections have been noted in both humans and in animals ranging from cows to birds. As of recent, there have been 50+ human cases reported in countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Middle East, China, and United States. G. ingluvicola, like other tissue-dwelling species, require an insect intermediate host to ingest eggs. Infections result from the ingestion of intermediate hosts containing L3 stage nematodes. Upon ingestion of the insect by an appropriate host, the larvae are released and can migrate to the esophagus or buccal cavity. Humans are an accidental host who occasionally get infected by ingesting infected poultry or insects. Infected humans have described a moving sensation in the buccal cavity which includes, but is not limited to, lips, gums, tongue, and palate. Symptoms include local irritation, pharyngitis and stomatitis and bloody oozing patches in the mouth. G. ingluvicola is commonly recognized in the esophageal epithelium of birds such as chickens, turkeys and pigeons. This worm stage burrows through the epithelium, leaving trails of eggs which find their way to the lumen, get swallowed, and eventually pass in feces. A related species, G. pulchrum, infects a variety of mammals but rarely humans.  Morphology  G. ingluvicola, meaning \\"crop mongylonemid\\" can grow up to . The larvated eggs are roughly 58 √ó 35 ¬µm.  Life cycle  The adult form of G. ingluvicola resides in esophageal epithelium. From there it lays unembryonated eggs which pass to the feces, known as embryonation. The L1, now in the eggs which reside in feces, is ingested by an insect and molts twice taking it to an L3 stage. The L3 in the hemocoel is ingested by the animal and molts twice more. Then the adult form emerges in the esophageal or crop epithelium.  Pathogenicity  Heavy infections are thought to lead to gastrointestinal disturbances that might cause emaciation. Nematodes are generally in the lumena of the gastric glands. Catarrhal gastritis may result which will eventually lead to chronic hypertrophic gastritis. The typical mucosal surface is characterized by irregular circumscribed wart-like thickenings with a finely verrucose surface.  Treatment  Albendazole is a common drug treatment.

It was subsequently named after the Duc d'Orl√©ans who stayed there in the early 19th century. By the early 20th century it was derelict and in 1926 it was mostly demolished. However, parts of the property, including a baroque octagonal room designed by architect James Gibbs, were preserved. The octagon room and its service wing are listed Grade I by Historic England and, together, with a converted stable block, are now the Orleans House Gallery, a gallery of art relating to the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and neighbouring areas of London. History 18th century Johnston's Twickenham house in 1844 James Johnston settled at Twickenham at the end of his political career. Johnston had seen diplomatic service in Germany, first as King's envoy to Berlin and later working to secure the Hanoverian succession, and made frequent journeys to Hanover. It was said George I \\"often conversed with him very familiarly\\" and that Johnston was \\"a great favourite of Queen Caroline, who was much entertained with his humour and pleasantry\\". It was also said \\"he keeps out a very great rank, and frequently has Mr. Walpool and the greatest courtiers with him at his country house near London; and the King sometimes does him the honour to dine with him\\". The King (George I) is also recorded to have been a regular casual visitor to the house. He was one of the first to construct a home on the Thames in Twickenham during the 18th century. He procured a lease (from the then under-lessee Mrs Davies)Mrs Davies was sister to the 1st Lord Berkeley of Stratton. The manor was vested in the Crown from 1541 and usually, for life, in the possession of the Queen consort. In 1675 the King granted a reversionary lease for 41 years after the death of Catherine of Braganza (1638‚Äì1705) to John Earl of Rochester. In 1702 James Johnston obtained from the Queen Dowager a lease for 13 years from 1720. By the time of his death in 1737 Johnston had much further extended the lease and (from George II) obtained yet another 13 years to commence in 1774. On Johnston's death it was sold to George Morton Pitt. Pitt obtained an extension to 1815. Pitt's only child married Brownlow Bertie but died aged 18 without surviving issue and in due course it became the residence of Pitt's wife's daughter by a prior marriage, Sophia Drake (died 1767) and her husband, Sir George Pocock (1706‚Äì1792). and commissioned architect John James to plan and erect a mansion ‚Äì a project which spanned the following 35 years. The grounds were extensive, including the area now known as the Orleans House woodlands. Johnston created a fine garden which \\"included canals, an icehouse, a kitchen garden, a pleasure garden, a wilderness, a grotto and a fruit garden\\". A baroque octagonal room, designed by architect James Gibbs, was added in 1720 for entertaining George II's Queen Consort, Caroline, who regarded Johnston with great favour. 19th century Louis-Phillippe, Duc d'Orl√©ans, while in exile, lived in Johnston's house at Twickenham between 1813 and 1815 and the house was later named after him. 20th century Painting of Orleans House, Twickenham by British artist Joseph Nickolls (1689‚Äì1789), circa 1750, held at the Yale Center for British Art Orleans House was demolished in 1926, and the area formerly occupied by the house used to quarry gravel throughout the 1930s. The outbuildings and octagon room were saved by the efforts of a local figure, the Hon. Nellie Levy, later the Hon. Mrs Ionides, who left it and her collection of 18th- and 19th-century pictures to the borough.Christopher Hibbert; Ben Weinreb; and others The London Encyclopaedia, third edition, London, Macmillan, 2008 It became a listed building in 1952 and was converted into an art gallery in 1972. In 1973, at the northern end of the former park were taken as the site of Orleans Park School. 21st century The buildings and site were refurbished between 2005 and 2008 by architects Patel Taylor to incorporate an education centre and a cafe. Orleans House Gallery Orleans House Gallery, which opened in 1972, displays material from the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames' art collection. This includes a portrait of James Johnston by Thomas Gibson, paintings of Orleans House by Arthur Vickers and several other artists, and the Burton Collection, which includes artwork, personal effects and photographs of the explorer Richard Francis Burton. Orleans House Gallery is also the site of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames' arts service and provides educational workshops for a wide variety of ages, using the converted stables and coach house as educational spaces. The gallery can also be hired as a wedding venue and for functions. The gallery reopened in March 2018 after a 17-month restoration project costing ¬£3.7 million, which was partly funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund through a ¬£1.8m grant. The Octagon Room has been restored, facilities improved and the upper floor extended to provide additional space. The painting of Queen Caroline has been relocated outside the Octagon Room. Exhibitions The gallery's previous exhibitions have included watercolours and sketches by Richard Dadd and, in 2003, the first major retrospective of Stephen Wiltshire's works. The gallery's exhibition Capability Now (from February to June 2016) marked the 300th anniversary of the birth of Capability Brown.

The day is sacred to Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva. They are worshipped individually or together in different temples in Varanasi, Rishikesh, Gaya and Maharashtra. The holy day of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi is also observed in Maharashtra by the Marathas as per the custom set by Shivaji and his mother Jijabai for this occasion and by the Gaud Saraswat Brahmins, though in a slightly different format. Legend According to Shiva Purana, Once, Lord Vishnu, Lord of Vaikuntha, left his abode and went to Varanasi to worship Lord Shiva on this day. He pledged to worship Shiva with one thousand lotuses. While singing hymns in glorification of Shiva, Lord Vishnu found the last or 'thousandth' lotus missing. Vishnu, whose eyes are often compared to lotuses, plucked one of them and offers it to Shiva. Lord Shiva becoming intensely pleased with His love, restored Vishnu's eye and rewarded Him the Sudarshana chakra, Vishnu's discus and sacred weapon.Hindu Holidays According to legend of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi related to the Varanasi festivities, a Brahmin named Dhaneshwar who had spent his lifetime committing several sins, visited the bank of the Godavari River to take a bath and wash off his sins, when Vaikuntha Chaturdashi was being observed by a large number of devotees by offering earthen lighted lamps and batti (wick) to the sacred river. Dhaneshwar mingled with the crowd. When he died, his soul was taken by Yama, the god of death, to hell for punishment. However, Shiva intervened and told Yama that Dhaneshwar's sins were cleansed due to the touch of the devotees on Vaikuntha Chaturdashi. Then Dhaneshwar was released from hell and got a place in the Vaikuntha. Folklore in Maharashtra This folklore in Maharashtra state in India is a practice that was set by Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire and his mother Jijabai. After Shivaji was crowned, the capital was built at Raigarh, which also had a large lotus tank called Kushavarta. The lotus flowers in the tank bloomed during the month of Kartik in a splendour of white, blue and red colours. When Jijabai and Shivaji saw the blooms, and Jijabai commented to Shivaji that Vaikuntha Chaturdashi was in the offing. Shivaji recalled the Vishnu and Shiva legend. Like Vishnu, Jijabai also wished to offer a thousand white lotus flowers to Shiva at his Jagadeeshwara temple. She was very particular that the flowers should be unblemished white lotus flowers, fresh and unplucked by any other person (as by such an act its divine quality would be lost). As the aged Jijabai would be able to pick the flowers by herself, Shivaji was unable to find a way to fulfil her wish and convened his court to discuss the problem. In the court, Vikram Dalvi - the young a personal body guard of Shivaji had a solution. Then Dalvi offered to undertake this task and assured Jijabhai and Shivaji that he would pick the lotuses without touching them. Shivaji told him that if he failed he would be subject to severe punishment. On Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, Dalvi went to the tank, early in the morning, offered his obeisance to Shivaji and Jijabai, when other courtiers and citizens had gathered to watch the event. Then he lay down flat on the ground in front of the tank and shot arrows one after the other in quick succession to cut the lotus stems. Then he got into the tank in a boat and used a pair of tongs to pick the flowers without touching them, as promised. Shivaji and Jijabai were pleased with the ingenious and incomparable performance of the archery skill of Dalvi, and as a gesture of appreciation presented him with a gold and emerald necklace, in the presence of the assembled crowd. Worship rituals Devotees of Lord Vishnu offer Him one thousand lotuses while reciting the Vishnu sahasranama, the thousand names of Vishnu. The Vishnupada Temple, which is believed to have footprints of Vishnu, celebrates its main temple festival in this period. The festival is also celebrated as kartik snan (bathing in a river or stream during the kaartik maas) by Vishnu devotees. In Rishikesh, this day is observed as Deep Daan Mahotsav to mark the occasion of Vishnu waking up, out of his deep sleep. As a mark of environmental awareness, the deeps or lamps are made of flour (which would disintegrate in water) instead of burnt earthen lamps. The lighted lamps are floated in the holy Ganges River in the evening. This is accompanied by several cultural festivities. On this occasion, Lord Vishnu is given a special place of honour in the sanctum of Kashi Vishwanath temple, a prominent Shiva temple in Varanasi. The temple is described as Vaikuntha on this day. Both the deities are duly worshipped as though they are worshipping each other. Vishnu offers tulsi (holy basil) leaves (traditionally used in Vishnu worship) to Shiva, and Shiva in turn offers Bael leaves (traditionally offered to Shiva) to Vishnu, which is taboo otherwise, to each other. Devotees start the pujas after taking baths, fasting for the whole day, and offering akshat ( turmeric mixed rice), sandalwood (Chandan) paste, sacred water of the Ganges, flowers, incense and camphor to both the deities. Then they offer lighted deeps (earthen lamps) and batti (cotton wick) as a special offering for the day. In Varanasi, women, particularly old women, outnumber others in offering prayers on this occasion. Over the years, the number of devotees participating in this festival has increased. At the Grishneshwar temple of Shiva, Vishnu is offered Bael leaves and Shiva is offered Tulsi leaves. It is considered to portray the union of Vishnu and Shiva. In the Tilbhandeshvar temple in Nashik, the linga - aniconic form of Shiva - is dressed up in finery and a silver mask, as Ardhanarinateshvara, the half-male, half-female form of Shiva. Thousands of people worship the Tilbhandeshvar and Shiva Kampaleshvar temples in Nashik. The festival is one of the three important festivals of these temples.Nashik District Gazetteers Another observance is by celebrating avail bhojan (means a dinner) taken under the Phyllanthus emblica tree (Indian gooseberry). It is also prominently celebrated in Vishnu temples like Srirangam (Tamil Nadu), Tirupati Srinivasa temple (Andhra Pradesh), Udupi Sri Krishna Mutt (Karnataka) and many more. It is a custom to light lamps in a cut summer squash, after removing its core, thus fashioning a lamp (others use earthen lamps) and using 360 wicks, that some make by themselves specially for this occasion. These wicks are customarily as long as the pod of a cereal (moong dal) References Category:Hindu holy days Category:November observances Category:December observances Category:Hindu festivals ","title":"Vaikuntha Chaturdashi"},{"id":"37931482","text":"Yenik√∂y is a village in the District of Sason, Batman Province, Turkey.

Wimsatt (born July 28, 1917 ‚Äì died, January 9, 1985) was professor of Zoology and Chairman of the Department of Zoology at Cornell University. From 1945 until 1960, Wimsatt taught courses in histology and embryology in the College of Arts and Sciences and also in the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine. He was well known for his pioneering research on the interrelationships of hibernation and reproduction and the biology of bats. Biography Intellectual When Wimsatt was a student at St. John‚Äôs Preparatory School in Washington, D.C., he attended a lecture by Professor Arthur \\"Doc\\" Allen (who founded the Cornell Lab of Ornithology). This triggered strong a desire in Wimsatt to study at Cornell. Due to his mother‚Äôs illness, he was unable to transfer from Catholic University in Washington to Cornell, but after her death he did. After he graduated, he became one of ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù Allen‚Äôs graduate students in ornithology before eventually switching to study Bats In 1943, after Wimsatt received his doctorate at Cornell under Howard Adelman, he became an instructor of anatomy at Harvard Medical School. In 1945, he returned to Cornell and was appointed assistant professor of zoology. In 1947, he was promoted to associate professor and in 1951, he was promoted to professor of zoology; a position he held until his death. Wimsatt made many research trips to Central and South America and the Caribbean Islands, but his most desired research trips were to the tropics of Mexico. In 1962, he spent a year working with Dr. Bernardo Villa at the University of Mexico after receiving a Guggenheim Fellowship. He spent three sabbatical leaves at the University of Arizona College of Medicine working with Dr. Philip Krutzsch, who shared similar research interests. He was a widely acclaimed as editor of the series Biology of Bats. His expertise was on the functional morphology of placentae. A look at his publications reveals his ability to use novel approaches in diverse areas of reproductive biology (e.g., embryology, placentation, and fetal membranes), ecological physiology, hibernation, and the integumentary, urinary, and digestive systems. This broad background served him well as an Associate Editor of The American Journal of Anatomy from 1974 until shortly before his death. Wimsatt was a member of the Board of Trustees of Cornell University from 1960 through 1965. He served for many years as a Director of the Cornell University Research Foundation, Inc. He was a member of Sigma Xi, Phi Kappa Phi, and Phi Zeta; a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the American Association of Anatomists, the American Society of Mammalogists, the Histochemical Society, the Society for the Study of Reproduction, and the American Society of Zoologists. He helped found of the Annual North American Symposium on Bat Research and in 1981 he was awarded the Gerrit R. Miller prize ‚Äúfor his outstanding record of contributions to chiropteran biology.‚Äù Personal Wimsatt was born in Washington D. C., the son of Alma Engebretson Cheyney and William Church Wimsatt. In 1940, Wimsatt married Ruth Claire Peterson (a fellow student at Cornell). He had six children, William C. Wimsatt, Jr., Ph.D.; Michael, M.D.; John, A.A.S.; Mary, M. A.; Jeffrey, D.V.M.; and Ruth, B.S., five of which also received degrees from Cornell. After a courageous battle with cancer, he died January 9, 1985.

His candidacy was formally announced on November 8, 2012 through an email to his supporters. On April 2, 2013, The Democratic Party of Virginia (DPVA) certified that McAuliffe was the only candidate to file for the June primary, and was therefore the Democratic nominee. On November 5, 2013 McAuliffe was elected Governor of Virginia with 47.75% of the vote. Campaign background and formation As early as May 2012, there was speculation that McAuliffe was going to run for governor in 2013. He announced in an interview that he would run as long as Senator Mark Warner did not. McAuliffe said that he would be the first person to endorse Warner, and that he \\"left the door open a little bit\\" and would wait \\"for it to be closed before jumping in.\\" On November 8, 2012, McAuliffe sent an email to his supporters announcing his official candidacy for the Democratic Party's nominee. He stated that he had been to every corner of Virginia during the previous four years for over 2,400 meetings and events and that it was clear to him that Virginians wanted their next governor to focus on job creation and common sense fiscal responsibility instead of divisive partisan issues. McAuliffe also expressed his approval for leaders who prioritize economic growth in order to make Virginia the best place for business. McAuliffe began to make telephone calls to key Democrats in order to inform them of his intentions to run for governor. During a call with Molly Ward, the Mayor of Hampton, he said that Warner had \\"given him the green light\\" to continue with his campaign. Warner initially stated that he would announce his decision on whether he would run or not by Thanksgiving. On November 20, he made an official announcement that he would not be running and would support McAuliffe's campaign. By mid-November, McAuliffe had started to assemble his campaign team. He selected Robby Mook, the outgoing executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, as his campaign manager, as well as Levar Stoney, former executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia, as his deputy campaign manager. Campaign for the party nomination Since McAuliffe announced his candidacy, journalists and media outlets reported on his level of support among Virginia Democrats being poor. Many liberal Democrats are unenthusiastic about their choices, although Ken Cuccinelli, McAuliffe's main Republican opponent, has received similar reaction among moderate Republicans, especially those who had previously backed Bill Bolling, who dropped out of the race in November. Economic Policy During a news conference on December 5, McAuliffe discussed GreenTech Automotive, a company that he acquired from China in 2009. He stated that the Virginia Economic Development Partnership did not want to bid on the company's plans to manufacture tiny, low-speed, all-electric two-seater cars, so he took them to Mississippi instead. Over 600 pages of notes and emails revealed that Virginia officials were skeptical about these plans because the company would not provide enough details to obtain economic development incentives. On December 13, McAuliffe toured the Reston Station to speak with construction workers and discuss the needs for infrastructure and transportation improvements. He was led on the tour by officials of the Comstock Partners company, including CEO Chris Clemente, Chief Investment Officer Steve Trauner, and Director of Communications Maggie Parker. McAuliffe emphasized the effects of job creation transit improvements while speaking at the station. Domestic Policy In response to the Sandy Hook shooting in mid-December, McAuliffe called for improved mental health care and greater gun control in Virginia. He stated that the Commonwealth must prioritize the diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of mental health issues, and also that he supported a renewal of the Assault Weapons Ban, passage of bipartisan legislature to strengthen background checks, and re-implementation of Virginia's \\"one-gun-a-month\\" rule, which limited individual gun purchases to once per month. McAuliffe released another statement two days later in which he supported bipartisan legislation to station more School Resource Officers at elementary schools. As of 2007, only 1% of elementary schools in Virginia had access to these law enforcement officials, compared to 74% of middle schools and 95% of high schools. General election Fundraising Through the August 31, 2013 reporting period, McAuliffe has raised over $20 million and spent $15 million. As of August 31, 2013, the campaign has $5 million cash on hand. Through the second quarter of 2013, McAuliffe's funds include $4.7 million from the Democratic Governors Association PAC; $295,000 he donated to himself; $250,000 from Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos; $100,005 from his father-in-law, Richard Swann; and $100,000 from Bill Clinton. Through the first quarter of 2013, 72% of McAuliffe's campaign contributors were from Virginia, but 78% of his total funds came from donors from outside Virginia. NVTC TechPAC endorsement In September 2013, the business group Northern Virginia Technology Council's political arm, NVTC TechPAC, endorsed Cuccinelli for governor after interviewing both candidates. Board members said McAuliffe was his \\"flamboyant, normal self\\", \\"uninformed and superficial\\", \\"didn't want to get pinned down to any details\\", and seemed to \\"wing it\\" in their interview. According to two board members present at the interview, when asked how he planned to get things done in Richmond, he replied, \\"I‚Äôm an Irish Catholic. I like to drink. It is what is. We‚Äôll go have lunch. We‚Äôll go have drinks. We‚Äôll work the phones. We‚Äôll do whatever it takes to get things done.\\" He also said, \\"I am not going to read every bill when I‚Äôm governor. I‚Äôm going to hire people to read them for me.\\" Upon learning of the endorsement, McAuliffe's campaign and supporters launched a furious effort to try to force the group to reverse its decision. State Senator Janet Howell, a Democrat from Fairfax County, emailed the PAC warning that the response from Senate Democrats would be \\"frigid\\" when the NVTC sought help with its legislative agenda. Howell's sentiment was echoed by Democratic Minority Leader Dick Saslaw and Sen. Barbara Favola. TechPAC's chairman said the pressure was \\"hot and heavy\\", and the group delayed announcing the endorsement, but followed through and officially endorsed Cuccinelli the next week.

Written primarily by Scott Lobdell, it details the appearance of H'El, a mysterious Kryptonian. The plot of \\"H'El on Earth\\" follows H'El's plan to restore Krypton and the Superman family's attempts to stop him.  Synopsis  The story begins after Superman's encounter with alien conqueror Helspont. He engages in a training regime organized by Dr. Shay Veritas, Superman's scientific consultant, so that he can increase his power in case Helspont returns. After a few weeks of exercise in the Block, Dr. Veritas's scientific complex, Superman returns to Metropolis so that he can resume his life as Clark Kent. Realizing that Morgan Edge is manipulating the articles in order to increase his power and influence over Metropolis' media output, Clark quits the Daily Planet. Later, Superman discovers a mysterious alien dragon attacking Metropolis. After a lengthy brawl that leads to Ireland, Superman kills the dragon in an explosion. But in that moment, Kara appears to Superman, telling him that the creature he killed was a Kryptonian animal. She says that if a Kryptonian animal is on Earth, then that means Krypton must still be alive. Unknown to Superman and Supergirl, the Kryptonian H'El watches them from a distance. Meanwhile, Superboy readjusts to his life at New York City after spending sometime with the Ravagers. As he spends some time with his fellow Teen Titan Bunker, who tries to convince Kon-El to live amongst the other Titans, Superboy is attacked by H'El. As clones were outlawed by Kryptonian authorities, H'El believes Superboy to be an abomination. As Superboy and H'El clash, Bunker calls Wonder Girl, Kid Flash, and Solstice for assistance. H'El clearly outmatches Superboy in power, countering Superboy's telekinesis with his own. Effortlessly defeating the Titans, H'El teleports away with an unconscious Superboy. H'El believes that Superboy's nature as a Kryptonian-human hybrid might be useful in his plan. Superman and Supergirl take the body of the Kryptonian animal, identified as a Tripodal Curosiananium, to Dr. Veritas. She later returns to her Kryptonian base, the Sanctuary, created by her father to serve as her refuge, much like the Fortress of Solitude. Falling asleep for a while, she awakens at the surface of the Sun, with H'El standing beside her. As they return to Earth, H'El explains that he was sent to Earth by her uncle, Jor-El, before the destruction of Krypton. He offers her the chance to bring Krypton back to life, and as a token of sincerity, he shows her the unconscious body of Superboy, giving Supergirl the chance to decide his fate. Needing some time to think, Supergirl wants to speak with her cousin first, so H'El gives her the ability to understand human language and transports her to Metropolis. However, she walks in on a conversation between Clark and Lois Lane. Lois visits Clark at his apartment, where they talk about Clark's recent departure from the Daily Planet and Lois' moving in with Jonathan Carroll. In that moment, Clark receives a visit from Supergirl. To avoid an awkward moment, Clark gets Lois out of the apartment. Later, Superman and Supergirl go to the Metropolis Centennial Park. Supergirl reveals she has found another Kryptonian, H'El, who introduces himself to Superman. H'El expresses his plan to save Krypton and shows Superman the unconscious body of his clone, Superboy. H'El tries to kill Superboy, but Superman stops him, and the two engage in a fight. Superboy and Supergirl attempt to intervene, but H'El brutally knocks them out. H'El even uses mental illusions to make Supergirl believe her cousin attacked her. After defeating Superman, H'El leaves Metropolis, but not before stating that he will save Krypton with Kara's help, no matter what price Earth has to pay. Superman brings the wounded Superboy to the Fortress of Solitude in order to help him recover from his injuries. With the help of Cyborg and Dr. Veritas, Superman devises a way to cure Superboy. Detaching his Kryptonian armor, Superman places it on Superboy. Both realize that the armor is the only thing keeping Superboy alive, as H‚ÄôEl caused serious damage to Superboy‚Äôs cellular structure. Suddenly, H‚ÄôEl appears and kicks Superman and Superboy out of the Fortress. H'El brings Supergirl to the Fortress and asks her to help him in his plan to save Krypton. To do that, first they need to retrieve a crystal from the bottled city of Kandor. Since H'El cannot enter Kandor, he asks Supergirl to do so. He uses his powers to transport Supergirl to Kandor. After she retrieves the crystal, Supergirl returns to the Fortress. Beginning to sympathize with H'El's motivations, she kisses him. Seeking for a way to stop H'El, Superman and Superboy travel to the prison holding Lex Luthor. Luthor, who is mildly disfigured from a previous attack by Superman, reveals that H'El wants to travel back in time to prevent Krypton's destruction. To do so, he plans to absorb the sun's energy, collapsing the entire solar system. Luthor taunts Superman with the fact that the only way to stop H'El is by killing him, which is something he will never do. As Superman and Superboy leave the prison, Superman calls in the Justice League to help take back the Fortress. The Justice League attacks the Fortress and Superman informs that they can stop H'El by using a shard of Kryptonite stored in the Fortress. H'El sends security robots against the League while Superboy and Batman arrive to the hangar bay, where the shard is located. However, H'El already stole the shard. H'El activates an alien prison that uses teleportation beams to trap its target into perpetual parallel dimensions. One of the beams hits Superman and Superboy enters one of the beams to rescue him. Superboy locates Superman and the two are able to return home, just a few minutes after they left. Unfortunately, H'El has already completed his machine. Flash attempts to convince Supergirl that H'El is only manipulating her, but she attacks him. As they fight across the Fortress, Flash gains the upper hand but H'El teleports Flash back into the Justice League Watchtower. Superman and Superboy reach H'El and Supergirl. Superman attempts to reason with Supergirl, but H'El moves the Fortress away from the Justice League and activates his machine. Superman, Superboy and Wonder Woman fight H'El as the machine begins draining the sun's energy. H'El takes the armor from Superboy and places it on Superman again, saying that Superman should die with minor dignity. As Superman engages H'El, Wonder Woman goes to help Superboy, who is heavily injured without the armor. As Supergirl attacks him, Superboy attempts to reason with her but she does not listen. Wonder Woman attacks Supergirl while Superboy goes to H'El's machine, intending to destroy it. Wonder Woman continues fighting Supergirl, restraining her with her lasso and forcing her to see that H'El's plan will destroy Earth. H'El does not care for Earth and forces Supergirl to choose between returning to Krypton and helping the Justice League. After taking a hit from H'El, Superman is launched to Earth's orbit. There, he meets a cosmic entity known as the Oracle, who gives him a vision of H'El's plan succeeding. As the Oracle disappears, Superman returns to Earth and continues fighting H'El. Superboy manages to destroy H'El's machine, while Supergirl stabs H'El with the Kryptonite shard in order to make up for helping him in the first place. As H'El disappears in the time portal he created, Supergirl falls ill from the Kryptonite poisoning and Superman takes her to the Fortress to heal her injuries. In the epilogue, a few years before Krypton's destruction, a young Jor-El finds an injured H'El in a cave.  Titles  * Superman Vol. 3 #13‚Äì17 * Superboy Vol. 6 #14‚Äì17 (Superboy Annual #1) * Supergirl Vol. 6 #14‚Äì17  \\"Krypton Returns\\"  \\"Krypton Returns\\" is a story arc that follows the events of H'El on Earth. Written by Lobdell, the story arc will begin in Action Comics Annual #2 and continue through the November issues Superboy #25, Supergirl #25, Superman #25. After the events of H'El on Earth, H'El has been sent to the time period of Krypton's destruction and plans to change history, so Superman and his allies travel to the past in order to stop him. Krypton Returns will also link into Lobdell's run in Teen Titans and Superman #23.3, which featured H'El in the Forever Evil event. Backstory After the events of \\"H'El on Earth\\", H'El had been returned to Krypton's past and fallen into a coma. After finding H'El, Jor-El had been running experiments on him so that he could prove Krypton was about to be destroyed. H'El's mind manifests through the astral plane and he sees Jor-El talking with his friend, a young soldier named Zod, about his plans to evacuate Krypton's population to a planet where its sun's radiation could give them special powers. To do that, Jor-El wants to send an unmanned spacecraft named \\"House of El\\", equipped with genetic material collected from all of Krypton's history. H'El realizes he was in fact created from the genetic material in the ship and wakes up from his coma, killing Jor-El and Zod. After launching the ship and ensuring his own creation, H'El decides to take over Krypton. Summary Superman, Superboy and Supergirl meet up in space and discover Krypton has mysteriously returned to life. The Oracle and his servant Faora explain to them that H'El has taken over Krypton and enslaved the population. He has also been travelling across time in order to save Krypton from destruction, but his travels have caused damage to the timeline. If they do not stop him, the temporal distortions he caused will destroy the universe. They each travel to different points in Krypton's history to systematically stop H'El. Superboy travels to Argo City a week before Krypton's destruction to make sure Supergirl escapes Krypton. Supergirl travels to the age of the Great War to stop the clone rebellion from causing damage to Krypton. Superman travels to Kryptonopolis months before Krypton's explosion to stop H'El at the very moment of his success. After getting to Argo City, Superboy meets Kara but they are attacked by the Eradicator, who wants to make sure every Kryptonian dies while Krypton explodes. After a small fight, Superboy defeats the Eradicator. As Supergirl arrives at the Great War, she attacked by clones. She defeats them but is left seriously weakened, and then, H'El encounters her, with the Kryptonite shard she impaled him with. Superman is attacked by Lara, his mother, who only stops when she sees the symbol of El in his armor. Supergirl fights H'El in the Great War while Superboy continues protecting Kara in Argo City. As Superman watches Jor-El and Lara on Kryptonopolis, he encounters a mysterious person who knows about his travel in time. Superboy is attacked by the Eradicator again, but Superboy uses a portal opened by the Oracle to send the Eradicator to Smallville in the present. H'El also attacks Superboy on Argo City, but Superboy and Supergirl realize if H'El is injured in a timeline, he will take damage in another. The clones that attacked Supergirl earlier acknowledge her as their leader and help her in the battle. Superboy's confrontation with H'El does not last long, as H'El disappears. As Superboy realizes Krypton is about to explode, he tells Kara about his mission. Meanwhile, Supergirl and the clones had defeated H'El, who commits suicide. Supergirl returns to the present while Superboy uses his powers to save Argo City just when Krypton explodes, sacrificing his life. Superman has met his father Jor-El, who comes from an alternate future where he discovered he was the one who created H'El in the first place. He has also travelled to the past to ensure H'El does not conquer Krypton. Superman and Jor-El travel to Krypton's core and fight H'El. At first, Jor-El wants to kill H'El but Superman instead uses H'El own chronal powers against him and freezes him with his super-breath, locking H'El in a state of eternal limbo. As Superman and Supergirl are reunited in the present, the Oracle informs them of Superboy's sacrifice. Superman and Supergirl return to Earth but in a small instant, Krypton is brought back to life in the present, right before it disappears.

He controlled the provincial Exchequer located at Caernarfon. Background Caernarfon Castle, seat of the Exchequer and Chamberlain of North Wales With the final defeat of the Welsh Princes of Gwynedd in 1282, Edward I of England \\"annexed and united\\" North Wales to the English crown although it did not become part of the Kingdom of England but was the king's personal fief. The governance and constitutional position of the principality after its conquest was set out in the Statute of Rhuddlan of 1284. The new administration comprised a number of royal officials appointed at the King's pleasure, including the Chamberlain of North Wales. Responsibilities Based at Caernarfon, the Chamberlain managed the Principality of Wales's finances for the North Wales counties under the control of the Justiciar of North Wales. The counties within his remit were Anglesey, Merionethshire, and Caernarfonshire and he accounted for the revenues of the provincial exchequer at Caernarfon to the Exchequer at Westminster. They also kept the Great Seal of North Wales, and when leases of land were needed to be sealed or the seal applied to documents authorizing payments, the Chamberlain's advice was sought. The Chamberlains used their office to enrich themselves: for example, Tomas Barneby, Chamberlain from 1406 to 1414 was dismissed by Henry V for embezzlement and extortion.

Later, he worked at Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, and excepted an invitation to Jerusalem, Israel for one year, where he taught at Racah Institute of Physics, a division of the Hebrew University. From 1993 to 2007 he worked as Professor of Physics at the University of Vienna and was a head of Isotope Research and Nuclear Physics.Biography He founded Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator, a universal facility which operates since 1996 and is a part of Accelerator mass spectrometry. The construction was based on 3-MV model of pelletron tandem accelerator, which was one of his key interests. In 1999 he became the president of the Austrian Physical Society, but had it only for one year. Four years later he became the Dean of Faculty of Physics in University of Vienna, and 2 years later became its Vice-Dean. The same year he was awarded with a Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria. In 2008 he was promoted to Emeritus Professor of Physics. In 2010 he was awarded by Austrian Academy of Sciences with an Erwin Schr√∂dinger Prize, and a year later he became a Fellow of the American Association award for the Advancement of Science. Besides physics, his other researched include works in archaeology, art, atmospheric science, atomic and molecular physics, biomedicine, environmental physics, forensic medicine, Egyptology, geochronology, geomorphology, geophysics, glaciology, groundwater dating, nuclear astrophysics, nuclear physics, oceanography, and paleoclimatology.

At the 2012 Brazilian International Press Awards she received an award for the Best Brazilian Singer Living in the U.S. She also received the 2013 As Notaveis award for her volunteer work and community service. Born in Po√ßos de Caldas, Brazil, Fabiana Passoni began singing when she was 6 years old. Her father would sit on the couch composing songs while encouraging her vocals to mature along with his. Fabiana's father taught the budding songstress the art of interpretation and how to play to an audience. Fabiana ran a successful music school in her hometown in the late 1990s before moving to the United States. While in New York City, Fabiana began singing bossa nova jazz fusion to American audiences. Artists such as Ella Fitzgerald and Leny Andrade influenced her style. She finally found her voice after moving to Los Angeles in 2007 and began composing songs for her debut album, √â Minha Vez. Fabiana fought against breast cancer for three years, during which time she released the acclaimed Naturalmente Brasi in 2011 featuring 12 original tracks. In 2002, the Brazilian International Press Awards' Col√©gio Eleitoral composed of U.S.-based Brazilian groups and community organizations chose her as best Brazilian Female Singer living in the U.S. Fabiana's songs are a combination of jazz fusion with the older rhythms of Brazil such as bossa nova, bai√£o, and samba. Her interpretations are passionate, sensual and exciting. Fabiana is Talk 2 Brazil's 2012 Person of the Year.

It was initially released as a 34-minute short film featuring songs performed by Murphy as well as archived cult footage (including footage involving Heaven's Gate co-founder Marshall Applewhite), pornography, cartoons and 1980s films. A deluxe edition was released for download on November 28, 2012 with tracks separated, as well as bonus tracks and instrumentals. Background Captain Murphy first appeared over the summer of 2012 on the Flying Lotus-produced track \\"Between Friends\\" for the 2012 Adult Swim Singles Program. The track also featured Odd Future's Earl Sweatshirt trading verses with Murphy. Speculation began to arise that Murphy was either Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Flying Lotus, or a combination of the three due to the frequent pitch shifts in vocals. Between July and September 2012, Murphy released several music videos on YouTube that featured animation by lilfuchs. Over the months, Captain Murphy began hinting towards his debut project Duality, which was scheduled to be released in November 2012. Release On November 15, 2012, Captain Murphy started a website and posted a 34-minute video titled \\"Duality\\" that featured his music as well as archived cult footage and lilfuchs-produced animation. He then began hinting at a deluxe version with separated tracks, bonus tracks and instrumentals. On November 28, Murphy released the deluxe version for download, along with the launch of a merchandise line. The mixtape was released with separate artwork for each track, created by lilfuchs. The album features samples from the 1987 film Robocop, also referenced in Flying Lotus' rap name Captain Murphy after the titular Officer Murphy, as well as recordings of Marshall Applewhite of Heaven's gate, and archival documentary recordings. On the night of the deluxe version release, Murphy played his first show at the Low End Theory in Los Angeles, California. He performed his set in a cloak to conceal his identity, but towards the end of the show, he revealed himself to be Flying Lotus.

The group aims to promote causes related to copyright legislation, as well as online privacy and censorship through the use of the Internet.  History  The organization was founded by Tiffiniy Cheng and Holmes Wilson in October 2011, and is incorporated in Boston, Massachusetts. There is no central office and all staff work remotely. Cheng and Wilson were previously involved in Participatory Culture Foundation, a nonprofit in the area of free culture. Initial funding for the organization was provided by Media Democracy Fund. Cheng and Wilson became friends when they attended the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science, a school for talented students in Worcester. Cheng was born in a Macau refugee camp to parents who fled the Vietnam War. Before starting FFTF, the two also formed Participatory Culture Foundation, a nonprofit that works to increase cultural collaboration, and built Miro; an open-source video and music sharing platform; Open Congress, a legislation website; and Amara, a tool for crowdsourced video subtitling. After Cheng and Holmes left FFTF in 2018, Sarah Roth-Gaudette, former Chief Operating Officer, became the Executive Director. Roth-Gaudette previously managed campaigns for U.S. PIRG and MoveOn.org. Former Campaign Director Evan Greer is now Deputy Director. Greer is also an international punk folk musician and transgender activist.  Copyright campaigns  thumb  SOPA and PIPA protests  Fight for the Future was involved in the online protests against the Stop Online Piracy Act and PROTECT IP Act in January 2012. The group was involved in coordinating the action in which a number of websites displayed messages advocating against the proposed bills. Protests were based on concerns that the bills, intended to provide more robust responses to copyright infringement (also known as piracy) arising outside the United States, contained measures that could possibly infringe online freedom of speech, websites, and Internet communities. Protesters also argued that there were insufficient safeguards in place to protect sites based upon user-generated content. According to FFTF, more than 115,000 websites joined the Internet protest. Major sites like Mozilla, wikipedia, Google, Reddit, Tumblr, and Craigslist blacked out much of their homepage and directed visitors to link through which they could contact lawmakers. In addition to the online protests, there were simultaneous physical demonstrations in several U.S. cities, including New York City, San Francisco and Seattle, and separately during December 2011 a mass boycott of then‚Äìsupporter GoDaddy.  Net Neutrality campaigns  Fight for the Future created the Internet Defense League as a means of coordinating possible future protests, similar to the ones it helped organize in January 2012. The League was focused on the passage of net neutrality at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Working with Free Press and Demand Progress, FFTF launched the Battle for the Net to serve as the hub for the campaign. Internet Slowdown Day (Main article: Internet Slowdown Day) FFTF, together with Demand Progress, Engine Advocacy, and Free Press organized this Internet-wide protest on September 10, 2014, during which thousands of sites across the web displayed an alert with a symbolic 'loading' symbol to promote a call to action for users to push comments to the FCC, Congress, and the White House. The tool was credited with breaking a 1-day submission record of 780,000 comments to the FCC. On March 12, 2015, the FCC released the specific details of its new net neutrality rules, and on April 13, 2015, the final rule was published. thumb Fight for the Future organized The Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality on July 12, 2017 to advocate for net neutrality in which over 50,000 websites and apps that supported net neutrality displayed the dreaded ‚Äúspinning wheel‚Äù of a stalled connection and mimic what could happen if the FCC rolled back the rules. The protest drove millions of phone calls, emails, tweets, faxes, and comments to Congress and the FCC. Major participants included: Twitter, Etsy, OkCupid, Vimeo, ACLU, Change.org, Greenpeace. Reddit, Netflix, Spotify, 4chan, Airbnb, Mozilla, OkCupid, Vimeo, Tinder, PornHub Expedia, Imgur, and Yelp. Verizon Protests On December 7, 2017, a week before the FCC Chair Ajit Pai (former Verizon counsel) moved to repeal net neutrality, FFTF and Free Press organized over 700 protests in front of Verizon stores in every state in the country; nearly 300 people attended the rally in midtown Manhattan. A NYT article highlighted the role of young people in these protests. Congressional Review Act (CRA) After the FCC voted to repeal the 2015 Open Internet Order, FFTF applied pressure on Congress to pass the CRA which would undo the FCC's decision. On May 16, 2018, fifty United States senators including three Republican Senators, voted to restore net neutrality under the CRA. FFTF's DemsAgainstThe.net campaign targeted the 16 House Democrats who did not support the Act, listing total donations each official received from the telecom industry. The Congressional term ended before the House could act, preventing the CRA from going through. California net neutrality law (SB 822) When ISPs made an estimated $1.3 million in donations to California lawmakers to try to eviscerate the state's robust net neutrality bill, FFTF activists fought back through phone calls, texts, ad buys, lawmaker scoreboards, and crowdfunded billboards. Following reports that Verizon throttled service to firefighters battling the worst wildfire in the state's history, more than 1,000 firefighters and other first responders signed on to an open letter calling for the restoration of the rules. The California bill passed with bipartisan backing on August 31, 2018. The LA Times and other major outlets credited the public outcry for the turnaround. After the U.S. Department of Justice challenged the law in court, the state agreed to delay its implementation until a final ruling. On October 1, 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled to allow states to pass their own rules. FCC Legal Irregularities FFTF challenged the FCC's claim that DDoS attacks prevented the filing of tens of thousands of pro‚Äìnet neutrality comments. FFTF's Comcastroturf.com tool helped Internet users collectively investigate fraudulent comments submitted to the FCC's net neutrality docket using stolen identities and helped spark major investigations from members of Congress, Attorneys General, the Wall Street Journal, the Government Accountability Office, and others. Comcast tried to shut down the site, and sent FFTF a cease and design order which it later rescinded. Save the Internet Act The Act, which was introduced into Congress on March 8, 2019, sought to reverse the December 17, 2017 FCC order to repeal the 2015 Open Internet Order and codify it into law. FFTF's ‚ÄòThe Whole Internet is Watching,‚Äô protest provided a widget that let people and sites like Etsy, Tumblr, Twitter, Pornhub, BoingBoing, and Github embed the live stream of the House markup hearing on their home pages. The group said a record 300,000 tuned in to the event. When the full vote was held on April 10, FFTF reported registering six million views on their Twitch site. The bill passed the House on April 10, 2019.  Opposition to WCIT-12  Along with AccessNow.org, the group has launched an online campaign opposing the changes proposed at the 2012 World Conference on International Telecommunications. The organization believes the changes would threaten the openness of the Internet.  Surveillance and Privacy campaigns  Reset the Net In response to reports of NSA mass surveillance, Fight for the Future called for increased privacy protections on the internet to decrease the efficiency of surveillance efforts. The organization participated in a day of action on June 5, 2014 to protest NSA surveillance, the anniversary of the date the first Edward Snowden story broke detailing the government's PRISM program, based on documents leaked by the former NSA contractor. Restore the Fourth On July 4, 2013, FFTF organized ‚ÄòRestore the Fourth‚Äô rallies in 100 cities across the US to protest against NSA, PRISM, and government spying. Don‚Äôt Break Our Phones rallies On Feb 14, 2016, FFTF organized rallies in front of 40 Apple stores around the nation, putting the spotlight on how tech giants are under increasing pressure to share their data with the government. Broadband Privacy Billboards In August 2016, Fight for the Future crowdfunded ‚ÄúYou Betrayed Us‚Äù billboards in the districts of three Republican House leaders‚ÄîRepresentative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who heads a communications subcommittee; Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader; and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin-who had voted to reverse broadband privacy laws enacted by the Obama FCC. The billboards included information on how much money the pictured lawmaker had received from the telecomm lobby. Chelsea Manning After whistleblower Chelsea Manning was jailed for disclosing to WikiLeaks nearly 750,000 military and diplomatic documents, she was imprisoned from 2010 until 2017 when her sentence was commuted. FFTF, laid the groundwork for her release and crowdraising $140,000 in post-prison support. Manning has been jailed since March 8, 2019 for her continued refusal to testify before a grand jury against Julian Assange and FFTF continues to call for her immediate release. Anti-ICE Protests After Salesforce signed a $40 million contract with ICE and U.S. Border Patrol, through NoTechForIce.com, FFTF brought together groups like Color of Change, RAICES, and Mijente, to demand that the company cancel their contract with Border Patrol. A protest was held during the company's flagship Dreamforce convention in San Francisco, where more than 170,000 people were in attendance. Salesforce ultimately agreed to meet with a group representing frontline communities and has since hired its first Chief Ethical and Humane Use Officer. FFTF publicized an internal email leaked from Microsoft-owned GitHub, the world's largest software development platform, that disclosed the renewal of a $200,000 ICE contract. The email prompted hundreds of the company's employees to demand the company cancel the contract. In October 2019, the group's NoMusicForICE campaign prompted more than 1,000 independent artists to call for the boycott Amazon-backed events and partnerships over its contracts with ICE and other federal agencies. Facial Recognition FFTF's BanFacialRecognition was the first major national campaign calling for a federal ban on law enforcement use of this technology and has been endorsed by 30 major organizations. With the help of musicians including Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello, Speedy Ortiz's Sadie Dupuis, Amanda Palmer, and rappers Atmosphere, the organization was able to get more than 40 of the world's largest music festivals to sign on, including SXSW, Coachella, Lollapalooza, and Bonarroo. Its AirlinePrivacy.com campaign called on airlines to drop facial recognition screening in partnership with U.S. border control and to book directly with companies that are not using it. Amazon Ring In response to Amazon Ring's practice of giving local law enforcement access to customers‚Äô camera-enabled doorbells, FFTF launched a campaign which prompted Amazon to release the full list of 400+ cities where partnerships exist. More than 30 civil rights and immigration organizations participated in the campaign. FFTF's InvestigateAmazon.com campaign demanded that Congress investigate the threats the surveillance-based business model poses to security, privacy and civil liberties. ISP sale of customer location data After a Motherboard report found that a bounty hunter could purchase location data from Sprint, T-Mobile, and AT&T; for as little as $300, FFTF organized a rapid response campaign calling on Congress and the FCC to investigate the dangers of the sale of sensitive personal information. Through this campaign, 20,000 people called for an investigation. By May 2019, all major carriers agreed to stop the practice.  Other activities  Opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership In the summer of 2016, Fight for the Future teamed up with musician Tom Morello's label Firebrand Records to launch a Rock Against the TPP multi-city tour, featuring concerts, teach- ins, and protests of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Gamers for Freedom  After Blizzard Entertainment, a top video game company, sought to suspend Chung Ng Wai, a professional gamer in Hong Kong, for expressing his support for Hong Kong protesters and refused to award him his prize money, FFTF organized Gamers for Freedom. The campaign teamed up with gamers, redditors, and others to protest the action and encouraged subscribers to cancel their membership. HelloVote In the 2016 elections, FFTF built HelloVote, the first ever SMS and Facebook messenger chatbot for registering to vote and helping others to get to the polls.  Controversies  Dr. David Lowery, of the University of Georgia accused Fight For The Future of being an \\"astroturf\\" organization funded by Silicon Valley interests disguised as a grassroots organization, and has documented large donations from major corporate backers including Union Square Ventures and Yelp.com.

There are about 20,000 Jains and around 10 Jain organizations in Africa. History Jainism entered Africa during the late 19th century, when Jains first emigrated from India to Kenya, and then to Uganda, Sudan and Tanzania. An exodus of Asians from Uganda in 1972 due to Idi Amin's policies forced some Jains to migrate elsewhere, like Australia, North America and Europe. Jainism in Kenya Jainism in Kenya has been present for about 100 years. It is practiced by a small community that actively organizes Jain conventions, film festivals and other community programs. There are Jain temples in Nairobi and Mombasa. Jains are among the most successful and prosperous businessmen in Nairobi and other bigger towns. Jainism in South Africa Jains emigrated to South Africa under British colonial rule in India and South Africa, and were successful in trade and business. Due to the high number of Jain tourists, in addition to the resident Jain community, many South African restaurants offer Jain food.

He controlled the southern half of the principality. Background Justiciar was a title given to one of the monarch's chief ministers in both England and Scotland during the medieval period, and was introduced to Wales in the 13th century. With the final defeat of the Principality of Wales in 1282, Edward I of England \\"annexed and united\\" its territories to the English crown although it did not become part of the Kingdom of England but was the king's personal fief. The governance and constitutional position of the principality after its conquest was set out in the Statute of Rhuddlan of 1284. The new administration comprised a number of royal officials appointed at the King's pleasure, including the Justiciar of South Wales. Responsibilities Based at Carmarthen, the Justiciar was responsible for the administration of the southern part of the royal lands in Wales and acted as the King's vice-gerents in the region. The counties within his remit were Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire. They enjoyed limited powers of patronage to appoint a variety of officials within their territory.

UP School Palayathuvayal Government Upper Primary School, Kolayad is an educational institution situated within the deep tropical forests of Kolayad Panchayat, Kannur district of North Kerala, India. Of the 172 students enrolled there, most belong to the families of an ancient local tribe Kurichya. The school is situated in a region with no effective communication or transport facilities. Despite this, it has a post office, a TV news studio, a mathematics lab and a museum all formed and operated by the students.'thatsamayam Palayathu vayal' (Palayathu Vayal Live): Feature Article written by TV Vinod in Mathrubhumi News Online (Language: Malayalam)(2012 September 7) Location A team participating in a two-day knowledge interaction session hosted by the school with the local wikipedians, forest ecologists and experts from other fields in December 2012 The school is located in the Kannavam-Peruva strip of reserved forests in Kolayad Panchayat, Kannur district. Accessibility to the site is very primitive. The only public transport available, a bus by state road transport corporation that runs once in a day, is from the nearest village of Kolayad. There are no mobile or land telephone networks. Electricity is available. Kolayad can be accessed from the nearby towns Peravoor, Kuthuparamba & Iritty. From the main highway, the school is connected by road through protected forest. The forest entry point is known as Changala Gate (Chain Gate).. To ensure conservation of natural resources, access is often controlled by the department of forests, Kerala Government. Palayathu Vayal is a name derived from the days of Pazhassi Kerala Varma, a king who raised a revolt against the English rulers for the first time in the history of Indian freedom struggle. It is believed that Thalakkal Chanthu, the Commander of Kurichya army, the principal force of the King used to train his men at this place. The name Palayam (meaning military camp in Malayalm) was later transformed to Palayathu Vayal. Notability Today, the population of Kurichyas, an anthropologically important tribe, is one among the extinction-threatened community of South Asia. Even while struggling to comply with the mainstream civilization and population of India, they strive to preserve their own culture and customs.Rao Bahadur C. Gopalan Nair. Wynad : Its Peoples and Traditions. (Page 64) This school particularly is one such institution where the students are encouraged to upkeep their ancient and indigenous skills and practices. The school is run by the state government. In a remote location, the scarcity of infrastructure and facilities themselves have prompted the school to start up facilities mimicking their real world counterparts in more affluent societies. Among these are a post office, a television facility for program creation and distribution, and a museum with their exhibits mostly of instruments and artworks of their own ancient styles and an organic farm. Post office A letter written by the students to their headmaster - The envelope is posted and delivered through the 'Post office' to the addressee. The whole process is administered by students. The school has devised a postal network run by its students. The children prepare envelopes, write letters to their teachers, friends and classmates and post them in post boxes. 'Postmen' pick them up to the post office where a Postmaster sorts them out and delivers to the addressee. Each letter carries a stamp like the conventional standard. Students use the facility to submit comments to the teachers. Teachers reply as well as taking necessary redressal actions. The system helps them to improve their writing and creative skills. Television news studio and channel The students run a television news network, gathering video events by means of a video camera. The events could be their own activities, programs conducted in the school, scenes from their surroundings, local news head lines, information snippets and weekly puzzles. The sequences are edited with the help of teachers. The final release is played through television sets in class rooms. There is a daily program on world news. Museum A model depicting human evolution - crafted out of recycled paper pulp by students The school has a small museum. The exhibits are traditional tools, weapons and instruments used by Kurichya, handicrafts by students, models for science study, and items collected from local forests.  Math Lab Math lab is a project where the teachers and students create gadgets and models to help the study of mathematics. The articles include abacuses, slide rules, and place value cards. Four Plant farms In order to train the children in farming activities, the school promotes a 'Four Plant farming scheme'. Selected four plants (such as Moringa oleifera, papaya, local spinach etc.) are cultivated at a nursery at the school as well as at the students' houses. The project also aims at complementing the nutrition of these students. Biodiversity studies In 2012, a team of biologists and historians in co-operation with the Wikimedia India Chapter and several wikipedians from the local language community, chose the school and its surroundings for an expedition to explore the bio-diversity system in the area.

Formed in December 1944 from a number of existing organisations, membership of the legion is open to all ex-service personnel, including British Commonwealth and Allied personnel, and former members of the peacetime Australian regular and reserve forces. The legion has branches in each state, and sub-branches in major cities and towns, with its national headquarters located in Melbourne, Victoria. The National Council meets annually and makes submissions to government on matters affecting the ex-service community, while other activities include welfare and social events, as well as assisting with compensation and benefit claims.  History  Formed in 1926, the Association of Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Clubs of New South Wales, later that year the Association of Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Clubs (though still a NSW organization), as a peak body to represent the hundreds of ex-servicemen's clubs scattered throughout the State. It was primarily concerned with matters affecting the lives of veterans of The Great War, such as pensions, employment, health care and housing. One of its first, and most enduring, innovations was the installation of a \\"Lamp of Remembrance\\" in each club to commemorate fallen soldiers. Office holders in 1926 were B. L. Smith, president; J. H. Cask, hon. secretary; H. E. Lording, treasurer; vice- president Willingham, and councillors Hart and Rushbrooke. :Ernest Alfred Rushbrooke (c. 1897 ‚Äì September 1952) was hon. secretary 1927‚Äì1935. In 1927 W. Kennedy was elected president, D. Willingham and J. Morris vice-presidents, J. H. Cask hon. secretary and E. Rushbrooke his assistant; R. Lording hon. treasurer; and councillors W. McInnes and J. Paterson. A later reference had that year's officers G. W. Patterson as president; E. A. Rushbrooke secretary; and J. S. Davidson treasurer. In 1927 the association organised the dedication ceremony for the newly-erected Cenotaph in Martin Place, Sydney On 25 April 1928 at 4:30 a.m. a representative group from the Association laid a wreath on the Cenotaph, commemorating the time and date of the First AIF landing at Gallipoli, long recognised as Anzac Day. From this act of remembrance the Anzac Day \\"Dawn Pilgrimage\\", later Dawn Service, evolved. In 1929 the Association became The Australian Legion of Ex-Servicemen's Clubs, following the titles of similar organizations in Britain, France and America, and initiated the Anzac Day Dawn Service (as \\"Dawn Pilgrimage\\") in Sydney at the cenotaph. The assembly of Units and procession to The Domain was organised quite separately by the RSSILA. In 1932 it decided to affiliate with the League of Nations Union and protested the cut in War Service pensions. In 1933 the Legion introduced hymns into the service, and for the first time a public address system was employed.

Breckinridge by Mathew Brady The political career of John C. Breckinridge included service in the state government of Kentucky, the Federal government of the United States, as well as the government of the Confederate States of America. In 1857, 36 years old, he was inaugurated as Vice President of the United States under James Buchanan. He remains the youngest person to ever hold the office. Four years later, he ran as the presidential candidate of a dissident group of Southern Democrats, but lost the election to the Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln. A member of the Breckinridge political family, John C. Breckinridge became the first Democrat to represent Fayette County in the Kentucky House of Representatives, and in 1851, he was the first Democrat to represent Kentucky's 8th congressional district in over 20 years. A champion of strict constructionism, states' rights, and popular sovereignty, he supported Stephen A. Douglas's Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act as a means of addressing slavery in the territories acquired by the U.S. in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Considering his re-election to the House of Representatives unlikely in 1854, he returned to private life and his legal practice. He was nominated for vice president at the 1856 Democratic National Convention, and although he and Buchanan won the election, he enjoyed little influence in Buchanan's administration. In 1859, the Kentucky General Assembly elected Breckinridge to a U.S. Senate term that would begin in 1861. In the 1860 presidential contest, he captured the electoral votes of most of the Southern states, but finished a distant second among four candidates. Lincoln's election as President prompted the secession of the Southern states to form the Confederate States of America. Though Breckinridge sympathized with the Southern cause, in the Senate he worked futilely to reunite the states peacefully. After the Confederates fired on Fort Sumter, beginning the Civil War, he opposed allocating resources for Lincoln to fight the Confederacy. Fearing arrest after Kentucky sided with the Union, he fled to the Confederacy, joined the Confederate States Army, and was subsequently expelled from the Senate. He served in the Confederate Army from October 1861 to February 1865, when Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed him Confederate States Secretary of War. Then, concluding that the Confederate cause was hopeless, he encouraged Davis to negotiate a national surrender. Davis's capture on May 10, 1865 effectively ended the war, and Breckinridge fled to Cuba, then Great Britain, and finally Canada, remaining in exile until President Andrew Johnson's offer of amnesty in 1868. Returning to Kentucky, he refused all requests to resume his political career and died of complications related to war injuries in 1875. Formative years Breckinridge's grandfather, U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge, influenced his political philosophy. Historian James C. Klotter has speculated that, had John C. Breckinridge's father, Cabell, lived, he would have steered his son to the Whig Party and the Union, rather than the Democratic Party and the Confederacy, but the Kentucky Secretary of State and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives died of a fever on September 1, 1823, months before his son's third birthday.Klotter, pp. 96‚Äì97 Burdened with her husband's debts, widow Mary Breckinridge and her children moved to her in-laws' home near Lexington, Kentucky, where John C. Breckinridge's grandmother taught him the political philosophies of his late grandfather, U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 97 John Breckinridge believed the federal government was created by, and subject to, the co-equal governments of the states.Klotter, p. 108 As a state representative, he introduced the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 and 1799, which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts and asserted that states could nullify them and other federal laws that they deemed unconstitutional.Heck, p. 1 A strict constructionist, he held that the federal government could only exercise powers explicitly given to it in the Constitution. Most of the Breckinridges were Whigs, but John Breckinridge's posthumous influence inclined his grandson toward the Democratic Party.\\"John Cabell Breckinridge\\". Encyclopedia of World BiographyKlotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 103 Additionally, John C. Breckinridge's friend and law partner, Thomas W. Bullock, was from a Democratic family.Heck, pp. 11, 13 In 1842, Bullock told Breckinridge that by the time they opened their practice in Burlington, Iowa, \\"you were two-thirds of a Democrat\\"; living in heavily Democratic Iowa Territory further distanced him from Whiggery.Davis, p. 27 He wrote weekly editorials in the Democratic Iowa Territorial Gazette and Advisor, and in February 1843, he was named to the Des Moines County Democratic committee. A letter from Breckinridge's brother-in-law related that, when Breckinridge's uncle William learned that his nephew had \\"become loco-foco\\",\\"Loco-foco\\" was by then a derogatory term used by Whigs to describe the Democratic Party; see locofocos. he said, \\"I felt as I would have done if I had heard that my daughter had been dishonored.\\"Heck, p. 14 On a visit to Kentucky in 1843, Breckinridge met and married Mary Cyrene Burch, ending his time in Iowa.Heck, p. 15 Views on slavery Slavery issues dominated Breckinridge's political career, although historians disagree about Breckinridge's views. In Breckinridge: Statesman, Soldier, Symbol, William C. Davis argues that, by adulthood, Breckinridge regarded slavery as evil; his entry in the 2002 Encyclopedia of World Biography records that he advocated voluntary emancipation.Davis, p. 19 In Proud Kentuckian: John C. Breckinridge 1821‚Äì1875, Frank Heck disagrees, citing Breckinridge's consistent advocacy for slavery protections, beginning with his opposition to emancipationist candidates‚Äîincluding his uncle, Robert Jefferson Breckinridge‚Äîin the state elections of 1849.Heck, p. 163 Early influences Breckinridge's grandfather, John, owned slaves, believing it was a necessary evil in an agrarian economy.Davis, p. 5 He hoped for gradual emancipation but did not believe the federal government was empowered to effect it; Davis wrote that this became \\"family doctrine\\". As a U.S. Senator, John Breckinridge insisted that decisions about slavery in Louisiana Territory be left to its future inhabitants, essentially the \\"popular sovereignty\\" advocated by John C. Breckinridge prior to the Civil War.Davis, p. 7 John C. Breckinridge's father, Cabell, embraced gradual emancipation and opposed government interference with slavery, but Cabell's brother Robert, a Presbyterian minister, became an abolitionist, concluding that slavery was morally wrong.Davis, p. 8Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 109 Davis recorded that all the Breckinridges were pleased when the General Assembly upheld the ban on importing slaves to Kentucky in 1833.Davis, p. 17 John C. Breckinridge encountered conflicting influences as an undergraduate at Centre College and in law school at Transylvania University.Davis, pp. 14, 17 Centre President John C. Young, Breckinridge's brother-in-law, believed in states' rights and gradual emancipation, as did George Robertson, one of Breckinridge's instructors at Transylvania, but James G. Birney, father of Breckinridge's friend and Centre classmate William Birney, was an abolitionist. In an 1841 letter to Robert Breckinridge, who became his surrogate father after Cabell Breckinridge's death, John C. Breckinridge wrote that only \\"ignorant, foolish men\\" feared abolition.Davis, p. 16 In an Independence Day address in Frankfort later that year, he decried the \\"unlawful dominion over the bodies ... of men\\". An acquaintance believed that Breckinridge's move to Iowa Territory was motivated, in part, by the fact that it was a free territory under the Missouri Compromise.Davis, p. 21 After returning to Kentucky, Breckinridge became friends with abolitionists Cassius Marcellus Clay, Garrett Davis, and Orville H. Browning.Davis, p. 43 He represented freedmen in court and loaned them money. He was a Freemason and member of the First Presbyterian Church, both of which opposed slavery. Nevertheless, because blacks were educationally and socially disadvantaged in the South, Breckinridge concluded that \\"the interests of both races in the Commonwealth would be promoted by the continuance of their present relations\\".Davis, pp. 19, 44 He supported the new state constitution adopted in 1850, which forbade the immigration of freedmen to Kentucky and required emancipated slaves to be expelled from the state.Davis, p. 47 Believing it was best to relocate freedmen to the African colony of Liberia, he supported the Kentucky branch of the American Colonization Society.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 113 The 1850 Census showed that Breckinridge owned five slaves, aged 11 to 36.Heck, p. 31 Heck recorded that his slaves were well-treated but noted that this was not unusual and proved nothing about his views on slavery. Moderate reputation Because Breckinridge defended both the Union and slavery in the General Assembly, he was considered a moderate early in his political career.\\"John Cabell Breckinridge, 14th Vice President (1857‚Äì1861)\\". United States Senate In June 1864, Pennsylvania's John W. Forney opined that Breckinridge had been \\"in no sense an extremist\\" when elected to Congress in 1851. Of his early encounters with Breckinridge, Forney wrote: \\"If he had a conscientious feeling, it was hatred of slavery, and both of us, 'Democrats' as we were, frequently confessed that it was a sinful and an anti-Democratic institution, and that the day would come when it must be peaceably or forcibly removed.\\"Davis, p. 59 Heck discounts this statement, pointing out that Forney was editor of a pro-Union newspaper and Breckinridge a Confederate general at the time it was published.Heck, pp. 163‚Äì164 As late as the 1856 presidential election, some alleged that Breckinridge was an abolitionist. By the time he began his political career, Breckinridge had concluded that slavery was more a constitutional issue than a moral one. Slaves were property, and the Constitution did not empower the federal government to interfere with property rights.Klotter in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 117 From Breckinridge's constructionist viewpoint, allowing Congress to legislate emancipation without constitutional sanction would lead to \\"unlimited dominion over the territories, excluding the people of the slave states from emigrating thither with their property\\".Heck, p. 33 As a private citizen, he supported the slavery protections in the Kentucky Constitution of 1850 and denounced the Wilmot Proviso, which would have forbidden slavery in territory acquired in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. As a state legislator, he declared slavery a \\"wholly local and domestic\\" matter, to be decided separately by the residents of each state and territory.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 104 Because Washington, D.C., was a federal entity and the federal government could not interfere with property rights, he concluded that forced emancipation there was unconstitutional. As a congressman, he insisted on Congress's \\"perfect non-intervention\\" with slavery in the territories.Current, \\"John C. Breckinridge\\" Debating the 1854 Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act, he explained, \\"The right to establish [slavery in a territory by government sanction] involves the correlative right to prohibit; and, denying both, I would vote for neither.\\"Harrison, p. 127 Later views Davis notes that Breckinridge's December 21, 1859, address to the state legislature marked a change in his public statements about slavery.Davis, p. 208 He decried the Republicans' desire for \\"negro equality\\", his first public indication that he may have believed blacks were biologically inferior to whites. He declared that the Dred Scott decision showed that federal courts afforded adequate protection for slave property, but advocated a federal slave code if future courts failed to enforce those protections; this marked a departure from his previous doctrine of \\"perfect non- interference\\".Heck, p. 80 Asserting that John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry proved Republicans intended to force abolition on the South, he predicted \\"resistance [to the Republican agenda] in some form is inevitable\\". He still urged the Assembly against secession‚Äî\\"God forbid that the step shall ever be taken!\\"‚Äîbut his discussion of growing sectional conflict bothered some, including his uncle Robert.Davis, p. 209 Klotter wrote that Breckinridge's sale of a female slave and her six-week-old child in November 1857 probably ended his days as a slaveholder. Slaves were not listed among his assets in the 1860 Census, but Heck noted that he had little need for slaves at that time, since he was living in Lexington's Phoenix Hotel after returning to Kentucky from his term as vice president.Heck, p. 167 Some slavery advocates refused to support him in the 1860 presidential race because he was not a slaveholder.Harrison and Klotter, p. 184 Klotter noted that Breckinridge fared better in rural areas of the South, where there were fewer slaveholders; in urban areas where the slave population was higher, he lost to Constitutional Unionist candidate John Bell, who owned 166 slaves.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 117 William C. Davis recorded that, in most of the South, the combined votes for Bell and Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas exceeded those cast for Breckinridge.Davis, p. 245 After losing the election to Abraham Lincoln, Breckinridge worked for adoption of the Crittenden Compromise‚Äîauthored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden‚Äîas a means of preserving the Union.Davis, p. 250 Breckinridge believed the Crittenden proposal‚Äîrestoring the Missouri Compromise line as the separator between slave and free territory in exchange for stricter enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and federal non-interference with slavery in the territories and Washington, D.C.‚Äîwas the most extreme proposal to which the South would agree.Heck, p. 95Davis, p. 251 Ultimately, the compromise was rejected and the Civil War soon followed.Davis, p. 253 Early political career A supporter of the annexation of Texas and \\"manifest destiny\\", Breckinridge campaigned for James K. Polk in the 1844 presidential election, prompting a relative to observe that he was \\"making himself very conspicuous here by making flaming loco foco speeches at the Barbecues\\".Davis, p. 30Heck, p. 19 He decided against running for Scott County clerk after his law partner complained that he spent too much time in politics.Davis, p. 31 In 1845, he declined to seek election to the U.S. House of Representatives from the eighth district but campaigned for Alexander Keith Marshall, his party's unsuccessful nominee.Heck, p. 20 He supported Zachary Taylor for the presidency in mid-1847 but endorsed the Democratic ticket of Lewis Cass and William O. Butler after Taylor became a Whig in 1848. Kentucky House of Representatives Breckinridge, circa 1850 In October 1849, Kentucky voters called for a constitutional convention.Heck, p. 26 Emancipationists, including Breckinridge's uncles William and Robert, his brother-in-law John C. Young, and his friend Cassius Marcellus Clay, nominated \\"friends of emancipation\\" to seek election to the convention and the state legislature In response, Breckinridge, who opposed \\"impairing [slavery protections] in any form\\",Heck, p. 27 was nominated by a bipartisan pro-slavery convention for one of Fayette County's two seats in the Kentucky House of Representatives. With 1,481 votes, 400 more than any of his opponents, Breckinridge became the first Democrat elected to the state legislature from Fayette County, which was heavily Whig.Davis, p. 45 When the House convened in December 1849, a member from Mercer County nominated Breckinridge for Speaker against two Whigs.Davis, p. 46 After receiving 39 votes‚Äî8 short of a majority‚Äîon the first three ballots, he withdrew, and the position went to Whig Thomas Reilly. Assigned to the committees on the Judiciary and Federal Relations, Breckinridge functioned as the Democratic floor leader during the session.Heck, p. 29 Davis wrote that his most important work during the session was bank reform. Breckinridge's first speech favored allowing the Kentucky Colonization Society to use the House chamber; later, he advocated directing Congress to establish an African freedmen colony, and to meet the costs of transporting settlers there. Funding internal improvements was traditionally a Whig stance, but Breckinridge advocated conducting a state geologic survey, making the Kentucky River more navigable, chartering a turnpike, incorporating a steamboat company, and funding the Kentucky Lunatic Asylum. As a reward for supporting these projects, he presided over the approval of the Louisville and Bowling Green Railroad's charter and was appointed director of the asylum.Davis, pp. 46, 48 Resolutions outlining Kentucky's views on the proposed Compromise of 1850 were referred to the Committee on Federal Relations.Heck, p. 30 The committee's Whig majority favored one calling the compromise a \\"fair, equitable, and just basis\\" for dealing with slavery in the territories and urging Congress not to interfere with slavery there or in Washington, D.C. Feeling this left open the issue of Congress's ability to legislate emancipation, Breckinridge asserted in a competing resolution that Congress could not establish or abolish slavery in states or territories. Both resolutions, and several passed by the state Senate, were laid on the table without being adopted. Breckinridge left the session on March 4, 1850, three days before its adjournment, to tend to John Milton Breckinridge, his infant son who had fallen ill; the boy died on March 18.Davis, p. 48 To distract from his grief, he campaigned for ratification of the new constitution, objecting only to its difficult amendment process.Davis, pp. 47‚Äì48 He declined renomination, citing concerns \\"of a private and imperative nature\\".Davis, p. 49 Davis wrote that the problem was money, since his absence from Lexington had hurt his legal practice, but his son's death was also a factor. U.S. House of Representatives At an October 17, 1850, barbecue celebrating the Compromise of 1850, Breckinridge toasted its author, Whig Party founder Henry Clay.Davis, p. 50 Clay reciprocated by praising Breckinridge's grandfather and father, expressing hope that Breckinridge would use his talents to serve his country, then embracing him.Heck, p. 32Davis, p. 51 Some observers believed that Clay was endorsing Breckinridge for higher office, and Whig newspapers began referring to him as \\"a sort of half-way Whig\\" and implying that he voted for Taylor in 1848. First term (1851‚Äì1853) Delegates to the Democrats' January 1851 state convention nominated Breckinridge to represent Kentucky's eighth district in the U.S. House of Representatives.Davis, p. 52 Called the \\"Ashland district\\" because it contained Clay's Ashland estate and much of the area he once represented, Whigs typically won there by 600 to 1,000 votes. A Democrat had not represented it since 1828, and in the previous election no Democrat had sought the office.Davis, p. 53 Breckinridge's opponent, Leslie Combs, was a popular War of 1812 veteran and former state legislator.Harrison, p. 126 As they campaigned together, Breckinridge's eloquence contrasted with Combs' plainspoken style.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 105Heck, p. 34 Holding that \\"free thought needed free trade\\", Breckinridge opposed Whig protective tariffs. He only favored federal funding of internal improvements \\"of a national character\\". Carrying only three of seven counties, but bolstered by a two-to-one margin in Owen County, Breckinridge garnered 54% of the vote, winning the election by a margin of 537.Davis, pp. 55‚Äì56 Linn Boyd served as speaker during Breckinridge's tenure in the House. Considered for Speaker of the House, Breckinridge believed his election unlikely and refused to run against fellow Kentuckian Linn Boyd.Davis, pp. 58‚Äì59 Boyd was elected, and despite Breckinridge's gesture, assigned him to the lightly-regarded Foreign Affairs Committee.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 107 Breckinridge resisted United States Democratic Review editor George Nicholas Sanders' efforts to recruit him to the Young America movement.Davis, p. 61 Like Young Americans, Breckinridge favored westward expansion and free trade, but he disagreed with the movement's support of European revolutions and its disdain for older statesmen. On March 4, 1852, Breckinridge made his first speech in the House, defending presidential aspirant William Butler against charges by Florida's Edward Carrington Cabell, a Young American and distant cousin, that Butler secretly sympathized with the Free Soilers.Heck, p. 40 He denounced Sanders for his vitriolic attacks on Butler and for calling all likely Democratic presidential candidates except Stephen Douglas \\"old fogies\\".Davis, pp. 62‚Äì63 The speech made Breckinridge a target of Whigs, Young Americans, and Douglas supporters.Davis, pp. 65‚Äì66 Humphrey Marshall, a Kentucky Whig who supported incumbent President Millard Fillmore, attacked Breckinridge for claiming Fillmore had not fully disclosed his views on slavery.Davis, p. 66 Illinois' William Alexander Richardson, a Douglas backer, tried to distance Douglas from Sanders' attacks on Butler, but Breckinridge showed that Douglas endorsed the Democratic Review a month after it printed its first anti-Butler article.Davis, pp. 66‚Äì67 Finally, Breckinridge's cousin, California's Edward C. Marshall, charged that Butler would name Breckinridge Attorney General in exchange for his support and revived the charge that Breckinridge broke party ranks, supporting Zachary Taylor for president.Davis, p. 67 Breckinridge ably defended himself, but Sanders continued to attack him and Butler, claiming Butler would name Breckinridge as his running mate, even though Breckinridge was too young to qualify as vice president.Davis, p. 68 After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took a more active role in the House. In debate with Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's constitutionality and criticized Giddings for hindering the return of fugitive slaves.Heck, p. 39 He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River bridges to avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing funds for a sculpture of George Washington because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga. Beginning in April, Breckinridge made daily visits to an ailing Henry Clay.Davis, p. 69 Clay died June 29, 1852, and Breckinridge garnered nationwide praise and enhanced popularity in Kentucky after eulogizing Clay in the House.Davis, p. 70 Days later, he spoke in opposition to increasing a subsidy to the Collins Line for carrying trans- Atlantic mail, noting that Collins profited by carrying passengers and cargo on mail ships.Davis, p. 71 In wartime, the government could commandeer and retrofit Collins's steamboats as warships, but Breckinridge cited Commodore Matthew C. Perry's opinion that they would be useless in war. Finally, he showed Cornelius Vanderbilt's written statement promising to build a fleet of mail ships at his expense and carry the mail for $4 million less than Collins. Despite this, the House approved the subsidy increase.Davis, p. 72 Second term (1853‚Äì1855) With Butler's chances for the presidential nomination waning, Breckinridge convinced the Kentucky delegation to the 1852 Democratic National Convention not to nominate Butler until later balloting when he might become a compromise candidate. He urged restraint when Lewis Cass's support dropped sharply on the twentieth ballot, but Kentucky's delegates would wait no longer; on the next ballot, they nominated Butler, but he failed to gain support. After Franklin Pierce, Breckinridge's second choice, was nominated, Breckinridge tried, unsuccessfully, to recruit Douglas to Pierce's cause.Davis, p. 73 Pierce lost by 3,200 votes in Kentucky‚Äîone of four states won by Winfield Scott‚Äîbut was elected to the presidency, and appointed Breckinridge governor of Washington Territory in recognition of his efforts.Heck, pp. 37‚Äì38 Unsure of his re-election chances in Kentucky, Breckinridge had sought the appointment, but after John J. Crittenden, rumored to be his challenger, was elected to the Senate in 1853, he decided to decline it and run for re-election.Davis, p. 76 =Election= Former Governor Robert P. Letcher, Breckinridge's opponent in 1853 The Whigs chose Attorney General James Harlan to oppose Breckinridge, but he withdrew in March when some party factions opposed him.Davis, pp. 76‚Äì77 Robert P. Letcher, a former governor who had not lost in 14 elections, was the Whigs' second choice.Davis, p. 77 Letcher was an able campaigner who combined oratory and anecdotes to entertain and energize an audience. Breckinridge focused on issues in their first debate, comparing the Whig Tariff of 1842 to the Democrats' lower Walker tariff, which increased trade and yielded more tax revenue.Davis, p. 81 Instead of answering Breckinridge's points, Letcher appealed to party loyalty, claiming Breckinridge would misrepresent the district \\"because he is a Democrat\\".Davis, p. 82 Letcher appealed to Whigs \\"to protect the grave of Mr. [Henry] Clay from the impious tread of Democracy\\",\\"Democracy\\" here refers to the U.S. Democratic Party, not the form of government. but Breckinridge pointed to his friendly relations with Clay, remarking that Clay's will did not mandate that \\"his ashes be exhumed\\" and \\"thrown into the scale to influence the result of the present Congressional contest\\". Cassius Clay, Letcher's political enemy, backed Breckinridge despite their differences on slavery. Citing Clay's support and the abolitionism of Breckinridge's uncle Robert, Letcher charged that Breckinridge was an abolitionist.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 106 In answer, Breckinridge quoted newspaper accounts and sworn testimony, provided by John L. Robinson, of a speech Letcher made in Indiana for Zachary Taylor in 1848.Davis, p. 80 In the speech, made alongside Thomas Metcalfe, another former Whig governor of Kentucky, Letcher predicted that the Kentucky Constitution then being drafted would provide for gradual emancipation, declaring, \\"It is only the ultra men in the extreme South who desire the extension of slavery.\\" When Letcher confessed doubts about his election chances, Whigs began fundraising outside the district, using the money to buy votes or pay Breckinridge supporters not to vote.Davis, p. 91 Breckinridge estimated that the donations, which came from as far away as New York and included contributions from the Collins Line, totaled $30,000; Whig George Robertson believed it closer to $100,000.Davis, p. 90 Washington, D.C., banker William Wilson Corcoran contributed $1,000 to Breckinridge, who raised a few thousand dollars. Out of 12,538 votes cast, Breckinridge won by 526.Heck, p. 35 He received 71% of the vote in Owen County, which recorded 123 more votes than registered voters. Grateful for the county's support, he nicknamed his son, John Witherspoon Breckinridge, \\"Owen\\". =Service= Of 234 representatives in the House, Breckinridge was one of 80 re-elected to the Thirty-third Congress.Heck, p. 37 His relative seniority, and Pierce's election, increased his influence. He was rumored to have Pierce's backing for Speaker of the House, but he again deferred to Boyd; Maryland's Augustus R. Sollers spoiled Boyd's unanimous election by voting for Breckinridge.Davis, pp. 98‚Äì99 Still not given a committee chairmanship, he was assigned to the Ways and Means Committee, where he secured passage of a bill to cover overspending in fiscal year 1853‚Äì1854; it was the only time in his career that he solely managed a bill.Davis, p. 121 His attempts to increase Kentucky's allocation in a rivers and harbors bill were unsuccessful but popular with his Whig constituents. The Missouri Compromise Line, repealed by the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act In January 1854, Douglas introduced the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act to organize the Nebraska Territory.Davis, p. 100 Southerners had thwarted his previous attempts to organize the territory because Nebraska lay north of parallel 36¬∞30' north, the line separating slave and free territory under the Missouri Compromise.Davis, p. 101 They feared that the territory would be organized into new free states that would vote against the South on slavery issues. The Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act allowed the territory's settlers to decide whether or not to permit slavery, an implicit repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Kentucky Senator Archibald Dixon's amendment to make the repeal explicit angered northern Democrats, but Breckinridge believed it would move the slavery issue from national to local politics, and he urged Pierce to support it.Davis, pp. 104‚Äì105Heck, pp. 42, 55 Breckinridge wrote to his uncle Robert that he \\"had more to do than any man here, in putting [the Act] in its present shape\\", but Heck notes that few extant records support this claim. The repeal amendment made the act more palatable to the South; only 9 of 58 Southern congressmen voted against it.Davis, p. 119 No Northern Whigs voted for the measure, but 44 of 86 Northern Democrats voted in the affirmative, enough to pass it. The Senate quickly concurred, and Pierce signed the act into law on May 30, 1854. During the debate on the bill, New York's Francis B. Cutting demanded that Breckinridge retract or explain a statement he had made, which Breckinridge understood as a challenge to duel. Under the code duello, the challenged party selected the weapons and the distance between combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces and suggested the duel be held in Silver Spring, Maryland, on the estate of his friend, Francis Preston Blair.Heck, p. 45 Cutting had not meant his remark as a challenge, but insisted that he was now challenged and selected pistols at 10 paces. While their representatives tried to clarify matters, Breckinridge and Cutting made amends, averting the duel. Had it taken place, Breckinridge could have been removed from the House; the 1850 Kentucky Constitution prevented duelers from holding office. In the second session of the 33rd Congress, Breckinridge acted as spokesman for Ways and Means Committee bills, including a bill to assume and pay the debts Texas incurred prior to its annexation.Davis, p. 128 Breckinridge's friends, W. W. Corcoran and Jesse D. Bright, were two of Texas's major creditors. The bill, which was approved, paid only those debts related to powers Texas surrendered to Congress upon annexation.Davis, p. 129 Breckinridge was disappointed that the House defeated a measure to pay the Sioux $12,000 owed them for the 1839 purchase of an island in the Mississippi River; the debt was never paid. Another increase in the subsidy to the Collins Line passed over his opposition, but Pierce vetoed it. Retirement from the House In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig majority gerrymandered the eighth district, removing over 500 Democratic voters and replacing them with several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and Jessamine counties from the district and adding Harrison and Nicholas counties to it.Davis, p. 124 The cooperation of the Know Nothing Party‚Äîa relatively new nativist political entity‚Äîwith the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election chances. With his family again in financial straits, his wife wanted him to retire from national politics. Pierre Soul√©, the U.S. Minister to Spain, resigned in December 1854 after being unable to negotiate the annexation of Cuba and angering the Spanish by drafting the Ostend Manifesto, which called for the U.S. to take Cuba by force.Davis, p. 126 Pierce nominated Breckinridge to fill the vacancy, but did not tell him until just before the Senate's January 16 confirmation vote.Davis, p. 127 After consulting Secretary of State William L. Marcy, Breckinridge concluded that the salary was insufficient and Soul√© had so damaged Spanish relations that he would be unable to accomplish anything significant.Davis, pp. 127‚Äì128 In a letter to Pierce on February 8, 1855, he cited reasons \\"of a private and domestic nature\\" for declining the nomination.Heck, p. 48 On March 17, 1855, he announced he would retire from the House. Breckinridge and Minnesota Territory's Henry Mower Rice were among the speculators who invested in land near present-day Superior, Wisconsin.Heck, p. 50 Rice disliked Minnesota's territorial governor, Willis A. Gorman, and petitioned Pierce to replace him with Breckinridge.Heck, pp. 50‚Äì51 Pierce twice investigated Gorman, but found no grounds to remove him from office.Heck, p. 51 Breckinridge fell ill when traveling to view his investments in mid-1855 and was unable to campaign in the state elections.Heck, p. 53 Know Nothings captured every state office and six congressional districts‚Äîincluding the eighth district‚Äîand Breckinridge sent regrets to friends in Washington, D.C., promising to take a more active role in the 1856 campaigns.Heck, pp. 53‚Äì54 U.S. vice president Two Kentuckians‚ÄîBreckinridge's friend, Governor Lazarus W. Powell and his enemy, Linn Boyd‚Äîwere potential Democratic presidential nominees in 1856.Davis, p. 137 Breckinridge‚Äîa delegate to the national convention and designated as a presidential elector‚Äîfavored Pierce's re-election but convinced the state Democratic convention to leave the delegates free to support any candidate the party coalesced behind.Davis, p. 138 To a New Yorker who proposed that Breckinridge's nomination could unite the party, he replied \\"Humbug\\".Davis, p. 139 Election A campaign poster for Buchanan and Breckinridge Pierce was unable to secure the nomination at the national convention, so Breckinridge switched his support to Stephen Douglas, but the combination of Pierce and Douglas supporters did not prevent James Buchanan's nomination.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 110 After Douglas's floor manager, William Richardson, suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice president would help Buchanan secure the support of erstwhile Douglas backers in the general election, Louisiana's J. L. Lewis nominated him.Davis, p. 144 Breckinridge declined in deference to Linn Boyd but received 51 votes on the first ballot, behind Mississippi's John A. Quitman with 59, but ahead of third-place Boyd, who garnered 33.Davis, p. 145 On the second ballot, Breckinridge received overwhelming support, and opposition delegates changed their votes to make his nomination unanimous.Heck, p. 59 The election was between Buchanan and Republican John C. Fr√©mont in the north and between Buchanan and Millard Fillmore, nominated by a pro-slavery faction of the Know Nothings, in the South.Heck, p. 60 Tennessee Governor Andrew Johnson and Congressional Globe editor John C. Rives promoted the possibility that Douglas and Pierce supporters would back Fillmore in the Southern states, denying Buchanan a majority in the Electoral College and throwing the election to the House of Representatives.Davis, p. 158 There, Buchanan's opponents would prevent a vote, and the Senate's choice for vice president‚Äîcertain to be Breckinridge‚Äîwould become president. There is no evidence that Breckinridge countenanced this scheme.Davis, p. 159 Defying contemporary political convention, Breckinridge spoke frequently during the campaign, stressing Democratic fidelity to the constitution and charging that the Republican emancipationist agenda would tear the country apart.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 111 His appearances in the critical state of Pennsylvania helped allay Buchanan's fears that Breckinridge desired to throw the election to the House. \\"Buck and Breck\\" won the election with 174 electoral votes to Fr√©mont's 114 and Fillmore's 8, and Democrats carried Kentucky for the first time since 1828.Heck, p. 63 Thirty-six at the time of his inauguration on March 4, 1857, Breckinridge remains the youngest vice president in U.S. history.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 112 The Constitution requires the president and vice-president to be at least thirty- five years old. Service When Breckinridge asked to meet with Buchanan shortly after the inauguration, Buchanan told him to come to the White House and ask to see the hostess, Harriet Lane.Heck, p. 67The role of White House hostess was typically filled by the First Lady (the president's wife), but Buchanan was unmarried. His niece, Harriet Lane, functioned as the mansion's official hostess during his term. Offended, Breckinridge refused to do so; Buchanan's friends later explained that asking to see Lane was a secret instruction to take a guest to the president. Buchanan apologized for the misunderstanding, but the event portended a poor relationship between the two men.Heck, p. 68Davis, p. 171 Resentful of Breckinridge's support for both Pierce and Douglas, Buchanan allowed him little influence in the administration. Breckinridge's recommendation that former Whigs and Kentuckians‚ÄîPowell, in particular‚Äîbe included in Buchanan's cabinet went unheeded.Davis, p. 168 Kentuckians James B. Clay and Cassius M. Clay were offered diplomatic missions to Berlin and Peru, respectively, but both declined.Davis, pp. 169‚Äì170 Buchanan often asked Breckinridge to receive and entertain foreign dignitaries, but in 1858, Breckinridge declined Buchanan's request that he resign and take the again-vacant position as U.S. Minister to Spain.Davis, pp. 181, 192 The only private meeting between the two occurred near the end of Buchanan's term, when the president summoned Breckinridge to get his advice on whether to issue a proclamation declaring a day of \\"Humiliation and Prayer\\" over the divided state of the nation; Breckinridge affirmed that Buchanan should make the proclamation.Davis, pp. 250‚Äì251 A marble bust of Breckinridge from the Senate's vice-presidential bust collection As vice president, Breckinridge was tasked with presiding over the debates of the Senate. In an early address to that body, he promised, \\"It shall be my constant aim, gentlemen of the Senate, to exhibit at all times, to every member of this body, the courtesy and impartiality which are due to the representatives of equal States.\\"Davis, p. 167 Historian Lowell H. Harrison wrote that, while Breckinridge fulfilled his promise to the satisfaction of most, acting as moderator limited his participation in debate. Five tie- breaking votes provided a means of expressing his views. Economic motivations explained two‚Äîforcing an immediate vote on a codfishing tariff and limiting military pensions to $50 per month ($ in present-day currency).Davis, p. 184 A third cleared the floor for a vote on Douglas's motion to admit Oregon to the Union, and a fourth defeated Johnson's Homestead Bill.Davis, pp. 184, 195 The final vote effected a wording change in a resolution forbidding constitutional amendments that empowered Congress to interfere with property rights.Davis, p. 259 The Senate's move from the Old Senate Chamber to a more spacious one on January 4, 1859, provided another opportunity. Afforded the chance to make the last address in the old chamber, Breckinridge encouraged compromise and unity among the states to resolve sectional conflicts. Despite irregularities in the approval of the Lecompton Constitution by Kansas voters, Breckinridge agreed with Buchanan that it was legitimate, but he kept his position secret, and some believed he agreed with his friend, Stephen Douglas, that Lecompton was invalid.Davis, pp. 178, 182 Breckinridge's absence from the Senate during debate on admitting Kansas to the Union under Lecompton seemed to confirm this, but his leave‚Äîto take his wife from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where she was recovering from an illness, to Washington, D.C.‚Äîhad been planned for months.Davis, pp. 182‚Äì184 The death of his grandmother, Polly Breckinridge, prompted him to leave earlier than planned.Davis, p. 182 During his absence, both houses of Congress voted to re-submit the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas voters for approval.Davis, p. 183 On resubmission, it was overwhelmingly rejected.Davis, p. 190 By January 1859, friends knew Breckinridge desired the U.S. Senate seat of John J. Crittenden, whose term expired on March 3, 1861.Heck, p. 77 The General Assembly would elect Crittenden's successor in December 1859, so Breckinridge's election would not affect any presidential aspirations he might harbor. Democrats chose Breckinridge's friend Beriah Magoffin over Linn Boyd as their gubernatorial nominee, bolstering Breckinridge's chances for the senatorship, the presidency, or both.Heck, p. 78 Boyd was expected to be Breckinridge's chief opponent for the Senate, but he withdrew on November 28, citing ill health, and died three weeks later.Heck, p. 79 The Democratic majority in the General Assembly elected Breckinridge to succeed Crittenden by a vote of 81 to 53 over Joshua Fry Bell, whom Magoffin had defeated for the governorship in August. After Minnesota's admission to the Union in May 1858, opponents accused Breckinridge of rigging a random draw so that his friend, Henry Rice, would get the longer of the state's two Senate terms.Davis, p. 185 Senate Secretary Asbury Dickins blunted the charges, averring that he alone handled the instruments used in the drawing. Republican Senator Solomon Foot closed a special session of the Thirty-sixth Congress in March 1859 by offering a resolution praising Breckinridge for his impartiality; after the session, the Republican-leaning New York Times noted that while the star of the Buchanan administration \\"falls lower every hour in prestige and political consequence, the star of the Vice President rises higher\\".Davis, p. 197 Presidential election of 1860 Breckinridge's lukewarm support for Douglas in his 1858 senatorial re-election bid against Abraham Lincoln convinced Douglas that Breckinridge would seek the Democratic presidential nomination, but in a January 1860 letter to his uncle, Breckinridge averred he was \\"firmly resolved not to\\".Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 114 Douglas's political enemies supported Breckinridge, and Buchanan reluctantly dispensed patronage to Breckinridge allies, further alienating Douglas. After Breckinridge left open the possibility of supporting a federal slave code in 1859, Douglas wrote to Robert Toombs that he would support his enemy and fellow Georgian Alexander H. Stephens for the nomination over Breckinridge, although he would vote for Breckinridge over any Republican in the general election.Davis, pp. 212‚Äì213 Nomination Breckinridge in 1860 by Jules-√âmile Saintin Breckinridge asked James Clay to protect his interests at the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina.Heck, p. 82 Clay, Lazarus Powell, William Preston, Henry Cornelius Burnett, and James B. Beck desired to nominate Breckinridge for president, but in a compromise with Kentucky's Douglas backers, the delegation went to Charleston committed to former Treasury Secretary James Guthrie of Louisville. Fifty Southern Democrats, upset at the convention's refusal to include slavery protection in the party's platform, walked out of the convention; the remaining delegates decided that nominations required a two-thirds majority of the original 303 delegates.Davis, p. 218Harrison and Klotter, p. 183 For 35 ballots, Douglas ran well ahead of Guthrie but short of the needed majority. Arkansas's lone remaining delegate nominated Breckinridge, but Beck asked that the nomination be withdrawn because Breckinridge refused to compete with Guthrie. Twenty-one more ballots were cast, but the convention remained deadlocked. On May 3, the convention adjourned until June 18 in Baltimore, Maryland.Heck, p. 83 Breckinridge's communication with his supporters between the meetings indicated greater willingness to become a candidate, but he instructed Clay to nominate him only if his support exceeded Guthrie's.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 115 Many believed that Buchanan supported Breckinridge, but Breckinridge wrote to Beck that \\"The President is not for me except as a last necessity, that is to say not until his help will not be worth a damn.\\"Davis, p. 212 After a majority of the delegates, most of them Douglas supporters, voted to replace Alabama and Louisiana's walk-out delegates with new, pro-Douglas men in Baltimore, Virginia's delegation led another walk-out of Southern Democrats and Buchanan-controlled delegates from the northeast and Pacific coast; 105 delegates, including 10 of Kentucky's 24, left, and the remainder nominated Douglas.Heck, p. 84 The walk-outs held a rival nominating convention, styled the National Democratic Convention, at the Maryland Institute in Baltimore.Melzer, p. 218 At that convention on June 23, Massachusetts' George B. Loring nominated Breckinridge for president, and he received 81 of the 105 votes cast, the remainder going to Daniel S. Dickinson of New York. Oregon's Joseph Lane was nominated for vice-president. Breckinridge told Beck he would not accept the nomination because it would split the Democrats and ensure the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln.Davis, p. 224 On June 25, Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis proposed that Breckinridge should accept the nomination; his strength in the South would convince Douglas that his own candidacy was futile.Davis, p. 225 Breckinridge, Douglas, and Constitutional Unionist John Bell would withdraw, and Democrats could nominate a compromise candidate. Breckinridge accepted the nomination, but maintained that he had not sought it and that he had been nominated \\"against my expressed wishes\\".Heck, p. 85 Davis's compromise plan failed when Douglas refused to withdraw, believing his supporters would vote for Lincoln rather than a compromise candidate.Heck, p. 86 Election The election effectively pitted Lincoln against Douglas in the North and Breckinridge against Bell in the South.Harrison, p. 128 Far from expectant of victory, Breckinridge told Davis's wife, Varina, \\"I trust I have the courage to lead a forlorn hope.\\" Caleb Cushing oversaw the publication of several Breckinridge campaign documents, including a campaign biography and copies of his speeches on the occasion of the Senate's move to a new chamber and his election to the Senate.Davis, p. 233 After making a few short speeches during stops between Washington, D.C. and Lexington, Breckinridge stated that, consistent with contemporary custom, he would make no more speeches until after the election, but the results of an August 1860 special election to replace the deceased clerk of the Kentucky Court of Appeals convinced him that his candidacy could be faltering. He had expressed confidence that the Democratic candidate for the clerkship would win, and \\"nothing short of a defeat by 6,000 or 8,000 would alarm me for November\\". Constitutional Unionist Leslie Combs won by 23,000 votes, prompting Breckinridge to make a full-length campaign speech in Lexington on September 5, 1860.Heck, p. 87 States' electoral votes by candidate; states won by Lincoln are in red, Breckinridge states are green, Bell states are orange, and Douglas states are blue. Breckinridge's three-hour speech was primarily defensive; his moderate tone was designed to win votes in the north but risked losing Southern support to Bell.Klotter in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 118 He denied charges that he had supported Zachary Taylor over Lewis Cass in 1848, that he had sided with abolitionists in 1849, and that he had sought John Brown's pardon for the Harpers Ferry raid. Reminding the audience that Douglas wanted the Supreme Court to decide the issue of slavery in the territories, he pointed out that Douglas then denounced the Dred Scott ruling and laid out a means for territorial legislatures to circumvent it.Heck, p. 88 Breckinridge supported the legitimacy of secession but insisted it was not the solution to the country's sectional disagreements. In answer to Douglas's charge that there was not \\"a disunionist in America who is not a Breckinridge man\\", he challenged the assembled crowd \\"to point out an act, to disclose an utterance, to reveal a thought of mine hostile to the constitution and union of the States\\". He warned that Lincoln's insistence on emancipation made him the real disunionist.Heck, p. 89 Breckinridge finished third in the popular vote with 849,781 votes to Lincoln's 1,866,452, Douglas's 1,379,957, and Bell's 588,879. He carried 12 of the 15 Southern states and the border states of Maryland, Delaware and North Carolina but lost his home state to Bell. His greatest support in the Deep South came from areas that opposed secession.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, pp. 117‚Äì118 Davis pointed out that only Breckinridge garnered nearly equal support from the Deep South, the border states, and the free states of the North.Davis, p. 246 His 72 electoral votes bested Bell's 59 and Douglas's 12, but Lincoln received 180, enough to win the election. Aftermath Three weeks after the election, Breckinridge returned to Washington, D.C., to preside over the Senate's lame duck session.Heck, p. 92 Lazarus Powell, now a senator, proposed a resolution creating a committee of thirteen members to respond to the portion of Buchanan's address regarding the disturbed condition of the country.Heck, p. 94 Breckinridge appointed the members of the committee, which, in Heck's opinion, formed \\"an able committee, representing every major faction.\\" John J. Crittenden proposed a compromise by which slavery would be forbidden in territories north of parallel 36¬∞30‚Ä≤ north‚Äîthe demarcation line used in the Missouri Compromise‚Äîand permitted south of it, but the committee's five Republicans rejected the proposal. On December 31, the committee reported that it could come to no agreement. Writing to Magoffin on January 6, Breckinridge complained that the Republicans were \\"rejecting everything, proposing nothing\\" and \\"pursuing a policy which ... threatens to plunge the country into ... civil war\\". One of Breckinridge's final acts as vice-president was announcing the vote of the Electoral College to a joint session of Congress on February 13, 1861.Harrison and Klotter, p. 185 Rumors abounded that he would tamper with the vote to prevent Lincoln's election.Davis, p. 257 Knowing that some legislators planned to attend the session armed, Breckinridge asked Winfield Scott to post guards in and around the chambers. One legislator raised a point of order, requesting that the guards be ejected, but Breckinridge refused to sustain it; the electoral vote proceeded, and Breckinridge announced Lincoln's election as president.Davis, p. 258 After Lincoln's arrival in Washington, D.C., on February 24, Breckinridge visited him at the Willard Hotel.Heck, p. 97 After making a valedictory address on March 4, he swore in Hannibal Hamlin as his successor as vice president; Hamlin then swore in Breckinridge and the other incoming senators.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 118 U.S. Senate Because Republicans controlled neither house of Congress, nor the Supreme Court, Breckinridge did not believe Lincoln's election was a mandate for secession.Harrison, p. 129 Ignoring James Murray Mason's contention that no Southerner should serve in Lincoln's cabinet, Breckinridge supported the appointment of Virginian Montgomery Blair as Postmaster General. He also voted against a resolution to remove the names of the senators from seceded states from the Senate roll.Davis, p. 262For a list of individuals expelled from the U.S. Senate, see List of United States senators expelled or censured. For a list of seceded states and their dates of secession, see Confederate States of America#States. Breckinridge as a senator Working for a compromise that might yet save the Union, Breckinridge opposed a proposal by Ohio's Clement Vallandigham that the border states unite to form a \\"middle confederacy\\" that would place a buffer between the U.S. and the seceded states, nor did Breckinridge desire to see Kentucky as the southernmost state in a northern confederacy; its position south of the Ohio River left it too vulnerable to the southern confederacy should war occur.Davis, p. 261 Urging that federal troops be withdrawn from the seceded states, he insisted \\"their presence can accomplish no good, but will certainly produce incalculable mischief\\".Heck, p. 98 He warned that, unless Republicans made some concessions, Kentucky and the other border states would also secede. When the legislative session ended on March 28, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky and addressed the state legislature on April 2, 1861. He urged the General Assembly to push for federal adoption of the Crittenden Compromise and advocated calling a border states convention, which would draft a compromise proposal and submit it to the Northern and Southern states for adoption.Harrison and Klotter, p. 187 Asserting that the states were coequal and free to choose their own course, he maintained that, if the border states convention failed, Kentucky should call a sovereignty convention and join the Confederacy as a last resort.Davis, p. 264 The Battle of Fort Sumter, which began the Civil War, occurred days later, before the border states convention could be held. Magoffin called a special legislative session on May 6, and the legislature authorized creation of a six-man commission to decide the state's course in the war.Harrison and Klotter, p. 188 Breckinridge, Magoffin, and Richard Hawes were the states' rights delegates to the conference, while Crittenden, Archibald Dixon, and Samuel S. Nicholas represented the Unionist position. The delegates were only able to agree on a policy of armed neutrality, which Breckinridge believed impractical and ultimately untenable, but preferable to more drastic actions. In special elections held June 20, 1861, Unionists won nine of Kentucky's ten House seats, and in the August 5 state elections, Unionists gained majorities in both houses of the state legislature. When the Senate convened for a special session on July 4, 1861, Breckinridge stood almost alone in opposition to the war.Harrison, p. 130 Labeled a traitor, he was removed from the Committee on Military Affairs.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 120Davis, p. 268 He demanded to know what authority Lincoln had to blockade Southern ports or suspend the writ of habeas corpus. He reminded his fellow senators that Congress had not approved a declaration of war and maintained that Lincoln's enlistment of men and expenditure of funds for the war effort were unconstitutional. If the Union could be persuaded not to attack the Confederacy, he predicted that \\"all those sentiments of common interest and feeling ... might lead to a political reunion founded upon consent\\".Klotter, p. 119 On August 1, he declared that if Kentucky supported Lincoln's prosecution of the war, \\"she will be represented by some other man on the floor of this Senate.\\" Asked by Oregon's Edward Dickinson Baker how he would handle the secession crisis, he responded, \\"I would prefer to see these States all reunited upon true constitutional principles to any other object that could be offered me in life ... But I infinitely prefer to see a peaceful separation of these States, than to see endless, aimless, devastating war, at the end of which I see the grave of public liberty and of personal freedom.\\"Davis, p. 276 In early September, Confederate and Union forces entered Kentucky, ending her neutrality. On September 18, Unionists shut down the pro-Southern Louisville Courier newspaper and arrested former governor Charles S. Morehead, who was suspected of having Confederate sympathies.Davis, p. 285 Learning that Colonel Thomas E. Bramlette was under orders to arrest him, Breckinridge fled to Prestonsburg, Kentucky, where he was joined by Confederate sympathizers George W. Johnson, George Baird Hodge, William E. Simms, and William Preston.Heck, p. 104 The group continued to Abingdon, Virginia, where they took a train to Confederate-held Bowling Green, Kentucky. On October 2, 1861, the Kentucky General Assembly passed a resolution declaring that neither of the state's U.S. Senators‚ÄîBreckinridge and Powell‚Äîrepresented the will of the state's citizens and requesting that both resign.Davis, p. 296 Governor Magoffin refused to endorse the resolution, preventing its enforcement. Writing from Bowling Green on October 8, Breckinridge declared, \\"I exchange with proud satisfaction a term of six years in the Senate of the United States for the musket of a soldier.\\" Later that month, he was part of a convention in Confederate-controlled Russellville, Kentucky, that denounced the Unionist legislature as not representing the will of most Kentuckians and called for a sovereignty convention to be held in that city on November 18.Harrison and Klotter, p. 192 Breckinridge, George W. Johnson, and Humphrey Marshall were named to the planning committee, but Breckinridge did not attend the convention, which created a provisional Confederate government for Kentucky. On November 6, Breckinridge was indicted for treason in a federal court in Frankfort. The Senate passed a resolution formally expelling him on December 2, 1861; Powell was the only member to vote against the resolution, claiming that Breckinridge's statement of October 8 amounted to a resignation, rendering the resolution unnecessary. Confederate Secretary of War Breckinridge served in the Confederate Army from November 2, 1861, until early 1865. In mid-January 1865, Confederate President Jefferson Davis summoned Breckinridge to the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia, and rumors followed that Davis would appoint Breckinridge Confederate States Secretary of War, replacing James A. Seddon.Heck, p. 132Davis, p. 478 Breckinridge arrived in Richmond on January 17, and some time in the next two weeks, Davis offered him the appointment.Davis, pp. 478‚Äì479 Breckinridge made his acceptance conditional upon the removal of Lucius B. Northrop from his office as Confederate Commissary General.Davis, p. 480 Most Confederate officers regarded Northrop as inept, but Davis had long defended him. Davis relented on January 30, allowing Seddon to replace Northrop with Breckinridge's friend, Eli Metcalfe Bruce, on an interim basis; Breckinridge accepted Davis's appointment the next day. A Lexington, Kentucky, statue honoring Breckinridge depicts him with the mustache he grew during the war. Some Confederate congressmen were believed to oppose Breckinridge because he had waited so long to join the Confederacy, but his nomination was confirmed unanimously on February 6, 1865.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 128 At 44 years old, he was the youngest person to serve in the Confederate president's cabinet. Klotter called Breckinridge \\"perhaps the most effective of those who held that office\\", but Harrison wrote that \\"no one could have done much with the War Department at that late date\\".Harrison, p. 131 While his predecessors had largely served Davis's interests, Breckinridge functioned independently, assigning officers, recommending promotions, and consulting on strategy with Confederate generals. Breckinridge's first act as secretary was to meet with assistant secretary John Archibald Campbell, who had opposed Breckinridge's nomination, believing he would focus on a select few of the department's bureaus and ignore the rest.Davis, pp. 485‚Äì486 During their conference, Campbell expressed his desire to retain his post, and Breckinridge agreed, delegating many of the day-to-day details of the department's operation to him.Davis, p. 486 Breckinridge recommended that Davis appoint Isaac M. St. John, head of the Confederate Nitre and Mining Bureau, as permanent commissary general.Davis, p. 487 Davis made the appointment on February 15, and the flow of supplies to Confederate armies improved under St. John.Heck, p. 133 With Confederate ranks plagued by desertion, Breckinridge instituted a draft; when this proved ineffective, he negotiated the resumption of prisoner exchanges with the Union in order to replenish the Confederates' depleted manpower.Davis, p. 491 By late February, Breckinridge had concluded that the Confederate cause was hopeless. He opposed the use of guerrilla warfare by Confederate forces and urged a national surrender. Meeting with Confederate senators from Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Texas, he urged, \\"This has been a magnificent epic. In God's name let it not terminate in a farce.\\" In April, with Union forces approaching Richmond, Breckinridge organized the escape of the other cabinet officials to Danville, Virginia.Heck, p. 134 Afterward, he ordered the burning of the bridges over the James River and ensured the destruction of buildings and supplies that might aid the enemy. During the surrender of the city, he helped preserve the Confederate government and military records housed there. After a brief rendezvous with Robert E. Lee's retreating forces at Farmville, Virginia, Breckinridge moved south to Greensboro, North Carolina, where he, Naval Secretary Stephen Mallory, and Postmaster General John Henninger Reagan joined Generals Joseph E. Johnston and P. G. T. Beauregard to urge surrender.Davis, p. 507 Davis and Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin initially resisted, but eventually asked Major General William T. Sherman to parley.Heck, p. 135 Johnston and Breckinridge negotiated terms with Sherman, but President Andrew Johnson (who had assumed the presidency on Lincoln's assassination on April 15) rejected them as too generous.Heck, pp. 135‚Äì136Harrison, p. 138 On Davis' orders, Breckinridge told Johnston to meet Richard Taylor in Alabama, but Johnston, believing his men would refuse to fight any longer, surrendered to Sherman on similar terms to those offered to Lee at Appomattox.Heck, p. 136 After the failed negotiations, Confederate Attorney General George Davis and Confederate Treasury Secretary George Trenholm resigned.Davis, p. 518 The rest of the Confederate cabinet‚Äîescorted by over 2,000 cavalrymen under Basil W. Duke and Breckinridge's cousin William Campbell Preston Breckinridge‚Äîtraveled southwest to meet Taylor at Mobile. Believing that the Confederate cause was not yet lost, Davis convened a council of war on May 2 in Abbeville, South Carolina, but the cavalry commanders told him that the only cause for which their men would fight was to aid Davis's escape from the country.Heck, p. 137Davis, pp. 519‚Äì520 Informed that gold and silver coins and bullion from the Confederate treasury were at the train depot in Abbeville, Breckinridge ordered Duke to load it onto wagons and guard it as they continued southward.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 129Davis, p. 520 En route to Washington, Georgia, some members of the cabinet's escort threatened to take their back salaries by force. Breckinridge had intended to wait until their arrival to make the payments, but to avoid mutiny, he dispersed some of the funds immediately. Two brigades deserted immediately after being paid; the rest continued to Washington, where the remaining funds were deposited in a local bank.Heck, pp. 137‚Äì138 Discharging most of the remaining escort, Breckinridge left Washington with a small party on May 5, hoping to distract federal forces from the fleeing Confederate president.Heck, p. 138 Between Washington and Woodstock, the party was overtaken by Union forces under Lieutenant Colonel Andrew K. Campbell; Breckinridge ordered his nephew to surrender while he, his sons Cabell and Clifton, James B. Clay, Jr., and a few others fled into the nearby woods.Davis, p. 524 At Sandersville, he sent Clay and Clifton home, announcing that he and the rest of his companions would proceed to Madison, Florida.Davis, p. 525 On May 11, they reached Milltown, Georgia, where Breckinridge expected to rendezvous with Davis, but on May 14, he learned of Davis's capture days earlier.Davis, p. 528 Later life Besides marking the end of the Confederacy and the war, Davis's capture left Breckinridge as the highest-ranking former Confederate still at large. Fearing arrest, he fled to Cuba, Great Britain, and Canada, where he lived in exile. Andrew Johnson issued a proclamation of amnesty for all former Confederates in December 1868, and Breckinridge returned home the following March. Friends and government officials, including President Ulysses S. Grant, urged him to return to politics, but he declared himself \\"an extinct volcano\\" and never sought public office again. He died of complications from war-related injuries on May 17, 1875.Heck, p. 160 Notes References Bibliography   Category:Political careers by person Category:Politics of Kentucky ","title":"Political career of John C.

The film premiered at the United Kingdom film festival Fright Fest in August 2011. A Night in the Woods was produced by Vertigo Films and stars Anna Skellern, Scoot McNairy, and Andrew Hawley. Plot The film follows Londoner Kerry (Anna Skellern) and her American boyfriend Brody (Scoot McNairy) as they travel to Dartmoor for a camping trip. Brody has decided to document their trip with his video camera. He grows irritated and jealous when Kerry invites her cousin Leo (Andrew Hawley), although Brody tries to hide this by acting friendly towards Leo. The trio stops by a pub, where they hear the story of a local legend called The Huntsman, who carves crosses into the foreheads of sinners before killing them. Brody grows increasingly more jealous of Leo after seeing him and Kerry joking around, making him doubt Kerry‚Äôs claims that Leo is her cousin. Things grow more tense as he confronts Leo over footage of Leo sneaking into Kerry and Brody‚Äôs home. Brody attempts to catch Kerry and Leo by setting his camera up in the tent, which proves to be effective. It is revealed that not only are the two not related, but that they used to be lovers and Kerry lied to Brody in order to make things easier. Left alone, Kerry and Leo begin to have a fling, which is cut short when Leo hurts Kerry. He tries to apologize, but is rejected when he suggests that Brody is trying to replace her recently dead father. Leo then leaves Kerry alone in the woods. Strange things begin to happen around the now alone Kerry such as strange noises and nooses tied to tree branches. Kerry is then chased into the woods by an unseen force, who knocks her out and carves a cross on her forehead. She manages to regain consciousness and returns to the campsite, where she angrily discovers the camera that Brody had set up in the tent as well as footage he had been secretly recording of her. This is further exacerbated by footage of her experiencing a nightmare while sleeping as well as a clip of Brody discussing plans to abandon Kerry in the woods so she can experience a solitude that he once experienced in exactly the same woods 10 years earlier. This infuriates Kerry, who then turns to the camera and threatens to hurt Brody. Her anger is cut somewhat short when the tent is violently shaken and she discovers a devastated Leo, all bruised and cut. Kerry tries to help him, but he attacks her in a fit of rage and chases her into the woods. She runs into a bruised and bleeding Brody, who convinces her that Leo is not himself and that they are being hunted by an unknown force. They try to find a way out of the woods, but Kerry fights with Brody after discovering Leo‚Äôs bracelet on the ground and suspecting Brody of wrongdoing. She manages to fight Brody off, killing him in the process but leaving her alone and hunted in the woods. Kerry then discovers Leo‚Äôs digital camera on the ground, where she views a clip of Brody being attacked and dragged away by an unseen assailant. Frightened, Kerry tries to find a way out but is attacked, causing the camera to cut to black. Cast *Scoot McNairy as Brody Cartwright *Anna Skellern as Kerry Hastings *Andrew Hawley as Leo Reception Critical reception for the film has been mixed, with the film holding a 42% \\"rotten\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 12 reviews. The Daily Record gave A Night in the Woods two out of five stars, criticizing the film as a Blair Witch Project ripoff that \\"fails to provide any real moments of horror\\". Screen Daily remarked that the last part of the film was \\"shades a little too much into incomprehensibility\\" but praised the film's acting.

The company comprises two wine labels: Blackbird Vineyards and Recuerdo Wines, and a wine, art and design gallery called Ma(i)sonry Napa Valley. Bespoke Collection also has an additional art gallery in St. Helena, California called I. Wolk Gallery. History Michael Polenske at Ma(i)sonry, 2010 Michael Polenske purchased the Blackbird Vineyard, in Oak Knoll District in California, in 2003 as a vacation retreat. The 10-acre property has a vineyard, a 100-year-old farm house, a ranch home and a pool. Polenske left his job in finance in 2006, to create a luxury brand focusing on wine, art and design, which would become the Bespoke Collection. Polenske's interest in wine was instilled in him when his father, a pilot in the military, was stationed at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California. He moved from his San Francisco apartment to live full- time in Napa Valley. Polenske opened Ma(i)sonry Napa Valley, a wine, art, and design gallery, in 2008. In 2010, Polenske purchased the I. Wolk Gallery in St. Helena, California. Bespoke Collection also introduced a membership program, which offers members access to limited production wines from the Bespoke Collection labels and to exclusive events. They also have a benefit program, called Bespoke Benefits, which allows members to earn points based on purchases made of Bespoke Collection products, including art and design pieces. In March 2014, Bespoke Collection opened a new art and design gallery in Healdsburg, California. Blackbird Vineyards After the purchasing the Blackbird Vineyard, Polenske created a wine label based around the Merlot grapes grown in the vineyard. Blackbird produces Pomerol-inspired, proprietary red wines by blending Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Cabernet Sauvignon. They also produce a ros√© from those three varietals. The wine labels have flocks of blackbirds on them. Ma(i)sonry Napa Valley Ma(i)sonry is a wine, art and design gallery located in Yountville, California. It was created in 2007 and opened in October 2008, when Michael Polenske purchased a stone building that was a former hotel for over 50 years. The name is a play on the French word maison and the English word masonry. Ma(i)sonry sells contemporary and modern art and vintage and new furniture, including select items designed by Polenske, and has featured works by Alexandra von F√ºrstenberg, Jedd Novatt, Greg Lauren, and David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley. They host trunk shows by San Francisco Bay Area fashion lines. Selected artworks are on display inside and outside at Ma(i)sonry's sculpture garden. An additional sculpture garden is located at Auberge du Soleil in Napa Valley, called the Ma(i)sonry Sculpture Gallery, and with additional gardens at MacArthur Place in Sonoma and Solage in Calistoga. Ma(i)sonry Ma(i)sonry offers visitors the opportunity to sample wines from nineteen vintners, including Bespoke Collection brands ‚Äì Blackbird Vineyards and Recuerdo Wines. They also have a wine flight and food pairing program, which Bespoke Collection wine with food from Thomas Keller's restaurant Addendum. In 2011, Ma(i)sonry held a series of winemaker dinners with boutique wines and food catered by Cindy Pawlcyn. Blackbird Vineyards winemaker, Aaron Pott has produced wines for Ma(i)sonry, including a Marsanne, Tempranillo, Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon and a proprietary red blend. All of the wines are produced from Napa Valley fruit and are made under the label Ma(i)sonry Napa Valley. Ma(i)sonry has a wine club called Medallion, which gives members first access to new boutique wines, special event access, and complimentary tastings at the tasting room. Ma(i)sonry has partnered with the Robb Report for Auction Napa Valley live lot packages. In 2013, Ma(i)sonry opened its first tasting room outside of Yountville, on the top floor of Restoration Hardware's Gallery at the Historic Museum of Natural History in Boston, Massachusetts. Ma(i)sonry was chosen as one of The New York Times must-visit places in a one-day visit to Napa Valley, in 2010. It was awarded the 2013 Best of Wine Tourism for Napa Valley for Art & Culture. History and architecture The building that houses Ma(i)sonry is one of two buildings in Yountville listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built in 1904 as a house for Charles Rovegno, a farmer. It has two stories and totals 3,000 square feet. The building was the Burgundy House Inn starting in the 1970s, until becoming Ma(i)sonry in 2007. The building underwent eighteen months of renovations by architect Douglas Thornley and the Roche + Roche Landscape Architecture firm. Roche + Roche created five outdoor spaces for wine tasting in a garden setting, which includes a fire pit and a redwood table that is five inches thick and 36-feet long. Polenske describes the exterior as a \\"living gallery.\\" The space takes influence from Belgian designer and antique dealer Axel Vervoodt's castle. There is also a private tasting room that overlooks the gardens. Recuerdo Wines Recuerdo Wines is a line of wines based in Mendoza, Argentina. The wines are produced through The Vines of Mendoza and created by winemakers Santiago Ach√°val and Pablo Martorell. Recuerdo focuses on Malbec wine. They also produce a Torront√©s.

Most of his career was spent with Corinthians, representing the club during one full decade. He was given the nickname Teleco by his grandmother when he was a young boy. He was referred to as \\"O Rei das Viradas\\" (King of the Twist) and \\"O Homem Gol\\" (Goal Man), for his exploits with his main club, scoring 251 goals in 246 games as well as helping it to four state titles. For these achievements, he is considered by many as a legend of the club and one of its greatest ever players. Football career Teleco began his career with Brit√¢nia Sport Club in 1933, one of the clubs that gave rise to Paran√° Clube through various mergers, before moving a year later to Corinthians. He moved to Corinthians only two years after Paulistas armed themselves in a revolution against dictator Get√∫lio Vargas, becoming the first black player to play for the club. He made his debut for Corinthians on 16 December 1934, when his side was crushed 5-0 by Vasco de Gama. His first goal for the club came soon after, in the last match of 1934, netting twice in the 4-1 defeat of Portuguesa. In the first game of 1935 on 6 January, Teleco scored twice more in Corinthians's 3-0 defeat of Hespanha. On 10 February, Teleco helped his side defeat Argentine giants Boca Juniors by a score of 2-0 in an international friendly. On 4 August, he inspired his team to victory over traditional rivals Palestra It√°lia by a score of 4-1, ending five years without a victory over Palestra. On 8 December 1935, Teleco helped his side to victory over Portuguesa Santista. The win would start an incredible run of 39 games without defeat for Corinthians, spanning a year and 3 months; despite this his side still fell just short to the title because of a loss in the penultimate round of the 1936 Campeonato Paulista to Palestra. After dramatically falling short in the 1936 Campeonato Paulista to rivals Palestra, Teleco inspired Corinthians to the title in 1937 over the same team. With a broken arm, Teleco was out of the game against Palestra on 14 November 1937, but his replacement Zuza passed out on hearing that he would replace Teleco. Wearing a large jersey to hide the bamboo sling holding his arm, Teleco netted his side's first goal on the 20th minute mark, engineering a derby victory. With a 0-0 draw against Juventus and a 3-0 defeat of Clube Atl√©tico Estudante Paulista, Corinthians won their first Paulista championship with Teleco, as he finished as the tournament's top scorer with 15 goals. Teleco would play for a decade with Corinthians, netting 251 goals in 246 games. He earned the nickname O Rei das Viradas because of his signature move of having his back to goal before quickly twisting his body into the air to score a goal. This goal-scoring record meant that he averaged 1.02 goals a game, higher than the 0.93 mark of Brazilian legend Pel√©. He played his last competitive game for the club, aged 30, against Ypiranga in March 1944. He left Corinthians as its all-time leading scorer, he now ranks third in that list behind Baltazar and Cl√°udio, and joined Santos for a short time before retiring from football. In the 246 games that Teleco played with Corinthians, his side won 155 games and only lost 38 times. Teleco was top scorer of the Campeonato Paulista on five occasions, nine goals in 1935, 28 in 1936, 15 in 1937, 32 in 1939 and 26 in 1941. He also managed to win four Paulista championships during this time, 1937, 1938, 1939 and 1941. This record of five top scoring honors in a top division, ranks among some of the highest in the world, level with the greats Jean-Pierre Papin and Delio Onnis and fellow Brazilian Mario Jardel. Later years and death Following his career, Teleco worked for Corinthians, taking care of the club's trophy room from 1967 until 1991. In 1971, the Brazilian magazine \\"Grandes Times Brasileiros\\" placed Teleco into Corinthians's All-Time Team. He died on the morning of 22 July 2000, with the cause of death being undisclosed. He was 86 years old.

Greg LeMond competed at a time when performance enhancing drugs were just beginning to impact his sport. Rumors of improprieties existed, including USA Cycling's blood doping at the 1984 LA Olympics and Francesco Moser's same measures prior to his 1984 assault on the hour record, but legalities were not sharply demarcated and the practice was not spoken of in the open. Considered one of the most talented cyclists of his generation, from his earliest days of professional cycling LeMond was strongly against taking performance enhancing drugs, largely on the basis of the health risks such practices posed. His career lacks the suspicious results that have tarnished his successors. His willingness to speak out against doping and those prominent individuals involved inadvertently linked him with the sport‚Äôs doping scandal controversies. In his opposition to fraud, corruption and what he saw as complicity on the part of cycling officials, LeMond became a lightning rod with the sports most prominent personalities. In 2001 LeMond was one of the first professional cyclists of note, and the only former Tour champion, to openly express doubts over the legitimacy of Lance Armstrong's three-consecutive Tour successes. He consistently questioned the relationship between riders and sports doctors like Italian Michele Ferrari. In 2006 LeMond noted that the extent of doping in the sport could not occur without complicity from the body that regulates international professional cycling, and he accused the Union Cycliste Internationale of serious doping-related corruption.Greg LeMond - 'Cycling is dying through Drugs' at Play the Game Conference, 27:00 and 44:00 Play the Game Conference, Coventry University, 2009 Jun 12, retr 2012 10 14UCI's failure to silence LeMond, Daniel Benson and Susan Westemeyer, Cycling News, October 4, 2012 In an open letter in December 2012 he asserted that UCI's Pat McQuaid and Hein Verbruggen were central to the problem in professional cycling. LeMond claimed professional cyclists are treated as \\"lab rats,\\" while the doping facilitators escape harm or responsibility. He told an audience at Coventry University, \\"The doctors, the management, the officials, they're the ones that have corrupted riders. The riders are the only ones that pay the price\\". LeMond's statements have brought him into conflict with some of the sport's elite, including the UCI's McQuaid and Verbruggen, the Trek Bicycle Corporation, and riders Lance Armstrong, Floyd Landis, and Alberto Contador. In the interests of reforming the sport, LeMond offered to serve as president of the UCI, taking over the position of former president Pat McQuaid. UCI and Pat McQuaid Former UCI President Pat McQuaid In around 2006, LeMond had described Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) as \\"corrupt\\" in an interview in L'√âquipe about doping in the sport. In response the UCI and Pat McQuaid threatened to sue him for defamation in Switzerland. In 2007 LeMond, inspired by a positive experience at L'√âtape du Tour, felt that perhaps the Tour de France could start a clean-up in the sport by separating from UCI. He made his feelings known to Patrice Clerc and Christian Prudhomme. LeMond soon after received a letter from UCI's Pat McQuaid threatening him with another lawsuit. British Cycling president Brian Cookson Following the United States Anti- Doping Agency findings against Lance Armstrong and U.S. Postal Service in 2012, LeMond stated that a change needed to be made at the head of leadership for the UCI, and stated if called upon he would be willing to take the position himself if necessary to lead cycling out of the mire of doping. Said LeMond: \\"It is now or never to act. After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case, another chance will not arise. I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic, transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term.\\" Lemond came to support British Cycling president Brian Cookson in the UCI Presidential battle. Said Lemond: ‚ÄúI have met and spent some time discussing with Brian about where cycling lost its way, how it lost its way, and what to do to bring the sport back to where it is not only a sport that leads by example, but a sport that inspires people once again. I feel confident after meeting Brian that his interest is to bring honest and transparent leadership to a sport that so desperately needs it. My hope is Brian will be the one to bring all interested parties together to once and for all do what was needed to be done years before, find solutions, both short term and long term, and to make it a priority that cycling comes first, not the other way around.‚Äù Cookson defeated McQuaid at the September 2013 UCI Congress in Florence, Italy. Lance Armstrong and Trek Lance Armstrong In July 2001, LeMond criticized Lance Armstrong for associating with Michele Ferrari, an Italian physician and sports trainer who admitted to practicing blood doping and advocated the controlled use of the banned substance erythropoietin by athletes.

Following LeMond's 2001 statement, Trek threatened LeMond with litigation and financial consequences, according to a 2008 lawsuit by LeMond Cycles against Trek. Trek had been licensing LeMond cycles since the 1990s and the brand had become successful. Armstrong's business relationship with Trek had become very strong as well after his Tour victories.

At a press conference Armstrong gave September 2008 to announce his return to cycling, LeMond was on hand sitting in the front row, and publicly challenged Armstrong with questions about doping. Armstrong appeared angry and interrupted LeMond, telling him it was time to move on. On February 16, 2011, Armstrong announced his retirement from competitive cycling. At the time he was facing a US federal investigation into doping allegations. In June 2012, USADA charged Armstrong with having used illicit performance-enhancing drugs. On August 24, 2012, the USADA announced that Armstrong had been issued a lifetime ban from competition, applicable to all sports which follow the World Anti-Doping Agency code. The USADA report concluded that Armstrong engaged in \\"the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen.\\" In addition, the USADA stripped Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles. On October 22, 2012, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the sport's governing body, announced its decision to accept USADA's findings. Armstrong chose not to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Despite having denied drug use throughout his career, in January 2013 he admitted to doping in a television interview conducted by Oprah Winfrey. Floyd Landis Floyd Landis at the start of Stage 18 of the 2006 Tour de France. On May 17, 2007, LeMond testified at a USADA hearing convened to weigh the evidence of doping by Floyd Landis during the 2006 Tour de France. Under oath, LeMond described a phone conversation he had with Landis on August 6, 2006, as well as another with Landis' business manager, Will Geoghegan, on May 16, 2007, the evening before LeMond appeared to testify. The major points of the testimony were: *In an August 6 phone conversation, LeMond said he told Landis that \\"If you did (admit to having used banned substances), you could single-handedly change the sport. You could be the one who will salvage the sport.\\" LeMond said Landis responded by saying \\"What good would it do? If I did, it would destroy a lot of my friends and hurt a lot of people.\\" * In their conversation, LeMond had disclosed his history of childhood sexual abuse to Landis, and said the secret had nearly destroyed him. LeMond stated he warned Landis. \\"(Lying about doping) will come back to haunt you when you are 40 or 50. If you have a moral compass and ethics, this will destroy you.\\" * Will Geoghegan attempted to stop LeMond's testimony by calling LeMond at his personal mobile phone number. LeMond reported that Geoghegan claimed he was \\"his uncle\\" and that he would be at the hearing to talk about what had happened between them. LeMond's BlackBerry, with Geoghegan's phone number captured in the call log, was entered into evidence. During a break in the testimony Geoghegan was observed by reporters approaching LeMond.

LeMond's testimony was supported by an online posting Landis made on the Daily Peloton forum in which Landis stated that LeMond had disclosed personal information of a sensitive nature to Landis, and Landis threatened to use that information to damage LeMond if LeMond continued to speak out about Landis' doping case. Aftermath of the Landis testimony Several weeks after his testimony, LeMond and his wife Kathy gave an extensive interview to the Sunday Times. He provided additional details on the circumstances of his 2001 apology to Armstrong, stating that Trek, the longtime manufacturer and distributor of LeMond Racing Cycles, had threatened to end the relationship at the behest of Armstrong. He described the two years that followed the forced apology as the worst in his life, marked by self-destructive behavior that ultimately led him to disclose his sexual abuse to his wife and seek help. LeMond also described how being a victim of molestation had impacted both his racing career and his life since.Cycle of Abuse In September 2007, Greg LeMond became a founding board member of the non-profit organization 1in6.org, whose mission is \\"to help men who have had unwanted or abusive sexual experiences in childhood live healthy, happy lives\\". In 2007, Landis was found guilty of doping and was banned from cycling for two years. In 2010, he admitted to having been involved in doping. Also in 2010, Landis personally contacted LeMond to apologize for the events of 2007, and the two reconciled their differences.\\"Cyclist Armstrong Denies Doping\\" Reed Albergotti, Wall Street Journal, May 20, 2010 Although he declined to make details of the conversation public, LeMond acknowledged his support of Landis and sought to assist his former adversary in obtaining legal representation for the ensuing US federal investigation. LeMond told the NY Daily News he believed 'most of Floyd Landis' statements' about doping.\\"Greg LeMond believes 'most of Floyd Landis' statements' about doping\\" Nathaniel Vinton, New York Daily News, May 20, 2010 Alberto Contador Alberto Contador On July 23, 2009, LeMond wrote an opinion articleAlberto, prove to me that we can believe in you. Lemonde.fr (July 23, 2009). Retrieved on August 21, 2011. in the French newspaper Le Monde where he questioned the validity of Alberto Contador's climb up Verbier in the 2009 Tour de France. In the piece, LeMond pointed out that Contador's calculated VO2 max had never been achieved by any athlete, in any sport. The article stirred a fair amount of controversy as it put to question the Tour's best rider. A normal man might have a VO2 max between 38 and 43 ml/kg/min. According to data published by former Festina coach and renowned performance specialist, Antoine Vayer, the Spanish rider would have needed a VO2 max of 99.5 mL/kg/min to produce this effort. This is an astonishingly high number. Excellent endurance athletes when highly trained may reach into the 80s. Lance Armstrong had a VO2 max calculated at 85 ml/kg/min. Miguel Indurain had achieved a VO2 max of 88 ml/kg/min. Though LeMond's own VO2 max had at one time been calculated at an astounding 92.5 ml/kg/min, this was extremely unusual without performance-enhancing products, and was still below that which was calculated for Contador.Moore p. 58 Said LeMond: \\"The burden is then on Alberto Contador to prove he is physically capable of performing this feat without the use of performance-enhancing products.\\" Other experts in exercise physiology questioned the calculation of 99.5 ml/kg/min. In an article appearing in Cyclingnews.com the same day as LeMond's piece, expert Andrew Coggan questioned LeMond's conclusions. Contador did not test positive for doping at the 2009 Tour. However, the following year he tested positive for clenbuterol after winning the 2010 Tour. On February 6, 2012, the Court of Arbitration for Sport stripped Contador of his results from July 2010 to February 2012, including his 2010 Tour and 2011 Giro titles.

Discussed by Enzo Ferrari as being turned into a production model, the proposal was dropped and the car remains a singular concept model, the first four-door Ferrari ever built. Background Battista \\"Pinin\\" Farina had founded his design house in 1930, and after World War II began working with Enzo Ferrari on designing bodies for his road cars, to allow Ferrari to create funds to continue his motor car racing. Design The rear of the Ferrari Pinin, showing the then unique body-coloured rear light cluster by Carello The drive for the project came from Sergio Pininfarina, who had dreamed of designing an Italian competitor for luxury 4 door saloons like the Jaguar XJ, the Maserati Quattroporte (designed by rival Giugiaro), and the Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9. The project was also personally approved by Enzo Ferrari and the general manager of Ferrari at the time, Eugenio Alzati. According to Alzati, since Ferrari was a subsidiary of Fiat at the time, Mr. Ferrari was obligated to use a Fiat 131 as his personal chauffeured transport. Mr. Ferrari found the 131 inadequate and therefore positively viewed a possible production Ferrari luxury sedan. Leonardo Fioravanti led the design team, who had been responsible for most Pininfarina Ferrari designs since the 1960s, while detailed work was completed Diego Ottina. Fioravanti proposed a sporting sedan design, powered by a forward-located Ferrari flat-12 engine. New headlights from Lucas Industries allowed the front to be lowered, creating a thin egg- crate style grill. The design also included body-coloured rear lights by Carello, From the side, the A and B pillars were disguised by using smoked glass, and exaggerating the C pillar, creating a coupe-style side view. The interior used tobacco-coloured Connolly leather, and a dashboard designed by Borletti, Production The prototype was created at Pininfarina's studio, on a donor Ferrari 400GT chassis. The car included a mock-up flat 12, mated to the shell of a five-speed manual gearbox. The car was unveiled by Sergio Pininfarina at the 1980 Turin Auto Show. During 1908-81, the car toured multiple motorshows, including the 1980 Los Angeles Auto Show and the Carrozzeria Italiana exhibition in Pasadena, California. Enzo Ferrari was so impressed that he discussed turning the design into a production vehicle. Despite Mr. Ferrari's initial enthusiasm, he ultimately did not approve the project at Ferrari's annual board meeting in 1980. Eugenio Alzati speculated that lack of support from Fiat's then-president Vittorio Ghidella doomed the production Pinin. Alzati believed than Ghidella saw the Pinin as a distraction from larger-scale projects that would help financially stabilize Fiat. Leonardo Fioravanti speculated that Ferrari's resistance to producing the car was due to the production quality of any resultant vehicle. \\"Faults\\" were accepted in sporting cars, but with the Pinin Ferrari would have been competing against the quality of experienced luxury sedan manufacturers including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and even Rolls-Royce.  Collector ownership  In the mid-1980s the Pinin was sold to Jacques Swaters, a Belgian racing driver turned businessman and car collector who formerly ran Ecurie Francorchamps, a prominent privateer Ferrari endurance and sportscar racing team, as well as a dealership, Garage Francorchamps. The Pinin was put on static display for many years in the basement of Garage Francorchamps' showroom. After being displayed at the 2005 Essen Motor Show to celebrate Pininfarina's 75th anniversary, the car was sold in 2008 by RM Auctions on behalf of Swaters for ‚Ç¨176,000. The new owner send the Pinin to former Ferrari chief engineer Mauro Forghieri's firm Oral Engineering with the brief to make it a running vehicle. The Oral Engineering team made multiple modifications to the Pinin, installing a Tipo F102 B flat 12 engine from a Ferrari BB 512 as well as other components either taken from other Ferrari models or custom- made. In order to fit the engine, the chassis was modified and strengthened. The original engine mounts were moved up and forward. A gearbox and differential from a 400 GT were installed. A bespoke fuel tank and wiring loom were also commissioned. Although the car had front and rear double wishbone independent suspension from a 400 GT installed from the beginning, suspension modifications were required to make it road-usable, including adjustment of ground clearance and replacement of non-functional springs. The conversion process took approximately 1.5 years. The car first ran in March 2010, some 30 years after its first appearance. It was put up for sale later that year, but failed to make a reserve of ‚Ç¨1 million. The car was put up for sale again by RM Auctions at their London sale on 26 October 2010, with a guide price of ¬£480,000 ‚Äì ¬£550,000. The car was on display at the Museo Ferrari in 2012, as part of a show of Pininfarina's ten greatest designs. In July 2015, the Pinin was listed for sale on Hemmings.com with an asking price of $795,000 USD. The car is currently owned by Ferrari collector Prof. Dr. Anthony Nobles in California. The car was displayed at The Quail Motorsports Gathering in August 2018. Nobles originally bid on the Pinin when it was sold at the Factory auction where he was outbid. He spent the next several years tracking down the car and acquired it in Maranello in 2017. The car is now in the Nobles Family Automotive Museum and makes the occasional drive down Pacific Coast Highway to Cars and Coffee.

He was a key figure in the Armenian reawakening and reformist movement in the 19th century.  Life  Krikor Peshtimadjian was born in Constantinople and devoted his entire life to writing and teaching. He became the principal of the Bezciyan Armenian School, where he also taught language, rhetoric, philosophy, and religion. In 1828, soon after the establishment of the religious school attached to the Patriarchate of Kum Kapi, he was appointed head teacher and chief administrator there. He taught at an Armenian seminary in Haskoy and worked as a private tutor to a bankers family. As an educator, he worked on textbooks and curriculum organization and wrote regulations for discipline in the school and the fair treatment of all students.  Works  Early in his life he started to compile a dictionary of Classical Armenian, intended to comprise two volumes, but the project was discontinued. He lived at a time when the Armenian intelligentsia were actively engaged in sharp disputes about classical versus the more vernacular modern Armenian. In 1829 he published Kraganutyun Haykazian Lezvi (A Grammar of the Armenian Language), in essence a grammar of Classical Armenian. His Tramabnutiun Gam Arvest Banakan (Logic, or the Art of Reason), a philosophical treatise, is also in Classical Armenian. Yet his other works, such as Krtutiun Kaghakavarutyun (Education in Civility) and Lusashavigh (The Path of Enlightenment), are written in a very clear modern Armenian. Peshtimaldjian's works reflect the crucially important transition in Armenian letters during the early 19th century. He also taught, and wrote on, philosophical topics, tending to adhere to the European philosophers of the Age of Reason. Although he was a layman, his knowledge in matters of religion and theology far exceeded that of most clerics. Living at a time when several schismatic movements arose, he came forward as a staunch defender of the Armenian Apostolic Church, her doctrines, and her traditions, attempting to preserve the national and religious unity of the Armenian community.

The film had musical score by Sankar Ganesh.  Plot  Sivagami Nachiyar (Rajasulochana) is an arrogant millionaire who lives with her two daughters Geetha (Vijayashanti) and Sitta (Radha) in her palacial, ancestral bungalow. She is extremely strict with everyone, including her two daughters, and forbids them from looking out of the house window, or even stepping out of the house. She also insults and rejects many millionaire suitors for them, which disappoints her daughters as they feel that they may not get married at all. However things take a turn when Nachiyar leaves home on an important work for ten days. Relieved, Geetha and Seeta finally venture out of the house. They run into two petty crooks, Buddy Raju (Suresh) and Putturaja (Karthik). After some hilarious confrontations, they eventually fall in love with them. However, Nachiyar has rejected numerous millionaires themselves, so her daughters know that she will never, in her wildest dreams, accept two petty crooks as her sons-in-law. On finding out that her daughters are in love with two hapless boys, she arranges their wedding with two princes from France. However they are none other than Buddy Raju and Putturaja in disguise. Nachiyar's brother-in-law, a gym wrestler, had planned the entire event to unite his nieces with the men they loved.

It carries the work-number ‚Öõ in his catalogue of works. History Stockhausen composed the Sonatine as the second of two \\"free works\\" required for his final examinations at the Cologne Conservatory . The piano part of the first movement was composed originally as a separate work, titled Pr√§ludium, and the violin part was then superimposed . The manuscript of the completed composition is dated 19 March 1951. It was premiered by Wolfgang Marschner, concertmaster of the NWDR Symphony Orchestra, with the composer at the piano, in a broadcast recording transmitted for the first time on 24 August 1951 (; ). The first performance before a live audience, however, did not occur until twenty years later, when Saschko Gawriloff (violin) and Aloys Kontarsky (piano) played it on 22 October 1971 at a concert of the SMIP in Paris (; ). Analysis The work is not so much an integrated composition as three disparate style exercises, related only through the use of a common twelve- tone row in which thirds and perfect fifths predominate . Together with the Drei Lieder for alto and chamber orchestra, composed the previous summer, the Sonatine is the most significant example of Stockhausen's employment of classical Schoenbergian twelve-tone technique, but at the same time both compositions integrate this technique with aspects of neotonality and stylistic features associated with neoclassicism . The three movements, played without pause, are: #Lento espressivo‚Äîvivacetto irato‚Äîtempo 1 #Molto moderato e cantabile #Allegro scherzando The first movement is lyrical and restrained in character, similar in character to a three-part invention in which rhythmic motives join with row transformations to produce the structure . On the other hand, it also resembles a small sonata-allegro form, beginning with the polyphonic superimposition of three different forms of the row (prime and retrograde in the right and left hands of the piano, inversion in the violin), all beginning on the same pitch, C5. The opening, slow section functions as an exposition. The middle section, in a faster tempo, is a sort of development section, and the final section returns to the opening tempo and material as a recapitulation (; ). In contrast to the polyphonic texture of the first movement, the second is more homophonic, with a slow boogie-woogie rhythm in the bass . The violin is muted throughout, and becomes separated from the increasingly heavy piano part as it floats upward. The movement is through- composed with an overall slowing process which Stockhausen described as \\"incredibly meditative, like Stimmung\\", and ends with the violin playing sextuplets against quadruplets in the piano . The finale is dominated by polytonal chords, which accumulate into dense layers. The movement ends with a three-note chord, duplicated in the two hands of the piano as well as the violin, consisting of the notes C, D, and A. These notes were the predominating melodic notes at the beginning of this movement, as well as at the start of the first movement, and constitute the first trichord of the prime form of the basic row, which dominates all of the Sonatine .

He graduated from Moscow Conservatory in 1950. In the era of Stalin's anti-Semitism, like the fate of many of his contemporaries-musicians, Haimovsky's destiny as a performer was thwarted. Immediately after his graduation concert, despite the formal characterization of the conservatory's administration noting him as an \\"extremely gifted pianist, outstanding performing abilities ...,\\" he was kicked out of Moscow by the communist regime to Russia's remote provinces, where, except for a short period of creative work in Nizhny Novgorod Conservatory, he spent 16 years isolated from concert stages. However, in 1966 Haimovsky returned to Moscow and entered the mainstream of the capital's musical life as a pianist and writer on music and musicians. An expert on French music in particular, Haimovsky was the first to bring to Russian musical culture the works of Olivier Messiaen. From 1966 to 1972 as a soloist and in collaboration with the best musicians of the capital, Haimovsky premiered Messiaen's most famous works for the USSR. Among them are: \\"Quartet for End of Time\\" (with M. Baranov, V. Tupikin, V. Simon, later recorded by \\"Melody\\"), \\"Visions of Amen\\" (with I. Katz), \\"Haravi\\" (with N. Cherednyakova ), \\"Three small liturgies of the Divine Presence\\" (with S. Sandetskis), \\"Exotic Birds\\" (with G. Rozhdestvensky), fragments of the works from the \\"20 Regards of the baby Jesus,\\" \\"Sketches of rhythm\\", \\"Catalogue of Birds\\". Haimovsky played the solo piano in \\"Turangalila-Symphony\\", performed for the first time in Russia by the USSR State Symphony Orchestra (conductor Evgeny Svetlanov). Triumph of \\"Turangalila\\" in Moscow (1971) was stunning. For his work Haimovsky received a letter of gratitude from the composer. During this time, Haimovsky published the first articles about Messiaen in ‚ÄúSoviet Music‚Äù, receiving considerable attention. In 1968, the publishing house ‚ÄúSoviet Composer‚Äù signed a contract with him for the first Russian book on Messiaen. The manuscript was completed in 1970, but was not published due to objections from communist censors. In the late 1960s, Haimovsky's solo- performing, literary career, organizational activities, and pedagogical deliberations significantly expanded when he joined the \\"Chamber Ensemble of Soloists of Moscow Radio and TV\\" (directed by A. Korneev). As a forward- thinker in musical activities, Haimovsky became a mediator between the Soviet composers (among them Nikolai Sidelnikov, Alfred Schnittke, Boris Tishchenko, among others) and his chamber group. He inspired Sidelnikov to create a number of masterpieces, which were subsequently performed across the USSR and recorded for \\"Melodia‚Äù label. And yet despite of the heights of this creative work in Moscow, a stifling political environment forced Haimovsky to leave the country (Oct 1972). After his emigration from the USSR, Haimovsky was a professor of Rubin Academy of Music in Jerusalem and soloist of the Israeli Radio Orchestra. He performed with the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, in particular the Israeli premieres of Messiaen (\\"Three Little Liturgies\\" with Mendi Rodan, \\"Exotic Birds\\" with Paul Kapolongo), performed recitals, made recordings on the radio (Chopin, Haydn, Debussy), and concertized in Europe. In 1974, the Tel Aviv newspaper Maariv wrote that Haimovsky is \\"not only a pianist of supreme virtuosity, but above all an artist with a strong personality.\\" This is seconded by Freiburg's Badische Zeitung: \\"He is a magician of sound.\\" Even after moving to the U.S. (in 1977) the first performances by Haimovsky are generally described as \\"unusual\\"; specifically, his Liszt and Messiaen as \\"breathtaking\\" (New York Times). The 1999 release of his American disks of Debussy's piano music, the American Guide wrote: \\"Every moment on this recording is a jewel ... the second book of Images is a revelation ... this transcendent performance...joins Benedetti Michelangeli, Gieseking, and Arrau...\\" Haimovsky received invitations from radio stations for recordings and interviews, particularly in New York, Stuttgart, Jerusalem. Additionally, he has performed in festivals such as ‚ÄúLyric Art Festival‚Äù in Houston and ‚ÄúRussishes Erbe‚Äù in Freiburg, and given master classes in the Jerusalem Music Center (under the auspices of Isaac Stern), Istanbul Conservatory, Boston Conservatory, Bard College, and others. From 1984‚Äì2001, Haimovsky was a professor of piano, chamber music, and aesthetics of performance at New York University. At the request of the institution, he founded the NYU Chamber Music Society that performed nearly 40 concerts of contemporary music from all over the world. Concerts involved undergraduate and graduate students, university professors, as well as guests from abroad. Upon leaving the university, Haimovsky returned to his second passion: writing. From 2002 to 2012, he published six books in Russian and translated one for English readers, all for Liberty Publishing House. Presently, Haimovsky lives with his wife in his home in Yorktown Heights, Westchester (New York). He continues to work as a writer and as a pianist.  Selected Concerts  Moscow.

Marsh (1844‚Äì1904) was an American politician who served as Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives during 1884 and 1885. Archelaus D. Marsh was born April 19, 1844, on a farm near Buford, Highland County, Ohio. His parents were James P. and Ellen J. (Bachman) Marsh. His father was a native of Virginia and his mother of Pennsylvania, both born in 1812. His parents were married in 1842 in Hamilton, Ohio, and Archelaus D. was their only child. Marsh lived on his parent's Highland County farm until 1868, when he moved to Sardinia, Brown County, Ohio, where he read law under the direction of W. W. McKnight and Chilton A. White. In 1872 Marsh was admitted to the bar in Georgetown, Ohio, and began the practice of law at Sardinia. He moved to Celina, Mercer County, Ohio, in October, 1874, and began a law practice there. Marsh was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1877, and was re-elected in 1879. He was elected again in 1883, and with the Democrats in the majority, he was selected as Speaker of the House for the sessions in 1884 and 1885.

It was launched near the same time as their reality prank show Punk'd, and although successful in ratings, was cancelled at the end of the first season so they could focus on its more popular counterpart. The program filmed contestants having to tolerate a 'friend' for 48 hours, while filmed on hidden camera in their home and different public settings. The 'friend' would be a trained improvisational comedian, who would progressively torment the contestant, their friends and loved ones. The catch was that the friends and family of the contestant were unaware of the folie √† deux. If able to endure the embarrassment caused by the irreverent demands of the friend, the contestant would win a cash prize. Reality comedy premise Ashton Kutcher produced You've Got a Friend at the same time as his hit reality show Punk'd The program filmed contestants interacting with friends and loved ones, with only the contestants aware they were on a television show. To win, the contestant had to convince friends and family over 48 hours that a trained improvisational comedian was their new 'best friend.' The contestant would not know the identity of the actor ahead of time, but only meet him while having a meal with friends at a restaurant. They would know the game had begun when the actor entered the dining area and said the phrase: \\"Hello, stranger!\\" The actor would then slowly but relentlessly torment the contestant, acting bizarre, and asking them to commit irreverent acts to prove their friendship, to the chagrin and concern of their real friends and family. Examples included the 'friend' demanding contestants shave their heads and eyebrows, break up with their girlfriends or boyfriends, or arrange meetings with loved ones to tell them the contestant was moving to Hollywood to start a new life with the 'friend'. The actor would even cause contestants to lose their actual jobs. The premise was to embarrass the contestant and progressively disrupt their personal lives as the program continued. At the end of 48 hours, if the contestant followed all direction and proved their friendship, they would receive a cash prize of $15,000. Improvisational comedians Joe Hursley played the 'friend' for a number of episodes Notable among actors playing the 'friend' on the program was a young Crista Flanagan, before her time on Mad TV and Mad Men. Joe Hursley also played the 'friend' for several episodes, becoming progressively more sinister as the program progressed. He later worked with Kutcher on Punk'd, and was lead singer for The Ringers before moving on to the Indians.

Biography Daniel Pinckney Parker was born on August 30, 1781, in Southborough, Massachusetts, to Benjamin and Abigail (Taylor) Parker. Following an apprenticeship as a store clerk in Marlborough, Massachusetts, Parker moved to Boston in 1810 and entered into partnership with Nathan Appleton under the name Parker & Appletons, until 1813. Family On December 8, 1806, Parker married Mary Weeks of Marlborough, Massachusetts. The Parkers had four children: Lucilla Pinckney, Mary, Henry Tuke, and Emily Taylor. The oldest, Lucilla Pinckney Parker, was born in Boston in 1810 and eventually married the lawyer and noted abolitionist Edmund Quincy, the son of Harvard University President Josiah Quincy. The Parkers only son, Henry Tuke Parker, graduated from Harvard University in 1842, and from Harvard Law School in 1845 before moving permanently to London, England, where he became a writer and member of the Royal Geographical Society of London. Home The shipping magnate's home was listed in Adam's Boston Directory of 1846 and 1847 as 40 Beacon Street. The house there was designed by the important Boston architect Alexander Parris, who is noted for having built United First Parish Church in Quincy, Massachusetts, Pilgrim Hall in Plymouth, Massachusetts, and Somerset Club in Boston. The property on which the Parker residence was built formerly belonged to famed Boston painter John Singleton Copley. The home later became known as the Nathan Appleton Residence or Appleton-Parker House, in combined recondition with its neighbor, #39, and home of Parker's early business partner and friend Nathan Appleton. The home is now considered a National Historic Landmark. In more recent years, the Appleton-Parker House has attracted attention as the one-time home of former General Electric CEO Jack Welch and for having been listed on a number of occasions with a considerable asking price. Parker's business offices were at one point listed at 40 State Street, in Boston. Business Parker, who had been close with the merchant and philanthropist Samuel Appleton, as well as his brother Nathan Appleton, is noted for having owned the famed Samuel Appleton ship, which was said to be one of the finest in Boston, measuring approximately 800 tons. That ship was primarily used for trade with China, and regularly made trips from Boston, around the Cape Horn, to San Francisco, California, and then to China. Parker was also the owner of the mercantile cargo sailing ship Zenobia (1837 ship). Although primarily involved in shipping, Parker's business endeavors were far reaching and quickly established him amongst Boston's most successful and influential businessmen. In 1813, Parker was a member of a consortium, which included businessmen Josiah White and Isaac Wright, that established The Plympton Cotton Factory Company, for the purpose of \\"... manufacturing cotton, wool and linen yarn and cloth, in Plympton, in the county of Plymouth.\\" Parker also served as a Director of the Office of Discount and Deposit Boston branch of the Bank of the United States, a record of which was engraved in a silver plate and deposited in the foundation of the bank as it was being designed and built by architect Solomon Willard on State Street in 1816. In part thanks to his established reputation following Willard's completion of the Bunker Hill Monument, Parker wrote specifically of his confidence in the architect in a letter to John Collins Warren dated October 8, 1825. On February 10, 1818, Parker, Patrick Tracy Jackson, and other members of the Boston Associates, were granted the charter of the Suffolk Bank by the Massachusetts General Court. Parker, Jackson, the other charter's holders, and the bank's directors met periodically from February 27 to March 19 at the Boston Exchange Coffee House to discuss the organization of the bank. On April 1, 1818, the bank opened for business in rented offices on State Street until the bank moved permanently to the corner of State and Kilby Streets (currently occupied by either 75 State Street or Exchange Place) on April 17. Parker owned 300 shares of the bank. Daniel Parker was recorded in the Acts and Resolves passed by the General Court section of the Private and Special Statutes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of 1822 as incorporating the Mashapog Turnpike Corporation \\"... for the purpose of locating, making and keeping in good repair, a turnpike road, from Norton meeting-house, in the county of Bristol, to the third school house, (so called) in the town of Canton, in the county of Norfolk, on the most direct and convenient route ....\\" As of 1831 Parker's various business roles included: Director of the Office of Discount and Deposit Boston branch of the Bank of the United States, Director of the Columbian Insurance Company, Director of the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Company, along with his friends Samuel Appleton and Nathan Appleton, and as Trustee of Provident Institution for Savings in the Town of Boston. Herman Melville Amongst Daniel Parker's closest friends and colleagues, many of them the Boston's most established and successful businessmen and public servants, was the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court, Lemeul Shaw. Shaw had, early on in his developing career, rented rooms from Parker, and counted amongst his own close friends the Melvilles of Boston. In 1847, the budding author Herman Melville married the judge's stepdaughter, Elizabeth Shaw. Parker is believed to have attended their wedding. Parker had his own ties with the Melvilles and was a trusted friend of Allan Melville, the father of the famous writer. The merchant had accompanied an eight-year- old Herman from Boston to Bristol, Rhode Island, in 1828 to spend their respective summer vacations. In 1843 upon his return from a whaling exhibition in the Pacific, the young Melville is believed to have called on Parker in an effort to resume any friendship that had developed prior to Melville's exploits on the sea. When Melville was married in 1847 and special arrangements were taken to avoid a public mobbing due to his popularity, the author is believed to have stayed with the Parkers. In 1848 Melville wrote to Parker in hopes of securing a position on one of his ships for his youngest brother, Tom. In a letter from Melville's wife, Elizabeth Shaw Melville, to her step-mother, the family friend Parker poses as the best option for a young man in the often treacherous shipping business; ‚ÄúHerman has written Mr. Parker ‚Äì (Daniel P.) to see if he can send him out in one of his ships. I hope he will, if Tom must go, for Mr. Parker would be likely to take an interest in him and promote him.‚Äù Mrs. Melville continued in a postscript; ‚ÄúIf father should chance to see Mr. Parker I wish he would speak to him about Tom.‚Äù Culture As a prominent member of Boston's society, Parker found himself inevitably immersed in the city's cultural organizations. In 1815 Parker was listed as a Trustee of the Boston Athenaeum, in 1826 was noted to have contributed $100, and in the years ranging 1821, 1844, and 1850 was noted as a subscriber and proprietor. Parker was also one of a number of patrons and trustees that contributed to the commission of the first painting to join the Atheneum's collection; a portrait of the organizations benefactor James Perkins by Gilbert Stuart. Daniel Pinckney Parker himself, along with his wife, had his portraits painted by Stuart. The University of Southern California currently has in its collection the Gilbert Stuart panel painting \\"Mrs. Daniel Pinckney Parker (Mary Weekes)\\", which dates to approximately 1810, when the sitter was 18 years old, and a few years after the young couples 1806 marriage. Later, in 1847, Parker was elected a member of the New England Historic Genealogical Society. Daniel P. Parker's wife, Mary Weekes, also held her own prominent position as president of the Fragment Society, the oldest continuous sewing circle in Boston's history, in the years 1838, 1849, 1850, and 1852. Even in the year of his death, 1850, Parker continued his philanthropic endeavors, contributing to the purchase of protective casing for and cataloging of the George Washington Library at the Boston Athenaeum. Death Following ‚Äúa painful illness of several months‚Äù, Daniel Pinckney Parker died at his home on Beacon Street on August 31, 1850, one day after his sixty-ninth birthday. Parker's obituary in the Boston Daily Atlas read as follows: \\"Among the many public-spirited merchants who have contributed to extend the commercial enterprise of Boston, few have been more zealous or successful. He had built for him nearly forty sailing vessels, and no man fitted his ships more liberally or took greater interest in the welfare of those in his employ. He was liberal in his charities without being ostentatious, was an affectionate husband, a kind father, and an upright citizen.\\" Daniel Pinckney Parker is buried at the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

History  After the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78 in central India, the Bengal Nagpur Railway began planning to open a low-cost railway track that would unite the region, allowing both access to the agricultural and mineral resources of the region, further safeguarding the inhabitants should another famine arise. Nainpur was the focal point of the network and was even bestowed with the prestige of being a divisional headquarters for some time. The lines came up in the early years of the 20th century. The first portion of the Gondia‚ÄìNainpur line was opened on 13 April 1903, Nainpur and Chhindwara were connected in 1904 and Jabalpur in 1905. The Chhindwara‚ÄìPench Coalfield line came up in 1906‚Äì07 and the Nainpur-Mandla Fort line in 1909. The extensive network of gauge tracks measured just over 1,000 km.  Conversion to broad gauge  The Satpura Railway is under conversion to broad gauge. The section between Gondia and Balaghat was converted to broad gauge in 2005‚Äì2006 connecting Balaghat to India's national network for the first time. Work is underway to convert the Balaghat‚ÄìJabalpur section to broad gauge. The narrow gauge trains running between Jabalpur and Balaghat were stopped in October 2015 and the track was closed for gauge conversion.The End Of A Much Loved Indian Railway Line The gauge conversion is expected to be completed by 2018-2019. The 85 km broad gauge track from Jabalpur to Ghunsore railway station was operational in September 2017 and the 28 km track from Ghunsore to Nainpur also has been operational since 2018. Now the work between Nainpur to Samnapur is going on rapidly and expected to be operationalize in mid 2020.

The hall house is a type of vernacular house traditional in many parts of England, Wales, Ireland and lowland Scotland, as well as northern Europe, during the Middle Ages, centring on a hall. Usually timber-framed, some high status examples were built in stone. Unaltered hall houses are almost unknown. Where they have survived, they have almost always been significantly changed and extended by successive owners over the generations. Origins 14th century open hall at Crook Hall, Durham In Old English, a \\"hall\\" is simply a large room enclosed by a roof and walls, and in Anglo-Saxon England simple one-room buildings, with a single hearth in the middle of the floor for cooking and warmth, were the usual residence of a lord of the manor and his retainers. The whole community was used to eating and sleeping in the hall. This is the hall as Beowulf understood it. Over several centuries the hall developed into a building which provided more than one room, giving some privacy to its more important residents.John E. Crowley, The Invention of Comfort: Sensibilities and Design in Early Modern Britain and Early America (Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003), p. 8 A significant house needs both public and private areas. The public area is the place for living: cooking, eating, meeting and playing, while private space is for withdrawing and for storing valuables. A source of heat is required, and in northern latitudes walls are also needed to keep the weather out and to keep in the heat. By about 1400, in lowland Britain, with changes in settlement patterns and agriculture, people were thinking of houses as permanent structures rather than temporary shelter. According to the locality, they built stone or timber- framed houses with wattle and daub or clay infill. The designs were copied by their neighbours and descendants in the tradition of vernacular architecture. They were sturdy and some have survived over five hundred years. Hall houses built after 1570 are rare. The open hearth found in a hall house created heat and smoke. A high ceiling drew the smoke upwards, leaving a relatively smoke- free void beneath. Later hall houses were built with chimneys and flues. In earlier ones, these were added as alterations and additional flooring often installed. This, and the need for staircases to reach each of the upper storeys, led to much innovation and variety in floor plans. The hall house, having started in the Middle Ages as a home for a lord and his community of retainers, permeated to the less well-off during the early modern period. During the sixteenth century, the rich crossed what Brunskill describes as the \\"polite threshold\\" and became more likely to employ professionals to design their homes. General description A simple hall house In its earliest and simplest form the medieval hall house would be a four-bay cruck-framed structure, with the open hall taking up the two bays in the middle of the building. An open hearth would be in the middle of the hall, its smoke rising to a vent in the roof. Two external doors on each side of the hall formed a cross passage. One end bay at the \\"screens end\\" or \\"lower end\\" of the hall would contain two rooms commonly called the pantry, used for storing food, and the buttery used for storing drink. These were intentionally unheated. The rooms in the \\"upper end\\" bay formed the private space. This layout was analogous to that found in the great houses of the day, the difference being merely that of scale. The rooms on the ground floor of the private space, were often known as parlours while the upper floor provided rooms called solars. The upper rooms would be reached in the simplest buildings by means of a ladder or steep companionway. The solars often stretched beyond the outer wall of the ground floor rooms, jettying out at one end or else at both ends of the building. As the hall itself had no upper floor within it, its outer walls always stood straight, without jettying. ;Single ended hall plans 150px Here a two-story wing is attached to one end of the hall. This can project beyond one side wall or both side walls of the hall, or sometimes just the upper story is jettied beyond the side wall. There were multiple solutions as to where the staircase was placed. ;Double ended hall plans 150px The open hall is flanked by two two-story extension. Together they can give the appearance of an H-shape as at Little Moreton Hall or a U-shape as is found in Cambridgeshire. The Clothiers' houses of the West Riding of Yorkshire were built with elaborate gables ;Wealden houses Wealden houses are a specific form of the double ended hall plan. They are built of timber and at ground floor level the wings do not project being the width of the hall in length. The upper-storeys of the wings are jettied out, and the roof-line follows this projection. Later alterations Plan of Horham Hall, showing the age of different parts A later aisled hall house Tree House, Crawley, no longer recognizable as a 15th-century building The vast majority of those hall houses which have survived have changed significantly over the centuries. In almost all cases the open hearth of the hall house was abandoned during the early modern period and a chimney built which reached from the new hearth to above the roof. This was created in the vicinity of the cross passage, and sometimes this added chimney actually blocked the cross passage. Once the clearance within the hall was no longer needed for smoke from the central hearth, the hall itself would often be divided, with a floor being inserted which connected all the upper rooms. Timber framed hall houses often had the infilling between their structural timbers replaced several times. While the timbers themselves were the strongest part of the building, it is unusual for all to have survived without replacement. In many cases whole outer walls have been replaced with solid brick or with solid stone. Usually a thatched roof was turned into one of slates or tiles. A successful building was likely to be extended to follow the fashion or to add needed additional accommodation, and it is even possible for a medieval hall house to be hidden within an apparently much later building and to go unrecognized for what it is, until alteration or demolition reveals the tell-tale smoke-blackened roof timbers of the original open hall.David J. Swindells, Restoring period timber-framed houses (1987), p. 165 Materials The construction techniques used in vernacular architecture always were dependent on the materials available, and hall houses were no exceptions. Stone, flint, cobble, brick and earth when available could be used to build walls that would support the mass on the roof structure. Alternatively, a cruck or a box frame structure of timber was built and this could be infilled with cob or be panelled with timber, tiles, or wattle and daub. Depending on the local tradition and availability thatched and stone roofs were used. A thirteenth century example of a stone roofed hall-house survives in a good state of preservation at Aydon Hall in Northumberland.W. Douglas Simpson, Exploring Castles (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1957), p. 51 Hearths, smoke bays and fireplaces In a two-wing hall house, with the hall open to the roof, smoke accumulated in the roofspace before exiting through louvres or raised tiles. Placing the hearth at the lower end of the hall was deliberate because combustion could be controlled by varying the through draught between the two doors. A smoke bay The next phase was to jetty out the first floor private accommodation into the open hall creating a half floor. The smoke rose into the remaining space into a smoke bay. The house benefitted from the extra space created, and the extended chambers benefitted from the extra heat. The use of smoke hoods enabled the smoke bays to be compressed further. In Surrey smoke bays were introduced in the early 16th century while in the North it was later, smoke hoods being introduced in the late 17th century. A brick built fireplace, chimney breast, flue and chimney stack gave more efficient combustion. This allowed the whole of the hall to be floored, then the stack could contain an extra flue to provide a fire on the upper floor. Fireplaces and chimney stacks could be fitted into existing buildings against the passage, or against the side walls or even at the upper end of the hall. It was only at the end of the 18th century that this innovation reached the north. The design and total function of the chimney depended on the size of the house or cottage and its location. English fires never became like the continental tiled cocklestove or the North American metal stove. In the earliest houses combustion of wood was helped by increasing the airflow by placing the logs on iron firedogs. In smaller houses the fire was used for cooking. Andirons provided a rack for spit roasting, and trivets for pots. Later an iron or stone fireback reflected the heat forward and controlled the unwelcome side draughts. Unsurprisingly the hearth migrated to a central wall and became enclosed at the sides. The earliest firehoods directed the smoke away from the low underthatch to the apex of the roof. They were constructed in wicker which was then lime-plastered to render them fire- proof. A chimney, and through flooring Inglenook fireplaces were a development. One side of the inglenook was a transverse wall, one of the others was the exterior wall which was pierced with a little 'fire window' that gave light. To the other side was an low partition wall with a settle to provide seating. A beam or bressumer at head height finished off the open end. The hearth stone extended across this whole area, and it was topped with a firehood. It became a room within a room. It was particular suited to burning logs and peat. In the Weald of Kent and Sussex, which were early iron smelting regions the back wall was protected by an iron fireback. The fireplace is a three-sided incombustible box containing a grate that allows an updraught and a controlled flue. It is most suited to burning sea-cole. Sea-cole or coal as it is now called was quarried from outcrops around England and transported to London as early as 1253. In larger houses, fireplaces and chimneys were first used as supplementary heating in the parlour, before eventually suppressing the open hearth. In smaller hall houses, where heat efficiency and cooking were the prime concern, fireplaces became the principal source of heat earlier. The design of the coal grate was important and the open fire became more sophisticated and enclosed leading in later centuries to the coal burning kitchen range with its hob, oven and water boiler, and the Triplex type kitchen range with a back boiler and the 1922 AGA cooker. Examples Unaltered hall houses are almost unknown. A large number of former hall-houses do still exist and many are cared for by the National Trust, English Heritage, local authorities and private owners. Wealden hall houses can be found in the weald of Kent and Sussex where the combination of good quality hard wood and wealthy yeoman farmers and iron founders prevailed in the 14th to 16th centuries. In Crawley today the Ancient Priors, the Old Punch Bowl and the Tree House are well documented as is Alfriston Clergy House in Polegate, East Sussex, which was the first house to be acquired by the National Trust. The Weald and Downland Open Air Museum has a collection of rescued house which have been extensively researched prior to their reconstruction. Elsewhere such as in Cheshire and Suffolk historic timber framed house often contain the remnants of hall houses. Hole Cottage in Kent near Cowden (operated by Landmark Trust) has an intact private dwelling wing of a Wealden hall house. Ancient Priors Ancient Priors The Ancient Priors is a medieval timber- framed hall house on the High Street in Crawley. It was built in approximately 1450, partly replacing an older (probably 14th-century) structure‚Äîalthough part of this survives behind the present street frontage. It has been expanded, altered and renovated many times since, and fell into such disrepair by the 1930s that demolition was considered. It has since been refurbished and is now a restaurant, although it has been put to various uses during its existence. English Heritage has listed the building at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance, and it has been described \\"the finest timber-framed house between London and Brighton\\". Crawley's development as a permanent settlement dates from the early 13th century, when a charter was granted for a market to be held; a church was founded by 1267. The area, on the edge of the High Weald. Some sources assert that a building stood on the site of the Ancient Priors by this time, claiming that it was built between 1150 and 1250 and was used as a chantry-house. Extensive archaeological investigation in the 1990s determined that although the possibility of an older building on the site could not be ruled out, the oldest part of the present structure is 14th-century and the main part (fronting the east side of the High Street) dates from about 1450 and incorporates no older fabric. Burgage plots‚Äîmedieval land divisions with houses or other buildings which were rented from the Lord of the Manor‚Äîwere particularly clearly defined on the east side of the High Street; the buildings within them usually faced the High Street, but plots were sometimes subdivided. This is believed to have happened at the site of the Ancient Priors, where the main (15th-century) part of the building faces west on to the High Street, and the older section faces south and is hidden from view. The building was originally used as a dwelling house, and the accompanying burgage plot was used for small-scale agriculture. The first confirmed owners were a family of colliers, who acquired it in 1608. It passed through many owners throughout the 17th century, some of whom rented the building to others; furthermore, in many cases the two parts of the building were occupied by different families or tenants. By 1668, when it was owned by a resident of Worth, the whole building had become an inn. Known at first as The Whyte Harte, its spelling was later standardised to The White Hart. Around this time, the entire messuage consisted of the inn itself, some barns, an orchard and a garden. In the early 18th century, the prominent local ironmaster Leonard Gale‚Äîholder of much property in the Crawley area‚Äîowned the building, and is believed to have lived there. By 1753, when the Brett family (who had held the property for 26 years) sold the messuage for ¬£473 (¬£ as of ), it also had stables, and covered about . In Cheshire Willot Hall, Bramall Hall and Little Moreton Hall all noted for their black and white half timbered appearance, are extended from an initial hall-house. And in Merseyside Speke Hall and Rufford Old Hall similarly benefited from agricultural prosperity. Rufford Old Hall Rufford Old Hall Rufford Old Hall is a National Trust property and Grade I listed building,Listed Buildings in West Lancashire , West Lancashire District Council in Rufford, Lancashire, England. Only the great hall, built around 1530 for Sir Robert Hesketh, survives from the original building but it indicates the wealth and position of the family. Until 1936, Rufford Old Hall was in the continuous ownership of the Hesketh family who were lords of the manor of Rufford from the 15th century. The Heskeths moved to Rufford New Hall in 1798. In 1936 Rufford Old Hall, with its collection of arms and armour and 17th century oak furniture, was donated to the National Trust by Thomas Fermor-Hesketh, 1st Baron Hesketh. The timber- framed hall house with great hall, in a late medieval pattern which continued in use in Tudor times, was built for Sir Robert Hesketh in about 1530. The hall, which formed the south wing of the present building, is substantially as built, long and wide, with the timbers sitting on a low stone wall. The hall has a flagged floor. It has a stone chimney, five bays, and a hammerbeam roof. The five hammerbeams each terminate, at both ends, in a carved wooden angel. The hall is overlooked by a quatrefoil squint in an arched doorway in the second-floor drawing room.Dean, R., 2007, Rufford Old Hall, The National Trust, In 1661 a Jacobean style rustic brick wing was built at right angles to the great hall which contrasts with the medieval black and white timbering. This wing was built from small two-inch bricks similar to Bank Hall, and Carr House and St Michael's Church in Much Hoole. Ufford Hall Ufford Hall, Fressingfield Ufford Hall is a Grade II* listed manor house in Fressingfield, Suffolk, England, dating back to the thirteenth century. Fressingfield is 12 miles east of Diss, Norfolk. The timber-framed manor house with rosy ochre coloured plaster walls and dark tiled roof,Sandon, Eric (1977), Suffolk Houses, A Study of Domestic Architecture, Woodbridge, Suffolk: Baron Publishing, 1977, p. 175 incorporates the medieval core of an earlier open- hall house. At least twenty raised-aisled houses have been identified in the area, \\"forming a characteristic group, rarely found elsewhere in England\\".Emery, Anthony (2000), Greater Medieval Houses of England and Wales, Vol. II, Cambridge University Press, p. 24 The Hall has attracted the attention of architectural historians, such as PevsnerPevsner, Nikolaus (1961), The Buildings of England: Suffolk, London: Penguin Books, p. 203 and Sandon, and has been described as the ‚Äúultimate development (‚Ä¶) of the early hall house.‚ÄùCook, Olive & Edwin Smith (1983), The English House through Seven Centuries, Overlook Press, p. 69 Its most noteworthy features include: cross- beamed ceiling in the parlour which has not been disturbed since the late fifteenth century or early sixteenth century; striking original sixteenth- century mullioned and transomed windows; back-to-back stuccoed fireplaces on both floors and chimney stacks of Tudor origin; fine Jacobean dog-leg staircase with turned balusters and newel posts with ball finials. The latter is the last major addition to the house, which remains largely unaltered from the original. Plas Uchaf Plas Uchaf Plas Uchaf () is a 15th-century cruck-and-aisle-truss hall house, that lies within the stone building belt south-west of Corwen, Denbighshire, Wales and north of Cynwyd. The house consists of a long rectangle divided by a cross passage. The west end is a large hall some high. The east end consists of smaller rooms on two floors. The roof structure is substantial, of paired cruck beams with additional horizontal, vertical and diagonal bracing. It features an aisle truss, a form normally only found in much larger buildings such as barns and churches. This suggests the use of English craftsmen and is an indication of the status of the original inhabitants. The walls are of stone rubble but were originally half-timbered. The original construction was thought to date from the late 14th or early 15th century, but part of the structure has been dated to 1435 by tree-ring dating. In the 16th century the hall was divided horizontally by the addition of an inserted floor supported by moulded cross beams. The house was listed as a house of the gentry as late as 1707Cited by Smith/LLoyd as \\"Edward Llwyd, Parochilia (ed. R. H. Morris), II, p. 56\\" but was later split into two or three labourers' cottages. West country Whitestaunton Manor Old Shute House (known as Shute Barton between about 1789 and the 20th century), located at Shute, near Colyton, Axminster, Devon, is one of the more important extant non-fortified manor houses of the Middle Ages. It was built about 1380 as a hall house and was greatly expanded in the late 16th century and partly demolished in 1785. The original 14th-century house survives, although much altered.Cooper, Nicholas; Mannez, Pru; Blaylock, Stuart, Shute Barton, Devon: Historic Building Analysis and Archaeological Survey 2008, Exeter Archaeology Report no. 08.80, produced for the National Trust Whitestaunton Manor in south Somerset was built in the 15th century as a hall house and has been designated as a Grade I listed building. It consists of an east-west range with two wings which were added later. Northumberland Aydon Hall and Featherstone Castle in Northumberland were stone-built hall houses. The owners applied for permission to crenellate to protect the buildings from the marauding Scottish insurgents. The original halls became part of substantial castles- which later, with the Act of Union became grand country houses.

It is now part of the Bespoke Collection. Current owner, Michael Polenske, wanted to create a winery that focused on producing wines from Merlot grapes, which fits with the name \\"Blackbird\\", as merlot means \\"young blackbird\\", in French patois. Blackbird Vineyards creates wines inspired by the Pomerol area of France. Winery president Paul Leary describes the wines as \\"California Bordeaux\\" wines. History In 1995 Mr. Aubrey Dean Jenkins and Mr. Michael James Hastings purchased 10 acres of land in the heart of Napa Valley from John and Janet Trefethen of the Trefethen Vineyards.[4]. Growing on the land at the time of purchase were a few old Pinot Noir grape vines that Trefethen Vineyards.[4] used for blending, but most of the remaining land was a Black Walnut orchard. Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Hastings first moved to the Napa Valley in June 1979. They raised horses at their Napa Valley home and ranch (‚ÄúElderado‚Äù). During that time they had met and befriended many vintners and winery owners in Napa Valley, such as John and Janet Trefethen and Andre Tchelistcheff (foremost wine maker and neighbor). They liked the idea of starting their own vineyard. They had never owned or operated a vineyard, so they were true beginners starting from scratch. Regardless, they eventually made their dream vineyard come true when they founded ‚ÄúBlackbird Vineyards.‚Äù The first name and label chosen for the new vineyard was ‚ÄúCorazon Vineyards.‚Äù The name was derived from the fact that their vineyard was located in the heart of Napa Valley; hence, the Spanish name for heart ‚Äúcorazon‚Äù seemed appropriate. They created signage and did a limited bottling under that name. About a year later, they changed the vineyard name and label to ‚ÄúBlackbird Vineyard‚Äù, because the already established Corison Winery felt the ‚ÄúCorazon‚Äù name infringed on ‚ÄúCorison.‚Äù The inspiration for choosing the new name ‚ÄúBlackbird Vineyard‚Äù came from the swooping flocks of black Starlings that came every year over Napa Valley. The actual name ‚ÄúMerlot‚Äù refers to the blackbird, which is thought to be a diminutive of merle, the French name for the blackbird; probably a reference to the dark blue color of the grape. Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Hastings worked in the vineyard morning till night. They also renovated two homes on the property while establishing the vineyard. They lived in the main house and rented out the renovated Victorian home. Mr. Hastings also went to Vintner school at Napa Jr. College to become a knowledgeable grower. To ready the land, the old vines and Walnut trees were removed in 1996 and the soil was tilled with extra deep excavating equipment. After excavation, all of the land was covered and fumigated to kill all nematodes. After the soil was prepared they laid out the vineyard's orientation and established two watering systems. One watering system was for drip watering and the other was for overhead sprinklers for frost protection. Next, came the trellising and end-post supports. As an innovation, Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Hastings installed electronic sensors to monitor the minerals and moisture content of the soil. In the fall of 1996, they selected and planted their Merlot root stock and clone (110RClone3) after consultation with Mr. Tony Baldini. Mr. Baldini had farmed the property for many years when owned by the Trefethen family. He believed in planting the right variety (and even clone) to match the soils and condition. Thus, it was Mr. Baldini's sage advice that led to the final choice of vines. Steve Baldini, Tony's son, was the vineyard manager. Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Hastings were also very lucky to have the ongoing vineyard management interests of Mia Klein of Selene Wines. The vines had to mature for three years before producing a suitable and robust harvest. The first crop was harvested in 1999 and was sold to Mia Klein of Selene Wines. Mia Klein used Blackbird Vineyard to create her 1999 Selene Merlot . The June 2002 issue of ‚ÄúWine and Spirits‚Äù magazine named Mia Klein‚Äôs 1999 Selene Label, Blackbird Vineyards, one of the ten best. The first private bottling under the ‚ÄúBlackbird Vineyard‚Äù label was in 2000. Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Hastings only crushed, fermented, and aged a few cases of that year's grapes for personal use. The first private labels created were very simple and had only the basic information (i.e., year, variety, and percent alcohol content). The original Blackbird Vineyard label was designed by Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Hastings and based on the signage at the vineyard. It depicted a white latticed background with a single blackbird feather sitting on top of the ‚ÄúBlackbird Vineyard‚Äù banner. From 1999 to 2001 they sold the Blackbird Vineyard grape harvest to Mia Klein. After 2001, they sold their harvests to other Napa Valley area wineries, including Duckhorn. In 2011, Oprah Winfrey picked ‚ÄúBlackbird Vineyards‚Äù as one of her favorites. The January 2011 issue of ‚ÄúO Magazine‚Äú says that Oprah Winfrey's favorite winery would be Blackbird Vineyards, a new winery whose first vintage wine was 2003. In October 2004, after 9 years of hard work creating Blackbird Vineyards from scratch and establishing its highly regarded reputation, Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Hastings sold Blackbird Vineyards to Michael Polenske. Michael Polenske left his career in finance and focused on creating a wine label and a lifestyle brand that would eventually become the Bespoke Collection; Blackbird is part of that collection. In 2006, Paul Leary became president of the label. Blackbird Vineyards partnered with country singer Martina McBride to release an exclusive wine in 2009. Blackbird Vineyards wine has been served at events for Chanel and the High Museum. Blackbird Vineyards sells their wines online and at Ma(i)sonry Napa Valley, a wine, art and design gallery in Yountville, California. They also have a wine club called BlackMail. Design The current wine labels have flocks of blackbirds on them in different positions and layouts. The label was designed by California designer David Hughes and Michael Polenske. Hughes had designed logos for other companies such as French Laundry and the Sundance Film Festival. Blackbird's proprietary red wine blend, Arise, features blackbirds sitting on a telephone wire in the same layout as the starting notes in the Beatles' song \\"Blackbird\\". Wine production Blackbird Vineyards has a ten-acre estate vineyard in the Oak Knoll District of Napa Valley AVA. The vineyard was originally a walnut orchard until it was planted with 5,717 Merlot vines in 1996. The first crop was harvested in 1999 and was sold to Mia Klein of Selene Wines. Mia Klein used Blackbird Vineyard to create her 1999 Selene Merlot. The first bottling under the new Blackbird Vineyard label was a 2003 Merlot, made by Sarah Gott. They produced 90 cases that vintage and it was only sold to private buyers. While the estate vineyard produces only Merlot, Blackbird Vineyards also sources Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon for blending. They also make a Ros√© and four proprietary red wines from those varietals. Five different wines make up the collection. Materials discarded from harvesting and winemaking, such as stems and vegetation, are made into compost and used in the vineyards. The vineyard is designated Fish Friendly Farming land. Grapes are often sorted two or three times to select the best fruit. The winery uses native yeast during the fermentation process. They use 100-percent French oak barrels in the winemaking and aging processes. The vineyard is managed by Renteria Vineyard Management. Aaron Pott continues as winemaker. Varietals The Merlot used in Blackbirds' wines comes primarily from their estate vineyard in the Oak Knoll District. Blackbird wines are made in the style of the Merlot- based wines of Pomerol, France, especially because of the similarity of the Pomerol and Oak Knoll district. They also make Merlot wine using grapes from Hudson Vineyards in the Carneros AVA and Stagecoach Vineyard in the Napa Valley AVA. Their Cabernet Franc grapes come from Stagecoach Vineyard, Hudson Vineyard, and Crocker & Starr vineyard, the latter which is located in St. Helena, California. Blackbirds' Cabernet Sauvignon grapes are sourced from Hudson Vineyard. Wines Blackbird Vineyards makes red wines blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes. Blackbird Vineyard wines (l-r): Arriviste, Arise, Illustration, Paramour, Contrarian Arriviste Blackbird Vineyard also makes ros√© wine called Arriviste. Arriviste is a blend of Blackbird's three signature grapes: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It pulls inspiration from the gypsies that winemaker Aaron Pott interacted with when living in the Saint-√âmilion area of France. The wine is harvested in autumn and uses the saign√©e method during the winemaking process. It then undergoes a cold fermentation process for six weeks. After sitting in cold storage, it is bottled 4‚Äì6 months after the grapes are harvested. Arise One red blend is called Arise. The name is taken from the Beatles' song \\"Blackbird\\". Arise is a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. The label features nine blackbirds on a telephone wire in the position of the starting notes the Beatles' song. Arise uses primarily Merlot grapes, rounded out with Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. It's harvested in the autumn and released two years later after being aged in half-seasoned and half-new French Oak barrels for 21 months. Illustration Illustration is primarily a Merlot wine, using a majority of Merlot grapes, followed by Cabernet Franc and a small percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon. It's inspired by P√©trus wines. Like other wines under the Blackbird label, it is aged for 21 months in French oak barrels that are majority new and only 25 percent seasoned. Illustration is considered the \\"heart\\" of the label's wines, being majority Merlot and heavily inspired by Pomerol-style wines. It was the only red wine served at the Vanity Fair Oscars party in 2007. Paramour Blackbirds' Paramour wine is inspired by wines from Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc. Year to year it focuses more on Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a smaller amount of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes. It is aged for 21 months in French oak barrels after being harvested in October. The barrels are 75 percent new and 25 percent seasoned, the same as the Contrarian and Illustration. Contrarian Contrarian is a red blend with a stronger focus on Cabernet Franc, which is often the main grape in the blend, followed by Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The style is in the vein of Ch√¢teau Troplong Mondot and Ch√¢teau Figeac wines. It is harvested in October and released in the spring after fermenting for 21 months in 75 percent new and 25 percent seasoned French oak barrels.

The children targeted by the knifeman are thought likely to be between six and eleven years of age. The attack occurred as the children were arriving for classes probably at 8:00 or maybe even 9:00. The incident has followed other school attacks in China since 2010 by mentally disturbed perpetrators involved in personal disputes or unhappy with the rapid changes occurring in Chinese society. Security guards had been posted at schools across China, with all schools to have a security guard by 2013. Stabbing Due to strict gun control laws in China, knives are usually the weapon of choice in violent crimes. The attack on the children occurred at the entrance of the school. Min first targeted the elderly woman, aged 85, who lived next to the school. He went to her house at around 7 a.m., stole one of her knives and attacked her head. The woman's daughter said an argument had occurred. At around 7:40 a.m., Min pursued the children with the knife he had stolen from the elderly woman's house and slashed them, many on their heads. Xinhua reported that some of the children had had fingers or ears cut off in the knife attack. Min was restrained at the primary school, and transferred to police custody. The victims were treated at three hospitals. Two of the children were taken to hospitals located outside Guangshan County to receive better care. None of the victims were fatally wounded. Perpetrator The suspect was initially identified to be Min Yingjun (); however, later reports identified the perpetrator to be a different man, Min Yongjun (), of the same village as Min Yingjun. He is reported to have had a long history of epileptic seizures, and to have been influenced by the 2012 doomsday phenomenon. This has been allegedly propagated in China by the Eastern Lightning church. Response The Guangshan County government established an emergency response team for the incident. The coverage of the incident in local media was tightly controlled, with Beijing usually restricting coverage of such sensitive topics to dissuade copycat attacks, and an article in the Financial Times reported a backlash by Chinese citizens due to the lack of coverage of the school stabbings. An article in The Associated Press similarly wrote that a possible reason why authorities wanted to restrict the news was to either \\"prevent encouraging others or to play down the crime to keep blame off the government.\\" Officials detained 52 people for spreading doomsday rumours, such as distributing leaflets. On 16 December, the suspect was arrested and charged with the crime of endangering public safety by dangerous means.Ê≤≥ÂçóÂÖâÂ±±Á†ç‰º§Â≠¶ÁîüÂ´åÁñë‰∫∫ÈóµÊã•ÂÜõË¢´ÊâπÂáÜÈÄÆÊçï, cpd.com.cn Six officials were fired. The reason for the dismissals has not been announced. Reactions Some commentaries situated the knife attacks in the wider context of China's social and economic transformation, noting the inadequacies in the country's health care system for diagnosing and treating citizens suffering psychiatric distress and illnesses. As the Chenpeng school attack was followed by the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in the United States hours later comparisons were drawn between the two. The difference in gun control laws between the two countries was used to explain the disparity in casualties of the school attacks by journalists and politicians, including U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler, and an article in the Associated Press noted that despite the different outcomes, an underlying commonality between the attacks was the increased frequency of school attacks because, \\"attackers often seek out the vulnerable, hoping to amplify their outrage before they themselves often commit suicide.\\" Comparisons were also drawn between the incident handling by the local and national governments involved. The lack of coverage by Chinese state-run news channels, and the lack of any emotional response from the Chinese government at all levels were contrasted to the detailed US media coverage and then-US President Barack Obama's national speech, including his commitment to tackle the underlying issues. Footage The local police released footage from a security camera showing the attacker barging into the school and attacking a student. The video was noted and analysed by many news agencies, and contributed significantly to the widespread coverage of the incident.

Sophrology is a self-development method and practice using body and mind allowing each individual to create more balance and harmony in themselves and the world around them. The word Sophrology comes from Ancient Greek œÉ·ø∂œÇ / SOS (\\"harmony\\"), œÜœÅŒÆŒΩ / PHREN (\\"mind\\"), and -ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ± / -LOGOS (\\"study/science\\"), the study of the consciousness in harmony. This method was developed by Professor Alfonso Caycedo, a Colombian neuro-psychiatrist, in the 1960s to support his patient to find more serenity in daily life. In 1970, at the first International Sophrology Conference, he said that Sophrology was born from his studies on human consciousness. Sophrology is both philosophy and a way of life, as well as a therapy and a personal development technique. He later said: \\"Sophrology is learning to live\\". Western roots Professor Alfonso Caycedo (of Spanish Basque origin, born in Bogota, Colombia in 1932), a neuropsychiatrist, created the 12 Sophrology Degrees from 1960 while practising medicine at a hospital in Madrid, Spain. He originally set out to find a way of healing depressed and traumatised clients by leading them to health and happiness with the least possible use of drugs and psychiatric treatments. Caycedo also wanted to study human consciousness and the means of varying its states and levels. He started looking into clinical hypnosis, phenomenology and Western relaxation techniques: Jacobson‚Äôs progressive relaxation, Schultz‚Äôs autogenic training. From Jacobson, Caycedo mainly kept the idea of differential relaxation, with using only the minimum muscle tension necessary for an action, as well as the ability to reduce anxiety by relaxing muscular tension. Without additional suggestion or psychotherapy, just muscular relaxation is sufficient for mental relaxation or harmony. With Schultz, which is a more ‚Äúmental‚Äù method, he was inspired by the human ability to achieve relaxation by visualisation alone. In October 1960, he created the term ‚ÄúSophrology‚Äù and opened the first department of clinical Sophrology in the Santa Isabel Hospital in Madrid. Eastern roots In 1963, Caycedo married a French yoga enthusiast. He started looking into Eastern techniques around that time. Between 1963 and 1964, he worked under the psychiatrist and phenomenologist Ludwig Binswanger (who had studied with Husserl and Heidegger) in Switzerland and was very much influenced by his work. Intrigued by the works of yoga and encouraged by Binswanger, he travelled to India and Japan from 1965 to 1968 where he studied yoga, Tibetan Buddhist meditation and Japanese Zen. He approached each discipline, theory and philosophy with the intention of discovering what, exactly, improved people's health, both physically and mentally, in the fastest possible time and with lasting results.In India, he discovered Raja Yoga in the ashram of Swami Anandanand and Sri Aurobindo‚Äôs integral yoga. He then travelled to Dharamsala to meet the Dalai Lama and study Tibetan Buddhism. Lastly, he went to Japan to learn Zen in several monasteries. On his return, he created the first three levels of what he called Dynamic Relaxation. From then on, Sophrology started to move away from clinical hypnosis and concentrated more on body work and the presence of the body in the mind. His idea was to help the Western mind use Eastern methods in a simple way, leaving aside the philosophy and religion, not mimicking those techniques for which he has always had the utmost respect but to enable people to experience easily new ways of working on their levels of consciousness. On his return to Spain, Caycedo settled in Barcelona where he started expanding Sophrology. He initiated a Sophrology group work in Paris and spread the word at scientific conferences in Spain, Switzerland and Belgium. Dr Raymond Abrezol In Switzerland, Dr Raymond Abrezol discovered the unique benefits of Sophrology and brought it to the attention of the general public. In 1965, having just finished his Sophrology studies, he tried to help a friend with whom he was playing tennis regularly. His performances and concentration developed quite dramatically. Abrezol then helped another friend with his skiing performance. He was financially supported by the countess Anne-Juliette Chouvalova (born de Pourtal√®s), who paid the scholarship in Champittet of Raymond's son Pierre. In 1967, a national ski coach who heard about Sophrology asked Abrezol's help to train four ski champions for the Grenoble Olympic Games of 1968, all in secret. Three of them ended up on the podium with Olympic medals, the only Swiss champions to get medals at the Games that year. The athletes revealed their Sophrology training to the press. The press was ecstatic and Abrezol ended up training the whole national team from the next season. Abrezol went on to train many other athletes in sailing, boxing, cycling, tennis, water polo, golf, and other sports. Athletes coached by Abrezol between 1967 and 2004 won over 200 Olympic medals. Following this success, Sophrology grew rapidly throughout the French-speaking world. Although initially used only in medicine, Sophrology then opened to other areas: sports of course but also prevention and promotion of health in the corporate world, education, arts, and other disciplines. Abrezol ran training programmes for a large number of influential doctors and sports coaches, many of whom now run Training Centres throughout France. His enthusiasm and his success with athletes opened doors for Sophrology to be taught in many areas of life. During his stay in Colombia in 1985, Caycedo created the fourth Level of Dynamic Relaxation and the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù branch of Sophrology. In 1988 he moved to Andorra and created the concept of Caycedian Sophrology. In 1992 he started the following levels and created a master's degree. In 2001, the twelve levels of Dynamic Relaxation with their specific techniques were completed. Fundamental principles Positive action Sophrology concentrates not on the problem itself but on the inner resources of the individual that will enable them to move forward, to feel stronger. The assumption is that positive action on consciousness start a positive chain reaction. According to Pascal Gautier, \\"Through an everyday practice, sophrology aims at harmony in human beings: quite a feat! In practice, it does not mean seeing life through pink-tinted glasses but putting an end to an unrealistic or negative vision of life to see things as they are (as much as possible) and reinforce whatever positive we have in us.\\"Pascal Gautier: D√©couvrir la Sophrologie (InterEditions) Objective reality Alfonso Caycedo looked into phenomenology after working in 1963‚Äì64 with the Swiss psychiatrist Binswanger (1881‚Äì1966) who had studied with Husserl and Heidegger. Phenomenology had a big impact on Sophrology. Some of the techniques in Sophrology suggest to look at things ‚Äúas if for the first time‚Äù, with a neutral approach, listening to sensations with no judgement or expectations. Experiencing is key. Suggestion is left to a minimum to let each person experience the exercise in their own ways. Key concepts *a non- judgemental attitude: look at things with as ‚Äúneutral‚Äù a look as possible, not using our previous knowledge or experience; *a beginner's mind: look at the world with a child‚Äôs mind, take it as it is; *acceptance: accept reality around us and others as they are, without ready-made ideas.

Amƒ´r is common in medieval Arabic as a commander on land (not sea). In medieval Latin it has lots records as a specifically Muslim military leader or emir.A set of usage examples of medieval Latin amir√¶us, ammiratus, ammirandus, amirallus, admiratus, admiralius is in Du Cange's Glossary of Medieval Latin. In medieval Latin the word carrying the meaning of a specifically Muslim commander √≤ earlier than the meaning of a naval commander. The same is true in Old French. The earliest in Old French is in a well-known long ballad about war-battles between Christians and Muslims, the Chanson de Roland, dated circa 1100, which contains about three dozen instances of amirail or amiralz (plural) meaning exclusively a Muslim military leader on land ‚Äì ref. Two late 12th-century examples with the same meaning are cited in the dictionary of Anglo-Norman French ‚Äì ref. In French, the word meaning admiral of the sea has its first known record circa 1208 in the Crusader chronicler Geoffrey of Villehardouin (died circa 1212) - Ref. Later in medieval French, it is commonly spelled both amiral and admiral, with both spellings having both meanings ‚Äì Amiral  Admiral @ Dictionnaire du Moyen Fran√ßais. The same is true in late medieval English; see Amiral  Admiral @ Middle English Dictionary. A Latin record of a different kind comes from Sicily in 1072, the year the Latins defeated the Arabs in Sicily at the capital city Palermo. In that year, after about 300 years of Arabic rule in Sicily, a new military governing official at Palermo was assigned as \\"Knight, to be for the Sicilians the amiratus\\", where -atus is a Latin grammar suffix. This title continued in mainly non-marine use over the next century among the Latins at Palermo, usually spelled am[m]iratus; spelled amiraldus in year 1113 where -aldus is a Latin suffix that functions much the same as -atus;The Latin suffix -aldus  -aldi is discussed in An etymological dictionary of the French language, by A. Brachet, translated to English by G. W. Kitchin, year 1873, on page cix. The Sicilian Latin amiraldi year 1113 is cited in Arabismi Medievali di Sicilia, by Girolamo Caracausi, year 1983 on page 105. ammiral year 1112 influenced by Latin suffix -alis. In 1178 (and earlier) the person holding the title amiratus at Palermo was put in charge of the navy of the Kingdom of Sicily.An in-depth treatment of the origin and early history of the Western word \\"admiral\\" is in the book Amiratus-AŒºŒ∑œÅŒ±œÇ: L'Emirat et les Origines de l'Amiraut√©, XIe-XIIIe Si√®cles, by L√©on Robert M√©nager, year 1960, 255 pages, including chapter headed \\"La naissance du terme \\"amiral\\" \\". A 1963 book review of M√©nager's book has some info about the subject of the book in English in Journal Speculum, Vol 38 number 2, pages 371-373. The article \\"Le point sur l'origine du mot amiral\\", by Omar Bencheikh, 5 pages, year 2003 (published by Bulletin de la SELEFA), ONLINE, is primarily interested in showing that the Arabic amƒ´r = \\"commander\\" was not in use meaning a sea commander in Arabic at the time when the Latins started using the word in the sense of sea commander in the 15th through 18th centuries. This is consistent with M√©nager's documentation that the word evolved as a title of governance within Norman Sicily from an original meaning of a commander on land in Norman Sicily. More on the 12th-century amiratus in Norman Sicily is contained in the book The Administration of the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, by Hiroshi Takayama, year 1993. And more notes on the word's early history in the West are in Arabismi Medievali di Sicilia, by Girolamo Caracausi, year 1150 on pages 102-105 (in Italian) and Arabismen im Deutschen, by Raja Tazi, year 1998 on pages 184-186 (in German). After that start, the use of the word to mean an Admiral of the Sea was taken up in the maritime republic of Genoa starting in 1195 as amirato, and spread throughout the Latin Mediterranean in the 13th century. Medieval Latin word-forms included ammiratus, ammirandus, amirallus, admiratus, admiralius, while in late medieval French and English the usual word-forms were amiral and admiral.Amiral  Admiral @ Middle English Dictionary and Amiral  Admiral @ Dictionnaire du Moyen Fran√ßais. The insertion of the letter 'd' was undoubtedly influenced by allusion to the word admire, a classical Latin word. ;adobe : ÿßŸÑÿ∑Ÿàÿ®ÿ© al-t≈´ba  at-t≈´ba,Arabic al- = \\"the\\". In Arabic where t≈´ba means brick, \\"the brick\\" is written al-t≈´ba but universally pronounced \\"at- t≈´ba\\". Similarly, the written al-sum≈´t (\\"the paths\\") is always pronounced \\"as- sum≈´t\\". Similarly, al-nƒ´l is always pronounced \\"an-nƒ´l\\". This pronunciation applies to al- in front of about half of the Arabic consonants. In front of the other half the al- is pronounced al-. the brick. The word is in a number of medieval Arabic dictionaries meaning \\"brick\\". The Arabic dictionary of Al- Jawhari dated about year 1000 made the comment that the Arabic word had come from the Coptic language of Egypt.A number of large dictionaries were written in Arabic during medieval times. Searchable copies of nearly all of the main medieval Arabic dictionaries are online at Baheth.info and/or AlWaraq.net. One of the most esteemed of the dictionaries is Ismail ibn Hammad al-Jawhari's \\"Al-Sihah\\" which is dated around and shortly after year 1000. The biggest is Ibn Manzur's \\"Lisan Al-Arab\\" which is dated 1290 but most of its contents were taken from a variety of earlier sources, including 9th- and 10th-century sources. Often Ibn Manzur names his source then quotes from it. Therefore, if the reader recognizes the name of Ibn Manzur's source, a date considerably earlier than 1290 can often be assigned to what is said. A list giving the year of death of a number of individuals who Ibn Manzur quotes from is in Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, volume 1, page xxx (year 1863). Lane's Arabic- English Lexicon contains much of the main contents of the medieval Arabic dictionaries in English translation. At AlWaraq.net, in addition to searchable copies of medieval Arabic dictionaries, there are searchable copies of a large number of medieval Arabic texts on various subjects. In European languages the early records are in medieval Spanish spelled adoba  adova and adobe with the same meaning as today's Spanish adobe, \\"sun-dried brick\\".Six instances of medieval Spanish adobes meaning sun-dried bricks are in the Libro de Palladio, dated 1385-1390, which is a Latin-to-Spanish translation of the agriculture book of Palladius (lived 4th century AD). The Latin original has sun-dried bricks in Book VI section xii. Text available in medieval Spanish, original Latin, and English translation. Earlier records for the word in medieval Spanish are cited in \\"Aportaciones filol√≥gicas a la documentaci√≥n emilianense altomedieval\\", by Fernando Garc√≠a Andreva, year 2011, in journal Archivo de Filolog√≠a Aragonesa, Volume 67, on page 248.

Engelmann. 430 pages. Published in 1869. The word entered English from Mexico in the 18th and 19th centuries. ;afrit (mythology) : ÿπŸÅÿ±Ÿäÿ™  øifrƒ´t, an ancient demon popularized by the 1001 Arabian Nights tales. ;albatross : The medieval Arabic source-word was probably ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿ∑Ÿëÿßÿ≥ al-ghattƒÅs which literally meant \\"the diver\\", and meant birds who caught fish by diving, and sometimes meant the diving waterbirds of the pelecaniform class, including cormorants.Several bird-names in Spanish are established as having entered Spanish from Arabic during the medieval era. They include today's Spanish alcarav√°n = \\"curlew bird\\" from medieval Arabic al-karawƒÅn = \\"curlew bird\\" and today's Spanish zorzal = \\"thrush and similar bird\\" from medieval Arabic zurz≈´r = \\"starling bird\\". The late medieval Spanish alcatraz = \\"seafish-catching large bird\\", such as pelican or cormorant or gannet bird, is presumed by everybody to be from an Arabic word. But it is not very clear what the Arabic word was. On looking at candidate words, Arabic al-ghattƒÅs = \\"the diver\\" (from verb ÿ∫ÿ∑ÿ≥ ghatas, to dive in water), implying a diving pelecaniform bird, is the one favored today by the dictionaries Concise OED, American Heritage, Merriam-Webster, CNRTL.fr, and some others. Al-ghattƒÅs is a fish-catching diving bird in chapters about birds by Ahmad al-Qalqashandi (died 1418) (Ref), Yaqut al-Hamawi (died 1229) and Zakariya al-Qazwini (died 1283) (Ref). In modern Arabic al-ghattƒÅs is a grebe (a diving waterbird of a different class) and also means a human skin-diver. This candidate word has the problem that the phonetic alterations involved in moving from al-ghattƒÅs to alcatraz are irregular and unusual: In Iberian Romance loanwords from Arabic, a conversion of gh- to c- is very rare, and an insertion of -r- is uncommon. The candidate favored by older dictionaries (including the dictionaries by Devic 1876, Skeat 1888, Weekley 1921) is Arabic al-qƒÅd≈´s = \\"bucket of a water wheel (hopper)\\", which certainly became Portuguese alcatruz well-documented with the same meaning, which in turn, it is speculatively proposed, became Portuguese and Spanish alcatraz = \\"a pelican with a bucket-like beak\\". One problem with this idea is that, although alcatraz has records meaning pelican, it also has records meaning cormorant and in the 16th century frigatebird and also gannet, which are large diving seabirds without a bucket-like beak. (These records are acknowledged by Devic (1876) and his followers). Moreover the word's early records have no highlighting of a bucket-like beak. The very earliest known record, which is in Spanish in year 1386, says \\"birds that maintain themselves on fish such as sea-eagles and alcatraces and other birds of the sea\\", and a relatively early record in Spanish at around 1440 speaks of \\"...pigeons and vultures and alcatrazes\\" ‚Äì cited in Los Arabismos del Castellano en la Baja Edad Media, by Ma√≠llo Salgado, year 1998. More early records in Spanish are at CORDE. The fact that al-qƒÅd≈´s (the waterwheel bucket) is certainly the parent of alcatruz (the waterwheel bucket) lends phonetic support to the view that al-ghattƒÅs can be the parent of alcatraz. From this or some other Arabic word, late medieval Spanish has alcatraz meaning pelecaniform-type large diving seabird. From the Spanish, it entered English in the later 16th century as alcatras with the same meaning, and it is also in Italian in the later 16th century as alcatrazzi with the same meaning.Alcatras in New English Dictionary on Historical Principles. The albatrosses are large diving seabirds that are only found in the Southern Hemisphere and the Pacific Ocean regions. Beginning in the 17th century, every European language adopted \\"albatros\\" with a 'b' for these birds, the 'b' having been mobilized from Latinate alba = \\"white\\". ;alchemy, chemistry : ÿßŸÑŸÉŸäŸÖŸäÿßÿ° al-kƒ´mƒ´ƒÅ æ, alchemy and medieval chemistry, and especially \\"studies about substances through which the generation of gold and silver may be artificially accomplished\\". In Arabic the word had its origin in a Greek alchemy word that had been in use in the early centuries AD in Alexandria in Egypt in Greek.During the early centuries AD, the Greeks in Egypt developed new alchemical and distillation methods. These were not acquired by the Late Classical Latins and they were unknown to the early medieval Latins. The later-medieval Latins acquired the methods in the 12th century from the Arabs. The Arabs had acquired them during the early centuries after the onset of Islam (up to the 10th century) from ultimately Greek sources. The parent of the Arabic word al-kƒ´mƒ´ƒÅ was a Late Greek word chemeia  chumeia = \\"art of alloying metals, alchemy\\", which was used in Greek in Alexandria in Egypt in the writings of the alchemist Zosimos (4th century AD) and the Zosimos commentator Olympiodoros (5th or 6th century AD) ‚Äì ref: Liddell-Scott-Jones. Zosimos and other Alexandrian Greek alchemy writers were translated to Arabic during the early centuries of Arabic literature ‚Äì ref: Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums, Band IV: Alchimie-Chemie, Botanik- Agrikultur. Bis ca. 430 H., by Fuat Sezgin, year 1971 (including pages 74-76). Distillation was the most important of the chemical techniques that were known to the Greeks of Late Antiquity, and known to the medieval Arabs, and unknown to the early medieval Latins. A Short History of the Art of Distillation, by Robert James Forbes, year 1948, \\"Chapter II: The Alexandrian chemists\\" and \\"Chapter III: The Arabs\\" and \\"Chapter IV: The [Latin] Middle Ages\\". The Arabic word entered Latin as alchimia in the 12th century and was widely circulating in Latin in the 13th century.In Latin, the earliest records for the word alchemy are dated about 1140 to 1145 ‚Äì ref: Alchimie @ CNRTL.fr and The Secrets of Alchemy by Lawrence M. Principe, year 2012, on pages 51-53. A century later, Vincent de Beauvais (died 1264) compiled a general-purpose encyclopedia about all subjects. He could not read Arabic and did not have any particular interest in alchemy, but for his encyclopedia he was able to copy alchemy material from several Arabic books that were available to him in Latin translation ‚Äì ref: Les sources alchimiques de Vincent de Beauvais by S√©bastien Moureau, year 2012, 113 pages. In medieval Latin alchimia was strongly associated with the quest to make gold out of other metals but the scope of the word also covered the full range of what was then known about chemistry and metallurgy.\\"Alchemy vs. Chemistry\\" by William R. Newman and Lawrence M. Principe, in journal Early Science and Medicine Vol. 3, No. 1 (year 1998), pages 32-65, which is an historical review of the meanings of the words \\"alchemy\\" and \\"chemistry\\" in Europe up to the 18th century. Partially reiterated in \\"From Alchemy to 'Chymistry' \\", by William R Newman, a chapter in The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science, year 2006, pages 497-517. See also Etymology of chemistry : From alchemy to chemistry. Late medieval Latin had the word-forms alchimicus = \\"alchemical\\" and alchimista = \\"alchemist\\". By deletion of al-, those word-forms gave rise to the Latin word-forms chimia, chimicus and chimista beginning in the mid 16th century. The word-forms with and without the al- were synonymous until the end of the 17th century; the meaning of each of them covered both alchemy and chemistry. ;alcohol : ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ≠ŸÑ al-kohl, very finely powdered stibnite (Sb2S3) or galena (PbS) or any similar fine powder. The word with that meaning entered Latin in the 13th century spelled alcohol. In Latin in the 14th and 15th centuries the sole meaning was a very fine-grained powder, made of any material.An alcohol of antimony sulfide (stibnite) is in Spanish with date 1278 and in Latin with date 13th century ‚Äì CNRTL.fr, Raja Tazi 1998. An alcofol of eggshells and an alcofol of iron sulfide (marcasite) are in a medical book by Guy de Chauliac in Latin in 1363 ‚Äì ref: MED. In these cases alcohol  alcofol meant a substance in the form of a very fine powder. A medieval use for such powder was in eye cleaning treatments for eye complaints (see collyrium). A Latin medical dictionary dated 1292 defined alcohol solely as \\"a powder for an eyewash\\" ‚Äì Synonyma Medicinae by Simon of Genoa. A medical book translated from Arabic to Latin in the late 13th century has Latin cohol on about 30 different pages, always meaning \\"a powder for an eyewash\\", involving powders of a variety of materials ‚Äì De Simplicibus Medicinis by Serapion the Younger. Alcohol is defined solely as an exceedingly fine powder in the Antidotarium of Pseudo-Mesuae, written in 1543, a book which professes to explain the meanings of ambiguous and difficult medicinal terms. In various cases the powder was obtained by crushing, but in various other cases the powder was obtained by calcination or by sublimation & deposition. In the alchemy and medicine writer Theophrastus Paracelsus (died 1541), the alcohol powders produced by sublimation & deposition were viewed as kinds of distillates, and with that mindset he extended the word's meaning to distillate of wine. \\"Alcohol of wine\\" (ethanol) has its first known record in Paracelsus.One of Paracelsus's followers and advocates was Martin Ruland (died 1602). Ruland wrote a dictionary of Latin alchemy terms in which he explained Paracelsus's mindset about the semantics of alcohol. Ruland said: (1) alcohol is an exceedingly fine-grained powder; (2) alcohol vini is distilled wine; (3) it is an error to think of the fine powder as having been obtained by mechanical grinding; (4) Paracelsus's alcool powders, synonymous with alcohol powders, which are powders obtained from various mineral rocks by Paracelsus, are prepared by first mechanically breaking up the mineral and then heating the mineral until it sublimates to a vapor, with \\"the sublimation performed by a carefully tempered fire, so that the powder of the mineral may be liquefied as little as possible, but at the same time may ascend until the flos [or essence] of the powder is seen sticking to the walls of the enclosure\\" [like soot does]; and (5) the alcool  alcohol, whether a powder or a liquid, is a purified body [and in other words it is a distillate] ‚Äì ref: Martin Ruland's Lexicon alchemiae (in Latin). Reference also A Short History of the Art of Distillation, by R.J. Forbes (1948), year 1970 on page 107 regarding Paracelsus, and on numerous pages regarding fine powders made medievally by sublimations and distillations. The same is covered in Makers of Chemistry, by E.J. Holmyard, year 1931 on page 111 regarding Paracelsus and on pages 58-59 regarding fine powders made medievally by sublimations and calcinations. In today's English dictionaries there are a number of other words or word- meanings that originate in the writings of Paracelsus, though none are nearly so well known as alcohol: they include alkahest, gnome, laudanum, nostoc, synovial. Paracelsus was also instrumental in increasing the circulation of some words that are rarely found before he used them ‚Äì an example is zinc. The biggest-selling English dictionary of the 18th century (Bailey's) defined alcohol as \\"a very fine and impalpable powder, or a very pure well rectified spirit.\\"\\"Alcohol\\" in N. Bailey's English Dictionary, year 1726. ;alcove : ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ®Ÿëÿ© al-qobba, vault, dome or cupola. That sense for the word is in medieval Arabic dictionaries. The same sense is documented for Spanish alcoba around 1275.

The Arabic root is traceable to Greek ambix = \\"cup\\". The earliest chemical distillations were by Greeks in Alexandria in Egypt in about the 3rd century AD. Their ambix became the 9th-century Arabic al-anbƒ´q, which became the 12th-century Latin alembicus.Book A Short History of the Art of Distillation, by Robert James Forbes, year 1948, including pages 36-37 for the word alembic.

The 13th-century Arabic dictionary Lisan al-Arab says al-fisfisa is cultivated as an animal feed and consumed in both fresh and dried form ‚Äì ŸÅÿµŸÅÿµÿ© @ Baheth.info . In medieval Arabic another name for alfalfa was al-qatt ‚Äì ŸÇÿ™ÿ™ @ Baheth.info . But al-fisfisa appears to have been the most common name for alfalfa. For example the entry for al-qatt in the 11th-century dictionary al-SihƒÅh says al-qatt is another word for al-fisfisa without saying what al-fisfisa is. In the Arabic of Andalusia a pronunciation as AL-FASFASA has some indirect documentation (ref). In mutation from the Andalusian Arabic word, some late medieval Spanish records have it as alfalfez and some late medieval Catalan records have it as alf√°ffe√ß and alfa√ßa meaning alfalfa (where √ß = z), as reported by Dozy year 1869, Corriente year 2008 and Diccionari del castell√† del segle XV a la Corona d'Arag√≥ (year 2013). The Arabic entered medieval Spanish. In medieval Spain alfalfa had a reputation as the best fodder for horses.

The English name started in the far-west US in the mid-19th century from Spanish alfalfa.Alfalfa seeds were imported to California from Chile in the 1850s; history of alfalfa. ;algebra : ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ®ÿ± al-jabr, completing, or restoring broken parts. The word's mathematical use has its earliest record in Arabic in the title of the book \\"al-mukhta·π£ar fƒ´ ·∏•isƒÅb al-jabr wa al-muqƒÅbala\\", translatable as \\"The Compendium on Calculation by Restoring and Balancing\\", by the 9th- century mathematician Mohammed Ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi. This algebra book was translated to Latin twice in the 12th century. In medieval Arabic mathematics, al-jabr and al-muqƒÅbala were the names of the two main preparatory steps used to solve an algebraic equation and the phrase \\"al-jabr and al-muqƒÅbala\\" came to mean \\"method of equation-solving\\". The medieval Latins borrowed the method and the names.An Arabic copy of Al-Khwarizmi's algebra book is at ref. Historical information on the Latin term \\"algebra\\" is in \\"Robert of Chester's Latin Translation of the Algebra of Al-Khowarizmi: with an introduction, critical notes and an English version\\", by Louis Charles Karpinski, 200 pages, year 1915; downloadable. The earliest Latin translation of the book of algebra of Al-Khwarizmi was by Robert of Chester and the year was 1145. Centuries later in some Latin manuscripts this particular translation carried the Latin title Liber Algebrae et Almucabola. But the translation of 1145 did not carry that title originally, nor did it use the term algebrae in the body of the text. Instead it used the Latin word \\"restoration\\" as a loan-translation of al-jabr. Another 12th-century Latin translation of the same book, by translator Gerard of Cremona, borrowed the Arabic term in the form aliabre and iebra where the Latin 'i' is representing Arabic letter 'j'. In year 1202 in Latin the mathematician Leonardo of Pisa wrote a chapter involving the title Aljebra et Almuchabala where Latin 'j' is pronounced 'y'. Leonardo of Pisa had been influenced by an algebra book of essentially same title in Arabic by Ab≈´ KƒÅmil ShujƒÅ ø ibn Aslam (died 930). In Arabic mathematics the term \\"al-jabr wa al-muqƒÅbala\\" has its first surviving record with Al-Khwarizmi (died 850), though Al-Khwarizmi gives signs that he did not originate it himself (ref, pages viii - x). Other algebra books with titles having this phrase were written by Al-Karaji a.k.a. Al-Karkhi (died circa 1029), Umar al-Khayyam (died 1123), and Ibn al-Banna (died 1321). Al-Khwarizmi's algebraic method was the same as the method of Diophantus of Alexandria, who wrote in the 3rd century AD in Greek. Diophantus's algebra book was in circulation in Arabic from the 10th century onward, and was known to Al-Karaji aka Al-Karkhi, but was not known to Al-Khwarizmi (refs below). At the time when the Latins started to learn mathematics from Al-Khwarizmi and from other Arabic sources in the 12th century, the Latins had no knowledge of the mathematics of Diophantus nor of similar other Late Greek sources.

In the late medieval Western languages the word \\"algebra\\" also had a medical sense, \\"restoration of broken body parts especially broken bones\\" ‚Äì ref: MED. This medical sense was entirely independent of the mathematical sense. It came from the same Arabic word by a different route. ;algorithm, algorism : ÿßŸÑÿÆŸàÿßÿ±ÿ≤ŸÖŸä al-khwƒÅrizmƒ´, a short name for the mathematician Muhammad ibn M≈´sƒÅ al- KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ (died c. 850). The word has no record in medieval Arabic mathematics except as a person's proper name. A few surviving 12th-century Latin introductory tutorials for working with the Hindu-Arabic numbers have algorizmi or alchorismi in the headline of the text with indications in the body of the text that it represents Al-Khwarizmi's name.\\"Early [ Latin Texts on Hindu-Arabic Calculation\\"], by Menso Folkerts, year 2001, 24 pages. \\"The Arabic Origins and Development of Latin Algorisms in the Twelfth Century\\", by Andr√© Allard, year 1991, 50 pages (abstract). Also \\"Two Twelfth Century Algorisms\\", by Louis C. Karpinski, year 1921, 19 pages. The 13th century Latin wordform was algorismus. In Latin and English from the 13th through 19th centuries both algorism and algorithm meant only the elementary methods of the Hindu-Arabic number system.The medieval Latin introductions to the Hindu- Arabic numeral system usually had the word algorismus in their title. The most popular such introduction was the one by Johannes de Sacrobosco, dated about 1230, about 20 pages long, which was also entitled De Arte Numerandi = \\"On the Craft of Arithmetic\\". Its opening paragraph says algorismus is the craft of arithmetic. Its popularity is inferred from the number of medieval copies that have survived ‚Äì Karpinski year 1915, Karpinski year 1911. \\"Algorithm\\" was effectively a new spelling in the mid-17th century, based on the model of the word Logarithm, with the \\"arithm\\" taken from ancient Greek arithmos = \\"arithmetic\\" and the \\"algor\\" descended from medieval Latin algorismus = \\"Hindu‚ÄìArabic numeral system\\". Algorithm simply meant the methods of the decimal number system until the late 19th century, at which point the word was almost obsolete, but then it was saved from oblivion by an expansion of the meaning to cover any systematic codified procedure in mathematics.

The word with that meaning was used by, e.g., the astronomers Ab≈´ al-WafƒÅ' B≈´zjƒÅnƒ´ (died 998) and Abu al-Salt (died 1134).Alidade in Dictionnaire √âtymologique Des Mots Fran√ßais D'Origine Orientale, by L. Marcel Devic, year 1876, on page 23 in footnotes, quotes in Arabic from Abu al-Wafa Buzjani. Glossaire des mots espagnols et portugais d√©riv√©s de l'arabe, by R. Dozy and W.H. Engelmann, year 1869, on page 219, quotes in Arabic from Ibn Abi Al-Salt (also known as Abu Al-Salt). The word with the same meaning entered Latin in the later Middle Ages in the context of Astrolabes.In Latin in the mid 12th century at least one Arabic- influenced book about Astrolabe instruments has alhaidada = \\"alidade\\" ‚Äì ref (page 63). Alhidada = \\"alidade\\" is in Spanish in the 1270s in a set of astronomy books that were largely derived from Arabic sources, the Libros del saber de astronom√≠a del rey Alfonso X de Castilla, where alhidada is a very frequent word ‚Äì ref. In Latin in year 1523 an introduction to astrolabes says: \\"Alhidada, an Arabic word, is a dial which turns and moves on the surface of an [astrolabe] instrument.\\" ‚Äì ref. In 18th-century English, Bailey's English Dictionary defined \\"alidada\\" as \\"the ruler or label that moves on the center of an astrolabe, quadrant, etc., and carries the sight.\\" ‚Äì ref. Crossref azimuth, which entered the European languages on the same pathway. ;alkali : ÿßŸÑŸÇŸÑŸä al-qalƒ´  al-qilƒ´, an alkaline material derived from the ashes of plants, specifically plants that grew on salty soils ‚Äì glassworts aka saltworts. The dictionary of Al-Jawhari (died c. 1003) said \\"al-qilƒ´ is obtained from glassworts\\". In today's terms, the medieval al-qalƒ´ was mainly composed of sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate.The medieval al-qalƒ´ was obtained from glasswort plants, i.e. succulent flowering plants that grow where water is salty. The plants contain high levels of sodium. When the plants are burned, much of the sodium ends up as sodium carbonate. Another major component in the ashes is potassium carbonate, plus the ashes contained some calcium compounds, plus various minor components. Medievally these plants were collected at seashores and other saline places, including desert places, and the plants were burned for their ashes, and these ashes were called al- qalƒ´ in Arabic. Making glass was the main thing the ashes were used for (also used for making soap). Non-salty-plant ashes were usable in making glass but the results were inferior. Analysis of the chemical composition of ancient glass from the Mediterranean region indicates that the ashes of glasswort plants (rich in sodium carbonate) were used as an ingredient in making glass thousands of years ago; Ancient Glass: An Interdisciplinary Exploration, by Julian Henderson, year 2013. The medieval Arabic milh al-qalƒ´ = \\"alkali salt\\" was a refined product that was refined from al-qalƒ´ = \\"alkali ashes\\" ‚Äì e.g., e.g.. The Arabs used it as an ingredient in making glass and making soap. The word's early records in the West are in Latin alchemy texts in and around the early 13th century, with the same meaning as the Arabic.One of the early records of \\"alkali\\" in the West is in the early 13th-century Latin alchemy text Liber Luminis Luminum, the authorship and/or translation of which is attributed to Michael Scotus (died in the 1230s), who had somewhere learned Arabic. This text is online in Latin as Appendix III of The Life and Legend of Michael Scot and some of its history is in \\"The Ars alchemie: the first Latin text on practical alchemy\\", by A. Vinciguerra, year 2009. Another Latin text that contains an early record of the word alkali is the Liber de Aluminibus et Salibus (English: Book of Alums and Salts), which is an Arabic-to-Latin translation with a date of late 12th or early 13th century in Latin and it is online in both Arabic and Latin at Ref (with \\"alkali salt\\" in section G ¬ß78). Those two Latin texts speak of sal alkali where sal = \\"salt\\", which corresponds to the medieval Arabic milh al-qalƒ´ where milh = \\"salt\\". Alkali is in the English language since the later 14th century ‚Äì ref: MED. It is also in Italian in the 14th century ‚Äì ref: TLIO (in Italian). The earliest French is 1509. CNRTL.fr cites a book by Guy de Chauliac using the word alkali in France in 1363, but that was in Latin, and the subsequent medieval translation of Chauliac's book into French did not use the Latin word ‚Äì ref: DMF, ref: French Chauliac. In Spanish, the first records are in Latin-to-Spanish translations about year 1500, translating Latin medical books written in Italy and France, as per Corpus Diacr√≥nico del Espa√±ol. ;ambergris and possibly amber: ÿπŸÜÿ®ÿ±  øanbar, meaning ambergris, i.e. a waxy material produced in the stomach of sperm whales and used historically for perfumery. From Arabic sellers of ambergris, the word passed into the Western languages in the mid-medieval centuries as ambra with the same meaning as the Arabic. In the late medieval centuries the Western word took on the additional meaning of amber, from causes not understood. The two meanings ‚Äì ambergris and amber ‚Äì then co- existed for more than four centuries. \\"Ambergris\\" was coined to eliminate the ambiguity (the color of ambergris is grey more often than not, and gris is French for grey). It wasn't until about 1700 that the ambergris meaning died out in English amber.Some very early records of word amber in medieval Latin are given at \\"ambre #2\\" @ CNRTL.fr. For the word in medieval Arabic see ÿπŸÜÿ®ÿ± @ Baheth.info and ÿπŸÜÿ®ÿ± @ Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon page 2168. Early records in English are in MED and NED. In the medieval era, ambergris mostly came from the shores of the Indian ocean (especially the western shores of India) and it was brought to the Mediterranean region by Arab traders, who called it  øanbar (also  øambar) and that is the parent word of the medieval Latin ambra (also ambar) with the same meaning. The word did not mean amber at any time in medieval Arabic. Meanwhile in the medieval era, amber mostly came from the Baltic Sea region of northern Europe. One can imagine in the abstract that a word of the form ambra meaning amber could be brought to Latin Europe by traders from the Baltic region. But the historical records are without any evidence for that. The records just show that the Latin word began with one meaning (ambergris) and later had two meanings (ambergris and amber). ;anil, aniline, polyaniline : ÿßŸÑŸÜŸäŸÑ al-nƒ´l  an-nƒ´l, indigo dye. Arabic word came from Sanskrit nili = \\"indigo\\". The indigo dye originally came from tropical India. From medieval Arabic, anil became the usual word for indigo in Portuguese and Spanish.Medieval Arabic had the word for indigo dye in the wordforms al-nƒ´l and al-nƒ´laj. Ibn al-Baitar (died 1248) freely intermixed both wordforms ‚Äì ref (on page 866). Users of the wordform nƒ´l or al-nƒ´l include Al-Muqaddasi (died c. 995), Ibn al-Awwam (died c. 1200), and Abd al- Latif al-Baghdadi (died 1231) ‚Äì citations are in Indigo in the Arab World, by Jenny Balfour-Paul, year 1997, on pages 20 and 184, and Histoire du commerce du Levant au moyen-√¢ge, by W. Heyd, year 1886, Volume 2 on pages 626-629. Late medieval Spanish had the word in the forms anil (c. 1295), annil (1250; 1482), and annir (1250; 1300; 1501) ‚Äì CORDE, Gual Camarena. Indigo dye was uncommon throughout Europe until the 16th century; history of indigo dye. In English anil is a natural indigo dye or the tropical American plant it is obtained from. Aniline is a technical word in dye chemistry dating from mid-19th- century Europe.\\"Anil\\" and \\"Aniline\\" in NED (year 1888). ;apricot: ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±ŸÇŸàŸÇ al- barq≈´q, apricot.Arabic al-barq≈´q means plum nowadays. Ibn al-Baitar (died 1248) lived in both the Maghreb and Syria. He wrote that the word meant apricot in the Maghreb and a species of plum in Syria ‚Äì ref: Dozy, year 1869. Ibn al-Awwam (died circa 1200) lived in the Maghreb and he said al-barq≈´q means apricot ‚Äì ref. In the medieval dictionary of Fairuzabadi, al-burq≈´q is an apricot ‚Äì ref: ÿ®ÿ±ŸÇŸàŸÇ @ Baheth.info . Arabic is in turn traceable back to Early Byzantine Greek and thence to classical Latin praecoqua, literally \\"precocious\\" and specifically precociously ripening peaches,Reported in An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language, by Walter W. Skeat, year 1888. Downloadable. i.e. apricots. The Arabic was passed onto the late medieval Spanish albarcoque and Catalan albercoc, each meaning apricot.albarcoque & albarquoque @ HispanicSeminary.org, albercoc @ Diccionari.cat. Early spellings in English included abrecok (year 1551), abrecox (1578), apricock (1593), each meaning apricot.\\"Apricot\\" in NED (year 1888). The letter 't' in today's English apricot has come from French. In French it starts around the 1520s as abricot and aubercot meaning apricot. ;arsenal : ÿØÿßÿ± ÿµŸÜÿßÿπÿ© dƒÅr sinƒÅ øa, literally \\"house of manufacturing\\" but in practice in medieval Arabic it meant government-run manufacturing, usually for the military, most notably for the navy.Medieval Arabic dƒÅr sinƒÅ øa was a manufacturing operation of the State, and could mean working the gold and silver of the sovereign, making weapons for the sovereign's military, or constructing and equipping warships ‚Äì \\"DƒÅr al-·π¢inƒÅ øa\\" in Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd Edition, edited by P. Bearman et al., published by Brill. Al-Masudi (died 956) wrote that \\"Rhodes is currently a dƒÅr sinƒÅ øa where the Byzantine Greeks build their war-ships\\" ‚Äì Al-Masudi's 10th-century Arabic. Ibn Batuta (died 1369) wrote that soon after Gibraltar had been retaken by Muslims from Christians in 1333 a \\"dƒÅr sina øa\\" was established at Gibraltar as a part of military strengthening there ‚Äì Ibn Batuta's 14th-century Arabic. The historian Ibn Khaldoun (died 1406) quotes an order of the Caliph Abdalmelic (died 705) to build at Tunis a dƒÅr sinƒÅ øa for the construction of everything necessary for the equipment and armament of seagoing vessels ‚Äì noted by Engelmann and Dozy 1869. In the Italian maritime republics in the 12th century the word was adopted to designate a naval dockyard, a place for building ships and military armaments for ships, and repairing armed ships. In the later-medieval centuries the biggest such arsenal in Europe was the Arsenal of Venice. 12th- century Italian-Latin has the spellings darsena, arsena and tarsanatus. In 14th-century Italian and Italian-Latin the spellings included terzana, arzana, arsana, arcenatus, tersanaia, terzinaia, darsena, and 15th-century tarcenale, all meaning a shipyard and in only some cases having naval building activity. In 16th-century French and English an arsenal was either a naval dockyard or an arsenal, or both. In today's French arsenal continues to have the same dual meanings as in the 16th century.English \\"arsenal\\" in NED (year 1888). More in French at CNRTL.fr and Dozy year 1869. More in Italian at Arabismi Medievali di Sicilia by Girolamo Caracausi (year 1983) and Tesoro della Lingua Italiana delle Origini (TLIO). And in German at Raja Tazi year 1998. Some of those references are citing the researcher :it:Giovan Battista Pellegrini. As reported by Pellegrini the form darsena meaning dockyard is in Latin in the port of Genoa in 1147, Pisa 1162, Sicily 1209. Two centuries later, from the port city of Pisa in Italian comes the form tersanaia (date 1313-23), tersanaja (1343) (where Italian j is pronounced y), terzinaia (later 14th century), meaning dockyard ‚Äì ref: CNRTL and TLIO. This form from 14th-century Pisa looks independently influenced by direct contact with the Arabic dƒÅr sinƒÅ øa, and not evolved out of the prior Italian-Latin darsena  arsana  tarsanatus. In later-medieval Catalan with meaning dockyard there was dara√ßana and darassana (references in Caracausi's book; and more in ref). The Catalan forms display contact with an Arabic form having a definite article, dƒÅr as- sinƒÅ øa. ;artichoke : ÿßŸÑÿÆÿ±ÿ¥ŸÅ al-kharshuf  ÿßŸÑÿÆÿ±ÿ¥ŸàŸÅ al-kharsh≈´f, artichoke. The word with that meaning has records in medieval Andalusi and Maghrebi Arabic, including at around year 1100.Medieval records of kharshuf  kharsh≈´f (also harshaf) meaning artichoke are cited in Corriente's A Dictionary of Andalusi Arabic, year 1997 page 153 and the dictionary explains the abbreviations it uses for its sources at pages xiii - xvii. The Andalusian Arab Ibn Baklarish (author of Musta øƒ´nƒ´; died early 12th century) spelled it kharshuf, as reported in Reinhart Dozy year 1869. The Andalusian Arab Ibn al-Khatƒ´b (died 1374) spelled it ÿÆŸèÿ±ÿ¥ŸèŸÅ khurshuf, as reported in Los Arabismos del Castellano en la Baja Edad Media, by Felipe Ma√≠llo Salgado year 1998. All the known medieval Arabic records of kharshuf  khurshuf are in authors who were located in the Far Western part of the Arabic-speaking world. The rest of the Arabic- speaking world used other words, but one of the other words was harshaf, which was obviously the parent of the Far Western kharshuf, as noted by Reinhart Dozy year 1869 and Marcel Devic year 1876. With the same meaning, Spanish alcachofa (circa 1400), Spanish carchofa (1423), Spanish alcarchofa (1423), Italian carciofjo (circa 1525) are phonetically close to the Arabic precedent, and so are today's Spanish alcachofa, today's Italian carciofo. It is not clear how the word mutated to French artichault (1538), northern Italian articiocch (circa 1550), northern Italian arcicioffo (16th century), English archecokk (1531), English artochock (1542),Early records in Spanish of alcachofa  carchofa  alcarchofa = \\"artichoke\\" are cited in Los Arabismos, by Ma√≠llo Salgado, year 1998. Instances in 16th century Italian are cited in artichaut @ CNRTL.fr and artichoke @ NED. The NED also has the early records in English. The ancient Greeks and Romans commonly ate artichokes, as documented in \\"Plants and Progress\\", by Michael Decker, year 2009, on pages 201-203. It is thought, but more evidence is desirable, that an improved artichoke cultivar arrived late in the medieval era and was the impetus for the spread of the new name in Europe in the 15th and early 16th centuries. but the etymology dictionaries unanimously say these have to be mutations of the Spanish and Italian word. ;assassin : ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ¥Ÿäÿ¥Ÿäÿ© al-hashƒ´shƒ´ya  ÿ≠ÿ¥Ÿäÿ¥ŸäŸÜ hashƒ´shƒ´n, an Arabic nickname for the Nizari Ismaili religious sect in the Levant during the Crusades era. This sect carried out assassinations against chiefs of other sects, including Crusading Christians, and the story circulated throughout Western Europe at the time (13th century and late 12th). Medievally in Latin & Italian & French, the sect was called the Assissini  Assassini. Medievally in Arabic texts the wordform is al-hashƒ´shƒ´ya, but by Arabic grammar this can be put in the form hashƒ´shƒ´n also. Hashƒ´shƒ´n is surely the wordform that the Latin Crusaders borrowed in the Levant. By well-known aspects of Latin & Italian & French phonetics, it is well understood why the wordform got phonetically changed from the Arabic Hashƒ´shƒ´n to the Latinate Assissini.\\"Genesis of the word Assassin\\" is ¬ß610 of the book History of the Ismailis, by Mumtaz Ali Tajddin (1998). Additional information at: assassin @ NED ; assassin @ CNRTL.fr ; assassino @ TLIO (in Italian) ; and Note #33: \\"Assassin\\" @ English Words Of Arabic Etymological Ancestry. The generalization of the sect's nickname to the meaning of any sort of assassin happened in Italian at the start of the 14th century. The word with the generalized meaning was often used in Italian in the 14th and 15th centuries.Tesoro della Lingua Italiana delle Origini (TLIO) : Search for words beginning with substring assassin-. In the mid 16th century the Italian word entered French, followed a little later by English. ;attar (of roses): ÿπÿ∑ÿ±  øitr, perfume, aroma. The English word came from the Hindi/Urdu-speaking area of northeast India in the late 18th century and its source was the Hindi/Urdu atr  itr = \\"perfume\\",The word attar is not used in European languages other than English. An early record in English, 1792: \\"Roses are a great article for the famous otter, all of which is commonly supposed to come from Bengal\\" in northeast India ‚Äì ref: NED. The earliest known use of the wordform \\"attar\\" according to the NED is in 1798 in The view of Hindoostan: Volume 2: Eastern Hindoostan, by Thomas Pennant, which says the roses for the attar are grown near Lucknow city in the Hindi/Urdu-speaking area of northeast India and the attar is extracted by distillation. In Urdu, ÿπÿ∑ÿ±  øatr   øitr = \\"perfume\\", and also ÿπÿ∑ÿßÿ±  øatƒÅr = \\"perfume\\"; see e.g. ÿπÿ∑ÿ± @ Platts' Urdu-English Dictionary, year 1884. The spelling in Hindi is ‡§á‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ittr  itr  itra = \\"perfume\\". In the English of India in the 19th century it was called \\"Otto of Roses, or by imperfect purists Attar of Roses, an essential oil obtained in India from the petals of the flower, a manufacture of which the chief seat is at Ghazipur\\", a city in the Hindi/Urdu-speaking area of northeast India ‚Äì Yule & Burnell, year 1903. The writer Fanny Parkes resided in India from 1822 to 1838 and was based at Allahabad city in the Hindi/Urdu-speaking area of northeast India from 1827 to 1838. She wrote about India: \\"The Muhammadans, both male and female, are extremely fond of perfumes of every sort and description ; and the quantity of atr of roses, atr of jasmine, atr of khas-khƒÅs, &c.;, that the ladies in a zenƒÅna put upon their garments is quite over powering.\\" ‚Äì Ref. which had come from the Persian  øitr = \\"perfume\\", and the Persian had come medievally from the Arabic  øitr. ;aubergine : ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿßÿØŸÜÿ¨ÿßŸÜ al-bƒÅdinjƒÅn, aubergine.A book on agriculture by Ibn Al-Awwam in 12th century Andalusia described how to grow the aubergine. Ibn al-Awwam spelled it ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿßÿØŸÜÿ¨ÿßŸÜ al-bƒÅdinjƒÅn = \\"aubergine\\" ‚Äì Banqueri year 1802, Cl√©ment-Mullet year 1866. Among copies of Ibn Al-Awwam's book there is the very unusual spelling ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿßÿ±ŸÜÿ¨ÿßŸÜ al-bƒÅrinjƒÅn, reported by Cl√©ment-Mullet 1866, but this is probably a scribal error. The most common spelling among medieval writers was ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿßÿ∞ŸÜÿ¨ÿßŸÜ al-bƒÅdhinjƒÅn (which is also today's spelling). The Arabic dictionary Lisan Al-Arab dated 1290 has the comment that the word came to Arabic from Persian ‚Äì ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿßÿ∞ŸÜÿ¨ÿßŸÜ @ Baheth.info . The plant is native to India. It was unknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans. It was introduced to the Mediterranean region by the medieval Arabs. The Arabic name entered Iberian Romance languages late medievally, producing late medieval Spanish alberengena = \\"aubergine\\" and Catalan alberginia = \\"aubergine\\".15th century Spanish has instances of all the spellings berengena  alberengena  bereniena  berenjena  verengena  alverengena  verenjena  verengenal = \\"aubergine\\", all in 15th century Spanish texts available at HispanicSeminary and Corpus Diacr√≥nico del Espa√±ol. The usual in 15th century Catalan was alberginia. The earliest in Catalan is year 1328 says Diccionari.cat. Despite plentiful instances in the 15th, the word is a rarity before the 15th in Spanish or Catalan. The phonetic change from /d/ to /r/ in going from the Arabic al-bƒÅdinjƒÅn to the Spanish (al)berengena is very poorly understood and not understood. The Catalan was the parent of the French aubergine, which starts in the mid-18th century and which embodies a change from al- to au- that happened in French.The phonetic shift from -al- to -au- is common in French. French words showing this shift that have been borrowed into English include auburn, faux, mauve and sauce, as well as aubergine. The aubergine name has been found in provincial French some centuries ago as albergine (ref), in addition to the late medieval Catalan alberginia (year 1383)  albarginia ;average : ÿπŸàÿßÿ±  øawƒÅr, a defect, or anything defective or damaged, including partially spoiled merchandise; and ÿπŸàÿßÿ±Ÿä  øawƒÅrƒ´ (also ÿπŸàÿßÿ±ÿ©  øawƒÅra) = \\"of or relating to  øawƒÅr, a state of partial damage\\".Medieval Arabic had ÿπŸàÿ±  øawr meaning \\"blind in one eye\\" and ÿπŸàÿßÿ±  øawƒÅr meant \\"any defect, or anything defective or damaged\\". Some medieval Arabic dictionaries are at Baheth.info , and some translation to English of what's in the medieval Arabic dictionaries is in Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, pages 2193 and 2195. The medieval dictionaries do not list the word-form ÿπŸàÿßÿ±Ÿäÿ©  øawƒÅrƒ´a.  øAwƒÅrƒ´a can be naturally formed in Arabic grammar to refer to things that have  øawƒÅr, but in practice in medieval Arabic texts  øawƒÅrƒ´a is a rarity or non-existent, while the forms ÿπŸàÿßÿ±Ÿä  øawƒÅrƒ´ and ÿπŸàÿßÿ±ÿ©  øawƒÅra are frequently used when referring to things that have  øawƒÅr or damage ‚Äì this can be seen in the searchable collection of medieval texts at AlWaraq.net (book links are clickable on righthand side). Within the Western languages the word's history begins in medieval sea-commerce on the Mediterranean. 12th and 13th century Genoa Latin avaria meant \\"damage, loss and non-normal expenses arising in connection with a merchant sea voyage\\"; and the same meaning for avaria is in Marseille in 1210, Barcelona in 1258 and Florence in the late 13th. 15th-century French avarie had the same meaning, and it begot English \\"averay\\" (1491) and English \\"average\\" (1502) with the same meaning. Today, Italian avaria, Catalan avaria and French avarie still have the primary meaning of \\"damage\\". The huge transformation of the meaning in English began with the practice in later medieval and early modern Western merchant-marine law contracts under which if the ship met a bad storm and some of the goods had to be thrown overboard to make the ship lighter and safer, then all merchants whose goods were on the ship were to suffer proportionately (and not whoever's goods were thrown overboard); and more generally there was to be proportionate distribution of any avaria. From there the word was adopted by British insurers, creditors, and merchants for talking about their losses as being spread across their whole portfolio of assets and having a mean proportion. Today's meaning developed out of that, and started in the mid-18th century, and started in English.The Arabic origin of avaria was first reported by Reinhart Dozy in the 19th century. Dozy's original summary is in his 1869 book Glossaire. Summary information about the word's early records in Italian-Latin, Italian, Catalan, and French is at avarie @ CNRTL.fr. The seaport of Genoa is the location of the earliest-known record in European languages, year 1157. A set of medieval Latin records of avaria at Genoa is in the downloadable lexicon Vocabolario Ligure, by Sergio Aprosio, year 2001, avaria in Volume 1 pages 115-116. Many more records in medieval Latin at Genoa are at StoriaPatriaGenova.it, usually in the plurals avariis and avarias. At the port of Marseille in the 1st half of the 13th century notarized commercial contracts have dozens of instances of Latin avariis (ablative plural of avaria), as published in Blancard year 1884. Some information about the English word over the centuries is at NED (year 1888). See also the definition of English \\"average\\" in English dictionaries published in the early 18th century, i.e., in the time period just before the big transformation of the meaning: Kersey-Phillips' dictionary (1706), Blount's dictionary (1707 edition), Hatton's dictionary (1712), Bailey's dictionary (1726), Martin's dictionary (1749). Some complexities surrounding the English word's history are discussed in Hensleigh Wedgwood year 1882 page 11 and Walter Skeat year 1888 page 781. Today there is consensus that: (#1) today's English \\"average\\" descends from medieval Italian avaria, Catalan avaria, and (#2) among the Latins the word avaria started in the 12th century and it started as a term of Mediterranean sea-commerce, and (#3) there is no root for avaria to be found in Latin, and (#4) a substantial number of Arabic words entered Italian, Catalan and Proven√ßal in the 12th and 13th centuries starting as terms of Mediterranean sea-commerce, and (#5) the Arabic  øawƒÅr   øawƒÅrƒ´ is phonetically a good match for avaria, as conversion of w to v was regular in Latin and Italian, and -ia is a suffix in Italian, and the Western word's earliest records are in Italian-speaking locales (writing in Latin). And most commentators agree that (#6) the Arabic  øawƒÅr   øawƒÅrƒ´ = \\"damage  relating to damage\\" is semantically a good match for avaria = \\"damage or damage expenses\\". A minority of commentators have been dubious about this on the grounds that the early records of Italian-Latin avaria have, in some cases, a meaning of \\"an expense\\" in a more general sense ‚Äì see TLIO (in Italian). The majority view is that the meaning of \\"an expense\\" was an expansion from \\"damage and damage expense\\", and the chronological order of the meanings in the records supports this view, and the broad meaning \\"an expense\\" was never the most commonly used meaning. On the basis of the above points, the inferential step is made that the Latinate word came or probably came from the Arabic word. ;azimuth : ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÖŸàÿ™ al-sum≈´t  as-sum≈´t, the directions, the azimuths. The word was in use in medieval Arabic astronomy including with the Arabic version of the Astrolabe instrument. It was borrowed into Latin in the mid 12th century as azimuth in the context of using Astrolabes.In medieval Arabic astronomy the usual word for an azimuth or direction was al-samt and the plural form of this was al-sum≈´t. The plural form was the source for the medieval Latin azimuth. Normally, the medieval Arabic texts on astronomy use the word in the singular. For instance, the astronomy book of Al-Battani (died 929) has the word 180 times in the singular and only once in the plural ‚Äì Ref. The Book of Optics of Ibn al-Haytham (died 1040) is not an astronomy book but it is notable for containing about 90 instances of ÿ≥ŸÖŸàÿ™ sum≈´t = \\"directions\\" ‚Äì Ref. The medieval Latins adopted the word in the plural through their adoption of Arabic astrolabes, which were set up to deal with a large number of defined azimuths. For background historical context see \\"Translations from Arabic Astronomy/Astrology: The Formation of [ medieval latin Terminology\\"], by Paul Kunitzsch, year 2005; and \\"The Treatise on the Astrolabe by Rudolf of Bruges\\", by Richard Lorch, year 1999. In the mid 13th century in Spanish, a√ßumut  a√ßumuth is in a set of astronomy books that took heavily from Arabic sources and again Astrolabes is the context of use.See a√ßumut + a√ßumuth @ CORDE RAE, which quotes from the Libros del saber de astronom√≠a del rey Alfonso X de Castilla, a set of Spanish astronomy books commissioned by king Alfonso X of Castille, completed about 1277, consisting largely of Arabic-to-Spanish translations. The earliest in English is in the 1390s in Geoffrey Chaucer's Treatise on the Astrolabe, which used the word about a dozen times. ;azure (colour), lazurite (mineral), azurite (mineral), lazulite (mineral) : ŸÑÿßÿ≤Ÿàÿ±ÿØ lƒÅzward  lƒÅz≈´ard, lazurite and lapis lazuli, a rock with a vivid blue colour, and this rock was crushed to a powder for use as a blue colourant in inks, paints, eye-makeup, etc.One medieval Arabic introduction to lƒÅzward = \\"azure stone\\" is in the 11th-century Book of Precious Stones of Al-Biruni. Al-Biruni emphasises lƒÅzward is crushed to a powder to be used as a blue colourant ‚Äì ref (page 115 and elsewhere). The 9th-century Arabic Stone Book of Aristotle (so- called; pseudonymously authored) says powdered lƒÅzward is used as eye makeup ‚Äì ref. An 11th-century book about how to make inks, written by a servant of emir Ibn Badis, uses powdered lƒÅzward as a blue ink colourant ‚Äì ref (on pages 29‚Äì30). Medievally lƒÅzward was also used as a polished stone uncrushed, but the powdered form had greater use. Ibn Sina (died 1037) and Abu Ja øfar al- GhƒÅfiqi (died c. 1165) said the blue colourant stone known in Arabic as hajar al-armenƒ´ (literally: Armenian stone) (interpret: Azurite) is inferior to the lƒÅzward stone (interpret: Lazurite) ‚Äì ref (page 755 and page 225). The word is ultimately from the place-name of a large deposit of azure-blue rock in northeastern Afghanistan (\\"Lajward\\"), which was the chief and probably the only source-place for the most-desired type of azure-blue rock in the medieval era ‚Äì the type called Lazurite today. Medievally the word was also used for other types of azure-blue rock that were less costly, especially the type called Azurite today. Latin had azurium and lazurium for the rocks, with records starting in the 9th century. Late medieval English had azure and lazurium for the rocks.Middle English Dictionary, entries for azure and lazurium. From the powdered rocks, azure was a color-name in all the later- medieval Western languages. Today's Russian, Ukrainian and Polish have the colour-name spelled with the letter 'L' (–ª–∞–∑—É—Ä—å, lazur). B ;benzoin, benzene, benzoic acid : ŸÑÿ®ÿßŸÜ ÿ¨ÿßŸàŸä lubƒÅn jƒÅwƒ´, benzoin resin, literally \\"frankincense of Java\\". Benzoin is a natural resin from an Indonesian tree. Arab sea-merchants shipped it to the Middle East for sale as perfumery and incense in the later medieval centuries. It first came to Europe in the early 15th century. The European name benzoin is a great mutation of the Arabic name lubƒÅn jƒÅwƒ´ and the linguistic factors that caused the mutation are well understood.JƒÅwƒ´ refers to Java in modern Arabic, but it referred to Sumatra in the medieval travel writer Ibn Batuta (died 1368 or 1369), who said that the best lubƒÅn jƒÅwƒ´ came from Sumatra ‚Äì Dozy, year 1869. The explanation for how the Arabic \\"lubƒÅn jƒÅwƒ´\\" got corrupted to the English \\"benzoin\\" is as follows, copied partly from Benjoin @ CNRTL.fr. The word is seen in Catalan in 1430 spelled benju√≠ and in Catalan the definite article was lo. It is seen in French in 1479 spelled benjuyn and in French the definite article was le. In French the letter J is pronounced not far from the neighborhood of zh (as in \\"soup du zhour\\") and that is similar to the Arabic letter J (ÿ¨). But in Latin and Italian, the letter J is pronounced as a Y (as in \\"Yuventus\\"). Therefore writing Z instead of J would be somewhat more phonetic in Latin and Italian. The word is seen in Italian in 1461 spelled benzoi (Italian i is pronounced like English ee) ‚Äì Yule & Burnell 1903. Similarly in Italian in 1510 a traveller in the Arabian peninsula wrote \\"Zida\\" for Jeddah and wrote \\"Azami\\" for Ajami ‚Äì Travels of Ludovico di Varthema (page 7 footnote 3). Italian benzoino begins in the 16th century. The appended letter 'n' in Italian benzoino is a Latinate and Italian suffix (descending from classical Latin -inus). Among European chemists, benzoin resin was the original source for benzoic acid, which when decaboxylated gives benzene ;bezoar: ÿ®ÿßÿ≤Ÿáÿ± bƒÅzahr and ÿ®ÿßÿØÿ≤Ÿáÿ± bƒÅdzahr (from Persian p√¢dzahr), a type of hard bolus, containing calcium compounds, sometimes formed in the stomachs of goats (and other ruminants). Today in English a bezoar is a medical and veterinary term for a ball of indigestible material that collects in the stomach and fails to pass through the intestines. Goat bezoars were recommended by medieval Arabic medical writers for use as antidotes to poisons, particularly arsenic poisons. That is how the word first entered medieval Latin medical vocabulary.\\"Bezoar\\" in Yule & Burnell (year 1903). \\"Bezoard\\" in Devic (year 1876)(in French). See also \\"A Treatise on the Bezoar Stone\\", by Mahmud bin Masud Imad al-Din, published in English translation in Annals of Medical History year 1935, 8 pages. \\"Bezoars\\" by R. Van Tassel, year 1973, 19 pages, has a survey of the chemical and mineralogical composition of the historical bezoars. ;borax, borate, boron : ÿ®Ÿàÿ±ŸÇ b≈´raq, various salts, including borax. Borax (i.e., sodium borate) was in use medievally primarily as a fluxing agent in soldering gold, silver and metal ornaments. The ancient Greeks and Romans used fluxing agents in metalworking, but borax was unknown to them. In medieval Europe there was no borax except as an import from Arabian lands. The Arabs imported at least part of it from India. From Arabic b≈´raq, Latin adopted the name borax  baurach in the 12th century meaning borax for fluxing metals, and sometimes later more loosely meaning any kind of salts for fluxing metals.Medieval Arabic b≈´raq encompassed various salts used for various purposes, and the name often came with a qualifier attached to give more specificity. The salts included naturally occurring sodium carbonate (natron) and sodium borate (borax). On the other hand, medieval Arabic tinkƒÅr meant specifically borax. TinkƒÅr was used primarily as a fluxing agent in soldering metals. It seems the Arabs and Persians were introduced to it from sources in India. The Persian and Arabic name tinkƒÅr probably originated from a Sanskritic word tinkana meaning borax from Tibet and Cashmere ‚Äì H. Grieb, year 2004. The medieval Arabic writer Al-Razi (died c. 930) said that tinkƒÅr is one type of b≈´raq and another type is \\"goldsmith's b≈´raq\\" (meaning a type of salt in customary use by goldsmiths for soldering) ‚Äì H. Grieb, year 2004. More examples of usage of both b≈´raq and tinkƒÅr in medieval Arabic are in ref and ref. In late medieval Latin alchemy books it was spelled borax, baurac (e.g.), baurach (e.g.), boracia, and other similar, and for some late medieval Latin writers this word had the same broad meaning as in Arabic (e.g.) but more usually in late medieval Latin it meant a substance used as a fluxing agent ‚Äì e.g., e.g., e.g.. Later-medieval Latin also had tincar  atincar  tinkar, always meaning a fluxing agent, usually borax, not always borax ‚Äì e.g., e.g., e.g., e.g.. In the 16th and 17th centuries in European metallurgy literature, non-borax substances could be called \\"borax\\" when they were used as fluxing agents, and borax at that time was often called tincar  atincar, and \\"Arabian borax\\", as well as \\"borax\\" ‚Äì Martin Ruland's year 1612 Lexicon Alchemiae (in Latin) has the definitions of that era for tinckar, borax, boras, baurac, and chrysocolla. In medieval Arabic the usual name for borax was ÿ™ŸÜŸÉÿßÿ± tinkƒÅr. This name was adopted by the medieval Latins starting in the 12th century as tincar  atincar with the same meaning. Today's Tincalconite, which is a mineral variant of borax, is descended from the medieval Latin tincar = \\"borax\\",Tincal @ CNRTL.fr. Greater details about the Portuguese origin of the wordform tincal as a variant of the medieval Latin tincar, from the medieval Arabic tinkƒÅr, at English Words of Arabic Etymological Ancestry: Note #44: Borax and Tincal. conjoined with ancient Greek konis = \\"powder\\" plus the conventional suffix -ite. \\"Boron\\" and \\"borate\\" descend from \\"borax\\". Bouquet: ÿ®ÿßŸÇÿ© Addendum for words that may or may not be of Arabic ancestry ;alizarin: Alizarin is a red dye with considerable commercial usage. The word's first records are in the early 19th century in France as alizari. The origin and early history of the French word is obscure. Questionably, it may have come from the Arabic ÿßŸÑÿπÿµÿßÿ±ÿ© al- øasƒÅra = \\"the juice\\" (from Arabic root  øasar = \\"to squeeze\\"). A majority of today's dictionaries endorse the al-  øasƒÅra idea, while a minority say the connection with al- øasƒÅra is improbable.Until the late 19th century the alizarin dye was made from the roots of the madder plant, aka Rubia tinctorum plant. (Today alizarin is made in pure synthetic form). Dye-making from the madder root was common in medieval and early modern Europe. The word alizari[n] is only on record from the early 19th century. In France in year 1831 the official dictionary of the French language defined \\"izari\\" as \\"madder from the Levant\\" and flagged it as a recent word ‚Äì Ref. It seems that an expansion of exports of madder from the Levant to western Europe may have occurred in the early 19th century ‚Äì Ref. But (1) the Arabic word for madder was a completely different word; (2) the Arabic al- øa·π£ƒÅra = \\"the juice\\" is very rarely or not at all used in Arabic in any sense of a dye; and (3) the way you get the dyestuff from the madder root is by drying the root, followed by milling the dried root into a powder ‚Äì not by juicing or squeezing. So the Arabic verb  øa·π£ar = \\"to squeeze\\" is semantically off-target, as well as being unattested in the relevant sense. Also the earliest known records are in French and it is not natural for an Arabic '·π£' to be converted to a French 'z' instead of a French 's' ‚Äì Ref. Regarding the Spanish word alizari the experts Dozy & Engelmann say it looks Arabic but they can find no progenitor for it in Arabic ‚Äì Ref: (year 1869) (page 144). In 1826, chemist Pierre Jean Robiquet discovered in madder root two distinct molecules with dye properties. The one producing a rich red he called \\"alizarin\\" and it soon entered all major European languages as a scientific word. Robiquet says in his 1826 research report: \\"regarding this new [red] entity coming from the neutral-coloured substance, we propose the name alizarin, from alizari, a term used in commerce for the entire madder root.\\" ‚Äì Ref: (year 1826)(page 411). ;almanac : This word's earliest securely dated record in the West is in Latin in 1267. A very small number of possibly a little earlier records exist but come with insecure dates. In its early records in Latin it was spelled almanac and it meant a set of tables detailing movements of astronomical bodies. Namely the movements of the five then-known planets and the moon and the sun. A lot of medieval Arabic writings on astronomy exist, and they don't use a word that can be matched to the Latin almanac. One of the words they do use is \\"zƒ´j\\" and another is \\"taqwƒ´m\\". The 19th-century Arabic-word-origin experts Engelmann & Dozy said about almanac: \\"To have the right to argue that it is of Arabic origin, one must first find a candidate word in Arabic\\" and they found none. There is a medieval Arabic ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿßÿÆ al-munƒÅkh, which would be a good fit phonetically, but it has no semantic connection to the Latin almanac. The origin of the Latin remains obscure.The first securely dated records of almanac in the West come from Roger Bacon (died 1294), who lived in northern Europe (Paris) and had no knowledge of Arabic. Roger Bacon writing in Latin spelled it almanac and almanach, both of which are foreign-looking in Latin. They definitely look Arabic in Latin. But no antecedent word is on record in Arabic. Thus the origin of the Latin is a puzzle. Some worthwhile information and some speculations about it are given at \\"Almanac\\" in New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (year 1888). In some other dictionaries it is claimed that the Latin almanac came from Arabic al-munƒÅkh and in particular it is claimed that munƒÅkh is attested meaning almanac in medieval Arabic. Those dictionaries include CNRTL.fr and Franz√∂sisches Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch (year 2002). However, the medieval documentary evidence for this claim is extremely weak and is nothing more than a statement by a native Spanish speaker written after the word had come into use in Latin. There is no medieval attestation of munƒÅkh meaning almanac in actual Arabic. More details at English Words of Arabic Etymological Ancestry: Note #165: \\"Almanac\\" ;amalgam, amalgamate: This word is first seen in European languages in 13th and 14th century Latin alchemy texts, where it meant an amalgam of mercury with another metal, and it was spelled amalgama. It lacks a plausible origin in terms of Latin precedents. In medieval Arabic records the word ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑÿ∫ŸÖ al- malgham  ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑÿ∫ŸÖÿ© al-malghama meaning \\"amalgam\\" is uncommon, but does exist and was used by a number of different Arabic writers. Today some English dictionaries say the Latin was from this Arabic, or probably was. But other dictionaries are unconvinced, and say the origin of the Latin is obscure.Dictionaries reporting the 13th-century Latin amalgama to be either surely or probably from Arabic al-malgham include Partridge (1966), Raja Tazi (1998), Random House Dictionary (2001), and Etymonline.com (2010). Loss of the first 'L' in going from al-malgham to amalgama (if it occurred) is called dissimilation in linguistics. Documentation in medieval Arabic for al- malgham(a) = \\"amalgam\\" is presented in W√∂rterbuch der klassischen arabischen Sprache, by Manfred Ullmann, Volume 2, on pages 901 and 902, year 1991, which collects examples from around a dozen different medieval Arabic texts. As an item supplementing Manfred Ullmann's collection, the Arabic dictionary of Ibn Sida (died 1066) states: \\"any melting substance such as gold, etc. mixed with mercury is called ŸÖŸèŸÑŸíÿ∫ŸéŸÖŸå molgham\\" ‚Äì ŸÑÿ∫ŸÖ @ Ibn Sƒ´da's dictionary. Ibn Sida's statement was copied into the dictionary of Ibn Manzur (died 1312) ‚Äì ŸÑÿ∫ŸÖ @ Lisan al-Arab. The Book of Precious Stones of Al-Biruni (died 1048), in its chapter on mercury, has grammatical plural ŸÖŸÑÿßÿ∫ŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ∞Ÿáÿ®... ŸÖŸÑÿßÿ∫ŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ∂ÿ© malƒÅghim al-dhahab... malƒÅghim al-fida = \\"gold amalgams... silver amalgams\\"; and elsewhere in the same book Al-Biruni has ŸÉÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑÿ∫ŸÖÿ© kal-malghama meaning a paste consisting of cowdung and salt (where Arabic kal- = \\"-like\\" = \\"sort of\\") ‚Äì Ref. The Syriac-to-Arabic dictionary of Bar Bahlul (died late 10th century) says in Syriac that a ‹°‹†‹ì‹°‹ê malagma of mercury with silver is called ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑÿ∫ŸÖÿ© al-malghama in Arabic ‚Äì ref: ‹ê‹¶‹™‹ò‹£‹†‹ù‹¢‹ò‹¢ @ Bar Bahlul column 267, line 25. Additional details about the medieval word are at English Words of Arabic Etymological Ancestry: Note #24 \\"Amalgam\\". ;antimony : This word's first known record is in Constantinus Africanus (died circa 1087), who was a widely circulated medical author in later-medieval Latin (crossref borage). His spelling was \\"antimonium\\". The medieval meaning was antimony sulfide. Antimony sulfide was well known to the medieval Arabs under the names ithmid and kohl and well known to the Latins under the name stibi  stibium  stimmi. The medieval Latin name antimonium is of obscure origin. Possibly it is a Latinized form of some Arabic name but no clear precedent in Arabic has been found. In the Western European languages other than Latin, in the late medieval period, antimony is a \\"bookish\\" word arriving from the Latin. It is found in medical books and alchemy books. ;borage (plant), Boraginaceae (botanical family) :The borage plant is native to the Mediterranean area. It was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans under other names. The name borage is from medieval Latin borago  borrago  borragine. The name is first seen in Constantinus Africanus, an 11th-century Latin medical writer and translator whose native language was Arabic and who drew from Arabic medical sources. Many of today's etymology dictionaries suppose the name to be from Arabic and report the proposition that Constantinus took it from ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿπÿ±ŸÇ ab≈´  øaraq = \\"sweat inducer\\", because borage leaves supposedly had a sweat-inducing effect and the word would be pronounced b≈´araq in Arabic. However, in medieval Arabic no such name is on record for borage, and phonetically the match between b≈´araq and borrago is weak, and Constantinus makes no mention of sweat in connection with borage, and a non-Arabic good alternative proposition exists.Constantinus Africanus writing in Latin in Italy in the late 11th century mentions two Arabic names for borage (including the usual name for borage in medieval Arabic, lisƒÅn al-th≈´r) and he does not indicate that his own name borrago  borragine is an Arabic name. (, ). Nevertheless an Arabic source-word for borrago is the preferred proposition in a majority of today's dictionaries. A large minority of dictionaries prefer the non-Arabic proposition of deriving borrago from Latin burra  borra = \\"coarse wool, stuffing\\", horse-hair or wool used as stuffing, also \\"shaggy garment\\", \\"garment made of coarse material\\"; medieval Italian borra = \\"raw hair, particularly raw hair used as wadding\\" (today's Italian borra means \\"wadding\\") ‚Äì borra @ TLIO.ovi.cnr.it, borra @ ETIMO.it. This derivation is in observance of borage's hairy stems and rough-textured leaves, together with the Latin suffix -ago appended. The suffix \\"-ago\\" in Latin means \\"a sort of\\" (examples: classical Latin virago where Latin vir = \\"courageous man\\"; classical Latin plumbago (mineral) where Latin plumbum = \\"lead (a metal)\\"; classical Latin plantago where Latin planta = \\"foot-sole\\") and it is in botanical names from Latin including Filago, Medicago, Plantago, Plumbago, Selago, Solidago, Tussilago, Ventilago, fabago, githago, lentago, liliago, populago, trixago. Details surrounding the word's beginnings in medieval Latin are given at Note #167: \\"Borage\\" @ English Words of Arabic Etymological Ancestry, from which a conclusion is made that the medieval Latinate word did not come from Arabic.

Critical reception The Los Angeles Review wrote of The View from the Body (2016): \\"Context is everything for meaning; there is no definition free of it. We are all in a context inextricably bound up in the definition of who we are. For better or worse, that imposes limits, especially the physical ones, with death being the ultimate defining context. However, the struggle against limits remains heroic and is better than the alternatives of apathy, acquiescence, even the embrace of oppression.

She donated the Palazzo Zuccari to house the Bibliotheca Hertziana in 1912. Early life Hertz attended school in Cologne, where her family had settled in 1844. Henriette was the fourth child, the eldest girl, of seventeen children, of which seven survived infancy. She spent her school years studying painting and the history of art. In 1871, Hertz, who had been born Jewish, converted to Protestantism.Florens Deuchler, \\"Hertz, Henriette\\", in Neue Deutsche Biographie 8 (1969), pp. 714-15 (online edition) Life in Rome, to 1912 Henriette Hertz is now known mainly through her establishment of the Bibliotheca Hertziana, granted to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute (KWI) in 1913 (from 1953, the Max Planck Society).History of the Institute - Bibliotheca Hertziana The Palazzo Zuccari in Rome was an \\"open house\\" In 1889 Hertz, with her wealthy friends Frida and Ludwig Mond, rented parts of the Palazzo Zuccari in Rome. Backed by Ludwig Mond's fortune earned in the British soda industry, the Monds and Hertz maintained an \\"open house\\" salon in Rome; regular visitors included Gabriele d'Annunzio, the Italian mathematician Pietro Blaserna, Paul Deussen, the writer Olga von Gerstfeldt and the art historian Ernst Steinmann, Wolfgang Helbig, Theodor Mommsen, Giovanni Morelli, and the violinist Teresina Tua, a/k/a Teresa Tua.History of the Institute - Bibliotheca HertzianaJulia Rischbieter, Henriette Hertz: M√§zenin und Gr√ºnderin der Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rom, Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004. In 1904, the Palazzo was purchased in Hertz's name, along with an adjoining building, the Casa dei Preti. With the support of Frida Mond and Steinmann, Hertz began to collect books on Italian art. During the ensuing years (1904-1912), Hertz collected the core of a research library focussed upon the art of Italy, and particularly of Rome. Extensive re- modelling of the palazzetto enabled the ground floor to be used for the library, which was installed in the winter of 1910-1911. The Sala di Disegno in the palazzetto has retained its original early twentieth-century furnishings, and was one of the five rooms originally used for the library. Despite opposition from Paul Fridolin Kehr, director of the Prussian Historical Institute in Rome, the Bibliotheca Hertziana was gifted to the KWI in 1912 with Ernst Steinmann as its foundation director. The Bibliotheca hosted the tenth International Congress of Art History of 1912,Max-Planck- Gesellschaft, \\"Rome: The first institute for the human sciences\\" which featured a plenary paper presented by Aby Warburg. The Bibliotheca Hertziana and the KWI On 15 January 1913, the Bibliotheca was officially inaugurated. Hertz gave the palazzetto and the entire inventory of its library to the KWI, along with substantial legacies to fund the operation of the Institute, and to expand the library. Hertz died in Rome on 9 April 1913, and was buried in the Cimitero Acattolico. Her tombstone was crafted by the artist Otto Placzek.

Hughes departed from Miletich Fighting Systems in order to start the team, alongside then-current EliteXC Middleweight Champion Robbie Lawler, longtime boxing coach Matt Pena, and wrestling/conditioning teacher Marc Fiore. History It was named H.I.T. Squad since its inception, before it was bought in 2011. H.I.T. Squad opened with an area of 13,500-square-foot gym in Granite City, Illinois, and initially included three other fighters: Robbie Lawler, Greco-Roman wrestling champion Jacob Hey, and The Ultimate Fighter 5 contestant Corey Hill. The training center, which was opened to the public in January 2008, was originally run by Hughes, Fiore, Lawler and Pena. Their desire to start a world-class facility was the motivating factor, while Hughes also wanted to be closer to his family in Hillsboro, Illinois. However, rumors of a broken relationship with Pat Miletich being a contributing factor were false. Purchase On March 23, 2012, it was announced by H.I.T. Squad representatives that they were under new ownership. Jesse Finney, a recently retired fighter from St. Louis, became the new owner, and the team's name was changed to Finney's HIT Squad. After the transaction was closed, Finney stated that the team would remain intact.

The episode was written by Kristin Cantrell, while being directed by Tommy Gormley. Plot The radio previously collected by the Fringe team from the pocket universe (as seen in \\"Through the Looking Glass and What Walter Found There\\") starts to receive a strange signal, but when they look for Walter (John Noble) to decode, they find that he has taken a dose of the hallucinatory drug \\"black blotter\\". When Peter asks him why he took LSD, Walter explains that he was desperate to remember the plan and implies that he thought this would help, but that he did not know they would be getting a message on the radio. He then confesses to Peter that he asked Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) to remove the pieces of brain that they had to restore to repair his brain after being in amber for so long; he asked for this because he felt he was becoming his old self who was a much crueler man. As Walter suffers from visions of his old lab assistant, Carla Warren (Jenni Blong) and images relating to his first passage to the parallel universe (as seen in \\"Peter\\"), the rest of the team work with Anil (Shaun Smyth) to triangulate the signal from the radio. Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Olivia (Anna Torv) travel to the site in a nearby forest, and find the decades-old remains of Observers and members of the human resistance, including one with Sam Weiss's identification. The two recognize that Sam and his allies were defending a makeshift transmitter tower that was relaying the radio signal, and find where the signal is broadcasting from. Walter is drawn by his hallucination of Carla to a spot in the lab where he had hidden a notebook containing many of his ideas, including the original design for the device to cross between universes. His vision of Carla claims that she died in a lab fire in trying to destroy the notebook. Nina Sharp appears in the hallucination and warns Walter not to read the notebook again. Peter, Olivia, Walter, and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) travel to a boat dock across from the island site where the radio signal originates, briefly stalled by a Loyalist force. Upon the island, they find the signal coming from a house, where a couple, Richard (Tom Butler) and Carolyn (Maria Marlow), are staying along with the Observer child (as seen in \\"Inner Child\\") which Walter had hidden in the pocket universe with help of an unknown person referred to as \\"Donald\\". They demand a password before they allow the group to approach that would have been encoded in the radio signal; Walter, through his drugged mind (we see a slightly surreal cutout animation in the style of Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame), is able to assemble the password \\"black umbrella\\". The couple allow them in and prepare the child, whom they have named Michael, for traveling, and explain that they were former members of the Resistance forces; as they were ready to settle down, Donald left them with Michael for protection, and as per his instructions, they activated the radio signal every five days. The Fringe team returns with Michael back to the lab. Olivia discovers that Michael still remembers her, despite having only met in the original timeline. Meanwhile, Walter, still in his drug-addled state, reminisces about his past and the damage that his more sinister side has done, and decides to burn the notebook. However, his hallucination of Carla warns that he has already done the damage, having recalled what he was capable of; when he next looks up, he finds he is looking at himself, a grim smile on his face. Walter snaps alert, finding no notebook and the lab empty. Production \\"Black Blotter\\" was written by Kristin Cantrell, marking her first writing credit for the series; she previously served as a script coordinator. It was directed by Tommy Gormley, making his first solo directing credit. He served as first assistant director on several of Fringe co-creator J.J. Abrams' projects, including Star Trek and Super 8. Within the episode is a 75-second animation in the style of Terry Gilliams animated sequences for Monty Python, representing part of Walter's drug- induced memory. The animation was produced by 6 Point Harness over a two-week period, working in the various idiosyncrasies of Gilliam's animations into this sequence. Elements such as a giant foot crushing the characters are a direct homage to the same elements used in Gilliam's animation for the Monty Python title sequences. Reception Ratings \\"Black Blotter\\" first aired in the United States on December 14, 2012 on Fox. An estimated 3.13 million viewers watched the episode, and earned a ratings share of 1.1 among adults aged 18 to 49, to become the highest rated episode of the season to date. 1.43 million viewers watched the episode through DVR and garnered a 0.6 rating, totaling 4.55 million viewers and a 1.7 rating. Reviews \\"Black Blotter\\" has been compared to the \\"19th episode\\" of earlier seasons - \\"Brown Betty\\" from Season 2, \\"Lysergic Acid Diethylamide\\" from Season 3, and \\"Letters of Transit\\" from Season 4 - where the producers have provided a strange, out- of-context episode that does not follow the usual narrative and direction of most other Fringe episodes The episode received positive reviews, with Noel Murray of The A.V. Club awarding the episode an \\"A-\\" grade, and IGN's Ramsey Isler rating the episode a 7.5 out of 10. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named \\"Black Blotter\\" the nineteenth best episode of the series, stating \\"Walter Bishop's most epic LSD trip ever ‚Äî an attempt to recover lost memories of his master plan to defeat the Observers ‚Äî allowed Fringe to creatively cut loose with some novel storytelling devices, none more inspired than a cartoon romp rendered in the style of Terry Gilliam's stop-motion Monty Python animation.\\" References External links * \\"Black Blotter\\" at Fox.com * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Fringe (season 5) episodes ","title":"Black Blotter"},{"id":"37933936","text":"Panchamukhi Anjaneya Temple, Ganadhal, Karnataka Ganadhal also spelled as Ganadhala is a village near Gillesugur village in the Raichur taluk of Raichur district in the Indian state of Karnataka. Ganadhal is famous for the Sri Panchamukhi Hanuman Temple where Sri Raghavendra Swamiji did penace for 12 years.http://aalayamkanden.blogspot.in/2010/10/sri-panchamukhi-cave-temple- ganadhal.html Ganadhal can be reached from Raichur and Mantralayam.\\\\ Legend The legend of this temple dates back to Ramayana. According to it, when Ravana lost all his sons & commanders, he summoned his step-brother Ahiravan/Mahiravana, who was an adept in Maya (illusion). Hearing this, Vibheeshana (Ravana's righteous brother, who sided with Rama), warned Rama & the other Vanaras. As per Rama's instruction, Hanuman built a fortress from his tail, where Rama, Lakshmana & the Vanaras were protected. The discus Sudarshana stood at the top of the fortress. Mahiravana, who got to know this, assumed the form of Vibheeshana & approached Hanuman at night, saying that he had got a few magical threads, which could protect Rama from demons. The unsuspecting Hanuman let him in. He rendered Rama & Lakshmana unconscious, turned them into dolls & escaped to Manivarthanapura, his capital city in Patala. When Hanuman saw the real Vibheeshana outside, he doubted him. But, he soon realised the truth & went in, only to find all the Vanaras unconscious & Rama-Lakshmana missing. Hanuman repented & decided to himself bring back them. Vibheeshana informed him that there were 2 gateways to Mahiravana's palace; one was in Ravana's palace, the other was through a cave in present-day Ganadhal. Hanuman went through the cave & soon reached Manivarthanapura. He saw that a dark lady with blood-red eyes stopped him. Hanuman informed her about his mission of saving Rama. She said \\"I am Yerukalamma, the guardian of this city. No one can enter here without my permission. But Mahiravana is doomed. His death is approaching him.\\" & let him in. As Hanuman entered, he encountered a Vanara, who fought with him. When Hanuman defeated him, a damsel named Deerghadehi came & said \\"Oh lord, spare him. He is your own son. While you were building a bridge to Lanka, I drank your sweat drops, & he was born. Please bless him. I have named him Mastyavallabha\\" Hanuman blessed him & proceeding further, was surprised to see another damsel crying & calling Rama's name. He silently approached her & learnt that she was Chandrasena, who had wished to marry Vishnu, but was abducted by Mahiravana. Hanuman also learnt that Mahiravana's soul was not in his body, & was somewhere hidden. He asked her to pretend as if she loved Mahiravana & learn from him about his soul. Hanuman also met Rama-Lakshmana, who were imprisoned in the temple of Yerukalamma. He bowed to them & said that he would soon free them & take them back. Then, he caused havoc in Manivarthanapura by killing demons. Mahiravana, who tried to kill him, was rendered unconscious. Later, when he approached Chandrasena, she pretended to love him, & asked him to marry her as soon as possible. She said \\"What will happen if you suddenly die?\\". Mahiravana said \\"Don't worry. My soul is in the form of 5 bees, that wander outside the earth. Their humming is fatal, & they live under a rock near the entrance to my city. Only if they are killed together, I can die.\\" After he left, Chandrasena reported everything to Hanuman, who thanked her & approached the place where the bees lived. He thought \\"If I had 5 faces, I could have swallowed all 5 bees at a time. Oh Sri Rama, help me\\" & he started praying. Instantly, a new strength enveloped him, & he assumed the form of having 5 face (one his own, the others Varaha, Garuda, Narasimha & Hayagriva) & swallowed all 5 bees at once. At the same time, Mahiravana, who was preparing to sacrifice Rama- Lakshmana, fell down & died. Rama, who was set free, blessed Chandrasena & returned to the Vanara camp, along with Hanuman & Lakshmana Thousands of years later, in the 16th century, Sri Raghavendra had a vision of Panchamukhi Hanuman, Lakshmi Venkatesha & Kurma. Later, a person named Bheemayya built the temple. Now, his 4 children, headed by Shamachar, have become the chief priest of the temple Demographics India census, Ganadhal had a population of 4,266 with 2,149 males and 2,117 females and 758 Households.http://www.censusindia.gov.in/PopulationFinder/View_Village_Population.aspx?pcaid=809407&category;=VILLAGE See also * Naradagadde * Bichali * Mantralayam * Raichur References External links * http://Raichur.nic.in/ Category:Villages in Raichur district ","title":"Ganadhal"},{"id":"37933948","text":"Mabel Cook Cole (April 18, 1880 ‚Äì November 13, 1977) was a dancer and singer.

He was one of the founding faculty members at Ball State University, where he chaired the English department for many years. Early life and education Clippinger was born on September 27, 1875 in Eau Claire, Michigan to mother Mary Edna and father Henry G. Clippinger, who worked as a medical doctor. He graduated from Michigan State Normal College (now Eastern Michigan University) in 1900, and went on to the University of Michigan, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1903 and a master's degree in 1904. He also briefly attended graduate school at Harvard University. Career and later life He became an assistant professor at the Indiana State Normal School (now Indiana State University) in 1904. He moved to Ball State College in 1918, newly reopened after a previous school on the same site closed and the site was donated to the state of Indiana. He was the first teacher hired at the new school, and became head of its English department. He wrote the first catalog of the school's curriculum and, ignoring the Indiana government's requirement that the newly founded school focus only on preparing students to become primary-school teachers, developed a curriculum that covered both primary and secondary-level education. At Ball State, Clippinger was \\"an effective, challenging instructor\\" but had difficult relations with some other faculty members. He stepped down as department chair in 1932. He retired in 1937 and was awarded emeritus professor the same year. Clippinger died on January 7, 1939, in Muncie, Indiana. Books Clippinger's published works include Children's Literature: A Textbook of Sources for Teachers and Teacher-Training Classes (with Charles Madison Curry, Rand McNally 1921), Illustrated Lessons in Composition and Rhetoric (Silver, Burdett, and Co. 1912),Reviews of Illustrated Lessons in Composition and Rhetoric: ; ; and the two volume text Written and Spoken English: A Course in Composition and Rhetoric (Silver, Burdett, and Co. 1917).Review of Written and Spoken English: Written and Spoken English was widely used as a high school textbook, and Children's Literature enjoyed a second edition in 1932.
