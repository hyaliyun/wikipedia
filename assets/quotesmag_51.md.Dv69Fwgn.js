Ryder, S.J. (October 8, 1800 ‚Äì January 12, 1860) was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit who became the president of several Jesuit universities in the United States. Born in Ireland, he immigrated with his widowed mother to the United States as a child, to settle in Georgetown, in the District of Columbia. He enrolled at Georgetown College and then entered the Society of Jesus. Studying in Maryland and Rome, Ryder proved to be a talented student of theology and was made a professor. He returned to Georgetown College in 1829, where he was appointed to senior positions and founded the Philodemic Society, becoming its first president. In 1840, Ryder became the president of Georgetown College, and oversaw the construction of the university's Astronomical Observatory, as well as Georgetown's legal incorporation by the United States Congress. He earned a reputation as a skilled orator and preacher. His term ended in 1843 with his appointment as provincial superior of the Jesuit Maryland Province. As provincial, he laid the groundwork for the transfer of ownership of the newly established College of the Holy Cross from the Diocese of Boston to the Society of Jesus. Two years later, Ryder became the second president of the College of the Holy Cross, and oversaw the construction of a new wing. He returned to Georgetown in 1848 for a second term as president, and accepted a group of local physicians to form the Georgetown School of Medicine, constructed a new home for Holy Trinity Church, and quelled a student rebellion. In his later years, Ryder went to Philadelphia, where he assisted with the founding of Saint Joseph's College and became its second president in 1856. He became the pastor of St. John the Evangelist Church in Philadelphia, and then transferred to St. John the Evangelist Church in Frederick, Maryland, as pastor. Finally, he returned to Philadelphia, where he died in 1860.  Early life  James Ryder was born on October 8, 1800, in Dublin, in the Kingdom of Ireland. He emigrated to the United States as a young boy with his mother, who was widowed by James' father, a Protestant who died when he was a child. She took up residence in Georgetown, then a city in the newly formed District of Columbia. Ryder enrolled at Georgetown College on August 29, 1813, and entered the Society of Jesus in 1815 as a novice, at the age of fifteen. He began his novitiate in White Marsh, Maryland, before being sent to Rome in the summer of 1820 by Peter Kenney, the apostolic visitor to the Jesuit's Maryland mission. He was sent alongside five other American Jesuits, who would go on to become influential in the administration of the Society in the United States for several decades. Among these, Ryder and Charles Constantine Pise were identified as the most intellectually advanced. They left from Alexandria, Virginia, on June 6, 1820, and landed in Gibraltar to be quarantined, before traveling to Naples on July 13 and then on to Rome in late August, where Ryder studied theology and philosophy. There, he was ordained a priest in 1824, and proceeded to teach theology at the Roman College. He then went to teach theology and sacred scripture at the University of Spoleto, where he remained for two years. He became a good friend of Archbishop Giovanni Mastai-Ferretti (later Pope Pius IX), who appointed him the chair of philosophy. Ryder also spent part of 1828 teaching in Orvieto. Ryder wearing a priest's alt=Portrait of James Ryder wearing a biretta Ryder returned to the United States in 1829, where he took up a professorship in philosophy and theology at Georgetown, to teach Jesuit scholastics. He was named the prefect of studies, where he implemented an overhaul of the curriculum under the direction of President Thomas F. Mulledy; he was simultaneously made vice president of the school. It was during this time that Ryder founded the Philodemic Society, of which he became the first president. Founded on January 17, 1830, it was the first collegiate debating society in the United States, and it was Ryder who selected the name. He was also appointed by Peter Kenney as minister and admonitor to Mulledy. In this role, he received a severe lecture from Kenney in 1832 for not properly welcoming six Belgian Jesuits who arrived at the college. In 1834, Ryder became a professor of rhetoric at the university. In an 1835 speech to Catholics in Richmond, Virginia, he called upon Catholics to defend national unity, which included opposing the efforts of Northern abolitionists to abolish slavery in the South; he warned Catholics that they would themselves become victims of persecution if their \\"glorious system of national independence\\" were to be overthrown.  Georgetown College = First presidency  The appointment of Ryder as president of Georgetown College was announced on May 1, 1840. His selection came despite concerns that he was more interested in giving talks and leading retreats than ensuring the institution was financially stable. Although he had the support of the Jesuit leadership, the Superior General of the Jesuits, Jan Roothaan, was worried that Ryder's American attitude in support of republicanism would take priority over his obedience to the Jesuits. Succeeding Joseph A. Lopez, he entered office while the Provincial Council of Baltimore was in progress, and the council fathers who were gathered in Baltimore took the opportunity to visit Georgetown. As president, Ryder's connections with Washington's politicians were strong. He had a particularly good relationship with the President of the United States, John Tyler, who enrolled his son at Georgetown, and whose sister converted to Catholicism. Their relationship went so far that Ryder played a significant role in the unsuccessful attempt to have Tyler run as a Democrat in the 1844 presidential election.Georgetown College Astronomical Observatory was constructed during Ryder's presidency.alt=Georgetown University Observatory between 1843 and 1907 Upon assuming the presidency, Ryder inherited a significant debt of $20,000 (), which he liquidated by 1842, at least part of it being paid by Ryder himself from monies he earned lecturing. Ryder had gained a reputation for talent in preaching, which he did without notes. This was particularly admired by Archbishop Samuel Eccleston, and Roothaan cited it as a source of many conversions to Catholicism. Word of his preaching reached President James Buchanan, who would attend his sermons and who received private instruction in Catholicism from him. Eventually, Ryder was described as the most well-known Catholic preacher in antebellum America. Twice during his presidency stones were thrown at him in the streets of Washington, one of these incidents occurring on April 26, 1844, as he was returning from the Capitol Building, where he had presided over the funeral of Representative Pierre Bossier. Such anti-Catholic aggression was the outgrowth of the Know Nothing movement in the United States. Ryder oversaw the establishment of the Georgetown College Observatory in 1842, a project spearheaded by James Curley. The opening of the observatory attracted several renowned Jesuit scientists from Europe who were fleeing the Revolutions of 1848. Moreover, the College of the Holy Cross was established in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1843, and Ryder sent Jesuits from Georgetown to teach there, while graduates of the new college received a degree from Georgetown until it was independently chartered by the Massachusetts General Court. Through having been recognized by the United States Congress in 1815, the university, as the President and Directors of Georgetown College, was officially incorporated by an act of Congress in 1844, and Ryder was named as one of the five members of the corporation. His term came to an end on January 10, 1845, when he was succeeded by Samuel A. Mulledy.  Second presidency  Ryder oversaw construction of the new Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown. In 1848, Ryder was appointed president of Georgetown for a second time, replacing Thomas Mulledy. His first act was to build a new edifice for Holy Trinity Catholic Church in the Georgetown neighborhood, which was then located on college property. He also implemented his fervent support for temperance by prohibiting students from consuming alcohol on or off campus, and eventually applied this ban to the Jesuits as well. This unpopular policy was accompanied by a ban on smoking. In the fall of 1849, Ryder was approached by four physicians who had been excluded from the Washington Infirmary and established a new medical faculty. They asked that their faculty be incorporated into Georgetown as its medical department, creating the first Catholic medical school in the United States. Ryder accepted the proposition within a week, giving rise to the Georgetown College School of Medicine. He appointed the four petitioners as the first professors of the school on November 5, 1849, and the first classes were held in May 1851. A rebellion broke out among the students in 1850. It began when members of the Philodemic Society held a meeting one day, in defiance of the prefect's order to the contrary. Ryder, who frequently left the college to preach, had been away for several weeks on a preaching tour. In response, the prefect suspended the society's meetings for one month. Upset at this decision, several members refused to perform their nightly reading at the refectory, and later threw stones in the dormitory. When Ryder returned, he expelled three students. One of these entered the refectory that night and incited the students to insurrection, who stormed a Jesuit's room. 44 of the students abandoned the college for downtown Washington and wrote Ryder that they would not return until the three were re-admitted and the prefect replaced. With the students' hotel bills mounting and going unpaid, Ryder convinced them to return to the college and quit the rebellion. He later replaced the prefect with Bernard A. Maguire. Later that year, Ryder presided over the marriage of William Tecumseh Sherman and Eleanor Boyle Ewing. His presidency came to an end in 1851, and Ryder was replaced by Charles H. Stonestreet.  Maryland provincial  In September 1843, while president of Georgetown, Ryder was appointed the provincial superior of the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus, with the strong support of his predecessor, Francis Dzierozynski. Ryder voiced support that the Jesuits should sell their parochial property, leaving this to diocesan priests, to instead focus on education in cities. At the same time, the Bishop of Boston, Benedict Joseph Fenwick, had become concerned with the cost of operating the newly established College of the Holy Cross. Therefore, he encouraged Ryder to accept ownership of the school on behalf of the Society of Jesus. The Superior General, Roothaan, delegated this decision to Ryder, who was initially hesitant to accept the college. By 1844, Ryder had privately decided to agree to the transfer, but this was not communicated to Fenwick and the deal formally struck until 1845 by Ryder's successor. Ryder delegated much of his responsibility, though he remained in charge. He held the post until 1845; Jan Roothaan believed the province had to be put under the control of a European to rectify the compounding scandal and mismanagement that had begun under Thomas Mulledy. To that end, he was replaced by Peter Verhaegen of Belgium.  College of the Holy Cross  alt=Oval portrait of James Ryder After his first presidency at Georgetown ended in 1845, Ryder went to Rome to clear his name in light of suspicions of his relationship with a woman who had exchanged letters with him. He traveled to Rome in January by way of New York City and France. In Italy, he recruited eight Jesuits to join him in the United States. One of these was a future president of the College of the Holy Cross, Anthony F. Ciampi. Upon Ryder's return, suspicions continued, despite his defense that the correspondence involved only spiritual counseling, but they finally ceased following Roothaan's order in 1847 that the correspondence end. Upon returning to the United States, he was appointed by Bishop Fenwick as president of the College of the Holy Cross on October 9, 1845, succeeding the school's first president, Thomas F. Mulledy. As president, he oversaw the construction of an east wing at the college, in accordance with the original plan for the school, which contained a dining room, chapel, study hall, and dormitory. This wing was the only part of the school spared by a subsequent fire in 1852. In 1846, he saw to the burial of the founder of the institution, Fenwick, in the college cemetery, pursuant to his wishes. The number of students increased during his administration. Ryder clashed with Thomas Mulledy during Mulledy's election as procurator of the Jesuits' Maryland province. As a result, he praised Ignatius Brocard's decision not to send Mulledy back to the College of the Holy Cross, where Mulledy was greatly disliked. The lack of discipline among the Jesuits at Holy Cross drew the commentary of both the Bishop of Boston, John Bernard Fitzpatrick, and Roothaan, who were particularly concerned with the propensity for drinking among the priests. Upon the end of his standard three-year term, Ryder was succeeded by John Early on August 29, 1848, and he returned to Georgetown.  Later years = Saint Joseph's College  In 1851, he moved to Philadelphia, where he assisted in the founding of Saint Joseph's College. He was made the pastor of St. John the Evangelist Church on September 30, 1855, when he replaced Richard Kinahan to become the first Jesuit in this position, and remained until he was succeeded by John McGuigan on October 4, 1858. In the meantime, he was appointed the president of Saint Joseph's College in 1856, following its first president Felix-Joseph Barbelin. Ryder sought to relocate the college from Willings Alley to the existing school building at St. John's, which would involve the transfer in ownership of the pro-cathedral from the Diocese of Philadelphia to the Jesuits; the diocese was unwilling to entertain this offer. In light of the ongoing Know Nothing movement, Ryder was referred to for some time as \\"Doctor Ryder\\" rather than \\"Father Ryder\\". He also wore layman's clothes, such as a bow tie rather than a Roman collar, in accordance with the orders of Charles Stonestreet, the Maryland provincial, that the Jesuits should not wear their clerical attire. Ryder's tenure lasted only until 1857 before he was succeeded by James A. Ward. He was forced to resign the presidency due to his deteriorating health, though his likeness endures in the form of a gargoyle of Barbelin Hall.  Pastoral work  Because of his oratorical skills, Ryder was sent to raise money for St. Joseph's College in California in 1852, where he raised $5,000 (). While there, he fell ill, and briefly went to Havana, Cuba, and then to the Southern United States, where he recuperated for several months. He was then stationed at St. Joseph's until 1856, when he was made the rector of St. John the Evangelist Church in Frederick, Maryland. In 1857, he was transferred to Alexandria, Virginia to do pastoral work, and he returned to Philadelphia in 1859 as spiritual prefect at St. Joseph's College. Ryder died on January 12, 1860, in the rectory of Old St. Joseph's Church in Philadelphia, following a brief illness. His body was transported back to Georgetown to be buried in the Jesuit Community Cemetery.

Although the Government Bloc led by incumbent Prime Minister Naji Shawkat won the most seats, it quickly disintegrated after the elections, allowing Rashid Ali al-Gaylani to become Prime Minister. Background Prime Minister Nuri al-Said submitted his resignation to King Faisal on 27 October 1932. The resignation was accepted on the following day. Faisal selected Naji Shawkat to form a new government on 3 November 1932. Although the resignation of al-Said was supposedly at his own behest, it was Faisal who had requested his resignation. He wished to reduce the influence of al-Said, who had established good relationships with the British government after signing the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, as well as gaining support from the moderate opposition which opposed the treaty. The government of Shawkat was seen as a compromise government that would achieve a balance between pro- British policies and opposition demands, and clear the political congestion caused by the signing the 1930 treaty. The new government sought to dissolve parliament (in which al-Said retained a majority) to calm the general public and limit al-Said's influence. Al-Said tried to dissuade Naji Shawkat from dissolving parliament by promising his party's support for the Shawkat government. However, Faisal and the new Prime Minister were determined to press ahead and a royal decree was issued for that purpose on 8 November 1932. Al-Said tried to block the decision by instructing his party's deputies not to attend the parliamentary session in which the royal decree was to be announced, but that was not able to prevent the government and Faisal from proceeding in dissolving parliament on 8 October. Al-Said subsequently held a meeting with his party's leadership on 10 October. The leadership issued a statement denouncing the dissolution and decided to send a memorandum to Faisal, claiming that the dissolution was illegitimate. Faisal tried to keep al-Said away from Iraq by appointing him as the country's representative to the League of Nations on 16 November 1932.  Election process  Shawkat's government had four months from the date of parliament's dissolution to hold new elections in accordance with article 40 of the constitution. Therefore the government selected 10 December 1932 as the date for electing the secondary voters that would elect the new parliament deputies early in 1933. Results Shawkat's government did not have a formal party, but endorsed a list of independent candidates that came to be known as the \\"government bloc\\". This bloc won 72 of the 88 seats, however this majority did not hold as the bloc began to disintegrate after the parliament convened on 8 March 1933. The National Brotherhood Party led by Yasin al-Hashimi and Rashid Ali al-Gaylani and members of the Iraqi National Party, led by Jafar Abu al-Temman participated in the elections as an opposition alliance, winning a minority of seats. Al-Said's Covenant party faded away.  Government formation  After the elections, Shawkat tried to expand his government by including elements from the moderate opposition such as al-Hashimi and Hikmat Sulayman. However, he failed to do so as the opposition started to grow, and his parliamentary bloc started to disintegrate. He submitted his resignation to Faisal on 18 March 1933, which was accepted. Faisal subsequently chose al-Gaylani on 20 March to form a new government. Aftermath Shawkat's government decision to endorse a group of independent \\"Government Bloc\\" candidates rather than having a formal party began a new tradition in Iraqi politics. The government would rely on their support to stay in power and pass laws. However, there were no guarantees that these candidates would stay loyal to the government after elections. Subsequently it was common for the deputies to change their political affiliation from one party to another, or move from pro-government to opposition and vice versa.

The species has the general characteristics of other species of Pseudorhabdosynochus, with a flat body and a posterior haptor, which is the organ by which the monogenean attaches itself to the gill of is host. The haptor bears two squamodiscs, one ventral and one dorsal. The sclerotized male copulatory organ, or \\"quadriloculate organ\\", has the shape of a bean with four internal chambers, as in other species of Pseudorhabdosynochus.Kritsky, D.

Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington, 99, 17-20. PDF The vagina includes a sclerotized part, which is a complex structure. This species is a member of the Pseudorhabdosynochus cupatus group, which includes several species having a similar structure of the sclerotised vagina; these are Pseudorhabdosynochus cupatus, Pseudorhabdosynochus cyathus, Pseudorhabdosynochus calathus and Pseudorhabdosynochus youngi. Etymology The name of the species is after Australian ichthyologist and parasitologist P. C. Young, \\"in recognition to his work on monogeneans, and especially this species\\".

It is located at a distance of circa 120 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 3367 is about 85,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on March 19, 1784.  Characteristics  NGC 3367 is a barred spiral galaxy with an asymmetric shape seen nearly face-on, with an inclination of 25 degrees. The inner arms begin at the ends of the bar, forming a ring with a major axis of 0.9 arcseconds,Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies, 1973, Acta Universitatis Upsalienis, Nova Regiae Societatis Upsaliensis, Series V: A Vol. 1 and after half of a revolution start to branch, creating a multiple-arm structure. They are studded with many bright HII regions.Sandage, A., Bedke, J. (1994), The Carnegie Atlas of Galaxies. Volume I, Carnegie Institution of Washington, p. 15 The star formation rate in NGC 3367 is nearly 3 per year. The outer arms form a semi-circular arch towards the south, at a distance of 50 arcseconds from the centre, more visible in the ultraviolet. Usually, asymmetry in a galaxy is caused by interaction with other galaxies, but no large satellite has been detected near NGC 3367. The cause of the asymmetry is assumed to be a minor merger or mass accretion that took place in the last billion years. Because no low surface brightness structures, like plumes and star streams, have been detected near NGC 3367, and nor is gas seen in HI imaging near the galaxy, it is believed that the galaxy accreted of cold gas in the past million years. This gas accretion resulted in increased star formation and nuclear activity. NGC 3367 features a strong bar. The bar pattern speed was estimated to be 43 ¬± 6 km s‚àí1 kpc‚àí1 using the Tremaine-Weinberg method. The bar of the galaxy is more prominent in the near infrared, suggesting the dominance of an old population of stars in that region. There is also a knot at the eastern end of the bar, where there is a non-negligible population of red giants and asymptotic giant branch stars.  Nucleus  NGC 3367 has been categorised as a HII region or a type 2 Seyfert galaxy. However, optically there is no hint of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). The spectrum of NGC 3367 features unusually broad lines (FWHM of 490 m/s for HŒ≤) and a blue asymmetry. The spectrum looks like one produced from Wolf-Rayet stars. There is no clear evidence of H-alpha emission. The spectrum is also dominated by starburst features like low [Fe II] 1.2567 Œºm/PaŒ≤ line ratio. The galaxy was observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope and [Ne v] 14.3 and 24.3 Œºm lines, consistent with the existence of a weak AGN were detected. Observed by the XMM-Newton telescope, the galaxy's X-ray luminosity in 2-10 keV was 2.0 √ó 1040 erg s‚àí1 dominated by a power law. This value is consistent with low-luminosity AGNs. When observed in radio waves, the galaxy features two radio lobes extending from a nuclear source, a feature common to Seyfert 2 galaxies. The emission of the southwest lobe is polarised, indicating it is above the plain of the disk, while the northeast is depolarised. The southwest lobe extends 26\\" from the nucleus and the northeast 33\\". The total extent of the source is approximately 12 kpc at the distance of the galaxy. More detailed observations by the Very Large Array revealed a radio jet connecting the nucleus with the southwest lobe and a circumnuclear structure with a radius of nearly 300 pc. In the centre of the galaxy lies a supermassive black hole whose mass is estimated to be (107.2) based on Ks bulge luminosity. The X-ray spectra of the galaxy suggested the mass of the supermassive black hole to be in the range of 105 to 107 . Around the nucleus, at a radius of circa 2 arcseconds, has been detected using CO(1-0) emission a significant amount of molecular gas. The total mass of molecular gas in that region is estimated to be and in the central 5 arcseconds the mass of molecular gas is . The presence of a such large mass could obscure the optical emission lines from an active galactic nucleus. The CO emission has an elongated shape, maybe due to the forces created by the stellar bar.  Supernovae  Five supernovae have been observed in NGC 3367 in the last 30 years; SN 1986A (type Ia, mag 14.0), SN 1992C (type II, mag 16.5), SN 2003aa (type Ic, mag 17.6), SN 2007am (type II, mag 17.8), and SN 2018kp (type Ia).List of Supernovae IAU Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. Retrieved 29 December 2015. SN 1992c was discovered by ESO astronomer Hans van Winckel on January 28, 1992. He found it on a photographic plate obtained by Guido Pizarro during a search programme carried out with the ESO 1-metre Schmidt telescope at La Silla. Spectra of the supernova, obtained by Della Valle and Christoffel Waelkens (Astronomical Institute of Leuven, Belgium), with the 2.2-metre telescope at La Silla, showed it to be of type II and that the explosion must have happened between 10 and 20 days earlier. The expansion velocity was measured at about 7000 km/sec. SN 1992c was located southeast of the centre of the galaxy, at the tip of a spiral arm. SN 1986A was found on February 4, 1986 near the condensations in the spiral arms east of the centre of the galaxy.  Nearby galaxies  NGC 3367 is the foremost member in a galaxy group known as the NGC 3367 group. Other members of the group include NGC 3391, and NGC 3419. A bit further away lie the galaxies NGC 3300, and NGC 3306. NGC 3367 lies in the same region of the sky as the Leo Group, whose redshift is about a third of NGC 3367. NGC 3377, a member of the Leo Group, lies 22 arcminutes to the north of NGC 3367.

Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church  Epiphanius, then President Petro Poroshenko and Andriy Parubiy on 15 December 2018 On 15 December 2018, at the unification council held in the Cathedral of St. Sophia, he was elected Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine, the first primate of the autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine. The official name of the primate the Orthodox Church of Ukraine is \\"His Beatitude (name), Metropolitan of Kyiv and all Ukraine\\".  Commemoration of the Patriarch of Moscow  On Sunday 16 December 2018, during Metropolitan Epiphanius' first Divine Liturgy as Metropolitan of the OCU following his election, he called for prayers for peace and unity in Ukraine. In the same liturgy, Metropolitan Epiphany also omitted Patriarch Kirill of Moscow from the list of brother primates with whom he is in communion who are usually commemorated at the Great Entrance. Metropolitan Epiphanius later explained in an interview with Ukrainian \\"Direct\\" TV channel: \\"At the moment I do not commemorate him [the Patriarch of Moscow] because we are in a state of war, so the Ukrainian people would not accept if the newly-elected primate commemorated the name of the Russian Patriarch.\\" During the Divine Liturgy on 7 January 2019, after the OCU received its official autocephaly on 5 January 2019, Metropolitan Epiphanius commemorated the name of Patriarch Kirill during the Great entrance. Epiphanius later told he had done this after the Ecumenical Patriarch had instructed him to do so, and that Filaret had instructed him (Epiphanius) not to mention Kirill.  Reception of the tomos of autocephaly  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew (left) handing the tomos of autocephaly to Metropolitan Epiphanius (right) On 5 January 2019, Patriarch Bartholomew and Metropolitan Epiphanius held a liturgy in St. George's Cathedral in Istanbul; the tomos of autocephaly of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine was signed thereafter, still in St. George's Cathedral. The tomos \\"has come into force from the moment of its signing\\". The signing of the tomos officially established the autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine. After the tomos was signed, Metropolitan Epiphanius made a speech, in which he declared about Poroshenko: \\"Your name, Mr President, will forever go down in the history of the Ukrainian people next to the names of the rulers, of our prince Volodymyr the Great, Yaroslav the Wise, Kostyantyn Ostrozky and Hetman Ivan Mazepa\\". On January 6, after a liturgy celebrated by Metropolitan Epiphanius and Patriarch Bartholomew, Partriarch Bartholomew read the tomos of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) and then gave it to Metropolitan Epiphanius. On 8 January 2019, the tomos was brought back to Istanbul so that all the members of the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate could sign the tomos. The tomos was signed by all members of the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate on 9 January 2018. The tomos, signed by all members of the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, was brought back to Ukraine on the morning of 10 January 2019.  Enthronement  It was planned that Epiphany would be enthroned on 3 February 2019, which is also the date of his 40th birthday. Thereafter, the first synod of the OCU was to take place. The monasteries of Mount Athos refused to send a delegation for the enthronement ceremony \\"not because the Fathers do not recognize its legitimacy or canonicity, but because they have chosen to stick with what has become official practice and accept invitations only to the enthronement of their ecclesiastical head, the Ecumenical Patriarch.\\" Two abbots of Mount Athos were planned to come at the enthronement but were to be part of the delegation of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. On 1 February, once in Kyiv, Archimandrite Ephrem, one of the two Athonite abbots, was hospitalized for a heart attack. On 2 February, Archimandrite Ephrem was visited by Epiphanius. As planned, Epiphanius was enthroned on 3 February 2019, in St. Sophia's Cathedral, Kyiv. Filaret was not present due to health conditions, so he sent his written congratulations to the primate Epiphanius, Filaret's congratulations were written by him and read at the end of the liturgy. Archimandrite Ephrem, who had been hospitalized on 1 February 2019, was not present at the ceremony of enthronement, but a hieromonk of Ephrem's monastery was present during the ceremony of enthronement. A monk from a skete of the Koutloumousiou Monastery was also present during the ceremony of enthronement. The first meeting of the holy synod of the OCU took place on 5 February 2019.  Conflict with Filaret  A conflict erupted between Filaret and Epiphanius becauses of disagreements concerning the model of governance, the management of the diaspora, the name and the statute of the OCU. According to Filaret, the agreement reached at the unification council was as follow: \\"the primate is responsible for the external representation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), and the patriarch is responsible for the internal church life in Ukraine, but in cooperation with the primate. The primate shall do nothing in the church without the consent of the patriarch. The patriarch chairs the meetings of the Holy Synod and the UOC meetings for the sake of preserving unity, its growth, and affirmation.\\" Filaret considers this agreement has not been fulfilled.  Academic and social activities  Epiphanius with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2019 Epiphanius is the head of the editorial board of scientific specialized editions Proceedings of the Kyiv Theological Academy and Theological Bulletin of the Kyiv Orthodox Theological Academy. He is also an author of more than 50 publications, including several monographs about Orthodox theology. Epiphanius is an active religious leader and social activist. He participates in many scientific and educational activities, and has made a significant personal contribution to the development of Ukrainian religious education and science and the development and strengthening of the Ukrainian state. He received recognition for this contribution from both the state and the Church in the form of orders.  Awards = Orders  He has received the Order of the Holy Apostle and Evangelist John the Theologian, the Order of the Holy Equal-to-the-Apostles Prince Volodymyr the Great of the Third Degree, the Order of the Holy Archangel Michael and the Order of the Holy Cross of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church.

The process by which cells divide into two daughter cells is called mitosis. Once these cells are formed they enter G1, the phase in which many of the proteins needed to replicate DNA are made. After G1, the cells enter S phase during which the DNA is replicated. After S, the cell will enter G2 where the proteins required for mitosis to occur are synthesized. Unlike most cell types however, neurons are generally considered incapable of proliferating once they are differentiated, as they are in the adult nervous system. Nevertheless, it remains plausible that neurons may re-enter the cell cycle under certain circumstances. Sympathetic and cortical neurons, for example, try to reactivate the cell cycle when subjected to acute insults such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity. This process is referred to as ‚Äúabortive cell cycle re-entry‚Äù because the cells usually die in the G1/S checkpoint before DNA has been replicated. Cell cycle regulation Transitions through the cell cycle from one phase to the next are regulated by cyclins binding their respective cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks) which then activate the kinases (Fisher, 2012). During G1, cyclin D is synthesized and binds to Cdk4/6, which in turn phosphorylates retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and induces the release of the transcription factor E2F1 which is necessary for DNA replication (Liu et al., 1998). The G1/S transition is regulated by cyclin E binding to Cdk2 which phosphorylates Rb as well (Merrick and Fisher, 2011). S phase is then driven by the binding of cyclin A with Cdk2. In late S phase, cyclin A binds with Cdk1 to promote late replication origins and also initiates the condensation of the chromatin in the late G2 phase. The G2/M phase transition is regulated by the formation of the Cdk1/cyclin B complex. Inhibition through the cell cycle is maintained by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) of the Ink and Cip/Kip families which inhibit the cyclin/CDK complex. CDK4/6 is inhibited by p15Ink4b, p16Ink4a, p18Ink4c, and p19Ink4d. These inhibitors prevent the binding of CDK4/6 with cyclin D (C√°nepa et al., 2007). The Cip/Kip families (p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2) also bind to cyclin/CDK complexes and prohibit advancement through the cell cycle. The cell cycle uses these CDKs and CKIs to regulate the cell cycle through checkpoints. These checkpoints ensure that the cell has completed all of the tasks of the current phase before they can gain entry into the next phase of the cycle. The criteria for the checkpoints are met through a combination of activating and inhibiting cyclin/CDK complexes as the result of different signaling pathways (Besson et al., 2008; C√°nepa et al., 2007; Yasutis and Kozminski, 2013). If the criteria are not met, the cell will arrest in the phase prior to the checkpoint until the criteria is met. Progression through a checkpoint without having first met the appropriate criteria can lead to cell death (Fisher, 2012; Williams and Stoeber, 2012). Abortive cell cycle re-entry It is believed that neurons are permanently blocked from the cell cycle once they differentiate. As a result, neurons are typically found outside of the cell cycle in a G0 state. It has been found that various genes that encode the G1/S transition, such as D1, Cdk4, Rb proteins, E2Fs, and CKIs, can be detected in different areas of a normal human brain (Frade and Ovejero-Benito, 2015). The presence of these core cell cycle factors can be explained through their role in neuronal migration, maturation, and synaptic plasticity (Christopher L. Frank1 and Li-Huei Tsai1, 2009). However, it is also possible that, under certain conditions, these factors can induce cell cycle re-entry. Under conditions such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, and activity withdrawal these factors have been shown to be upregulated. However the cells usually die in the G1/S checkpoint before DNA has been replicated (Park et al., 1998). The process by which the cell re- enters the cell cycle and dies is called ‚Äúabortive cell cycle re-entry‚Äù and is characterized by the upregulation of cyclin D-cdk4/6 and downregulation of E2F, followed by cell death (Frade and Ovejero-Benito, 2015). In cerebellar granule cells and cortical neurons, E2F1 can trigger neuronal apoptosis through activation of Bax/caspase-3 and the induction of the Cdk1/FOXO1/Bad pathway (Giovanni et al., 2000). The downregulation of p130/E2F4 (a complex which has been shown to maintain the post mitotic nature of neurons) induces neuronal apoptosis by upregulating B-myb and C-myb (Liu et al., 2005). Cell cycle re-entry Tetraploid neurons (neurons with 4C DNA content) are not restricted to retinal neurons, 10% of human cortical neurons have DNA higher than 2C (Frade and Ovejero-Benito, 2015). Typically differentiated neurons that replicate their DNA die. However, this is not always the case as exhibited by sensory and sympathetic neurons, which are able to replicate their DNA without neuronal death (Smith et al., 2000). Neurons that are Rb deficient have also been found to re-enter the cell cycle and survive in a 4C DNA state (Lipinski et al., 2001). Duplication of DNA can lead to neuronal diversification in vertebrates, as seen in observations in the developing chick retina. These neurons re-enter the cell cycle as they travel to the ganglion cell layer when they are activated by p75NTR. These neurons are unable to enter mitosis and are stuck in a 4C DNA content state. Cell cycle re-entry by p75NTR is not dependent on Cdk4/6 (Morillo et al., 2012) and, therefore, differs from other cell types that re-enter the cell cycle. In retinal ganglion cells, p75NTR is mediated by p38MAPK and then phosphorylates E2F4, before progressing the cell through the cell cycle. Tetraploid neurons in mice are made in a p75NTR dependent manner in cells that contain Rb during their migration to their differentiated neuronal layers (Morillo et al., 2012). It is still unknown why these neurons are able to pass through the G1/S checkpoint and not induce apoptosis through E2F1. Neurodegenerative diseases Cell cycle re-entry usually causes apoptosis. However, in some neurodegenerative diseases, re-entry into the cell cycle occurs. The neurons that are able to re-enter the cell cycle are much more likely to undergo apoptosis and lead to the disease phenotypes. In Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, affected neurons show signs of DNA replication such as phosphorylated Mcm2 and cell cycle regulators cyclin D, Cdk4, phosphorylated Rb, E2F1, and cyclin E. Not much is currently known about the direct mechanism by which the cell cycle is reactivated, however it is possible that MiR26b may regulate the activation of cell cycle progression by upregulating cyclin E1 and downregulating p27Kip1 (Busser et al., 1998; Yang et al., 2003). Alzheimer diseased neurons rarely exhibit the ability to enter mitosis and, if they don‚Äôt undergo rapid mitosis, can survive for long periods of time in a tetraploid state. These neurons are able to enter the S phase and replicate their DNA, however they become blocked in the G2 state. In affected and unaffected tetraploid neurons, during development and during the progression of the disease, passing the G2/M checkpoint leads to cell death. This hints that the G2/M checkpoint aids in the survival of tetraploid neurons. This is supported by experiments in which the G2/M checkpoint is removed through addition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) blockers in tetraploid cells that resulted in cell death. BDNF prevents the G2/M transition through its receptor TrkB and their capacity to decrease cyclin B and Cdk1. The mechanism by which neurons undergo apoptosis after the G2/M transition is not yet fully understood, it is known that Cdk1 can activate the pro-apoptotic factor Bad by phosphorylating its Ser128 (Frade, 2000). Interkinetic nuclear migration Interkinetic nuclear migration is a feature of developing neuroepithelia and is characterized by the periodic movement of the cell‚Äôs nucleus with the progression of the cell cycle. Developing neuroepithelia are tissues composed of neural progenitor cells, each spanning the entire thickness of the epithelium from the ventricular surface to the laminal side. Cell nuclei occupy different positions along the apical‚Äìbasal axis of the tissue. S phase occurs close to the basal side whereas mitosis exclusively occurs close to ventricular apical side. The nuclei then move to upper regions near the basal side where they proceed through S-phase. This nuclear movement is repeated at each cell cycle and is maintained by an apical-to-basal migration during G1- phase and a reverse basal-to-apical movement during G2- phase. It was proposed that the INM maximized the amount of mitotic events in the limited space and that, since neuronal progenitors have a basal body, they need to move their nucleus to the apical side in order to assemble the mitotic spindle used in mitosis. It has been reported that the INM is not required for the cell cycle since removing the INM doesn‚Äôt change the length of the cell cycle. Interestingly, blocking or delaying the cell cycle results in the arrest or reduction of the INM respectively. Nuclear migration is not necessary for cell cycle regulation, however cell cycle regulators have tight control over the INM (Del Bene, 2011).  Bibliography  * Del Bene, F. (2011).

It had large eyes and was probably a fast-swimming predator, hunting planktonic crustaceans and smaller fish. A very early teleost, Dorsetichthys had many primitive characteristics such as ganoid scales and a spine that was partially composed of cartilage, rather than bone. Taxonomy The type species of Dorsetichthys, D. bechei, was formerly assigned to Pholidophorus, but Arratia (2013) recognized as generically distinct from the Pholidophorus type species, placing it in the new family Dorsetichelyidae and new order Dorsetichthyiformes.

Incorporated in 2013, it is dedicated to producing new works, revisiting oft-neglected works from the theatrical canon, and approaching classic pieces from a new and different perspective.  History  In 1986, founders John Sowle and Steven Patterson created a production company called Kaliyuga Arts for the purpose of presenting off- beat, challenging work. Of the 28 plays Kaliyuga Arts presented, eight were world premieres, three were U.S. premieres, six were regional premieres, and many others had not been seen in their respective regions for decades. As they migrated from Los Angeles to San Francisco to New York City and eventually to the Hudson Valley, Sowle and Patterson continued to present sporadically and tour occasionally, always in rented or donated spaces. In November 2013, they purchased an old factory building on the outskirts of downtown Catskill, NY to serve as a permanent artistic home for their productions. In 2019, the theatre will present its sixth season of in-house productions, along with an eclectic mix of theatre, dance, music and special events brought in from outside production sources. Bridge Street Theatre has been instrumental in the region's cultural renaissance, thanks in part to ongoing support by New York State's Homes and Community Renewal Program.

It was originally responsible for combat training of aircrews arriving from the United States, a mission it continued until near the end of the war, when the air divisions began the training. Starting in late winter of 1944, the command took over special operations missions, including night leaflet dropping, infiltration of agents behind enemy lines and supplying resistance forces in occupied countries. As Allied forces advanced across Europe, most of its personnel were used to form provisional disarmament units. The command was disbanded in October 1948, when the United States Air Force decided it would have no future need for a level of command between major commands and air divisions.

Miura 5 will be 25 m long, capable of inserting 300 kg of payload into a 500 km sun-synchronous orbit (SSO), featuring an optional kick stage that can circularize the orbits of satellites. All stages are planned to be liquid-propelled and its technology is inherited from Miura 1. The first stage is planned to be reusable through the combined use of its engines and parachutes for retrieval.  Development  The Miura 5 will use a TEPREL-C turbopump engine, unlike previous versions which use a pressurized tank cycle. Its reuse capabilities are planned to allow it to be launched 3 times. A lift capacity of 150 kilograms was originally envisioned, but in 2018 lift capacity was doubled after a 10-month European Space Agency review that concluded launching up to 300 kilograms to a 500-kilometer orbit should be pursued. In October 2016, the ESA chose PLD Space as the main contractor of the LPSR (\\"Liquid Propulsion Stage Recovery\\") programa, part of the agency's Future Launchers Preparatory Programme (FLPP), for the development of a reusable first stage with a budget of 750,000 euros. The main objective is to provide the reusable first stage Miura 5 launcher with parachute for return although the possibility of using controlled paragliders or \\"ballutes\\" will also be explored. The system will be tested at first in Miura 1. On 11 April 2019, PLD Space performed a successful crash and recovery test of the first stage of a Miura 5 demostrator (1.5 m diameter instead of 1.8 m) in El Arenosillo. The stage was dropped from a height of 5 km, slowed down with three parachutes and touched the water, where it was recovered. Launch sites On July 2019, PLD Space reached an agreement with CNES to study the launch of Miura 5 from CSG, French Guiana. As part of an agreement, INTA is also helping them procure a launch site, being El Hierro Launch Centre the best option from a technical point of view. Recently PLD Space has shared the possibility of making launches from the planned spaceport in Azores but the status of this proposal is unknown.https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2020/all2020/63/ Launch schedule The first test flight of Miura 5 is planned to take place in 2024.

Ciampi, S.J. (January 29, 1816 ‚Äì November 24, 1893) was an Italian- American priest of the Catholic Church and member of the Society of Jesus.  Early life  alt=Portrait of Anthony Ciampi sitting in a chair Anthony Ciampi was born as Antonio F. Ciampi on January 29, 1816 in Rome. He hailed from a prominent family, which included Ciampi's uncle, Cardinal Giuseppe Sala. He was educated at the Pontifical Gregorian University, before entering the Jesuit novitiate at Sant'Andrea al Quirinale in Rome on September 7, 1832. Following his philosophical studies at the Gregoriana, he was assigned to a Jesuit school in Piacenza, where he taught grammar from 1839 to 1840, and then at a school in Ferrara, where he taught grammar and the humanities from 1840 to 1844. In 1845, he returned to Rome to study theology for one year. Ciampi was then invited by the president of the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, Fr. James A. Ryder, to join the American Jesuits; Ciampi accepted and immigrated to the United States. He continued his studies at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where he was ordained a priest on July 23, 1848.  College of the Holy Cross = First presidency  Ciampi was appointed the President of the College of the Holy Cross on August 28, 1851. Within a year of his appointment, on July 14, 1852, a devastating fire consumed the entire college building, except for its east wing and library, despite the efforts of the fire department and local citizens of Worcester to haul water a quarter of a mile up the hill from the river. The student dormitories with their possessions were lost, and the uninsured college faced a cost of $50,000. The fire was believed to have begun on the third floor by a professor who was burning old examination papers. Left without any place to stay, the neighbors offered lodging to the faculty and students. Within a few months, work began on rebuilding the school using the contributions of donors throughout the Diocese of Boston. A new and larger building was opened on October 3, 1853.

The surprise attack saw initial success by the Soviet troops in advancing through the Finnish supply lines but failed to continue the assault towards Tolvaj√§rvi village and the Finnish main-lines. The Soviet soldiers were exhausted and hungry after 5 days of forced marching and stopped to eat the sausage soup that the retreating Finns had left behind in their field kitchens.

DJ Ferret's releases to date have all been mixes of other artists' work. The most successful of these were the \\"Underground Club Mix\\" series associated with Asleep By Dawn magazine. The 3-volume series was initially available only through Hot Topic, although all 3 albums eventually received a brief limited retail release. The first volume included tracks by Paul Van Dyk, Ministry and Skinny Puppy.. The second volume was packaged with a DVD and included The 69 Eyes, Eisbrecher and Joachim Witt . On the strength of the included DVD, the title spent one week on the Billboard Comprehensive Music Video Chart at position #38 in the issue dated 25 November 2006. The third and final volume included Robert Smith of The Cure, Information Society, In This Moment, Type O Negative, and a reading of \\"The Raven\\" by actor Christopher Lee. Together, the three volumes sold in excess of 50,000 units. His first release as DJ Ferret was in 2003. \\"Noir: Smooth Female Trip-Hop\\" collected Trip-Hop tracks with female vocals from Japan, Russia, England and the US. In 2006 he released \\"Big Up Berlin: Best Of German Hip Hop And Reggae,\\" which he described as the first American compilation of German hip- hop. Some of Germany's best-selling hip-hop and reggae artists participated, including Seeed, Kool Savas, Azad, Bushido and Fler. Tracks by a few lesser- known artists were also included. AllMusic described it as \\"a smashing compilation that bundles together 17 German hip-hop and dancehall artists onto one fabulous CD\\" and \\"a bridge-building compilation that spans hip-hop and dancehall and Europe and the New World.\\" He later put out another German hip- hop mix called \\"Ende Gute, Alles Gute\\" as an unofficial online release in 2017. \\"Dancing In The Dark: 10 Years Of Dancing Ferret \\" and \\"Dancing In The Dark 2006\\" were compilations produced under his own name and included a VNV Nation remix of a Joachim Witt track, Faun, Corvus Corax and De/Vision. Actress Kristanna Loken of Terminator 3 fame was the cover model for the latter title, wearing her original outfit from the movie . Also credited as \\"Patrick Rodgers\\" was a soundtrack for the roleplaying game Vampire: The Masquerade. Produced under license from White Wolf Publishing and released in 1999, the CD was titled \\"Music From The Succubus Club\\" and included one track devoted to each of the vampire clans in the game. DJ Ferret is still actively performing live DJ gigs. As a concert promoter, he is best known for his \\"Dracula's Ball\\" event, which has taken place since 1996 and is one of the largest events for goths and vampires in the country. The 40th Dracula's Ball sold out without running a single print ad or media story.. The Dracula's Ball 20-Year Anniversary party also sold out and featured performances by Front 242 and Covenant Outside of the music industry, Rodgers is known for his consumer advocacy, particularly a lawsuit in which he became the first American to \\"foreclose\\" on a bank, leading CNN to refer to him as a \\"folk hero.\\" A video of one of his television interviews regarding the suit has over a million views.. He subsequently appeared on The Colbert Report. Rodgers also later sued eBay over a consumer matter.. Of his consumer advocacy, he said \\"It makes me sad to say this, but I wish more people would learn how to sue in small claims court. So many companies have made it clear that customer service is not a priority for them. Americans need to force them to rethink that position.\\" In April 2019, Amazon tapped DJ Ferret (as Patrick Rodgers) to host a talk show titled \\"Interviewed By A Vampire\\" for broadcast on Amazon Prime. The first season of three episodes featured guests Derrick Pitts, Kyle Cassidy and Rodney Anonymous.

Bongiorno achieved greater recognition with his third book, The Sex Lives of Australians: A History, described as \\"serious\\" but \\"lively and engaging\\" by the Daily Telegraph, \\"highly readable, serious history about our most intimate yet most culturally sensitive selves\\" by the Canberra Times, while Sydney Morning Herald wrote that it \\"affords Australian sexuality a much-needed centrality in terms of explaining and understanding the evolution of our society and of our culture\\" and The Advertiser wrote that \\"[Bongiorno] barges into the bedrooms of our forebears to show us a rarely seen side of their lives\\".

Background The Flea was bred by Lord George Bentinck at his Goodwood House stud in Westhampnett. Her sire, Coronation had won the 1841 Derby and Ascot Derby. Coronation stood only a few seasons in the United Kingdom before being exported to Russia. Her dam, Puce (1834 - 1849), was bred by the Duke of Cleveland and was sired by the 1829 St. Leger winner, Rowton. The Flea's half- sister Monstrosity produced the 1844 2000 Guineas winner The Ugly Buck. Puce's dam, Pucelle, was a daughter of the 1814 Oaks winner Medora and is a tail- female ancestor to St. Marguerite (Thoroughbred family 4-n). Puce's full sister Virginia produced the multiple stakes winner Virago and is an ancestor of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks winner Thebais. The majority of the Bentinck Stud, including Puce, was sold in August 1846 to Lord Mostyn. The Flea was acquired by Frank Clarke (c. 1800 - 1856), who wrote for the racing publication Bell's Life under the pseudonym Pegasus. The Flea was trained by John Day at Danebury. Racing career The Flea was not raced extensively and only completed as a three-year-old. Ridden by Alfred Day, the son of her trainer, The Flea won the 1000 Guineas by a head from the mares Clarissa and St. Rosalia in a field of 10 runners. The Oaks winner, Lady Evelyn, did run but was not placed in the race. The race was later called \\"unwisely run and unwisely ridden\\" by the racing press, but Alfred Day's performance was praised. The Flea's only win was in the 1000 Guineas. She was unplaced for the Ascot Gold Vase in June, the Chesterfield Stakes in July, and the Orange Stakes run at Goodwood in August. She was subsequently retired to become a broodmare at the close of the 1849 racing season. The Flea was bred by Lord George Bentinck. Breeding career First retired to Lord Exeter stud in 1850, The Flea was bought by representatives for Queen Victoria and moved to Hampton Court Stud by 1852. The Flea was not a successful broodmare, with her best runner being Cimicina. She produced four foals before her death: *Chestnut filly (foaled in 1851), sired by The Hero. This foal was sold to Count Waldstein in 1852. *Cimicina (1852 - 1858), sired by Phlegon. Winner of seven races as a two-year-old. Described as \\"small and undersized\\", she produced only one foal that died young. *Canary (foaled in 1854), sired by Alarm. Unsuccessful as racehorse. *Chestnut filly (foaled in 1855), sired by Orlando. This foal was exported to Turin in 1856. The Flea was bred to Pyrrhus The First in 1855 and was presented as a gift to the King of Sardinia in January 1856. She died in the spring of 1856 before foaling and before she could be exported to Sardinia.

A chaplet is a headdress in the form of a wreath made of leaves, flowers or twigs woven into a ring.Chaplet at OED; retrieved 28 June 2018 It is typically worn in festive occasions and on holy days. In ancient times it also served as a crown representing victory or authority. History In ancient times chaplets made from branches and twigs of trees were worn by victors in sacred contests; these were known as pancarpiae. Later, flowers were used to \\"heighten the effect\\" with their color and smell. Glyccra challenged Pausias to a contest where she would repeatedly vary her designs, and thus it was (as Pliny described it) \\"in reality a contest between art and Nature\\". This invention is traced only to later than the 100th Olympiad via Pausias paintings. These \\"chaplets of flowers\\" became fashionable and evolved into the Egyptian chaplets using ivy, narcissus, pomegranate blossoms. According to Pliny, P. Claudius Pulcher In Chapter 5 of Naturalis Historia, titled \\"The great honour in which chaplets were held by the ancients\\" Pliny explains the how these head dresses were perceived: Pliny continues the explanation to describe the severity in which the rules of the wearing of the chaplets were enforced by the \\"ancients\\": #L. Fulvius, a banker, having been accused, at the time of the Second Punic War, of looking down from the balcony of his house upon the Forum, with a chaplet of roses upon his head, was imprisoned by order of the Senate, and was not liberated before the war was brought to a close. #P. Munatius, having placed upon his head a chaplet of flowers taken from the statue of Marsyas, was condemned by the Triumviri to be put in chains. Upon his making appeal to the tribunes of the people, they refused to intercede in his behalf #The daughter of the late Emperor Augustus, who, in her nocturnal debaucheries, placed a chaplet on the statue of Marsyas, conduct deeply deplored in the letters of that god. Pliny notes that the statue of Marsyas was a meeting place for courtesans, who used to crown it with chaplets of flowers.Pliny 21.6, note 3 He also notes that when Emperor Augustus's daughter Julia placed a chaplet on the statue, she was acknowledging herself to be no better than a courtesan.Pliny 21.6, note 6 The highest and rarest of all military decorations in the Roman Republic and early Roman empire was the Grass Crown (Latin: corona graminea) . It was presented only to a general, commander, or officer whose actions saved a legion or the entire army. One example of actions leading to awarding of a grass crown would be a general who broke/such as breaking the blockade around a beleaguered Roman army. The crown took the form of a chaplet made from plant materials taken from the battlefield, including grasses, flowers, and various cereals such as wheat, which was presented to the general by the army he had saved. The corona radiata, the \\"radiant crown\\" known best on the Statue of Liberty, and perhaps worn by the Helios that was the Colossus of Rhodes, was worn by Roman emperors as part of the cult of Sol Invictus prior to the Roman Empire's conversion to Christianity. It was referred to as \\"the chaplet studded with sunbeams‚Äù by Lucian, about 180 AD.Lucian: Alexander the false prophet Examples Image:Sg2537.jpgAthens coin c. 393-355 BC Image:Bust_woman_mosaic_Met_38.11.12.jpgRoman Mosaic c. 2nd century AD Image:Alexandre Bluhm Flora.jpgGoddess Flora Image:Cheyenne Indian Man.jpgCheyenne man wearing a wreath of cottonwood leaves Image:1Lats ligo.pngLatvian coin See also * Corolla (headgear) * Crancelin * Vinok References Category:Ancient Roman culture Category:Ancient Greek culture Category:Headgear Category:History of clothing (Western fashion) Category:Floristry ","title":"Chaplet (headgear)"},{"id":"59403405","text":"Sascha Korb (born 18 June 1993) is a German footballer who plays as a midfielder for SC Verl.

He also had a couple of nicknames: > When it comes to nicknames, sailing and the yacht business may be even cuter > and more prolific than, say, golf and the golf business. Cuthbertson is not > only Big George, he's also Cumbersome. Cassian is not only Little George, > he's also Casual. Get it? C & C Yachts. Early life George Harding Cuthbertson was born on June 3, 1929, in Brantford, Ontario. He was the second son of Elma Charlotte (n√©e Ferguson), and Allan Edward Cuthbertson, who was general manager and later president of Harding Carpets, which operated a factory in Brantford. George's middle name came from carpet company founder Victor Harding. The elder Mr. Cuthbertson died suddenly of a heart attack in 1943. His widow and sons moved to her hometown of Toronto. There was no yachting background in his family. There had been exposure to boating at summer camps, but it was his enrolment in the Royal Canadian Yacht Club's junior program at 14 and his introduction to the instruction boats, known with dubious affection as \\"Brutal Beasts\\", that provided a formal introduction to the sport. George had an innate feeling for sailing, one that encompassed not only athletics but form and structure. As a boy, he was always drawing airplanes and ships‚Äîor rather, translating them, to scale, from imagined solid form to two-dimensional schemes. He was beginning to see beauty, grace and speed as qualities that could be governed by mathematics, albeit a mathematics tempered by artistic instinct. In time, this vision would lead to a career in an occupation with a very narrow membership‚Äîthat of a Canadian yacht designer with an international reputation. He had few role models. The level of sailing activity in the Toronto area was a far cry from today's crowded standards. It was very much a male pastime, with the concept of the sport as a truly family recreation still many years away. In the shadow of post-war economic gloom, outings seemed to be restricted to Saturdays on the part of the men of the household, with a few women joining in. There was little regular work to support a full-time resident designer. Apart from a number of enthusiasts like Charlie Burke, who excelled in racing dinghy designs, and a few local builders who, on occasion, penned their own creations, the ranks of full-fledged local designers were practically empty. The circle of potential clients and associates was relatively small, and Cuthbertson made many key connections as the Royal Canadian Yacht Club's official measurer, a post he assumed at 17. The job put him in touch with many individuals important to his future, and lent him first-hand experience with the shapes and dimensions of the Great Lakes' faster yachts. Education George completed high school in Toronto before earning a degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Toronto, graduating in 1950. Career C&C; 25 designed by Cuthbertson C&C; 35 Mk 1 designed by Cuthbertson After graduating Cuthbertson worked for a time for the Canadian operation of SKF, the Swedish ball-bearing manufacturer. In 1951, he formed a registered partnership with Peter Davidson, a young man also active in sailing at the RCYC, for the purpose of producing products in an experimental new material called fibreglass. This work led to Cuthbertson's first production design, the Water Rat, a small dinghy conceived in 1953. About 80 in all were built, mostly with the bare hands of the two partners. There wasn't a lot of work for yacht design in Canada at that time, so they operated a yacht brokerage, which imported yachts from Europe, under the name of Canadian Northern Co.  Venture II  Cuthbertson was active in both 6-Metre and 8-Metre competition, which led to an important modification assignment. The RCYC and the Rochester Yacht Club had arranged to revive the Canada's Cup, an emblem of match racing supremacy on the Great Lakes, last contested between the two clubs in 1934, in honour of the RCYC's centennial in 1954. The series was to be sailed, as in the previous outing, in 8-Metres, and Royal Canadian Yacht Club member Norm Walsh hired Cuthbertson to secure a proven 8-Metre and draw up its alterations. After losing the opening race of the match series, Walsh's Venture II, with Cuthbertson and Davidson aboard, won three straight to bring the Canada's Cup to its native land for the first time since 1903. It was an encouraging debut for the 25 year-old Canadian designer, and it paid off with an imagined dividend when Walsh subsequently asked Cuthbertson to provide the design for a large ocean racer.  Inishfree  Inishfree was George Cuthbertson's first design of consequence and she was built in Meaford, Ontario by Cliff Richardson Boat Works. A year and a half under construction, her materials and workmanship were the finest. Finished bright, she was double planked of mahogany over laminated oak frames, and bronze fastened with cast bronze centreboard in a monel trunk. Her laid deck was of teak, and her mainmast aluminum, but her other spars were of spruce. Inishfree was launched in August, 1958 and sailed from Georgian Bay to Toronto in time to score her first win ‚Äì the Edward Prince of Wales Cup. In 1960, the RCYC burgee was first flown in a Bermuda Race as Inishfree sailed to a respectable finish in Class B. Returning home, she won the Freeman Cup Race, her first of three in a row ‚Äì the only yacht ever to so accomplish ‚Äì and she added a fourth Freeman Cup win in 1964. Many more trophies bear her name. In 1961 alone, Inishfree won the Marlatt and Boswell Trophies, the Cosgrave, Dufferin, Marquis of Lorne and Queen's Cups, her second Freeman Cup and the Rochester Race ‚Äì her first of three in a row. Subsequently, owned by W. Bernard Herman of Island Yacht Club, Inishfree became in the early 1960s the first Canadian entrant in the Southern Ocean Racing Circuit, initiating Canadian participation which was to prove historic in years to come. She promptly began to rack up an enviable race record on Lake Ontario. Canadian Northern Co. Cuthbertson modified a number of European yachts for the North American market. These Canadian Northern 35s were designed by Cuthbertson and built of steel by Kurt Beister in Norderney, Germany. A half dozen were built by Cliff Richardson in Meaford, Ontario. One, named Carousel was ordered as a bare hull by a boyhood friend of Cuthbertson's from sailing days in Port Credit, who had since become Peter Davidson's brother-in-law. His name was Perry Connolly, and he would soon return to George Cuthbertson for the design that would make both their names household words in international sailing circles. \\"At this time, Ted Brewer was very involved with our brokerage and import activities,\\" Cuthbertson says. \\"Ted was with us for about three years, functioning as a yacht broker (and a very effective one) while studying yacht design in his spare time through the Westlawn course. In time, he also moved to the U.S. to take a job with Luders Marine Construction in Stamford, Conn., and so began his distinguished career.\\" Much had happened in the interim between the 1954 Canada's Cup and the launching of Inishfree. Cuthbertson and Davidson had parted ways, leaving Cuthbertson on his own to pursue further design commissions. Cuthbertson & Cassian In 1961 Cuthbertson took George Cassian into the company, and established the design firm of Cuthbertson & Cassian, which designed a number of successful steel, and strip planked wooden boats for Great Lakes and East Coast customers. In an interview Cutbertson explained: > In late ‚Äô58 there was a very major plant, Avro up in Malton, Ontario, > building aircraft. They had developed the Avro Arrow [Canada's first > supersonic aircraft], which was apparently superb. They built a half-dozen, > the customer being the Canadian government. It was generally acknowledged to > be the best aircraft of its type‚Äîa fighter‚Äîin the world at that time. For a > variety of reasons that are still hotly debated, the prime minister at that > time [1957‚Äì1963], John Diefenbaker, canceled the contract. Whoosh! Avro had > no choice but to immediately shut down, they were so wedded to that program. > Diefenbaker canceled the contract on a Friday and that laid off 17,000 > people, including George Cassian, who was in the design department. On > Monday this young chap walked into my office and introduced himself. Said > we'd met once several years before at a party, which was likely. Was there > any chance he could get a job? He had drawings with him and I was impressed. > I said, ‚ÄúGeorge, I have two weeks of design work ahead of me. And if you > join, that will be one week each.‚Äù So he said, ‚ÄúWell, I haven't got anything > else to do.‚Äù So I said, ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù He was with me for almost a year. His other > interest was automobiles, racing cars. He decided to move to Detroit in the > auto industry, but whenever he was back in Toronto, where his family was, > he'd drop in the office to see how things were going. He told me he was > moving home and getting married and would like to buy a share of the > business. I was up to my ears in debt, having trouble paying bills, so I > sold him a 25% interest. We incorporated as Cuthbertson & Cassian Ltd. In > due course that 25% was increased to one third. We were never a partnership. Among the more notable Cuthbertson & Cassian products from the early 1960s were Vanadis, a 34-footer built of steel in Germany for Payson Mayhew of Chicago in 1960, Galatia for Tony Ronza, Sr., Laura for Doug Hood, Courtesan for John Young of Shelter Island, NY, Inferno I for Jim McHugh, La Mouette and Thermopylae for Gordon Fisher, and the little motorsailor Pipe Dream for Sonny Slemin. When Payson Mayhew's Vanadis attended the 1961 Southern Ocean Racing Conference (SORC), Cuthbertson was part of her crew. His appearance may have heen the first modern day participation by a Canadian in the circuit, and the experience introduced him to many people who would be influential in the development of C&C.; =La Mouette= The 38-foot La Mouette was a wooden design built at Metro Marine in Bronte for Gord Fisher of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, which led to a semi-production series. Erich Bruckmann, who would later be one of the founding partners of C&C; Yachts, had been shop supervisor at Metro Marine when La Mouette was built. Fibreglass construction By 1964, the company was but a short step away from becoming involved in designs of fibreglass construction. Cuthbertson had some experience with the material back in the early 1950s, building the Water Rat dinghy, but it was only beginning to have an impact on the boating industry in the early 1960s. The introduction of fibreglass boats was about to make a complete change to the industry and the very nature of recreational boating. Fibreglass would make possible the existence of proper production designs, which in turn would significantly lower the cost of an individual yacht, making the sport accessible to a more general and increasingly affluent public. Cuthbertson & Cassian's first commission for a fibreglass design came from Hinterhoeller Limited, a rapidly growing firm in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. Its founder, George Hinterhoeller, had apprenticed as a boat builder in his native Austria before emigrating to Canada in 1952. He had gone into business for himself in 1957, then incorporated as a private company in 1963. The 36-foot design Cuthbertson & Cassian supplied him became known as the Invader class, and about two dozen were built on a semi-production basis. The partnership then provided him with the design for the Redwing 30 and, later, the Redwing 35. These complimented the designs of Hinterhoeller himself, already in production‚Äîthe HR 25, the HR 28 and the fantastically successful 24-footer, the Shark. In 1965, Ian Morch of the Belleville Marine Yard commissioned C&C; to design the 31-foot Corvette. The centerboard sloop was built of fiberglass and numbered several hundred before production ceased. =Red Jacket= The same year, Canadian yachtsman Perry Connolly asked C&C; to design a custom racing sloop for him. The design directive called for flat-out speed. Connolly said he wanted \\"the meanest, hungriest 40-footer afloat\\". The boat, named Red Jacket, was built by Bruckmann Manufacturing, in Oakville, Ontario, in fiberglass with a balsa core; the resulting structure was (and is) strong, stiff and significantly lighter than the wood or solid fiberglass yachts then sailing. Red Jacket is considered to be the first sailboat engineered with a cored hull (other earlier boats had balsacored decks, and powerboat builders were using it in transoms and superstructures). No doubt the weight savings and panel stiffness of her cored hull contributed significantly to her racing success. She was launched in May 1966 and took 11 of 13 starts that summer. That winter, Red Jacket headed south and won the famed SORC (Southern Ocean Racing Conference), which was a series of six races with the major two being from St. Petersburg to Fort Lauderdale and from Miami to Nassau.competing against over 85 of the best racers of the day. Red Jacket was the first Canadian boat to win the SORC. In 1970, Murray Burt wrote for Maclean's: > There are series of offshore-racing events in Long Island Sound, there's the > celebrated Bermuda race, there are campaigns off British Columbia, there's > the transpacific from Los Angeles to Honolulu, and there are at least a > dozen other important offshore conferences.

She's the only boat from outside the United States ever to > win the SORC. Red Jacket is still actively raced by her owners, members the Royal Canadian Yacht Club. C&C; Yachts In September 1969 the design firm of Cuthbertson & Cassian Ltd. joined with three of the builders producing Cuthbertson & Cassian designs, Belleville Marine Yard, Hinterhoeller Ltd. and Bruckmann Manufacturing to form C&C; Yachts. In that first year C&C; achieves sales of $3.9 million. =Manitou= The year of the merger brought a challenge for the Canada's Cup, a match-race between Canada and the US. C&C;'s custom shop, Bruckmann Manufacturing of Oakville, Ontario, built the three Canadian defenders, one of which, Manitou, beat the Sparkman and Stephens-designed Niagara. On Manitou's victory Burt said: > At the moment, if your average Canadian sports fan has heard of any C & C > yacht at all, she is probably the Manitou. Last September, in the very > pricey competition for the ancient Canada's Cup, Manitou knocked out the > American yacht Niagara in three consecutive races.

Yet George > and George had designed a boat that beat Olin Stephens‚Äô latest, and she'd > beaten her three straight. And there could scarcely have been one well- > heeled deep-sea racing devotee in the whole world who did not hear about it. In 1971 hull #1 of the \\"Limited Edition\\" series, Arieto, won first in Class B of the SORC, and the Montego Bay Race. Also in 1971, Endurance, a 43-footer as well, won the Chicago-Mackinac Race. In 1972, Condor, the prototype Redline 41 won SORC overall and the 43 foot Arieto won the Nassau and Governor's cups. =Other Cuthbertson designs for C&C; Yachts= The C&C; designs that came off Cuthbertson's drawing board in the early 70s for production building at the Niagara-on-the-Lake plant of George Hinterhoeller are legendary and include the C&C; 25, 27, 30, 35, and 39. The Custom Shop under Erich Bruckmann built such Cuthbertson & Cassian designed classics as the Redline 41, C&C; 43, C&C; 50, and the remarkable C&C; 61\\\\. The Redline 41 Condor would follow Red Jacket's lead and win SORC overall in 1971. The custom yachts that came off Cuthbertson's board in this time period further consolidated Cuthbertson's and C&C;'s reputation on the race course under the CCA rule, and included the 53‚Äô Inferno II for Jim McHugh, the 54‚Äô Bonaventure V for Bernie Herman, True North for the 1969 Canada's Cup, and Mirage and Merrythought for the unsuccessful 1971 defence of Canada's Cup, both of which would go on to achieve great offshore racing success under Gerry Moog and Jack King. The high water mark of Cuthbertson's design career was the 1971 SORC where Cuthbertson & Cassian designed boats not only won overall, but also won three of the five divisions. A truly remarkable feat, which has never been achieved by another designer. After the introduction of the IOR Rule in the early 1970s, the sailing world changed dramatically with the rise of a whole new cohort of young designers. This, combined with the increased demands of running what was becoming a large multi-national public company answerable to a Board of Directors, led Cuthbertson to hand the design responsibilities to Robert Ball in 1973. After a short break from the company, Cuthbertson returned to C&C; in the position of President, a position he held until an outside acquisition of the company in late 1981. Motion Designs In 1982, Cuthbertson left the company he created to relaunch his design career with a new company, Motion Designs, producing drawings for Ontario Yachts and other local Ontario builders. Retirement Cuthbertson served as official historian of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club and as an honorary curator at the Marine Museum of the Great Lakes at Kingston, Ontario, where he long served on the board of directors.sailingscuttlebutt.com: \\"Eight Bells: George Cuthbertson\\", 5 Oct 2017 Through the 1970s Cuthbertson flew Cessna 172s and floatplanes. In his retirement continued to fly, usually a custom built Cessna 172. He also tinkered with furniture design and travelled widely. It was his practice to visit marinas to check in on the condition of the sailboats he had designed. He maintained a soft spot for the dinghies with which he launched his career. The user name of his e-mail address was \\"waterrat.\\" Death George H. Cuthbertson, aged 88, died on October 3, 2017 at his home in Toronto, Canada. George Cuthbertson was the last surviving member of the original founders of C&C;, being predeceased by George Cassian, Ian Morch, George Hinterhoeller, and Erich Bruckmann. Awards In 1974, George H. Cuthbertson was elected to membership in the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. George H. Cuthbertson was awarded the Canadian Yachting Magazine, Ontario Sailing, 2011 Legends of Ontario Sailing Award as one of the ‚ÄúBuilders of C&C; Yachts‚Äù Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012 to honour significant contributions and achievements by a Canadian. George H. Cuthbertson was inducted into the Canadian Sailing Hall of Fame in 2014. Cuthbertson archive The Marine Museum of the Great Lakes has in its archives the early original C&C; design and construction drawings, a retirement donation by Cuthbertson of his papers. In 2008 Tim Jackett, whose company bought the C&C; name in 1996, donated the rest of the Cuthbertson papers and more, dating from 1972 through to the late 1980s. Boat designs Some of George Cutbertson's designs include: Favourites When George Cuthbertson was asked back in 1992 to name the company's most outstanding boats from his tenure, he felt that the original C&C; 35 was a standout. He also mentioned two other models from its era: The Redline 41 Condor earned C&C; its second‚Äîand last‚ÄîSORC title in 1972. At that same SORC, the C&C; 61 Sorcery was first overall in two races. Socery had amassed a trophy case of victories in 1971 for owner James Baldwin of Locust Valley, N.Y., and Cuthbertson felt the fame of this design has been largely overlooked in Canada because none of the 61s ever sailed in \\"local\\" waters.

The lake is bordered on the western side by the Wagin Lake Nature Reserve, which occupies an area of . The traditional owners of the area are the Noongar peoples in the Gnaala Karla Booja region (the Pindjarup, Wiilman and Ganeang dialectical groups). There are a number of Aboriginal sites throughout the shire, including around the lake. The lake's name is of Noongar origin, and was first recorded by a surveyor in 1869-72. It means \\"place of emus\\", or \\"site of the foot tracks from when the emu sat down\\". The town takes its name from the lake. The lake is part of a chain of wetlands situated along major ancient drainage lines in the area that run from Dumbleyung in the north to south of Wagin. The Shire of Wagin contains many large lakes and wetlands, including western parts of Lake Dumbleyung, Parkeyerring Lake, Lake Little Parkeyerring, Lake Quarbing, Lake Norring, Lake Little Norring, Lake Gundaring and Lake Wagin. The lakes are part of the catchment system of the Blackwood River but as a result of the flat topography, low average rainfall and existence of an extensive network of salt lakes, the eastern creeks and rivers rarely contribute any flows to the river. The catchment area has an average rainfall of per annum and an evaporation rate of per annum. The landscape is a mixture of alluvial plains, dunes, small lunettes and swales found over alluvial and aeolian deposits. In February 2017 floods filled the lake to capacity; it remained filled through to the following year, attracting large flocks of black swans, egrets and ducks.

She was the only one of the 68 women who signed the Declaration to see the day that women could vote nationwide. On July 19, 1848, 19-year-old Pierce travelled to Seneca Falls with 6 of her closest friends by wagon upon hearing about the Convention. It was not for many years, until 1920 when Pierce was 91 when she was able to witness the first election in which she was eligible to vote.  Teenage years  Charlotte Woodward Pierce Charlotte Woodward Pierce was born in 1829 in Waterloo, New York to a Quaker family. After working as a schoolteacher at the age of 15, she became an independent seamstress, working out of the home of Moses and Hannah Chapman in 1848. All of the wages she earned from sewing gloves from leather went to Moses Chapman in exchange for her living arrangements. This working situation ignited in Pierce an awareness for the oppression of the women of her era. As a result, she participated in the Seneca Falls Convention to fight for greater opportunities for women. Because she was working at the time, she wanted all women to be able to choose their area of work and wages, which was something she and many other women could not do at the time.  Political work after 1848  In the years after Seneca Falls, Pierce continued her work to further women's rights. She joined the American Women's Suffrage Association (AWSA) and was also acquainted with famous suffragist and social reformer Susan B. Anthony. In addition, she became active in the Association for the Advancement of Women. Pierce outwardly opposed the creation of the National Woman's Party (NWP), expressing her belief that women should join existing political parties instead of consolidating their votes together in their own party. Despite her original disapproval of the NWP, she sent a trowel to the NWP to be used to help place a cornerstone for the party's headquarters in Washington. The trowel read, \\"in memory of the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848: presented by its sole survivor, Mrs. Charlotte L. Pierce, in thanksgiving for progress made by women and in honor of the National Woman's Party, which will carry on the struggle so bravely begun.\\"  1920 election  After the ratification of the 19th Amendment, the 1920 presidential election of Warren G. Harding was American women's first opportunity for enfranchised political engagement. Charlotte Woodward Pierce was the only remaining woman from Seneca Falls present and excited for the election, but unfortunately for Pierce, who was 91 at the time, her deteriorating health kept her from exercising her right to vote. She was bedridden and going blind, which kept her from going to the polls that day and voting for a candidate. Because of her health issues, Pierce was never actually able to exercise the right to vote that she and her deceased peers worked so hard for.

One of the Mormon pioneers, John Steele built the house in 1862 and lived there until his death in 1903, working as an herbal physician and serving in a number of town and county offices. Its floor plan is a rare double-parlor style. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 for its architectural and historical significance. Architecture The one-story house stands on a foundation of stone, with red adobe walls and a wooden gable roof. Most Toquerville homes from this period were built of log rather than adobe. With It is one of only three well- documented examples of a double-parlor house in Utah: it is divided into two parlors and a narrower hall on the northern end. The Steele house has an extra door compared to most double-parlor houses (with one door and three windows), producing a symmetrical facade that gives the misleading appearance of a double-cell house (with two rooms of equal size). The center room, with a large fireplace, served as the kitchen. An adobe lean-to was added in the 1860s‚Äì1870s on the left third of the rear, and further expanded with a frame lean-to on the right two-thirds in the 1930s. A full-width porch pictured in 1900 is now removed; it is unknown whether it was original. The exterior walls were probably stuccoed white in the early 20th century. With a \\"virtually unaltered\\" interior and the original doors and windows, however, the house \\"maintains a high degree of its original integrity.\\" History Toquerville had only been founded three years ago when John Steele moved there from nearby Parowan in 1861, as part of southern Utah's settlement by the Mormons. His family came in 1862. Experienced with making and laying adobe brick, which he had done in Salt Lake City, Steele probably built the house himself that year. He served as postmaster (1865), justice of the peace (1868‚Äì1869), and as surveyor (1873) and assessor (1874‚Äì1875) of Kane County. He also had a nearby boot and shoe shop, and went on several LDS Church missions. But \\"Doc\\" Steele derived much of his reputation from setting bones, administering herbal medicines and making horoscopes. Despite Utah introducing medical licensing, he continued to practice until his death in 1903. The privately owned house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 7, 1988. The nomination cites its locally significant architecture and history: \\"There are approximately a dozen houses in the community that date from the first decade or two of settlement, but few of them are as old and as well preserved as the Steele House.\\" See also Other historic Toquerville properties: * Thomas Forsyth House * Naegle Winery References Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Utah Category:National Register of Historic Places in Washington County, Utah Category:Houses completed in 1862 Category:Houses in Washington County, Utah ","title":"John Steele House (Toquerville, Utah)"},{"id":"59403642","text":" Dewahi Gonahi (Nepali: ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ó‡•ã‡§®‡§æ‡§π‡•Ä) is a municipality in Rautahat District, a part of Province No. 2 in Nepal.

It was filmed beside the Chinese film Love for Life, and chronicles the everyday lives of a variety of different people living in China with HIV/AIDS. The film depicts the living conditions of those living with HIV in China, as well as their own personal thoughts on their disease. Together, like the film Love for Life, was commissioned by the Ministry of Health and backed by the Chinese government. Zhao Liang has been seen as a rebel director, producing documentaries that expose the Chinese government of wrongdoing. For instance, his documentary Petition focused on mistreatment of Chinese by local authorities and government officials. Unlike his previous works, Together was made with the Chinese government and was censored, without mention of the mishandling of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1990s and the cover-up by the government. Instead, the documentary focuses more on the actual lives of individuals with HIV/AIDS instead of touching on the past blood-sharing scandal in villages.  Plot  The documentary Together begins on the set of the film, with Zhao Liang asking cast members and crew about their opinions on HIV/AIDS. Liang also reveals to cast members and those working on the film that there are cast members who have HIV/AIDS. This revelation receives mixed reactions from the crew, demonstrating a lasting stigma around the disease despite working on a film to promote awareness on HIV/AIDS. Liang also follows actors from the film and extras who have the diagnosis and uses the documentary to let these individuals both share their stories and offer insight to the disease and the effect on their lives and relationships with others. For instance, it is revealed in the documentary that Hu Zetao, who plays the narrator in the film Love for Life, has HIV/AIDS. The documentary looks closely at Zetao's life and relationships with family members; The Lancet noted in 2011 that of the participants in the film, Zetao, who contracted the virus from his mother, was the least isolated by his diagnosis. In fact, most of the participants asked that their identities remain secret.  Themes  The documentary Together showcases the stories of individuals living with HIV in a modern-day society, whereas the film Love for Life is based on a fictional story about the 1990s blood-selling practice in rural villages. While Love for Life showcases an emotional story between two HIV positive individuals, Together focuses on the burden and stigma within present society and desire to be seen as normal individuals. Together provides information about the government and also details modes of transmission through the stories, focusing on mother-to-child transmission and blood transfusion than through more scandalous methods such as through sex work or sharing needles for drug use. Overall, Together is a documentary that looks at the stigma that still exists within China while also promoting the efforts of the government to reduce stigma and control the continuation of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Within the documentary, the stigma within Zetao's own family is shown. Specifically, he is unable to dip his chopsticks into the communal hotpot and is given his own utensils and bowls that he must wash separately. His family fears contracting the disease from Zetao, leading to isolation from his family. In addition to following actors and extras from the film Love for Life, Liang also reaches out to many people within China through chat rooms. Liang joins an online chat room specifically for individuals with HIV and AIDS and asks about their stories and willingness to be filmed for the documentary. While many are hesitant to film, the few who do agree have their identities protected and share how they contracted the disease, who knows of their status among family and friends, and the stigma that the diagnosis has in the modern day. From the interviews and minimal response, it is clear that there is still a fear of being open about such a diagnosis. ‚ÄúA big reason we don't stand up,\\" explained one participant known only as Invisible Angel, \\"is because people don't identify with us. People think that only drug users or promiscuous and morally depraved people get AIDS.‚Äù Additionally, within the interviews a common theme is fear of telling family members out of fear of isolation, rejection or shame. One individual details how she had planned to kill both herself and her son due to their HIV positive statuses and lack of desire to live in a society where their status is seen as a burden and impeding relationships with others.  Reception = Critical response  Together was filmed beside Love for Life, marking the first time the blood selling scandal of the 1990s had been featured in mainstream Chinese media. More still, the Chinese government backed the film, and used it as a way to advocate public health information on HIV/AIDS, and the living condition and social impact it has on those who contract it.
