It purports to reveal how the economy trumps other concerns, which allows for the elevation of class as the focus of the study.  Marxism  In the 19th century, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote that the main source of instability in the international system would be capitalist globalization, more specifically the conflict between two classes: the national bourgeoisie and the cosmopolitan proletariat. Historical materialism was going to be Marxism‚Äôs guideline in understanding the processes both in domestic and international affairs. Thus, for Marx human history has been a struggle to satisfy material needs and to resist class domination and exploitation. Despite ideological criticism, Marxism has strong empirical advantages on its side. Firstly, by emphasizing injustice and inequality it is very relevant to every period of time as these two failures of the human society have never been absent. Marxism is a structural theory just like neorealism, but it focuses on the economic sector instead of the military- political one. Its analysis reflects the relation between the base (the modes of production) and the superstructure (political institutions). The source of structural effects is not anarchy, but the capitalist mode of production which defines unjust political institutions and state relations. This economic reductionism is considered also to be a central flaw. As a solution, the neo- Gramscian school proposed a further development. By combining global capitalism, state structure and political-economic institutions, they managed to create a theory of global hegemony (ideological domination). According to this theory, hegemony is maintained through close cooperation between powerful elites inside and outside the core regions of the world system. Global governance is constituted by political and economic institutions that put pressure on the less developed and unstable peripheral countries. From an epistemological point of view, Marxism created the foundations for critical theory and it is superior in this sense to the dominant approaches of Anglo- American international relations that are problem-solving theories. As any other critical theory, Marxism has a normative interest in identifying possibilities for social transformation and how theory is instrumental to power. This is why Marx wrote about capitalism with an interest in the social forces that would bring about its downfall hoping that humanity would be free from domination and exploitation. Realists in particular see this to be politically motivated and not objective and neutral. The normative disadvantage of Marxism is that it can be seen as Eurocentric by promoting the Enlightenment ideal of cosmopolitanism.  Dependency theory  Linked in with Marxist theories is dependency theory which argues that developed countries in their pursuit of power penetrate developing states through political advisors, missionaries, experts and multi-national corporations (MNCs) to integrate them into the capitalist system in order to appropriate natural resources and foster dependence by developing countries on developed countries.  World- systems theory   Criticisms  Realists and liberals criticize Marxist conflict theories for ideological and consequentialist reasons. Postpositivists disagree with Marxists' elevation of class conflict as the most significant aspect of human life and the key to understanding all human history and behavior.

It was released in Japanese arcades only on the Sega Hikaru arcade system board in 2001. Following its initial release, there was initially no home console port of the game due to the Hikaru's superior graphical capabilities. A region free home port of the game was announced and released on the Xbox 360http://vo-force360.sega.jp/ on December 22, 2010. Gameplay Original logo Force differs from previous versions of the series in that it features 4-players, 2-on-2 team matches. The battle system is heavily simplified from the game's predecessor, Oratorio Tangram, in order to balance the increased number of players. The left-turbo function is removed, and the speed is significantly slower. The game website states this as a side- effect of the V-converters being less efficient than the Mars crystals. The machine uses a magnetic card system to record player data, with the cards being called a \\"VO4 Pilot's License\\". Players start by choosing a base Virtuaroid, which will open up other variants in its family tree as the player plays more of the game. Because of this design, a large number of Virtuaroid variants exist, and the game has the largest VR roster of any game in the series name so far. The VO4 Pilot's License can be used with the VO4 Terminal, which lets players view records, set the pilot name, swap color schemes or use another available Virtuaroid. During the lifespan of the game, an upgraded version named Virtual On Force M.S.B.S. Ver7.7, with new Virtuaroids, new stages and new magnetic card face designs. Virtual-On Marz can be considered the spiritual home console version of Force, since Marz took its rules, stages and the Virtuaroids from Force, though without support for 4-player matches and only taking a select few Virtuaroids, while leaving most of the variants out due to storage constraints of the game. =Xbox 360 version= The Xbox 360 version retains the same gameplay as the original series, only with a few inclusions: 2 on 2 Leader Battles, co-op boss fight mode, a Mission mode and Xbox Live support for online play. Battles have local 2 player splitscreen or up to 4 player over System Link. The game also has a special Collector's edition which includes a booklet called Virtual On Chronicle 15, that looks back at 15 years of Virtual-On, and a six disc soundtrack called Virtual On Official Sound Data. All of the items come packaged in a box with artwork from Hajime Katoki. The game's release date is confirmed to be December 22, 2010. Jaguarandi is now available as a hidden character, along with Apharmd the Hatter based on Apharmd J. However, Ajim, which was a playable character in Oratorio Tangram, is not playable in this Force version. The split-screen gameplay, which was absent from Xbox Live Arcade version of Oratorio Tangram, makes a return in this version. Preordering of the games allows access and download a special \\"Thorax\\" item that adjusts the bust sizes of both female Virtualoids: Fei-Yen and Angelan.

Marz is designed on the basic gameplay rules of Virtual-On Force, and uses most of the assets from Force, ranging from the stages down to the Virtuaroids. It can be considered a spiritual home console version of the 4-player Force. Marz was not well received, bringing many negative responses from reviewers and players alike. Some stores in North America, expecting poor sales, only sold the game to those who reserved it. The game was re-released on the PlayStation 3 in Japan on March 21, 2013 to commemorate the game's tenth anniversary. Gameplay Virtual On Marz retains the Twin Stick control layout of the series, mapping the two stick to the analogue sticks on the DualShock controller, and the turbo and weapon buttons to the four L and R buttons. A new Auto controller layout was provided, as well as several variants, for players who did not like the twin stick format. The match rules follow that of Virtual On: Force, that is, two-on-two matches with a leader on each team. Fallen teammates can be given half the other's life gauge through the \\"rescue tag\\" maneuver, and the first pair to fall loses the round. The \\"Challenge Mode\\" is a single match setup that is akin to a stage in Virtual On: Force, with the player tagged with a NPC partner against two other NPC opponents or bosses. New to the PlayStation 2 Marz is the \\"Dramatic Mode\\", which is a story mode with a linear sequence of missions with various objectives such as exploration, target destruction, beat 'em up and boss battles. When certain requirements are met, such as passing certain stages, or destroying a number of certain Virtuaroids in beat 'em up missions, new Virtuaroids are open for selection and play in the other modes. A split-screen 2-player mode is available, with the choice of playing on the same team or against each other. The game does not feature any means to play with 4-players, and thus, falls short of making full use of the design behind the Virtual On: Force game system and rules. In Japanese version, the Database mode is available, and the databases in this mode can be collected throughout the Dramatic Mode. These databases include stories, characters, and items associated with them. Some of the databases include a description of the particular subjects. This mode is not available in the English localization of the game. Characters The following characters are non-playable characters that appear in the single player Dramatic Mode and Challenge mode in the game, controlled by the computer. Most of the non-playable characters were created for use in the game, although some of them come from previous games with some tweaks in the Virtual-On franchises. The pilots of the Special Virtuaroids are taken from novelizations of the Virtual On franchise such as One Man Rescue and Fragmentary Passage. These Special Virtuaroids can be unlocked if a player meets certain requirements.

The famine is considered the worst in recent decades; it was characterised by massive flooding along the Brahmaputra River as well as high mortality. Overview After independence in 1971, Bangladesh's economy faced a crisis. According to American magazine Time: Warnings of famine began in March 1974 when the price of rice rose sharply. In this month \\"widespread starvation started in Rangpur district\\", the region which would become one of three most afflicted. It had only been two years and three months since the end of the war for Bangladeshi independence (December 1971) and the country's formal creation. In many ways, Bangladesh's new state and devastated infrastructure and markets were wholly unprepared to deal with the situation. Corruption among the newly appointed officials was rampant and widespread. In April, though government officials reiterated that the crisis would be temporary, rice prices continued to rise sharply and reports of starvation became more widespread. From April to July, Bangladesh was hit by heavy rainfall and a series of devastating floods along the Brahmaputra river, with notably destructive incidents in May, July; the ability of the rice crops to survive this was reduced by the growing monoculture of HYV rice. In addition, neighbouring India declined to co-operate with the government of Bangladesh. Rice crops were devastated and prices rocketed. In October rice prices peaked and conditions eased by November 1974 as foreign aid and the winter crop arrived. The famine was officially over by December, though \\"excess\\" mortality (e.g. by disease) continued well into the following year, as is the case with most famines. More people suffered in the rural areas due to starvation. Generally, regional famine intensity was correlated to flood exposure and no doubt the floods exacerbated the famine. However, though warnings of famine began long before the flood (as demonstrated above), it is to the floods which the famine is popularly blamed. Portrait of mortality In terms of total mortality, though figures vary, one scholar estimates 1.5 million deaths as a reasonable estimate. This number includes the post-famine mortality. Starvation was not the only factor; a significant number of deaths are attributable to cholera, malaria and diarrheic diseases. As with most famines, weakened, disease-susceptible conditions resulted in high post-famine mortalities of over 450,000. The poor, labourers and non-landowners were especially susceptible. Multiple authors agree that \\"wage labourers suffered the highest mortality for all groups\\". Crude death rate \\"among landless families was three times higher than that for families with three or more acres\\". Causes As with most famines, the causes of the Bangladesh famine were multiple. These included flooding, rapid population growth, government mismanagement of foodgrain stocks, legislation restricting movement of foodgrains between districts, foodgrain smuggling to neighbouring countries and so called distributional failures. The famine did not occur among all areas and populations but was concentrated in specific areas; particularly those hit by flooding. In their studies of the 1974 famine, various scholars find that 1974 average foodgrain production was a 'local' peak. For this reason, scholars argue that, \\"food availability approach offers very little in the way of explanation of the Bangladesh famine of 1974\\". Rather, they argue that the Bangladesh famine was not caused by a failure in availability of food but in distribution (or entitlement), where one group gained \\"market command over food\\". Two distributional failures stand out. The first failure was internal: the specific configuration of the state rationing system and the market resulted in speculative hoarding by farmers and traders and a consequent rise in prices. The second failure was external: the US had withheld 2.2 million tonnes of food aid, as the then US Ambassador to Bangladesh made it abundantly clear that the US probably could not commit food aid because of Bangladesh's policy of exporting jute to Cuba. And by the time Bangladesh succumbed to the American pressure, and stopped jute exports to Cuba, the food aid in transit was \\"too late for famine victims\\".

It is a mainly residential area, and contains a number of terraced council housing estates. Apple's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa is located in the area, and employs about 3,000 people. Knocknaheeny is part of the Cork North-Central (D√°il constituency). Name and crest Knocknaheeny Crest Knocknaheeny is translated from the Irish Cnoc na hAoine meaning \\"Hill of Friday\\". This is thought by some to reference the hill upon which Jesus Christ was crucified. The Knocknaheeny crest is blue and black in colour and includes the Irish title Cnoc na hAoine. The crest has three images: a reservoir, a windmill, and a swallow. The three stars represent Knocknaheeny, Hollyhill and Knocknacullen.  History  In 1862, Griffith's Land Valuation Survey reported that fifteen families formed the lands of Knocknaheeny, Knocknacullen. They paid rent to the Lord of Cork. One family, Forrest, still farms land near Clogheen. Cattle grazed on what is now Harbour View Road and a windmill stood on the site of the present Killala Gardens. Residential park in Knocknaheeny In the early 1970s, Cork City Council, known then as Cork Corporation, began to develop housing estates on the countryside of Knocknaheeney. These were used to house and rehouse people from slightly older areas of the city, including those who grew up in neighbouring Churchfield, Farranree and Gurranabraher, who wished to remain close to their families. The older townlands had been named after plants; for instance Knocknaheeny (the Hill of the Friday/Rushes), Knocknacullen (Hill of Holly), Knockfree (the Hill of Heather) and Shanakiel (Old Wood or Foxes Wood). The Corporation named the terraces and avenues of modern Knocknaheeney after harbours and coastal areas around the country. In the late 1970s and 1980s, Knocknaheeny had a very young population. The local primary school, Scoil Mhuire ar Cnoc na hAoine (St. Mary's on the Hill), was granted extensions to cope with over-populated classrooms. Scoil Mhic Shuibhne (now Terence McSwiney Community College) was opened in 1979, the first VEC (Vocational Educational Committee) mixed school. By the end of the 1980s and into the 1990s, the school had a population of over 800 students. Like other local schools, enrollment has dropped and stabilized at under half that number, mainly due to changing demographics of an aging population and the Celtic tiger ‚Äì an economic boom in Ireland from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s fueled by foreign investment ‚Äì which enabled many families to relocate and purchase homes in newer estates in the Cork county region. As of 2009, approximately 4,500 people lived in Knocknaheeney.\\"Combat Poverty Agency\\". Institute of Public Health in Ireland. Retrieved on 18 April 2009 Some houses in Knocknaheeny have run into neglect. However Cork City Council have made efforts to improve this situation and development is now visible with a new Town Centre under construction on Harbour View Road. Residential areas are also popping up with housing now erected at the Reservoir (Rezza) stretching to Nash's Boreen and new affordable housing located on Hollyhill Lane and the Shanakiel Development at the top of the Blarney Road.Corporation Web Site In recent years, plans were put in place to demolish the greater part of Knocknaheeny and rebuild it in phases. Locals were consulted on the plans, and there was some resistance and reluctance by many who felt that the Council held no regard for the strong sense of community and ties that were built up over the years. There was also some questioning of the City Council's relationship with Apple Inc., which planned expansion of their headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and wanted a new road built where houses stood. Concerns increased with Apple's subsequent plans to buy land that include part of a very old pilgrimage route and a newer section of a main road circling the outside of the neighbourhood. Nevertheless, 2014 saw the first phase of rehousing. Those whose houses have to be demolished ‚Äì both council- and privately-owned houses ‚Äì were rehoused in neighbouring areas. Those who had purchased their houses from the City and who haven't agreed to have the properties demolished have to wait for the alternative housing that the Council has offered. They usually have to remain in their homes in Knocknaheeny with demolition occurring around them. Amenities =Schools= Knocknaheeny's primary school is St. Mary's on the Hill, opened in 1981, which admits both boys and girls. In its early years it was granted an extension to deal with the then-large numbers of students. The secondary school is Terence MacSwiney Community College (formerly Scoil Mhic Shuibhne), which had approximately 800 students, and now houses, at its western end, a further education college known as CityNorth College. There has been a presence of Barnardo's children's charity in the area since the early 2000s. The Family Centre that was set up by the local Daughters of Charity, in the area's infancy, has been under the operation of the Health Service Initiative since the early 2000s. The centre runs a pre-school through the high-scope method and a creche. In the late 1970s and 1980s, there was a nursery school operating in Ardmore Avenue, but for various reasons (including lack of a teacher, building unsuitability and lower child population numbers) it had closed. The secondary school was home to the Cork City Council Library until it had to move to a premises in the shopping centre across the road. A new building for the library was built on the school's ground and was opened in mid-2015. Most of the secondary school's land has been used to accommodate The Family Centre and other community-based ventures in recent years. = Sport = Over the years, there have been a variety of sports introduced into the area, with many staying. One example would be that of tennis, with weekly children's tennis classes given every summer. These classes took place on the tennis court of the secondary school, which has since been built on. Martial arts clubs are also active in the community. Because Knocknaheeny is in close proximity to other neighbourhoods, there is easy access to other clubs not in the immediate area. For many years, the area ran a swimming club, supported by local volunteers. This was run from Cork City Council's public swimming pool in Churchfield, and many children started their lessons here and moved on to become lifeguards or sports and swimming tutors. Soccer is a big part of the community, and local teams include Knocknaheeny Celtic, Central Rovers and Grattan United. Other sporting activities in Knocknheeny include Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) sports of Hurling and Gaelic football. In 1943, St Vincent's Hurling and Football club was founded to promote Gaelic games in the Blarney Street and Sunday's Well area, and later expanded to encompass Knocknaheeny, Gurranabraher and Churchfield. The club won the Minor Premier County competition in 1998. Some of these players joined with members of other underage teams from the 1990s to help the club win its first intermediate football title in 2006 and has ensured that the club retained Senior status for the first time since the 1970s. =Transport= Knocknaheeny is served by a number of bus routes, including route 201 (from Mayfield via Knocknaheenyto Cork University Hospital) and route 202 (from Knocknaheeny via the city centre and Ballintemple to Mahon).

In other words, if they had that exact stamp in stock in the exact condition specified, the current catalogue price is the price that they would charge for it. This contrasts with most other catalogues which are produced by firms that do not sell stamps and therefore base their pricing on an average of market values in the country where the catalogue is published.

He is a founding member of the rock bands Jefferson Starship and Starship and the only member of both bands to play on every song, album, tour, and video. Since 1993, Chaquico has pursued a solo career as a contemporary acoustic jazz guitarist and composer. Early life Chaquico was born and raised in Sacramento, California and attended La Sierra High School in the suburb of Carmichael. His mother, Muriel, was a state government employee, and his father, Bill, was an upholstery craftsman who owned his own business. He had an older brother named Howard. His household was a musical one, as his mother played piano and organ and his father played saxophone and accordion. As Chaquico recalls, \\"My mom and dad were musicians and played around the house all the time. I thought everybody played the piano and organ like mom and the sax and accordion like Dad together after dinner.\\" He began playing the guitar as a young boy, when his parents bought him his first guitar at the age of ten. When Chaquico was twelve, he and his father were traveling in their car when they were hit head-on by a drunk driver. Chaquico sustained major injuries. Both of his arms were broken, as were his leg, ankle, foot, wrist, and thumb. During physical therapy, his father told him that guitarist Les Paul had been in a car accident and had played guitar to help himself heal. His father promised to buy him a Les Paul guitar when he got better. Although he could play only the high E string of his acoustic guitar due to his casts, he benefited from playing and his father kept his word about the Les Paul.  Career  Chaquico started playing guitar in clubs when he was fourteen. Two years later, he was asked to join his English teacher, Jack Traylor's, new band, Steelwind, which performed in the Sacramento and San Francisco Bay Areas. Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane saw him perform and invited him to a series of recording sessions and concerts. Chaquico's first recording with Kantner and Grace Slick was in 1971 on their album Sunfighter, followed by Baron von Tollbooth & the Chrome Nun. He played on Slick's solo album, Manhole, in 1974. During this period, members of the Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead, Quicksilver Messenger Service, and Crosby, Stills and Nash often appeared together in concerts and recordings, and he played alongside Jerry Garcia, David Crosby, David Freiberg, and Carlos Santana. Craig Chaquico with Jefferson Starship at KSAN95's Free Concert in Justin Herman Plaza, San Francisco - June 1, 1979 When he joined the newly formed Jefferson Starship touring band in 1974, Chaquico expected to go back to school after one tour. Instead, Slick and Kantner invited him to join the band permanently. Chaquico played a crucial role in launching Jefferson Starship into commercial success. The band eventually earned twenty platinum and gold albums including Red Octopus which was certified double-platinum in 1995. Chaquico was the only member to appear in every recording, album, tour, and music video. He wrote or co-wrote Jefferson Starship's songs \\"Fast Buck Freddy,\\" \\"Love Too Good,\\" \\"Rock Music,\\" \\"Jane,\\" \\"Find Your Way Back,\\" \\"Layin' It on the Line\\", and \\"Light the Sky on Fire\\". Jefferson Starship performed the song \\"Light the Sky on Fire\\" for the Star Wars Holiday Special in 1978. On April 22, 1974, San Francisco Chronicle music critic Joel Selvin wrote, \\"Guitars are the best thing about live rock bands and Chaquico is easily the best thing about Starship.\\" Carvin Guitars began placing advertisements in Guitar Player magazine and Guitar for the Practicing Musician during the 1980s featuring Chaquico and his Carvin V220 and double neck electric guitars X100B amp stacks, which became their best-selling products through the 1980s. Craig Chaquico in 1981 The name Jefferson Starship was legally retired by all band members in March 1985 after Paul Kantner left the band and renamed it \\"Starship\\". All other band members, including Chaquico, remained with the band. Starship recorded hits such as \\"We Built this City\\", \\"Sara\\", and \\"Nothing's Going to Stop Us Now\\". Chaquico and Starship were in MTV videos on a regular basis and appeared in the first MTV Spring Break special in Daytona Beach in 1986. Chaquico left Starship in 1991, and soon after, the band announced that it would quit. Having become disappointed with the musical direction Starship was going, Chaquico formed Big Bad Wolf, a hard rock band which recorded one album before disbanding. He began a solo career that explored world music, New Age, and contemporary jazz. His first album, Acoustic Highway (1993), was the number one Independent New Age Album of the Year in Billboard Magazine and a number one on the Billboard New Age Albums chart, while his second album, Acoustic Planet (1994), reached number one on the same chart and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best New Age Album. The album borrowed from African and Native American music. The song \\"Just One World\\" was launched into space on a satellite that was part of NASA's Space Ark program. His most recent album, Fire Red Moon, was Chaquico's first blues album and it reached number fifteen on the Billboard blues chart. Chaquico was named Best Pop Instrumental Guitarist in Guitar Player magazine's 1997 Readers' Poll. Philanthropy Chaquico using Music Therapy at Renown Children's Hospital in Reno, Nevada, 2016 Chaquico became a believer in the healing power of music after recovering from a car crash when he was twelve. With the National Association of Music Therapy, Beamz, Remo, and Washburn Guitars, he provided instruments to patients in hospitals. He has become an Artist Advocate for organizations such as the American Music Therapy Association and Memory and Music which use music as a therapeutic, healing power for injured and traumatized people of all ages as well as those with various forms of dementia. With the support of these organizations, Craig has brought music into hospitals, prisons, schools and other places where music can provide healing. He is a member of Bikers for Charity, a group run by Harley Davidson that supports the Muscular Dystrophy Association. When he negotiated a contract to make his Washburn signature guitar, the two parties pledged to plant a tree for every signature guitar manufactured. He supports Guitars in the Classroom, a group with the mission to train and equip teachers to transform learning into a creative, musical process.

They are often used in manicures and pedicures after the nail has been trimmed using appropriate nail clippers. Nail files may either be emery boards, ceramic, glass, crystal, plain metal files or metal files coated with corundum. A nail drill is a powered rotary tool, which is used by a nail technician to file nails. Materials =Emery board= An emery board Emery boards are small flat long objects which have emery or emery paper glued to them, making them both abrasive and flexible, used for fingernail and toenail care. They are used by manicurists to shape and smooth the nail during manicure and pedicure sessions. Emery boards are inexpensive and disposable, making them a sanitary alternative to metal nail files. The emery board was first patented by J. Parker Pray of New York in 1883. Emery boards are generally less abrasive than the metal nail files, and hence, emery boards may take longer to file down nails than metal nail files. However, nail files may play a role in disease transmission if they are used on more than one person without adequate sterilization. Emery boards are usually less expensive than metal nail files, therefore emery boards can be economically disposed of after use on a single person. The nail can be smoothed and shaped accurately by taking light, even strokes in one direction across the top of the nail. Twenty to thirty easy strokes can typically shorten excessively long fingernails, while five to ten strokes are sufficient for shaping the nails. Guitar players have also been known to use emery boards to smooth out calluses which may snag the strings of their guitars. Emery pitches Baseball pitchers and cricket bowlers have been known to use emery boards to scuff the outside of the ball. The roughness can offer more grip and hand control. Surface scratches also alter the ball's aerodynamics making it more susceptible to spin and movement when in flight. However, the deliberate manipulation of the ball using an emery board is classified as cheating in baseball and cricket. In an infamous 1987 Major League Baseball incident, Joe Niekro of the Minnesota Twins was caught with an emery board in his pocket and suspended for ten games. He claimed it was for filing his nails. =Glass= Glass nail files are more recently available. Since glass nail files have a smoother and more even surface they do not splinter the nail like emery boards or metal nail files. This makes them a preferred instrument by manicurists, although they are sometimes difficult to find in stores. Glass nail files come in very different qualities, some of them solid glass, others merely glass covered with an abrasive surface. History Although the modern nail file only appeared at the end of the 19th century, evidence of nail file-like tools exist even further back in history. Marie Antoinette was known for her fondness with the lime √† ongles, which was a nail file-like tool made of pumice stone. When her perfectly shaped nails were seen, it became the latest female trend in the French Court of Versailles. The pumice stone was carved into a pencil-like shape, which was used to trim and shape the edges of the nail.

The reserves then left the league, with the first team placed in the Premier Division amidst league reorganisation, going on to win the title in the 1929‚Äì30 season. In 1931‚Äì32 they reached the first round of the FA Cup but lost 9‚Äì0 at Northampton Town. The following season saw them win the Surrey Senior Cup, beating Dulwich Hamlet 2‚Äì1 in the final. The club were FA Amateur Cup semi-finalists in 1933‚Äì34, losing 2‚Äì0 to Dulwich Hamlet. The following season saw them finish as runners-up in the Premier Division.Spartan League 1934‚Äì1955 Non-League Matters Metropolitan Police were Spartan League champions again in 1936‚Äì37 and 1938‚Äì39. When the league restarted after World War II, they were placed in the Central Division for the 1945‚Äì46 season, winning the title without losing a match. Placed in the Premier Division the following season, the club won the league title in 1946‚Äì47 and were runners-up in 1947‚Äì48. They won back-to-back titles in 1953‚Äì54 and 1954‚Äì55. In 1960 the club transferred to the Metropolitan League, finishing bottom of the league in 1961‚Äì62. They won the League Cup in 1968‚Äì69, and when the league folded in 1971, they transferred to Division One South of the Southern League, where they remained until moving to Division Two of the Isthmian League in 1977. They were Division Two runners-up in 1977‚Äì78, earning promotion to Division One. In 1984‚Äì85 the club reached the first round of the FA Cup, losing 3‚Äì0 at home to Dartford. At the end of the 1984‚Äì85 season Metropolitan Police were relegated to Division Two South. Although they were promoted back to Division One after finishing as runners-up in the division in 1987‚Äì88, the club were relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1990‚Äì91 season. Another FA Cup first round appearance in 1993‚Äì94 ended in a 2‚Äì0 defeat at home to Crawley Town. Amidst league reorganisation, the club were moved into Division One South in 2002, before being placed in Division One in 2004. A fifth-placed finish in 2004‚Äì05 saw them qualify for the promotion play-offs, but they lost 4‚Äì3 on penalties to Bromley in the semi-finals after a 1‚Äì1 draw. The club finished fourth in the division the following season, but lost in the play-off semi-finals again, defeated 1‚Äì0 by Dover Athletic. More league reorganisation saw Metropolitan Police placed in Division One South in 2006. They finished fourth in 2007‚Äì08, losing 2‚Äì0 to Cray Wanderers in the play-off semi-finals. Another fourth-placed finish in 2008‚Äì09 was followed by a 1‚Äì0 win against Fleet Town in the play-off semi- finals before a 1‚Äì0 loss to Cray Wanderers in the final. They won the London Senior Cup in 2009‚Äì10, beating AFC Wimbledon in the final on penalties. In 2010‚Äì11 the club won Division One South, earning promotion to the Premier Division. A fourth FA Cup first round appearance in 2012‚Äì13 saw the club drawn at home to Crawley Town again, this time losing 2‚Äì1. In 2014‚Äì15 they finished fifth, going on to lose 2‚Äì1 to Hendon in the play-off semi-finals. The club also won the Surrey Senior Cup, beating Merstham 2‚Äì0 in the final. At the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season Metropolitan Police were transferred to the Premier South division of the Southern League as part of the restructuring of the non- League pyramid. The following season saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 2‚Äì0 to Newport County. They also won the Surrey Senior Cup, and finished third in the Premier Division South. In the play-offs they defeated Salisbury 3‚Äì2 in the semi-finals, and went on to win the final against Poole Town 1‚Äì0, qualifying for the super play-off final against Tonbridge Angels, which they lost 3-2 after extra time. Ground The club have played at Imber Court since their establishment. The site was purchased by the Metropolitan Police Service in 1919, with a clubhouse opened in 1920.Metropolitan Police Pyramid Passion A grandstand was opened in 1923 and doubled in size to accommodate 672 spectators in 1934. Floodlights were erected in 1971 and the ground was enclosed in 1973. Terracing was installed on three sides of the pitch in 1984, with a cover added to the Mounted Branch End in 1988. In 1994 the original stand was demolished and replaced with a 300-seat stand, which was opened with a commemorative match against the Army.

Dr. Modi set out to hold eye camps in the then Bombay State, which included parts of Karnataka. He travelled to remote villages and towns to hold camps, often with very little financial or medical support. He mobilised support from local voluntary organisations and people. He also received assistance from India and abroad for his mission. Those operated upon were being given spectacles free of cost.

Union ground forces led by General Gordon Granger conducted a short siege of the Confederate garrison at the mouth of Mobile Bay under the command of General Richard L. Page. The Confederate surrender helped shut down Mobile, Alabama, as an effective Confederate port city. Background Admiral David Farragut had defeated the Confederate navy in Mobile Bay on August 5, and Fort Gaines, guarding the western approach to the bay, had surrendered to the cooperating Union land forces under Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger. Granger and Farragut next turned their full attention to Fort Morgan on Mobile Point, east across from Fort Gaines. The fort was a powerful but outdated fortification garrisoned by 600 men under the command of Robert E. Lee's cousin, Brig. Gen. Richard L. Page. Siege Plan of Siege Operations. Granger's soldiers landed at Pilot Town on August 9 and began moving siege artillery within range. The Union fleet also turned their guns on the fort. For the next two weeks Union forces kept up a heavy and consistent artillery fire. On August 16 the Confederates abandoned two batteries of the outer defenses and Granger moved his siege mortars within 500 yards of the fort and his 30-pounder rifled guns to within 1,200 yards. On August 23, General Page unconditionally surrendered the fort. Indignant, he broke his sword over his knee instead of surrendering it to the Federals. Page's situation was further worsened when he was suspected of destroying munitions and works within the fort after the surrender agreement. For this he was arrested by the Federal authorities and imprisoned. Aftermath The fall of Fort Morgan to the Union forces sealed the mouth of Mobile Bay. The city of Mobile, Alabama would fall on April 12, at the end of the Civil War, after the Battle of Fort Blakeley on April 9, 1865. General Page remained imprisoned until July. A court of inquiry was convened in New Orleans to investigate the charges against Page for violating the laws of war. The court, however, found him \\"Not Guilty\\". The court found that much of the destruction of ammunition resulted from a fire in the Citadel and that Confederates had spiked the artillery pieces before they had raised a white flag of surrender. 2017 commemoration The siege was commemorated in 2017, led by Regina Lanante, the Intermediate School Coordinator of a certain school in Quezon City, Philippines.Official Records Along with her, the other significant figures which participated in the special commemoration includes Lara Ng, Lea Repalde, Lucienne Andres, Camila Villena, Jocelyn Gahol, and Kristin Mabalot.

When moving eastbound, the object's angular velocity is increased (in addition to Earth's rotation), and thus the centrifugal force also increases, causing a perceived reduction in gravitational force. In the early 1900s (decade), a German team from the Institute of Geodesy in Potsdam carried out gravity measurements on moving ships in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. While studying their results, the Hungarian nobleman and physicist Baron Roland von E√∂tv√∂s (Lor√°nd E√∂tv√∂s) noticed that the readings were lower when the boat moved eastwards, higher when it moved westward. He identified this as primarily a consequence of Earth's rotation. In 1908, new measurements were made in the Black Sea on two ships, one moving eastward and one westward. The results substantiated E√∂tv√∂s' claim. Since then, geodesists use the following formula to correct for velocity relative to Earth during a measurement run. : a_r = 2 \\\\Omega u \\\\cos \\\\phi + \\\\frac{u^2 + v^2}{R}. Here, :a_r is the relative acceleration :\\\\Omega is the rotation rate of the Earth :u is the velocity in longitudinal direction (east-west) :\\\\phi is the latitude where the measurements are taken. :v is the velocity in latitudinal direction (north-south) :R is the radius of the Earth The first term in the formula, 2Œ©u cos(œÜ), corresponds to the E√∂tv√∂s effect. The second term is a refinement that under normal circumstances is much smaller than the E√∂tv√∂s effect.  Physical explanation  The most common design for a gravimeter for field work is a spring-based design; a spring that suspends an internal weight. The suspending force provided by the spring counteracts the gravitational force. A well- manufactured spring has the property that the amount of force that the spring exerts is proportional to the extension of the spring from its equilibrium position (Hooke's law). The stronger the effective gravity at a particular location, the more the spring is extended; the spring extends to a length at which the internal weight is sustained. Also, the moving parts of the gravimeter will be dampened, to make it less susceptible to outside influences such as vibration. For the calculations it will be assumed that the internal weight has a mass of . It will be assumed that for surveying a method of transportation is used that gives good speed while moving very smoothly: an airship. Let the cruising velocity of the airship be . = Motion along the equator = Graph of the force experienced by a 10-kilogram object as a function of its speed moving along Earth's equator (as measured within the rotating frame). (Positive force in the graph is directed upward. Positive speed is directed eastward and negative speed is directed westward). To calculate what it takes for the internal weight of a gravimeter to be neutrally suspended when it is stationary with respect to the Earth, the Earth's rotation must be taken into account. At the equator, the velocity of Earth's surface is about . The amount of centripetal force required to cause an object to move along a circular path with a radius of 6378 kilometres (the Earth's equatorial radius), at 465 m/s, is about 0.034 newtons per kilogram of mass. For a 10,000-gram internal weight, that amounts to about 0.34 newtons. The amount of suspension force required is the mass of the internal weight (multiplied by the acceleration of gravity) minus those 0.34 newtons. In other words: any object co-rotating with the Earth at the equator has its measured weight reduced by 0.34 percent, thanks to the Earth's rotation. When cruising at 10 m/s due East, the total velocity becomes 465 \\\\+ 10 = 475 m/s, which requires a centripetal force of about 0.0354 newtons per kilogram. Cruising at 10 m/s due West the net velocity is 465 ‚àí 10 = 455 m/s, requiring about 0.0325 newtons per kilogram. So if the internal weight is neutrally suspended while cruising due East, after reversing course it will not be neutrally suspended any more: the apparent mass of the 10,000-gram internal weight will increase by about 3 grams, and the spring of the gravimeter must extend some more to accommodate this greater weight. In high-performance meteorological models, this effect needs to be taken into account on a terrestrial scale. Air masses with significant velocity with respect to the Earth have a tendency to migrate to another altitude, and when the accuracy demands are strict this must be taken into account. = Derivation of the formula for simplified case = Derivation of the formula for motion along the Equator. A convenient coordinate system in this situation is the inertial coordinate system that is co-moving with the center of mass of the Earth. Then the following is valid: objects that are at rest on the surface of the Earth, co-rotating with the Earth, are circling the Earth's axis, so they are in centripetal acceleration with respect to that inertial coordinate system. What is sought is the difference in centripetal acceleration of the surveying airship between being stationary with respect to the Earth and having a velocity with respect to the Earth. The following derivation is exclusively for motion in east‚Äìwest or west‚Äìeast direction. Notation: : a_u is the total centripetal acceleration when moving along the surface of the Earth. : a_s is the centripetal acceleration when stationary with respect to the Earth. : \\\\Omega is the angular velocity of the Earth: one revolution per Sidereal day. : \\\\omega_r is the angular velocity of the airship relative to the angular velocity of the Earth. : \\\\left(\\\\Omega + \\\\omega_r\\\\right) is the total angular velocity of the airship. : u = \\\\omega_r R is the airship's velocity (velocity relative to the Earth). : R is the Earth's radius. :\\\\begin{align} a_r & = a_u - a_s  & = \\\\left(\\\\Omega + \\\\omega_r\\\\right)^2 R - \\\\Omega^2 R  & = \\\\Omega^2 R + 2 \\\\Omega \\\\omega_r R + \\\\omega_r^2 R - \\\\Omega^2 R  & = 2 \\\\Omega \\\\omega_r R + \\\\omega_r^2 R  & = 2 \\\\Omega u + \\\\frac{u^2}{R}  \\\\end{align} It can readily be seen that the formula above for motion along the equator follows from the more general equation below for any latitude where along the equator v = 0.0 and \\\\cos\\\\phi = 1.0 : a_r = 2 \\\\Omega u \\\\cos\\\\phi + \\\\frac{u^2 + v^2}{R} The second term represents the required centripetal acceleration for the airship to follow the curvature of the earth. It is independent of both the Earth's rotation and the direction of motion. For example, when an aeroplane carrying gravimetric reading instruments cruises over one of the poles at constant altitude, the aeroplane's trajectory follows the curvature of the earth. The first term in the formula is zero then, due to the cosine of the angle being zero, and the second term then represents the centripetal acceleration to follow the curvature of the Earth's surface. = Explanation of the cosine in the first term = The force of gravity and the normal force. The resultant force acts as the required centripetal force. The mathematical derivation for the E√∂tv√∂s effect for motion along the Equator explains the factor 2 in the first term of the E√∂tv√∂s correction formula. What remains to be explained is the cosine factor. Because of its rotation, the Earth is not spherical in shape, there is an Equatorial bulge. The force of gravity is directed towards the center of the Earth. The normal force is perpendicular to the local surface. On the poles and on the equator the force of gravity and the normal force are exactly in opposite direction. At every other latitude the two are not exactly opposite, so there is a resultant force, that acts towards the Earth's axis. At every latitude there is precisely the amount of centripetal force that is necessary to maintain an even thickness of the atmospheric layer. (The solid Earth is ductile. Whenever the shape of the solid Earth is not entirely in equilibrium with its rate of rotation, then the shear stress deforms the solid Earth over a period of millions of years until the shear stress is resolved.) Again the example of an airship is convenient for discussing the forces that are at work. When the airship has a velocity relative to the Earth in latitudinal direction then the weight of the airship is not the same as when the airship is stationary with respect to the Earth. If an airship has an eastward velocity, then the airship is in a sense \\"speeding\\". The situation is comparable to a racecar on a banked circuit with an extremely slippery road surface. If the racecar is going too fast then the car will drift wide. For an airship in flight that means a reduction of the weight, compared to the weight when stationary with respect to the Earth. If the airship has a westward velocity then the situation is like that of a racecar on a banked circuit going too slow: on a slippery surface the car will slump down. For an airship that means an increase of the weight. The first term of the E√∂tv√∂s effect is proportional to the component of the required centripetal force perpendicular to the local Earth surface, and is thus described by a cosine law: the closer to the Equator, the stronger the effect.  Motion along 60 degrees latitude  The E√∂tv√∂s effect for an object moving eastward along 60 degrees latitude. The object tends to move away from the Earth's axis. The E√∂tv√∂s effect for an object moving westward along 60 degrees latitude. The object tends to be pulled towards the Earth's axis. The same gravimeter is used again, its internal weight has a mass of 10,000 grams. Calculating the weight reduction when stationary with respect to the Earth: An object located at 60 degrees latitude, co-moving with the Earth, is following a circular trajectory, with a radius of about 3190 kilometer, and a velocity of about 233 m/s. That circular trajectory requires a centripetal force of about 0.017 newton for every kilogram of mass; 0.17 newton for the 10,000 gram internal weight. At 60 degrees latitude, the component that is perpendicular to the local surface (the local vertical) is half the total force. Hence, at 60 degrees latitude, any object co-moving with the Earth has its weight reduced by about 0.08 percent, thanks to the Earth's rotation. Calculating the E√∂tv√∂s effect: When the airship is cruising at 25 m/s towards the east the total velocity becomes 233 \\\\+ 25 = 258 m/s, which requires a centripetal force of about 0.208 newton; local vertical component about 0.104 newton. Cruising at 25 m/s towards the west the total velocity becomes 233 ‚àí 25 = 208 m/s, which requires a centripetal force of about 0.135 newton; local vertical component about 0.068 newton. Hence at 60 degrees latitude the difference before and after the U-turn of the 10,000 gram internal weight is a difference of 4 grams in measured weight. (Popularly spoken as the weight is a force being measured in newtons, not in grams.) The diagrams also show the component in the direction parallel to the local surface. In meteorology and in oceanography, it is customary to refer to the effects of the component parallel to the local surface as the Coriolis effect.

Ake (pronounced AH-kay) was considered \\"one of Africa's foremost political philosophers.\\" He specialised in political economy, political theory, and development studies and is well known for his research on development and democracy in Africa. He was professor of political economy and dean of the University of Port Harcourt's Faculty of Social Sciences for some years in the 1970s and 1980s after having taught at Columbia University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1966. He held various academic positions at institutions around the world, including at Yale University (United States), University of Nairobi (Kenya), University of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) and University of Port Harcourt (Nigeria). He was active in Nigerian politics, a critic of corruption and authoritarian rule in Africa. His permanent home was in Port Harcourt.  Academic career  Before becoming a dean at Port Harcourt, he taught at universities in Canada, Kenya and Tanzania. Afterward, he held a variety of posts, at the African Journal of Political Economy, on the Social Sciences Council of Nigeria, and elsewhere. At Yale, he taught two political science courses‚Äîone, called State in Africa, which was for undergraduates and graduate students, and another for undergraduates, about aspects of development and the state in Africa. While teaching at Yale he lived in temporary quarters on the Yale campus. He wrote in 1985, in an essay on the African state: \\"Power is everything, and those who control the coercive resources use it freely to promote their interests.\\" George Bond, the director of the Institute of African Studies at Columbia University's School of International Public Affairs, said: \\"He was one of the pre-eminent scholars on African politics and a scholar-activist concerned with the development of Africa. His concern was primarily with the average African and how to improve the nature of his conditions.\\" David E. Apter of Yale said of Ake: \\"In the very short time he was here, he developed a following among the students, both graduate and undergraduate, which was truly extraordinary. There were graduate students who wept at his death. Everyone was really shocked. It was an amazing testimonial to the man.\\" Apter said that Ake had \\"crackling intelligence and an outspokenly severe view of African politics and nevertheless, underneath that, a quality of understanding which was remarkably subtle and complex. But he was able to communicate the complexity in a straightforward manner.\\" He added that Ake \\"was not only, in my view, the top African political scientist, but an extraordinarily courageous person. The Nigerian Government was often at odds with him, and nevertheless, they recognized his stature.\\"  Later life, and death  On November 16, 1995 Ake resigned from the Steering Committee of the Niger Delta Environmental Survey. He did so to protest the execution of a minority rights activist, Ken Saro- Wiwa. Ake was a critic of Shell and the oil industry. He is quoted as saying, \\"In Nigeria, companies like Shell are struggling between greed and fear.\\" In 1991 Ake founded and became the director of the Center for Advanced Social Science, headquartered in Port Harcourt. The center is a think-tank for social and environmental research. It also played a practical role, functioning in the early 1990s as an honest broker concerning oil revenues and environmental issues between local officials and representatives of several minority groups in the oil-producing area in southeastern Nigeria. Other tasks set for it were to apply scientific knowledge to actual developmental problems in Africa and to enable Africa to become more of a producer of knowledge. When the center was founded, its sole supporter was the Ford Foundation. It is now supported by the Ford Foundation and other donors in the United States and elsewhere. Mora McLean, a former Ford Foundation staff member who is now the president of the Manhattan-based African-American Institute, said that.\\" Ake was one of 142 people killed when flight 86 between Port Harcourt and Lagos in Nigeria crashed. The plane was operated by a local airline, Aviation Development Company (ADC Airlines). His death was widely believed to have been orchestrated by the then military junta of Gen. Sani Abacha, of whom Ake was an uncompromising critic. This is in addition to the fact that Ake was a mentor to the slain author, Ken Saro-Wiwa and a brain behind the Ogoni agitations against exploitation. His survivors included his wife, Anita, and three sons: Mela, Ibra Ake & Brieri. His son Ibra Ake is a Grammy Award winner and renowned creative director, most popular for directing the video Childish Gambino by Donald Glover.

It is one of the largest Conservative Synagogues in Canada, with approximately 1,800 member families. History Adath Israel was founded in 1903 by Jewish immigrants from Romania as the First Roumanian Hebrew Congregation Adath Israel. Known as the \\"Roumainshe Shul\\", the synagogue started when new immigrants from Roumania gathered together in a rental space, eventually moving to its first permanent home on Centre Avenue. In 1911, the synagogue dedicated a new building on Bathurst Street near Dundas, where for 30 years the congregation grew under the leadership of Rabbi Abraham Kelman. In 1947, Rabbi Erwin Schild, newly ordained by the Yeshivah Torath Chaim of Toronto, became the new rabbi of the Congregation. The next few years at the synagogue were marked by tremendous growth in membership and activities to the point where, coupled with the shifting demographics of the Jewish community, a new building was constructed in its current location in North York. The formal name was shortened in the 1950s, and in 1957 the new building was officially dedicated. Religious affiliation Adath Israel, like the majority of Conservative synagogues in the Toronto area (in contrast to most American Conservative synagogues), has not adopted egalitarianism. In the mid-2000s, Adath Israel's Rabbi Steven Saltzman proposed the establishment of a Canadian \\"sovereignty association\\" within the Conservative movement that would support synagogues following traditionalist policies. Rabbi Saltzman's suggestion came on the heels of the Conservative biennial convention in Boston, where Rabbi Menachem Creditor of Sharon, Massachusetts, challenged the philosophy of halakhic pluralism‚Äîan approach affirmed by movement leaders‚Äîwhen he argued against continuing to permit non-egalitarian synagogues from being a part of the Conservative movement. In 2008, the congregation seceded from the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism and affiliated with the Canadian Council of Conservative Synagogues.

The branch was originally established in the First World War and disbanded after the signing of the Armistice. The branch was re-formed at the start of the Second World War. The new MI7, while less significant than its predecessor, acted as a necessary liaison link between the War Office and the Ministry of Information and Political Warfare Executive. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War, a subsection of the Directorate of Military Operations, MO5(h), was established with responsibility for press and cable censorship and the issuing of War Office communiques through the Press Bureau. Initially just two General Staff Officers (GSO2) were allocated to the subsection. It became immediately apparent that two men was insufficient for the task and within a fortnight the subsection was expanded to a senior General Staff Officer (GSO1) with eight assistant ‚Äòcensors‚Äô working under him. In February 1915, the Directorate of Special Intelligence was formed and consequently MO5(h) was upgraded and designated as the MO7 section. It was nominally under the command of Colonel Coleridge, the Military Assistant Director of the Press Bureau. As part of the War Office, MO7 was concerned with press publicity. It gave the first war correspondents permission to visit the Western Front in May 1915. Its duty was to ensure that the military authorities maintained control over the Press and correspondents' work. In January 1916, as part of a reorganisation of the Imperial General Staff, a new Directorate of Military Intelligence was created and MO7 became Military Intelligence Section 7. MI7 was organised in a series of sub-sections distinguished by lower-case letters in brackets. The precise duties of these sub-sections varied with time, but may be roughly summarised as follows.See history of subsection (b) in a PDF file here. *MI7 (a) - censorship. *MI7 (b) - foreign and domestic propaganda, including press releases concerning army matters. *MI7 (c) - translation and (from 1917) regulation of foreign visitors. *MI7 (d) - foreign press propaganda and review (part of subsection (b) until subsection (d) was formed in late 1916). A.A. Milne, the author of Winnie the Pooh, served in MI7(b) after recovering from wounds sustained at the Battle of the Somme. =Location= De Keyser's Royal Hotel, later Adastral House and MI7(b)'s headquarters. From April 1916, when it was first established under the direction of Captain Peter Chalmers Mitchell, until early October 1917, most of MI7(b)'s staff worked from Adelphi Court, on the Strand, London, whereupon the whole section moved into Adastral House on the Victoria Embankment. Not to be confused with the later Air Ministry headquarters on Kingsway, the first Adastral House was the former De Keyser's Royal Hotel, located by Blackfriars Bridge. The bankrupt hotel was requisitioned in May 1916 for use as Government offices and was utilised by both the Royal Flying Corps and MI7. =Surviving source documents= As a branch of military intelligence, paperwork was routinely destroyed to maintain strict security. A further large-scale destruction of papers was organised when MI7 was closed down at the end of WWI. A few important files are scattered amongst War Office, Foreign Office and Ministry of Information records at the British National Archives. Also, some documents from MI7(b) have survived because they were retained by one of its operatives, Lieutenant James Price Lloyd. In 2012, relatives discovered after his death, when his property in Builth Wells, Wales was being sorted and cleared, that he had kept up to 150 files from his time at MI7(b). The archive consisted of two broad categories of articles written between 1917 and 1918 - the \\"Tales of the VC\\". More than 90 stories of individual heroism by men from all over the Empire can be viewed on the National Library of Wales website and on the Europeana 1914-18 website. Samples of the remaining 60 articles can be found in archives such as \\"MI7b-the discovery of a lost propaganda archive from the Great War\\". Second World War In September 1939, MI7 was reformed at the outset of the Second World War as the largely civilian Press and Propaganda section of the War Office Directorate of Military Intelligence. It was transferred to the Ministry of Information in around June 1940. The Anglo-Irish fantasy writer Lord Dunsany served in MI7(b) during the early months of WW2 and was based at the Air Ministry building Adastral House (now known as No 1 Kingsway). In fiction The name MI7 has often been used in fiction as the title for an intelligence agency or organisation similar to the actual MI5 or MI6. In the Bond film Dr. No (1962) there are two explicit references to James Bond working for MI6; strangely, one of these (where the words are spoken by 'M') has been dubbed to \\"MI7\\", although the speaker's lips clearly say \\"MI6\\". In the Operation Susie episode of The Professionals, central organization CI5 comes into conflict with elements of MI7 working to a different agenda. Rowan Atkinson's character of Johnny English from the spy spoof films Johnny English, Johnny English Reborn and Johnny English Strikes Again is an MI7 agent. The character was originally presented in a series of adverts for Barclaycard as MI7 agent Richard Latham. In St Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold, former Head Girl Kelly Jones now works as an agent for MI7. Contemporary There was public speculation in 2015 that Stephen Jolly, the UK's then Director of Defence Communications, an Under-Secretary of State or 2* official, at the Ministry of Defence, might be seeking to revive MI7. Jolly was making waves in military circles at the time by driving forward a \\"full spectrum\\" approach to Defence communications, encompassing public relations, media operations, information operations and psyops. Defence commentators dubbed this \\"post-Afghan reset\\" of communications the \\"Rainbow in the Dark\\" doctrine. It was an approach that entailed the most radical shake-up in British Defence communications in more than thirty years. Jolly was also instrumental in the creation of the Forster Review that led to reform of the D-Notice Committee in the same year. This unique combination of responsibilities positioned Jolly in the eyes of conspiracy theorists as an inheritor of the traditions of MI7.History of M.I.7(b) (March, 1916 - December,1918) https://www.psywar.org/psywar/reproductions/MI7b.pdfRed Tape, White Lies https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-20949,00.htmlAA Milne may not have liked MI7, but propaganda played a vital wartime role https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/britain-at-war/10017954/AA-Milne-may-not- have-liked-MI7-but-propaganda-played-a-vital-wartime-role.html Notes References * Category:Defunct United Kingdom intelligence agencies Category:1916 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Military communications of the United Kingdom Category:War Office in World War II Category:British intelligence services of World War II ","title":"MI7"},{"id":"3690737","text":"Derby Owners Club (DOC) is a horse racing simulation arcade game made by Sega- AM3. The format of the game is a player uses one of several consoles (called satellites) at the arcade to train horses, and then races them against 11 other computer AI horses or any number of other players (up to between 3 and 11 others, depending on location and format used) on tracks and G-1 races. Gameplay Each player acts as owner, trainer, and jockey at each console. Players then can train their horses to improve in the horses abilities (Start, Corner, Competing, Out of Box, Tenacious, and Spurt) through the use of pre- purchased memory cards, breeding via the console, or retired dam and sire cards, in order for you to breed your own retired horses you will have to race them twenty times, then you will have the option of retiring them or to continue their career. These improvements can be augmented by foods rewarded by how the person plays the training segment. The horse is then matched up with other horses in the races and the player can now race the horse, with the use of either whipping or hold buttons. Depending on where the horses finish, they are awarded a purse. Back at the stables, the owner must now gauge the horse's personality after the race. The horse either gains or suffers hearts through the owner's actions. Given the nature of the game, many websites and players have developed large amounts of media dedicated to the breeding, training, and racing of horses. Much of it focuses on the Whip Points, where if players whip at the right times according to their horses ability and personality, they can take advantage of the race and win. If a horse is a front-runner the player must whip fiercely at the beginning of the race to ensure a good lead, a spurt horse is good for the end of the race so the player must save most of the whipping power for the end. Successful racers have also spent a large portion of time looking into the different breeding lines. There are rare times in the game where you will get a special horse, this does not mean they will necessarily run faster or have better stamina or necessarily be glitches, they will just have special markings, okapi, zebra, panda, and more. Game list =Derby Owners Club 2000= Derby Owners Club 2000 (DOC2000) was released into Asian markets in 2000. The game used Japanese and Hong Kong racetracks (e.g. SEGA racetrack in DOC is loosely based on the Sha Tin racetrack in Hong Kong) plus Grade 1 (G-1) races at both countries (with Japan gaining most of them). Initially, the game proved so popular that players sometimes ended up sitting at the satellites for up to 8 hours and businesses had to create a reservation system and lounges for players to wait in. The success of the game ended up allowing Sega to release the DOC World Edition (DOCWE), using the DOC2000 hardware and software. =Derby Owners Club World Edition= The English port of the DOC2000 game released in 2001. Most of the software was rewritten in English and certain races were also Americanized (the Yushun Himba (Japanese Oaks) and the Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby) were renamed American Oaks and American Derby respectively). However, many of the races still hark back to the Japanese G-1 races (the Japan Cup Dirt, the Japan Cup, the Mile Championship and the Sprinters Stakes are notable examples).

He played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1907‚Äì1913), Pittsburgh Pirates (1914), Pittsburgh Rebels of the Federal League (1915), Boston Braves (1916‚Äì1918), Brooklyn Robins (1919‚Äì1921), and Philadelphia Phillies (1921). He batted and threw right-handed. Baseball career Konetchy was born in La Crosse, Wisconsin. In his youth, he would play ball in the sandlots of La Crosse. For at least some time he attended Lincoln Middle School. He played for the La Crosse Blackhawks of the Class-D Wisconsin State League. The team played at a park in what is now the 23rd and 24th Street Historic Neighborhood at the current site of Heeter's Car Care. While he was considered an above-average hitter (he batted over .300 four times) he was more known around the league for his supreme consistency, his never-faltering speed, and his high degree of defensive skill at first base. Konetchy made his Major League debut with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1907, and went on to acquire 25 stolen bases in , hit .302 in , and pick up 88 RBIs in . He also had a 20-game hitting streak in 1910. In 1911, with the Cards only three games out of first place in early July, the team was involved in a train crash on its way from Philadelphia to Boston. 47 passengers were injured, while twelve died. None of the Cardinals were seriously injured, due to a pre-trip change in the location of their car to the rear of the train. Konetchy and Cards manager Roger Bresnahan led the rescue effort, carrying many passengers to safety, some of whom may have died. Despite posting their first winning season since 1901, the Cardinals never recovered from the incident, finishing a distant fifth; but Konetchy led the NL with 38 doubles, and his own team with six home runs and 88 RBIs. He led the Cardinals in hits in 1909, 1910, 1911, and 1912. When Konetchy moved to the Pirates in 1914, he had a below-average season, followed by an above- average one in the same city, but on a different team in a different league. Playing for Pittsburgh of the Federal League, he tied his career high with a .314 average, with 10 home runs and 93 RBIs. Soon, he was back in the National League, and he was picking up hits in droves. In with Brooklyn, Konetchy got his only shot at postseason play during his career, although Brooklyn (93-61) lost the World Series in seven games to the 98‚Äì56 Cleveland Indians. In the Series, Konetchy picked up four hits in 23 at bats, a .174 average. However, he did have 2 RBIs in the Series, and three walks. By the end of 1920, he had surpassed 2000 career hits and was quite high on the all-time leaderboard (into the top 25). His final season was spent in Brooklyn and then Philadelphia, when the Phillies selected him off waivers on July 4, 1921. Konetchy's major league career ended there. Besides playing first base, he had tried out pitching, having thrown in 3 games. One of them, at Chicago in 1918, was a fairly bad start in which he pitched a complete game and allowed 8 runs (6 earned). This is believed to be the last instance of a non-pitcher pitching even the first two innings of a game: Alvin Dark and C√©sar Tovar pitched a first inning, once each. His two relief appearances were more successful: in one, he went 4 and 2/3 innings and gave up no runs on one hit to get the win. In 2085 games, he batted a solid .281 with 74 home runs and 992 RBIs. He had 2150 career hits in 7649 at bats. Konetchy also picked up 255 career stolen bases. He ended with a total of 344 doubles, and after having reached doubles figures in triples ten times, retired with 182, tying him for the 11th highest total in history. He finished his career with a .990 fielding percentage. After leaving the majors, he played with Fort Worth of the Texas League from through , batting .345 with 41 home runs in . After retiring, he went into business with pitching star Joe Pate. He died in Fort Worth, Texas at the age of 61. The cause was heart disease. He was posthumously inducted into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1961. His interment was located at Fort Worth's cemetery Greenwood Memorial Park.

R. R. Tolkien's fantasy world of Middle-earth include the seven listed in Appendix F of The Lord of the Rings: Elves, Men, Dwarves, Hobbits, Ents, Orcs and Trolls, as well as various spirits, the Valar and Maiar. Other beings of Middle-earth are of unclear nature such as Tom Bombadil and his wife Goldberry. Ainur The Ainur were angelic spirits created by Eru Il√∫vatar at the Beginning. The Ainur who subsequently entered the physical world of Middle-earth were the Valar (\\"powers\\"), though that term came to refer primarily to the mightiest among them.The Silmarillion, \\"Ainulindale\\" Lesser spirits were called the Maiar. Most of the Valar and Maiar withdrew from Middle-earth to the Undying Lands of Valinor, though some of the Maiar, such as the Wizards or Istari, Melian, the Balrogs, and the Dark Lord Sauron, assumed mortal forms to help or hinder the peoples of Middle-earth.The Silmarillion, \\"Valaquenta\\", \\"Of the Maiar\\" and \\"Of the Enemies\\" =Wizards= Wizards like Gandalf were Maiar but took the form of Men. The wizards of Middle-earth were Maiar: spirits of the same order as the Valar, but lesser in power. Outwardly resembling Men but possessing much greater physical and mental power, they were called Istari (Quenya for \\"Wise Ones\\") by the Elves.Essay on \\"The Istari\\" in Unfinished Tales. They were sent by the Valar to assist the people of Middle-earth to contest Sauron. The first three of these five wizards were known in the Mannish tongues of the Lord of the Rings series as Saruman \\"man of skill\\" (Rohirric), Gandalf \\"elf of the staff\\" (northern Men), and Radagast \\"tender of beasts\\" (possibly Westron). Tolkien never provided non-Elvish names for the other two; one tradition gives their names in Valinor as Alatar and Pallando, and another as Morinehtar and R√≥mest√°mo in Middle-earth.The History of Middle-earth, Vol. XII (The Peoples of Middle-earth), p. 384‚Äì385. Each wizard in the series had robes of a characteristic colour: white for Saruman (the chief and the most powerful of the five), grey for Gandalf, brown for Radagast,It has been suggested that his name is taken from the Slavic god Radegast. and sea-blue for Alatar and Pallando (known consequently as the Blue Wizards). Gandalf and Saruman play important roles in The Lord of the Rings, while Radagast appears only briefly, innocently helping Saruman to deceive Gandalf, who believes Radagast since he is honest, and fortuitously alerting Gwaihir to rescue Gandalf again. Alatar and Pallando do not feature in the story, as they are said to have journeyed far into the east after their arrival in Middle-earth. As the Istari were Maiar, each one served a Vala in some way. Saruman was the servant and helper of Aul√´, and so learned much in the art of craftsmanship, mechanics, and metal-working, as was seen in the later Third Age. Gandalf was the servant of Manw√´ or Varda, but was a lover of the Gardens of L√≥rien, and so knew much of the hopes and dreams of Men and Elves. Radagast, servant of Yavanna, loved the things of nature, both animals and plants. As each of these Istari learned from their Vala, so they acted in Middle-earth. =Balrogs= Demonic creatures of fire and shadow, Balrogs were fallen Maiar, loyal to the first Dark Lord, Morgoth. They participated in the wars of the First Age of Middle- earth but were mostly destroyed during the War of Wrath which ended the Age.The Silmarillion, \\"Valaquenta\\"The Silmarillion, \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\", Chapter 3 \\"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\\" By the Third Age, the only remaining Balrog was \\"Durin's Bane,\\" the Balrog of Moria, killed by Gandalf.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 5 \\"The Bridge of Khazad-d√ªm\\" Free peoples The Free Peoples of Middle-earth were the four races that had never fallen under the sway of the evil spirits Morgoth or Sauron: Elves, Men, Dwarves and Ents. Strictly speaking, among Men it was only the Men of the West who were Free People, particularly the descendants of the D√∫nedain of the Isle of N√∫menor, as most Men of the East and South of Middle- earth became servants of Morgoth and Sauron over the ages. The Ent Treebeard quotes lines from a traditional lay listing them The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, Book 3, Chapter IV 'Treebeard' > :First came the four, the free peoples :Eldest of all, the elf-children > :Dwarf the delver, dark are his houses :Ent the earthborn, old as mountains > :Man the mortal, master of horses After encountering the hobbits Merry and Pippin, he consents that hobbits are a fifth free people, adding a fifth line, \\"Half-grown hobbits, the hole- dwellers\\". =Dwarves= The race of Dwarves preferred to live in mountains and caves, settling in places such as Erebor (the Lonely Mountain), the Iron Hills, the Blue Mountains, and Moria (Khazad-d√ªm) in the Misty Mountains. Aul√´ the Smith created Dwarves; he also invented the Dwarven language, known as Khuzdul. Dwarves mined and worked precious metals throughout the mountains of Middle-earth. The seven different groups of Dwarf-folk originated in the locations where the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves first awoke before the First Age. =Elves= The Elves, or Firstborn, were the first of Eru's Children to awaken. Born under the stars before the ascension of the Moon and the Sun, they retain a special love for light and an inner spirit endowed with unique gifts. They call themselves the Quendi, or \\"Speakers\\", for they were the first to utter words; and, even now, no race understands language and song like the Firstborn. Fair and fine featured, brilliant and proud, immortal and strong, tall and agile, they are the most blessed of the Free Peoples. They can see as well under moon or starlight as a man at the height of day. They cannot become sick or scarred, but if an Elf should die, from violence or losing the will to live from grief, their spirit goes to the halls of Mandos, and as they are bound to Arda and cannot leave until the world is broken and remade. Elven skill and agility is legendary: for instance, walking atop freshly fallen snow without leaving a trace of their passing. On a clear day they can see ten miles with perfect clarity and detail up to 100 miles. These gifts come at great cost, though: they are strongly bound to Fate (see Mandos) and hated by Morgoth. No other race has been blessed and cursed more than the Quendi. The Quendi were sundered after the awakening and many sub-groups appeared. The First Sundering occurred when some left Middle-earth to live in the blessed realm of Valinor, while others stayed behind. This produced the Eldar, who accepted the call to come to Valinor, and the Avari who refused the great journey. Elves who stayed in Middle-earth and never saw the light of the trees became known as the Moriquendi or \\"Dark-elves\\". This did not imply that the Dark-elves were evil, they just never saw the light of the trees. On the journey to Valinor, some of the Teleri (\\"Those who tarried\\") abandoned the main group and those of them who did not mingle with the Moriquendi became the Laiquendi (Green-elves), the Sindar (Grey-elves) and the Nandor. These elves of the great journey who remained in Middle-earth were then called the √ömanyar (The Unwilling). The Eldar who reached Valinor were eventually divided into three distinct groups: Vanyar, Noldor and Teleri. These three groups became known as the Calaquendi or \\"Light-elves\\" because they beheld the light of the Two Trees of Valinor. Later some of the Noldor went back to Middle-earth in their quest for the Silmarils, while the Vanyar remained in Valinor. The Silvan Elves, of Nandor and Avari descent, inhabited Mirkwood and Lothl√≥rien. =Men= During the time of The Lord of the Rings, Men in Middle-earth were located in many places, with the largest group of free men in the countries of Gondor and Rohan. When the island of N√∫menor fell, only the Faithful escaped and founded the twin kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor. The Faithful were known in Middle-earth as the D√∫nedain, and as leaders of these kingdoms, they were able to lead the resistance to Sauron, and preserve the Men of the West as Free People. There were also free men at the village of Bree, at Esgaroth, in Dr√∫adan Forest (home to \\"wild men\\" known as Dr√∫edain or Woses), and in the icy regions of Forochel. Those who served evil powers, such as the men of Dunland, Rh√ªn, Harad, and Umbar, were not considered free men. Men bear the so-called Gift of Men, mortality. The descendants of the D√∫nedain include the Rangers of the North and the Rangers of Ithilien. Dr√∫edain The Dr√∫edain, one of the earliest varieties of men, lived in small numbers, often in tribes. They were little folk, shorter than dwarves, yet taller than hobbits. They were known for their voodoo-like magic, their black eyes (which glow red when they are angry), and their ability to sit for hours and days on end without moving or blinking. They grew little hair, except that on their heads and sometimes small tufts on their chins. They were short and stout, and other men tended to dislike them due to their harsh, rough voices. Their laughter, however, was full of mirth. It is said that their skill of stonework rivaled the Dwarves'. The Drughu were not evil. They were mortal enemies of orcs, defending the homes of their human neighbors with their own lives and with the aid of their magical Watch-Stones. The Elves of Beleriand developed a special fondness for them and valued their skill at fighting orcs. The Return of the King, Book 5, ch. 5, \\"The Ride of the Rohirrim\\". =Ents= Ents were an ancient race of tree-like creatures, having become like the trees that they shepherd. They were created by Yavanna and given life by Il√∫vatar. By the Third Age, they were a dwindling race, having long ago lost their mates, the Entwives.The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 4: \\"Treebeard\\".The Return of the King, book 6, ch. 6 \\"Many Partings\\" Huorns Close kin of the Ents, Huorns were animated trees that possessed sentience. They were said to have voices but could only be understood by the Ents, not by the other peoples of Middle-earth. It is unclear if Huorns were simply trees that became aware or Ents that became more \\"treeish\\" over time (both varieties were thought to exist). Huorns were found in Fangorn Forest and possibly the Old Forest near Buckland. Legolas mentions that the Elves helped to wake up the trees. The Huorns decided the Battle of Helm's Deep, destroying Saruman's army of Orcs.The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 7 \\"Helm's Deep\\" =Hobbits= Hobbits are a race of Middle-earth, also known as 'halflings' on account of their short stature, roughly half the size of men. They are characterized by curly hair on their heads and leathery feet that have furry insteps, for which they did not wear shoes. Many hobbits live in the Shire as well as Bree, and they once lived in the vales of the Anduin. They are fond of an unadventurous life of farming, eating, and socializing. There were three types of Hobbits: The Harfoots were the most numerous. The Stoors had an affinity for water, boats and swimming; the Fallohides were an adventurous people. The origin of hobbits is unclear, but of all the races they have the closest affinity to men, and in the Prologue to The Lord of the Rings Tolkien calls them relatives of men.The Fellowship of the Ring, Prologue. Enslaved peoples Enslaved peoples were those races that had fallen under the sway of the evil spirits Morgoth and Sauron, also known by the Free Peoples as 'Servants of the Enemy'. They included Orcs, Trolls and Men. The origin of Orcs and Trolls is unclear, but they were races that were taken by Morgoth and corrupted through sorcery into their final evil nature and appearance. Men were rarely corrupted by Morgoth or Sauron in the same way. Rather, their hearts and minds were corrupted by power and evil impulses, while they retained the physical appearance of men. Prolonged service to Sauron however, did turn the bearers of the Rings of Power from Men into the wraith-like Nazg√ªl. Those men who were the servants of Morgoth or Sauron were mostly from the east and south of Middle-earth. =Men= Not all Men were on the side of good; the Men who lived in the east and south were under Sauron's dominion. They included the Haradrim or Southrons and the Black N√∫men√≥reans (and later the Corsairs of Umbar) who pledged their allegiance to Mordor, and many different Easterling peoples, such as the Balchoth, the Wainriders, and the Men of Khand, who attacked Gondor and Rohan on numerous occasions. The Men of Dunland served as agents to the traitorous wizard Saruman. In the First Age, some Easterlings were under Morgoth's dominion. Ringwraiths The Ringwraiths (also known as Nazg√ªl or Black Riders) were once great Men until they were given Rings of Power by Sauron. These gradually corrupted them until they became slaves of the Dark Lord's will. Clad in dark hooded cloaks and riding demonic steeds or flying \\"fell beasts,\\" the Ringwraiths forever hunted for the One Ring to bring it back to their master.The Silmarillion, \\"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\\"The Silmarillion, \\"The Akallab√™th\\"Unfinished Tales, 4. \\"The Hunt for the Ring\\" i. \\"Of the Journey of the Black Riders\\" The Dead Also known as ghosts or shades, they were spirits of Men unable to pass on to the afterlife. Spirits haunted various regions of Middle- earth, most notably the Dead Marshes and the Paths of the Dead, which were guarded by the Dead Men of Dunharrow. =Orcs= Orcs were a race first bred by Morgoth, which mostly lived in mountain caves and disliked sunlight. Many of them lived in the Misty Mountains while others lived in Mordor. They are also known as goblins. The Orcs were not created, since \\"evil cannot create, only corrupt\\" in Tolkien's philosophical perspective. One version of their origin, widely known in part due to its use in Peter Jackson's films, postulates that they were Elves who were corrupted and whose appearance was changed over time. However, Tolkien also wrote other accounts of their origin.The Silmarillion, \\"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\\" Sauron and Saruman the wizard bred an unusually large and powerful type of orc, the Uruk-hai. Although most orcs did not like the sun and could not bear to be in it, the Uruk-hai could stand daylight.The Two Towers, \\"The Riders of Rohan\\" Deformed Half-orcs also existed, crossbred from Men and Orcs.The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 9 \\"Flotsam and Jetsam\\" Tolkien uses the term \\"Goblin\\" mainly interchangeably with Orc, though sometimes in The Hobbit for the smaller sub-races of Orcs native to the Misty Mountains. =Trolls= Trolls were said to have been created by Morgoth \\"in mockery of\\" the Ents. They disliked the sun, and some types turned to stone if exposed to sunlight. Trolls dwelt in the Misty Mountains as well as in Mordor. Sauron bred the Olog-hai, large, clever, and resistant to the sun.The Return of the King Appendix F \\"Of Other Races\\"The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 5 \\"The Bridge of Khazad-d√ªm\\"The Return of the King, book 5, ch. 4 \\"The Siege of Gondor\\"The Return of the King, book 5, ch. 10, \\"The Black Gate Opens\\" =Barrow-wights= Barrow-wights (from Middle English wight, a man) were dark spirits sent by the Witch-king of Angmar to possess and animate the bodies and bones of the former kings of the D√∫nedain. These undead monsters haunted the Barrow-downs near Bree.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 1, ch. 8 \\"Fog on the Barrow-downs\\" Other beings =Tom Bombadil= Tom Bombadil does not belong to any of the peoples of Middle-earth; Tolkien calls him the spirit of the countryside.Letters, #19 to Stanley Unwin, 16 December 1937 Unlike the other races, he is seemingly unaffected by the One Ring and appears to predate the Children of Il√∫vatar (Elves and Men). As to the nature of Bombadil, Tolkien himself said that some things should remain mysterious in any mythology, \\"especially if an explanation actually exists.\\"Letters, #144 to Naomi Mitchison, 25 April 1954The Fellowship of the Ring book 1, ch. 6, \\"The Old Forest\\"The Fellowship of the Ring book 1, ch. 7, \\"In the House of Tom Bombadil\\" Tom is also known as \\"The First\\", \\"Master Tom\\", \\"Old Tom\\", \\"Iarwain Ben-adar\\" (a Sindarin name meaning \\"The Oldest without a father\\"). The Noldor call him \\"Orald\\" meaning \\"Very Old\\", Dwarves call him \\"Forn\\" (meaning: The Ancient). =River-spirits= Spirits of nature tied to rivers and waterways. Only two are mentioned by Tolkien: Goldberry, the wife of Tom Bombadil, and her mother the River-woman. It is unknown whether these beings were unique, part of a larger race, or a form of Maiar. =Giants= Giants other than Ents are referred to only a few times by Tolkien. Stone-giants of the Misty Mountains are said to lob stones at Thorin and Company in The Hobbit.The Hobbit, \\"Over Hill and Under Hill\\" =Dragons= Smaug in fan art Dragons are already present in The Book of Lost Tales. Tolkien had been fascinated with dragons since childhood.J. R. R. Tolkien (1947), On Fairy-Stories, Unwin Paperbacks (1975), p. 44; As well as \\"dragon\\", Tolkien used the terms drake (from Old English draca, in turn from Latin draco and Greek Œ¥œÅŒ¨Œ∫œâŒΩ), and worm (from Old English wyrm, \\"serpent\\", \\"dragon\\"). Tolkien named four dragons in his Middle-earth writings. Like the Old Norse dragon Fafnir, they are able to speak, and can be subtle of speech.Shippey's discussion is at ; it is summarized in Glaurung, in The Silmarillion, is the Father of Dragons in Tolkien's legendarium, the first of the Fire-drakes of Angband, and the main antagonist of The Children of H√∫rin, leading to the protagonist T√∫rin's suicide. The Silmarillion, \\"Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin\\" Ancalagon the Black (Sindarin: rushing jaws from anc 'jaw', alag 'impetuous') was the greatest of all dragons, bred by Morgoth during the First Age, as told in The Silmarillion. Scatha was a mighty \\"long-worm\\" of the Grey Mountains. He was killed by Fram in the early days of the √âoth√©od. Scatha's name was likely taken from Anglo-Saxon scea√∞a, \\"injurious person, criminal, thief, assassin\\".J. R. R. Tolkien (1967), Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings, in Wayne G. Hammond & Christina Scull (2005), The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion, Harper Collins, p. 762; After slaying Scatha, Fram's ownership of his recovered hoard was then disputed by the Dwarves of that region. Fram rebuked this claim, sending them instead Scatha's teeth, with the words, \\"Jewels such as these you will not match in your treasuries, for they are hard to come by.\\" This led to his death in a feud with the Dwarves. The √âoth√©od retained at least some of the hoard, and brought it south with them when they settled in Rohan. The silver horn that √âowyn gave to Merry Brandybuck after the War of the Ring, crucial in The Scouring of the Shire, came from this hoard. Smaug of Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, was killed by Bard in Dale, as told in The Hobbit. The Arkenstone was buried right in the pile he slept on, but Smaug never noticed it. Smaug had only a single weakness: there was a hole in his jewel-encrusted underbelly on his left breast area. Bilbo Baggins discovered this, which led to Smaug's death above Esgaroth.Tolkien, J. R. R. (1937), Douglas A. Anderson, ed., The Annotated Hobbit, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2002, Three extinct genera have been named, inspired by Tolkien's dragons. In 1977, an extinct genus of worms from the Cambrian Burgess Shale was named Ancalagon in 1980, an extinct genus of mammal was named Ankalagon, and in 2014, a new genus and species of gliding reptiles was named Glaurung.

Constructed from 1987 to 1988 by Prestige Properties, the shopping center is located between Bartow and Baychester Avenues, just outside Sections 4 and 5 of Co-op City, on an open lot that was the site of the Freedomland U.S.A. amusement park between 1960 and 1964. The Bay Plaza Shopping Center is the largest shopping center in New York City.

Expansion  The Mall at Bay Plaza is expansion project of Bay Plaza Shopping Center. The center encloses a fashion mall with stores like Macy's and over 100 specialty stores and food court as well as a 1,800-car parking garage. It opened on August 14, 2014. The Mall at Bay Plaza is the first enclosed anchored fashion mall opened in the New York City area in almost 40 years after Queens Center opened in 1973.

Life and works  David Geiser was an abstract expressionist painter, born in Rochester, New York in 1948. He studied at the University of Vermont, √âcole des Beaux-Arts, and the Art Students League. In 1969, he moved to San Francisco and began drawing underground comix and cavorting with other underground comic creators such as S. Clay Wilson. He created several underground comic titles in the early 1970s, included Saloon, Demented Pervert, Clowns, Uncle Sham, DTs, Pain, Sloppy Seconds, and Edge City. He moved into oil painting in the late 1970s. Geiser moved to New York City in the early 1980s, where he concentrated on oil painting while moving into abstract expressionism. Geiser's paintings are tactile and deep, often being composed of many layers of shellack, pitch, tar, rope and scrap wood. Geiser was married to actress Mercedes Ruehl and lived in the Hamptons with her and their son Jake. David Geiser died on October 14, 2020 at the age of 72.

It was equivalent to the pound sterling and was divided into 20 shillings, each of 12 pence. Ordinary UK coinage circulated. Apart from an old Bahamas penny coin struck in 1806, there were no special sterling coin issues such as were found in Jamaica. History In 1825, an imperial Order-in-Council was passed for the purposes of introducing the British coinage into all the British colonies. It wasn't immediately very effective due to unrealistic ratings, and it required a further Order-in-Council to be passed in 1838. By the middle of the nineteenth century, British coinage had replaced the Spanish dollar throughout all of the British West Indies. But it was only in the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Jamaica that the pound unit of account was used. In the Eastern Caribbean territories and in British Guiana, the dollar unit of account was retained in conjunction with the British coinage at a fixed rate of one dollar equal to four shillings and two pence. Unlike in Bermuda, the US dollar circulated freely alongside the British sterling coinage in the Bahamas. The pound was replaced by the dollar in 1966, at a rate of 7 shillings = 1 dollar (1 pound = 2.86 dollars). This rate meant that the new Bahamas dollar was at a slight discount to the US dollar. For a wider outline of the history of currency in the region, see currencies of the British West Indies. Coins The only coin issued was a 1 penny coin struck in 1806. British coins circulated on the islands until 1966. Banknotes The Bank of Nassau initially issued notes in denominations of 5 and 10 shillings, and 1 pound. 4 shilling notes were introduced in 1906. The bank failed in 1917, and the Bahamas government took over the issuance of banknotes on the islands. The Public Treasury issued 1 pound notes in 1868, followed by government notes in 1869 for 1 and 5 pounds. In 1919, a new series of 4 and 10 shillings, and 1 pound notes was introduced, with 5 pound notes reintroduced after 1936.

It shares the genus Arctocebus with the golden angwantibo (Arctocebus aureus). It is closely related to the potto (Perodicticus potto) and to the various lorises. The Calabar angwantibo lives in the rainforests of west Africa, particularly in tree-fall zones. In areas where the forest has been cleared, it has been known to live on farmland. Its range covers Cameroon, Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea. The species takes its name from the Nigerian city of Calabar. The Calabar angwantibo weighs between 266 and 465 grams. It has orangish-yellow fur on its back, grey or white fur on its belly, and a distinctive white line on its forehead and nose. Like other lorids, this angwantibo has a very short index finger, which allows it to get a strong grip on tree branches. The second toe on each foot has a specialised claw that the angwantibo uses for grooming. The Calabar angwantibo is the only primate to have a functioning nictitating membrane (third eyelid).Montagna, W., Machida, H., and Perkins, E. M. 1966. \\"The skin of primates XXXIII.: The skin of the angwantibo\\". American Journal of Physical Anthropology. Vol. 25, 277-290. The Calabar angwantibo is nocturnal and arboreal. It stays considerably lower in the trees than the other nocturnal strepsirrhines in its range, and is typically found between 5 and 15 metres above ground. It moves by climbing very slowly through the trees, always grasping branches with at least three of its limbs at a time. During the day the angwantibo sleeps under dense foliage, hanging from a branch. The Calabar angwantibo's diet consists mainly of insects, especially caterpillars, but it also eats some fruit. It will eat strong-smelling insects that other animals reject. Before eating a caterpillar, the angwantibo wipes it carefully with its hands to remove any poisonous barbs. When confronted by a predator, the Calabar angwantibo will roll up into a ball, but keep its mouth open beneath its armpit. If the attacker persists, the angwantibo will bite it and not let go. Calabar angwantibos forage for food alone, but each male's territory overlaps that of several females. Angwantibos reinforce social bonds through mutual grooming and scent-marking. Mating takes place only in the final phase of the female's estrous cycle, and is performed hanging upside-down from a branch. The female gives birth to a single infant after a gestation period of 131 to 136 days; the young are normally born between January and April. Infants are born with their eyes open and can cling to their mother's fur right away. In literature The Calabar angwantibo, along with its close relative the potto, makes an appearance in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey‚ÄìMaturin novels. Stephen Maturin acquires a Calabar angwantibo on his travels and becomes 'absurdly attached' to it. The search for an angwantibo is also a minor focus of Gerald Durrell's first book, The Overloaded Ark.

The first was built in the 13th century; this was approximately 30 metres high and built in the Romanesque style. This tower was destroyed by lightning. In the 15th century a second tower was built, approximately 45 metres high, but it also was devastated by lightning in a storm. The third and current tower was largely built between 1469 and 1482 from blocks of Bentheimer sandstone. The steeple was not finished until the mid-16th century. This tower was initially an estimated 102 metres high.E. O. van der Werff, Martini. Kerk en toren. Assen, 2003, p. 53; F. Westra, Martinitoren. Groningen, 2009, p. 29. According to an improbable myth, the tower would have been 127 m high Its architecture was influenced by the Dom Tower of Utrecht. The lighting of celebratory fires on the third gallery, after the departure of Spanish and Walloon troops in 1577, caused the tower to partially collapse. However, the remaining portion kept a height of 69 meters. In the 17th century the tower was repaired up to the current 97 metre height. Later the tower was damaged several times by natural violence and several wars. There is a bullet hole in one of the bells, a result of heavy fighting when the Canadian Forces liberated Groningen at the end of World War II.

At various times, the location was also known as Pickford‚ÄìFairbanks Studios, the United Artists Studio, Warner Hollywood Studios, and its name since 1999, The Lot. The site was acquired by Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks and dubbed Pickford‚ÄìFairbanks Studios in 1919. It was later renamed the United Artists Studio in 1928, as it was being used by several independent producers, including Samuel Goldwyn, that distributed through United Artists. Although Goldwyn did not control the deed for the land, he and Joseph Schenck built many of the facilities on the lot. Schenck left United Artists in 1935, leaving his share of the deed to Goldwyn, and Fairbanks died in 1939, leaving his share to Pickford. When Goldwyn left United Artists in 1940, he sought to rename the lot Samuel Goldwyn Studio. Pickford and Goldwyn fought over the name and ownership of the property until a court ordered that the lot be auctioned in 1955. James Mulvey, Goldwyn's most trusted business confidant and president of Samuel Goldwyn Inc., outbid Pickford for the property. The lot officially became Samuel Goldwyn Studio and remained so until Warner Brothers purchased the site in 1980, naming it Warner Hollywood Studios. Warner Bros. sold the property in 1999, and the name was officially changed to its longtime nickname, The Lot. Awards The studio was awarded with the Academy Award for Best Sound in 1968 for the film In the Heat of the Night.

Music  Born in New Jersey, Weber was a precocious musical talent, making her debut at age 12 with the orchestra at New York's Town Hall. She studied with a number of teachers and musicians, such as Cecile Genhart, Walter Hendel, Jos√© Ech√°niz, and Eugene List. Weber graduated summa cum laude from the Eastman School of Music, where she studied with C√©cile Genhart and Eugene List. Following graduation, she continued her studies in New York City with Nadia Reisenberg and was a fellowship student at Tanglewood for two summers. Weber has appeared with the American Composers Orchestra, Boston Civic Symphony, Boston Pops, Chautauqua Symphony, New Hampshire Symphony, Sarajevo Philharmonic, Sarasota Pops, and Syracuse Symphony. Her solo performances have been at the White House, Carnegie Hall, Wigmore Hall, Weill Hall, National Gallery of Art, Boston‚Äôs Symphony Hall, the 92nd Street Y, Merkin Hall, and the Newport Festival. Internationally, she has appeared in Yugoslavia, Turkey, and the Baltic States under the auspices of the US Information Service. At the invitation of the American Liszt Society, she presented recitals and master classes in China. Her interest in the uncommon avenues of the piano literature led to a world premiere recording of Liszt‚Äôs 1838 Transcendental Etudes. Time Magazine wrote, ‚ÄúLiszt later simplified these pieces into the still ferociously difficult Transcendental Etudes (1852 version) for fear that no one else could play them. There may now be several fire-eating piano virtuosos who can execute the original notes, but few can liberate the prophetic music they contain as masterfully as Janice Weber does here.‚Äù Her eclectic recordings include Rachmaninoff‚Äôs complete transcriptions (IMP); with the Lydian Quartet, Leo Ornstein‚Äôs vast Piano Quintet (New World Records); flute and piano works of Sigfrid Karg-Elert; and waltz transcriptions of Godowsky, Rosenthal, and Friedman (IMP). For VAI, Weber recorded Liszt‚Äôs last Hungarian Rhapsody, one of only two living pianists to be included in a compendium of historic performances by nineteen artists. This recording subsequently won the International Liszt Prize. Her recording of a number of Leo Ornstein‚Äôs piano works was released by Naxos in June 2002 to significant acclaim in both the American and European press. Weber is a member of the piano faculty at the Boston Conservatory and the Boston Conservatory Chamber Players. She is a contributor to the Musical Times (London), Clavier, and other music publications. She has been an adjudicator for the National Endowment for the Arts and has served on juries for the Gilmore Foundation, the American Piano Association, the Boston Amateur Pianists Competition, and the Hilton Head International Competition.  Words  Weber has a second career as a writer of fiction. Her first book, \\"The Secret Life of Eva Hathaway\\" was released in 1985. Weber's books are noted for their bawdy, dark humor and their female protagonists. The books have spanned different genres, from romantic comedy (\\"The Secret Life of Eva Hathaway\\") to a culinary murder mystery (\\"Devil's Food\\"). As a writer, Weber has perhaps received the most attention for her books about the Bond-esque female spy Leslie Frost, \\"Frost the Fiddler\\" and its sequel \\"Hot Ticket\\". Nearly all of her books contain, at some point, a reference to the world of classic music; in the Frost books, the music world is central to the plot. Frost the Fiddler (St. Martin‚Äôs Press) was chosen a Notable Book of the Year by the New York Times. She has written two screenplays and is currently at work on her sixth novel.

The club's main home venue is Manor Park, Horsford to the north of Norwich, although it has used other locations throughout the county. History Cricket may have reached Norfolk by the end of the 17th century. The earliest reference to cricket in the county is dated 1745. The first county match played by the team was Norfolk v Suffolk at Bury St Edmunds Race Course on Thursday 23 August 1764, which was won by Norfolk. This was reported in the Gazetteer & London Daily Advertiser on Tuesday 28 August. More games against Suffolk followed. A number of teams representing the county existed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The present club was founded on 14 October 1876 and played its first matches in 1877. The county joined the Minor Counties Championship when it was formed in 1895. It missed the 1896 season, and also did not compete in 1902 and 1903, but otherwise has remained at that level ever since. =Honours= Norfolk has won the Minor Counties Championship five times, two of them shared. It won the first Championship in 1895, sharing with Durham and Worcestershire. It won outright in 1905, 1910 and 1913. Its most recent success was a shared title with Herefordshire in 2002.

Biography Bland was born in England and entered Emmanuel College on February 26, 1613.The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Virginia Historical Society, page 220. In about 1635 he was transported to Virginia. He was elected a Burgess to represent Charles River county for 1639 to 1640 term. In 1642 Bland was granted 1,000 acres of land in the Deltaville area of Virginia. Bland Point is named after him.[Deltaville, Larry S. Chowning, page 11, 2014.] =Death= In the Spring of 1647 on June 10, Bland along with Francis Yeardley, the son of the former governor of Virginia George Yeardley, Dr. Edward Hall and current burgess Richard Eyers spent the night at the widow Sarah Gookin's estate. Francis Yeardley described the incident that took place the next morning at breakfast. He stated that they, \\"fedd hartily,\\" and recorded that they, \\"healthfully and cheerfully,\\" passed the morning. During the conversation Burgess Richard Eyers and Bland realized that they were related. They drank alcoholic beverages freely and after breakfast Yeardley, Dr. Hall, Bland and Eyers decided to set out for Eyers' plantation by foot. Although Yeardley suggested to wait until the heat of the day had subsided Bland decided not to heed the warning and set briskly for the plantation. Eyers quickly realized that he did not know how to get there and asked Edward Windham for directions. Windham led them as far as Little Creek. A bit beyond there they saw Bland sleeping in the shade of Mrs. Gookin's \\"barne fort.\\" Bland asked Eyers to wait with him for he needed to rest and suggested that the others continue.

New tactics were developed for the big-gun Dreadnought battleships. The mine, torpedo, submarine and aircraft posed new threats, each of which had to be countered, leading to tactical developments such as anti-submarine warfare and the use of dazzle camouflage. By the end of the steam age, aircraft carriers had replaced battleships as the principal unit of the fleet. The development of tactics in the 19th Century The interval of ninety years between the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 was marked by no major naval war. There was fighting at sea, and there were prolonged blockades, but there were no campaigns between large and well-appointed navies. During this period an entire revolution took place in the means of propulsion, armament and construction of ships. Steam was applied to warships, at first as an auxiliary force, in the second quarter of the 19th century. The Crimean War gave a great stimulus to the development of the guns. It also brought about the application of iron to ships as armour-plate. Very soon metal was adopted as the material out of which ships were made. The extended use of shells, by immensely increasing the danger of fire, rendered wood so inflammable that it was too dangerous for employment in a warship. Changes so sweeping as these could not take place without affecting all the established ideas as to propulsion, armament and construction. =Revival of ramming= Steam allowed the ship herself to be used as a projectile. Many thought that the use of the ram would again become common and the sinking of Re d'Italia by the Austrian Erzherzog Ferdinand Max at the battle of Lissa in 1866 seemed to give force to this supposition. Accidental collisions such as those between the British warships Vanguard and Iron Duke, Victoria and Camperdown showed how fatal a wound could be given by the ram of a steam warship. But even the sinking of Re d'Italia was largely an accident, and steam-powered ramming turned out to be impractical. Between vessels both under full control, a collision was easily avoided where there was space to move. In a m√™l√©e, or pell-mell battle, opportunities would occur for the use of the ram, but the torpedo and the mine soon made it very dangerous for one fleet to rush at another. The torpedo may be said therefore to have excluded the pell-mell battle and the use of the ram except on rare occasions. Ramming as a tactic also invalidated the former need to concentrate guns on the broadside, which in any case was being made obsolete by the larger guns developed as a consequence of the Industrial Revolution and made necessary by the iron or steel armour now being used. Fewer of the large guns could be carried or mounted, and a wider arc of fire was required to compensate. Since ships would be required to fight \\"end-on\\" when attempting to ram (or to rush into a pell- mell battle), many ships were designed to give as much fire ahead (and sometimes astern) as on the broadside. This was usually at the expense of seaworthiness, and in many cases firing directly ahead caused blast damage to superstructure, decks and fittings. This was another factor which made ramming invalid as a tactic. Furthermore, a ship designed to have a ramming capability typically had a tumblehome hull design which would allow the ram to strike below the waterline. This design of hull is inherently slower than almost any other hull design, giving an additional disadvantage to ships employing rams. =Development of the torpedo= As the 19th century drew to a close, another element of uncertainty was introduced by the development of the torpedo. A weapon which is a floating and moving mine, capable up to a certain point of being directed on its course, invisible or very hard to trace, and able to deliver its blow beneath the water-line, was so complete a novelty that its action was hard to foresee. The new weapon scored its first success in the 1891 Chilean Civil War, when the old Congressional battleship \\"Blanco Encalada\\" was sunk at anchor by the Balmacedist torpedo gunboat \\"Almirante Lynch\\" in the Battle of Caldera Bay. The question arose whether the torpedo itself would not become the decisive weapon in naval warfare. It was undoubtedly capable of producing a great effect when its power could be fully exerted. A school arose, having its most convinced partisans in France, which argued that, as a small vessel could destroy a great battleship with a single torpedo, the first would drive the second off the sea. The battleship was to give place to the torpedo boat or torpedo-boat destroyer, which was itself only a torpedo boat of larger size. But the early torpedo was subject to some disadvantages. It could not be used with effect at more than 2,000 yards. Water resistance rendered its course uncertain and comparatively slow, so that a moving opponent could avoid it, which was comparatively easy given that most early torpedoes left behind a tell-tale trail of bubbles in their wake. Torpedo boats were small and could easily be sunk by gunfire. By night the risk from gunfire was less, but the invention of the searchlight made it possible to keep the waters round a ship under observation all night. From the torpedo sprang too the submarine, which aimed at striking below the surface, where it itself was, like its weapon, invisible, or nearly so. The Russo- Japanese War The Russo-Japanese War was the first test of the new concepts. The war was a stunning victory for Japan, opening with the blockade and gradual immobilization of the Russian Pacific Fleet at Port Arthur and culminating in the destruction of the Russian Baltic Fleet at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. =First use of torpedoes in battle= In the war between Russia and Japan the torpedo was at first used with success, but the injury it produced fell below expectations, even when allowance is made for the fact that the Russian squadron at Port Arthur had the means of repair close at hand. In the sea fights of the war it was of subordinate use, and indeed was not employed except to give the final stroke to, or force the surrender of, an already crippled ship. =Effectiveness of mines= The war also saw the first use of mines as an offensive, rather than purely defensive, weapon when the Japanese laid a minefield outside Port Arthur. On April 12, 1904, the Russian flagship Petropavlovsk ran into the minefield off Port Arthur and was sunk, while the battleship Pobieda was badly damaged. The Russians turned the same tactic on the Japanese who lost two of their six battleships, the Yashima and the Hatsuse, in a newly laid Russian minefield off Port Arthur a month later. =Sinking ships to block harbours= The Russo-Japanese War (and as much may be said for the war between the United States and Spain) confirmed an old experience. A resolute attempt was made by the Americans to block the entrance to Santiago de Cuba with a blockship. The Japanese renewed the attempt on a great scale and with utmost intrepidity, at Port Arthur; but though a steamship can move with a speed and precision impossible to a sailing ship, and can therefore be sunk more surely at a chosen spot, the experiment failed. Neither Americans nor Japanese succeeded in preventing their enemy from coming out when it wished. Development of Dreadnoughts As the 19th century came to a close, the familiar modern battleship began to emerge; a steel-armoured ship, entirely dependent on steam and carrying a relatively small number of large guns mounted in turrets, typically arranged along the centreline of the main deck. The revolutionary Dreadnought of 1906 was the first battleship to entirely dispense with smaller guns and used steam turbines for her main propulsion. The Dreadnought rendered all existing battleships obsolete, because she was larger, faster, more powerfully armed and more strongly protected than existing battleships, which came to be known as pre- Dreadnoughts. This sudden levelling of the field led to a naval arms race as Britain and Germany and, to a lesser extent, other powers like the United States, France, Russia, Japan, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, Brazil, Argentina and Chile all rushed to build or acquire Dreadnoughts. The First World War The introduction of mines, torpedoes and submarines greatly increased the complexity of naval tactics during the First World War. Even so, the gun remained the principal naval weapon. It could still deliver its blows at the greatest distance in the greatest variety of circumstances. =Fleet tactics= The development of long-range guns mounted in turrets changed the nature of naval tactics. While concentration remained a fundamental objective of tactics, the increased range and field of fire of naval guns meant that admirals now sought to achieve concentration of fire, rather than concentration of ships. The aim of a skilful officer was to concentrate a superior force on a part of his opponent's formation. In the age of sail, when the range of effective fire was a thousand or twelve hundred yards and guns could only be trained over a small arc because they were fired out of ports, concentration could only be effected by bringing a larger number of ships into close action with a smaller. By the early 20th century, when gunfire was effective at 7,000 yards or more, and when guns fired from turrets and barbettes had a far wider sweep, concentration could be effected from a distance. The power to effect it had to be sought by a judicious choice of position. The \\"line ahead\\" had been imposed on sailing fleets by the need to bring each ship's broadsides into action. Experiments made during manoeuvres by steam navies, combined with the experience gained in the war of 1904‚Äì05 in the Far East, showed that no material change had taken place in this respect. It was still as necessary as ever that all the guns should be so placed as to be capable of being brought to bear, and it was still a condition imposed by the physical necessities of the case that this freedom could only be obtained when ships followed one another in a line. This allowed each ship to fire over wide arcs without firing over friendly ships. Steaming with the enemy off to the side enabled a ship to fire salvoes with both the forward and rear turrets, maximizing the chances for a hit. When in pursuit or flight, or when steaming on the look-out for a still unseen enemy, a fleet may be arranged in the \\"line abreast\\". A pursuing fleet would have to run the risk of being struck by torpedoes dropped by a retreating enemy. But it would have the advantage of being able to bring all its guns which can fire ahead to bear on the rear ship of the enemy. When an opponent was prepared to give battle, and turns his broadside so as to bring the maximum of his gunfire to bear, he must be answered by a similar display of force ‚Äì in other words, the line ahead must be formed to meet the line ahead. Each ship in the line generally engaged its opposite number in the enemy battle line. =Introduction of camouflage= Dazzle camouflage was intended to make it difficult to estimate a ship's speed and heading and thus prevent submarines from effectively firing torpedoes. This was accomplished by painting striking designs along the ship, with long, bold lines frequently cutting across the hull and thus rendering the bow of the ship indistinct, which in turn prevented submarines from determining the heading or speed of the ships. This innovation was short-lived, however, as the stark lines intended to confuse submarines only made ships into more visible targets for aircraft. The final evolution of camouflage was into the now prevalent gray shades which almost all warships since WWII have been painted. In the US Navy this is known as \\"Haze Gray.\\" =Development of the submarine= Tactically, submarines of the First World War were similar to privateers in the age of sail, because they were employed primarily to destroy the enemy's merchant traffic in an extremely opportunistic sense rather than engage in battle with enemy naval vessels. Individually, submarines were only capable of sinking a small number of ships because of their limited supply of torpedoes and shells. Anti-submarine tactics were in their infancy at the outbreak of the First World War. Surface warships lacked the means to detect submerged submarines or the weapons to attack them. Surface warships were reduced to hoping to sight the periscope of a submerged submarine or the wake of its torpedoes. Other than gunfire, the only way to sink a submarine was by ramming. Defensive anti-submarine tactics largely consisted of turning ships end-on to the submarine, to reduce the size of the target, by turning towards a submarine sighted off the bows and away from a submarine sighted off the stern. By the end of 1914, German cruisers had largely been cleared from the oceans and the main threat to shipping came from U-boats. The British Admiralty was slow to respond to the change. Only in 1917, at the urging of the British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, did the British institute a convoy system. Losses to U-boats dropped to a fraction of their former level. =Development of aircraft= The British carrier Furious in 1918, after she had been fitted with a landing-on deck aft, but still clearly showing her cruiser origins. Note the large crash barrier rigged behind her funnel and her dazzle camouflage. During WWI, the German forces occasionally employed Zeppelins to attack enemy shipping, but this never inflicted serious losses. Towards the end of the war, the British began to develop the first aircraft carriers by adding flying off and then landing decks to the large light cruiser Furious. The interwar years Fearing another naval arms race, the big naval powers agreed to the Washington Naval Treaty and scrapped some of their battleships and cruisers while still on the slipways. In addition to this, the Washington Naval Treaty established limits on the total tonnage of the fleets of America, Japan and Britain. It was decided in negotiations that a ratio of power would be established of 5:5:3, corresponding to America, Britain and Japan in that order. This meant that the Japanese fleet would only be allowed a fraction of the power that was given to the American and British fleets, a fact which lead directly to the Japanese construction of super battleships. Although this treaty was extremely explicit in its governance of battleship and cruiser tonnage, it was lax in the area of carriers, a fact which all of the participants failed to take advantage of. The growing tensions of the 1930s and the rise of aggressive nationalist governments in Japan, Italy and Germany restarted the building programs, with even larger ships than before; Yamato, the largest battleship ever, displaced 72,000 tons, and mounted 18.1-inch guns. =Emergence of the aircraft carrier= Shortly after the end of the war, the first aircraft carriers designed from the keel up were completed: the Japanese H≈çsh≈ç and the British Hermes. Both ships were too small to be satisfactory. Under the terms of the Washington Treaty, Britain, America and Japan were allowed to convert two ships that were due to scrap under the treaty into aircraft carriers. By luck as much as planning, the Americans and Japanese both developed large carriers that were capable of handling up to 90 aircraft, based on the hulls of battlecruisers due to be scrapped under the Washington Treaty. Both navies gradually began to develop new tactics for employing aircraft carriers in battle, although these tactics did not come into full fruition until the middle of the Pacific Campaign of WWII. =Development of new weapons= The Magnetic mine was a German development that allowed naval mines to become more deadly than ever; by detecting the magnetic charge of a large ship a mine could detonate without ever having to make contact with the craft, and it would be completely harmless to smaller ships, whose lack of a strong magnetic field allowed them to pass safely, saving the mine for more valuable targets. The oxygen Long lance torpedo, which used pure oxygen instead of air for the oxidizer, was developed by the Japanese just prior to their full involvement in WWII. Despite having more than twice the effective range of the best Allied torpedoes and lacking the tell-tale torpedo wake, the oxygen torpedo was not used to its fullest capacity by the Japanese Imperial Navy, mostly because of inefficient submarine deployment. The Second World War During the Second World War tactical developments became even more closely tied to the development of new weapons and technologies. The war saw the first large-scale tactical use of hydrophones, sonar (or ASDIC) and radar, and the development of new technologies such as high-frequency direction finding (HF/DF). In the North Sea and Atlantic, Germany lacked the strength to challenge the Allies for command of the sea. Instead, German naval strategy relied on commerce raiding using capital ships, armed merchant cruisers, submarines and aircraft. The Allies immediately introduced a convoy system for the protection of trade that gradually extended out from the British Isles, eventually reaching as far as Panama, Bombay and Singapore. In the Mediterranean, Britain and Italy fought a conventional naval war for command of the sea. The need to provide capital ships with the anti-submarine protection of a destroyer screen and air cover from an aircraft carrier led to the increasing use of ad hoc task forces, composed of whichever ships were available for a particular operation. Later in the war however, anti-submarine warfare was perfected to a large degree by the Allies, meaning that much more specialized ships and equipment were deployed in convoys with the express purpose of detecting and destroying German (and later Japanese) submarines. =Impact of aircraft on tactics= The development of air power led to further tactical changes, including the emergence of aircraft carriers and the development of naval air fleets. The employment of land-based and carrier-based aircraft during the Second World War showed that command of the seas rested in great part on control of the air above it. Off Norway in the spring of 1940 and in the English Channel in the summer of that year, the German Luftwaffe demonstrated that the British could not maintain command of the sea in daytime without command of the air. In the following year, the arrival of Luftwaffe squadrons in the Mediterranean reversed the British ascendancy in the theatre by neutralizing the British dominance at sea. =Development of the wolf pack= With the immediate introduction of convoy by the Allies at the start of the Second World War, the German submarines (known as U-boats) operating against Allied trade in the Atlantic were driven to adopt new tactics. Until the last year of the war, almost all U-boats were diesel-powered, relying on electric motors for propulsion while underwater. This design had important tactical implications. The electric motors were far less powerful than the diesel engines and had a short battery life. When submerged, most submarines were capable of about 10 knots, little more than the slowest merchantman. So a submerged submarine was not only much slower than when on the surface, but also unable to proceed at its maximum submerged speed for any length of time. Submarines of the Second World War were more submersibles than true submarines. Under Admiral Karl D√∂nitz the U-boats further developed the tactics of surface night attacks that had first been used in the First World War and then refined in exercises in the Baltic before the Second World War. Rather than attacking in daylight while submerged, the German U-boat commanders developed a tactic for operating more like torpedo boats than submarines, attacking on the surface at night where they could use their higher surfaced speed. Approaching the convoys at night on the surface, they found that they could pass quite close to the escorts and yet remain undetected. Look outs high up on the bridges of the escort ships found it all but impossible to spot the low shape of the U-boat with the tiny silhouette of the boat's conning tower against the darkness of the water. But for the U-boats, the escorts and the merchantmen stood out starkly against the lightness of the sky. The convoy battles of the First World War had taught the Germans that a single submarine had little prospect of success against a well defended convoy. Instead of attacking the Allied convoys singly, the German U-boats now began to work in packs co-ordinated centrally by radio. The boats spread out into a long patrol line that crossed the path of the Allied convoy routes. Once in position the boats used hydrophones to pick up the propeller noises of the convoys, or used binoculars to try to spot the tell-tale smoke of a convoy on the horizon. When one boat sighted a convoy, it followed it, broadcasting the convoy's position and waiting for other boats to come up before attacking. So instead of being faced by a single submarine, the convoy escorts had to cope with a group of U-boats attacking in a single night. The most daring commanders, like Otto Kretschmer, not only penetrated the convoy's screen but attacked from within the columns of merchantmen in the convoy. The escort vessels, which were too few in number and often lacking in endurance, had no answer to the lone submarine attacking on the surface at night as their ASDIC detection apparatus only worked against underwater targets. Pack tactics were first used successfully in October 1940, to devastating effect in the battles of Convoys SC 7 and HX 79. Convoy SC 7, with a weak escort of two sloops and two corvettes, was overwhelmed, losing 59% of its ships. The battle for Convoy HX 79 was in many ways worse than SC 7. The loss of a quarter of the convoy without any loss to the U-boats despite a strong escort of two destroyers, four corvettes, three naval trawlers and a minesweeper demonstrated the utter inadequacy of the contemporary British anti-submarine tactics. The success of pack tactics against these two convoys encouraged Admiral D√∂nitz to adopt the wolf pack as his standard tactics. The change in British tactics included the introduction of permanent escort groups to improve the co-ordination and effectiveness of ships and men in battle. Initially, the escort groups consisted of two or three destroyers and half a dozen corvettes. Since two or three of the group would usually be in dock repairing weather or battle damage, the groups typically sailed with about six ships. The Germans also made use of long-range patrol aircraft to find convoys for the U-boat packs to attack, though this tactic rarely succeeded. Towards the end of the war the Germans introduced homing-torpedoes that aimed for the noise made by a target's propellers. Although devastatingly effective at first, the Allied scientists soon developed countermeasures. The American submarine campaign in the Pacific contains many parallels with the German submarine campaign in the Atlantic. Like the Germans, the Americans began the war with a flawed weapon ‚Äì faulty torpedoes ‚Äì that undermined morale and took more than a year to fix. American submariners developed the same preference for attacking on the surface at night and similar pack tactics, although American wolf packs rarely exceeded three boats. But in the Pacific, it was the submarines, not the escorts, that benefited from the introduction of new technologies like radar. By 1943 many US submarines were fitted with radar, which American submarines were routinely using to find convoys and track the positions of escorts at night. =Development of anti-submarine warfare= The primary anti-submarine weapon was the convoy escort, typically a destroyer, armed with sonar (or Asdic) and depth charges. The capture of in July 1941 gave the British a much greater understanding of the capabilities of the German U-boats. In particular, the British were astonished by the maximum safe diving depth of the U-boats, which was far below the deepest setting on Allied depth charges. In the Pacific, the Japanese Navy failed to get a grip on the problems of convoy defence and failed to evolve effective anti-submarine tactics. With fewer escorts and many small convoys, the average number of escorts for a Japanese convoy was inevitably small and many were easily outmanoeuvred by the attacking submarines. =Eclipse of the battleship= The sinking of the British Prince of Wales and Repulse off Malaya on 10 December 1941 by Japanese aircraft marked the beginning of the end of the era of the battleship. By the end of the Pacific War, the tactical role of battleships and cruisers had been reduced to providing anti-aircraft fire to protect the vulnerable carriers and bombarding shore positions. The Japanese battleships Yamato and Musashi were both sunk by aircraft long before they could come within striking range of the American fleet. =Dominance of the aircraft carrier= The British attack on the Italian naval base at Taranto in November 1940, in which one Italian battleship were was sunk and two others heavily damaged, first demonstrated the full potential of the aircraft carrier. But the successful attack on ships in harbour did not convince advocates of the battleship that their day was over. It was the Japanese who really developed the tactical and strategic potential of aircraft carriers. Learning from their experiences in operations off the Chinese coast from 1937 onwards, the Japanese began to combine their carriers into permanent squadrons. While the British and Americans were still operating carriers on their own or sometimes in pairs, by 1941 the Japanese had organized a naval air fleet containing as many as six aircraft carriers. Shokaku preparing the attack on Pearl Harbor. It was this force that struck the opening blow of the Pacific War at Pearl Harbor. The same carrier force then worked its way across the Pacific, attacking Allied forces at Rabaul, in the Netherlands East Indies, at Darwin and finally at Colombo and Trincomalee in Ceylon. The Allied forces in the East Indies were overwhelmed and the old battleships of the British Eastern Fleet forced to retreat as far as Kilindini on the African coast. Despite these successes, many Japanese admirals still failed to grasp the tactical implications of the dominance of the aircraft carrier. Instead of using its battleships to escort the carriers, the Japanese Navy continued to husband its battleships for the decisive fleet action, which never came. The Japanese success in sinking or damaging almost all the US Pacific Fleet's battleships at Pearl Harbor forced the Americans to base their tactics on the aircraft carrier (though they would possibly have developed such tactics anyway). The Americans quickly assembled a group of task forces, each based around a single carrier. Through a series of raids on Japanese-held islands, the American gradually grew more confident in their handling of aircraft carriers, learning that the right place for the task force commander was aboard a carrier, not one of the escorting cruisers, and developing tactics like having a single fighter direction officer for task forces operating in company. The four great carrier battles of 1942 ‚Äì Coral Sea, Midway, Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz ‚Äì were all fought by aircraft without the ships on either side actually coming in sight of one another. The Japanese carriers were caught time and again by American aircraft with a light screen of cruisers and destroyers, contributing to the loss of six Japanese carriers in the four battles. When the new American fast battleships began to arrive in the Pacific in the summer of 1942, they were allocated to the carrier task forces where their heavy anti- aircraft batteries could defend the vulnerable carriers, rather than being formed into separate battle squadrons. By 1943, as growing numbers of new carriers, battleships, cruisers and destroyers began to reach the Pacific, the Americans developed a fleet of fast carrier task forces that swept across the Pacific over the next two years, isolating, overwhelming and then destroying the Japanese island bases.

Schleswig Cathedral (, ) officially the Cathedral of St. Peter at Schleswig (), is the main church of the city of Schleswig and was the cathedral of the Bishop of Schleswig until the diocese was dissolved in 1624. It is now a church of the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church, the seat of the Lutheran Bishop of Schleswig and Holstein, and ranks among the most important architectural monuments of Schleswig-Holstein.  History  = Predecessors = In 850 a missionary church was founded in Haithabu (Hedeby). Between 947 and 949 Otto I installed three dioceses on the Cimbrian peninsula: Ribe, Schleswig and in 948 √Örhus. After the foundation of the Schleswig diocese in 947, the first cathedral in Schleswig was built. Today, neither the size nor the location of this cathedral is known. =Construction= Gothic inside of Schleswig Cathedral In 1134, construction of a new romanesque basilica began. The work was only completed around 1200, because an additional nave was constructed that can still be seen today. Construction materials included granite, tuff from the Rhine, and brick. In 1134, the Danish King Niels‚Äô headless body was laid out in St. Peter's Cathedral after it was pulled from the Schlei in the nets of local fishermen. The monks who attended the corpse heard strange noises and thought that the spirit of King Niels was wandering about in the church. As a result, the king's body was taken to Gottorp and stuffed into a boggy grave. Someone hammered a stake through Niels' chest to keep him there. Legend has it that King Niels' still haunts the cathedral, and that he still hunts across the moors and forest of Schleswig with his hounds.Huitfeldt, Arild. Danmarks Riges Kr√∏nike King Frederick I of Denmark is entombed in the cathedral. After the collapse of two towers and some parts of the basilica in 1275, the High Gothic Hall Choir was constructed and completed around 1300. The Late Gothic Hall Church was built from 1200 to 1408 and was finally completed in the 16th century. In 1894 that the cathedral got its final outward appearance. In 1879 Schleswig became the provincial capital in 1879, and in 1888 the construction of a Gothic revival western tower began at the request of the King William II of Prussia. It was completed in 1894 and at 112 metres, a little too high compared to the proportions of the cathedral. There is a viewing platform on the tower at 65 metres which commands a great view on the city of Schleswig, the Schlei and the fishing village of Holm. , one can view the bells above the platform with a special guided tour starting in the cathedral. Beside the Gothic Altar of the Magi (c. 1300) in the southern choir, a bronze baptismal font in the high choir by Ghert Klinghe (1480) and a four-metre-high wood carving of Christophorus, the cathedral's main attraction is the famous Bordesholm Altar.  The cathedral in detail  =The Petri Portal= The Petri Portal ca. 1180 Access to the cathedral is granted through the romanesque Petri Portal, dating back to 1180. A variety of materials were used for the portal's construction: granite, red sandstone from Sk√•ne, limestone from Gotland and tuff from the Rhineland. On the Tympanum, Christ is depicted amongst evangelists and saints. Presumably, the one holding the key is the disciple Peter, and the other one who is given the scroll with the Christian mission, is St. Paul. Beside the portal, there is a weathered sculpture of a lion; another one can be found on the outer wall of the sacristy. = The sacristy = The sacristy, build around 1480, first served, indeed, as sacristy and conference room of the cathedral chapter (; an entity similar to a parochial church council that is tasked with the cathedral's day-to-day religious work) and since 1567 as classroom for the cathedral's school. After the Reformation, it was converted to a F√ºrstengruft (tomb for the princes) as tomb for the dukes of Holstein-Gottorp. =The High Choir= Bishop Berthold arranged for an expansion of the High Choir at the end of the 13th century. Also, frescos were added, depicting the Annunciation, the Coronation of Mary, St. Catherine, St. Philippus, St. Peter, Deesis and angels. The choir banks were manufactured by an unknown artist working under the pseudonym Magister rusticus at the beginning of the 16th century. =The Schwahl= The three- winged cloisters at the northern end of the nave, were constructed from 1310 to 1320, called the Schwahl. The name has its root in the Danish-Low German dialect and means \\"cold alley\\". It was used mainly for processions that left and re-entered the church on that way. Here, restored frescos from the church's foundation can be found. They show the life of Christ as well as a selection of legendary creatures. During Advent, a small art market takes place in the cloisters. =The Br√ºggemann-Altar= The altar, carved by Hans Br√ºggemann from 1514 to 1521 is the cathedral's main attraction Detail from the centre of the Br√ºggemann-Alter: Jesus carrying the cross The oak wood altar, carved by Hans Br√ºggemann from 1514 to 1521, is 12.60 meters high and depicts biblical history from Christ's arrest to Ascension (modelled after Albrecht D√ºrer's \\"Little Passion\\"). In the central piece, Jesus carrying the cross and the descent to hell are emphasized through larger carvings. Ascension and Pentecost are depicted on the altar wings. Next to the central piece, Adam and Eve can be seen. Above everything, Jesus Christ hovers as pantocrator. Originally, the altar was manufactured for the Augustinian Chorherrenkirche (i.e. collegiate church) in Bordesholm. After the priory's dissolution, the Duke Christian Albrecht of Holstein-Gottorp arranged for the altar's transfer to Schleswig Cathedral in 1666. A young Emil Nolde helped with the altar's restoration in Flensburg at the end of the 19th century. =Cenotaph of Frederick I= In the northern choir nave, an elegant renaissance cenotaph for Frederick I, King of Denmark and Norway and Duke of Schleswig and Holstein, can be found. The tombstone, created for the choir in 1552 and put up there, was moved to its current position in 1901. It was called one of the \\"masterpieces of Dutch renaissance art in Northern Europe\\" (Marianne Mehling). Its creator is the Flemish sculptor Cornelis Floris de Vriendt. Instead of the usual seven virtues, the (empty) sarcophagus stands only on six. =The Blue Madonna= J√ºrgen Ovens (1623‚Äì1678) painted his Blue Madonna which was originally called Holy Family with Johannes, in 1669. It is situated on a pillar in the northern side nave. The influence of Anthony van Dyck is clearly visible on the baroque painting. J√ºrgen Ovens, born 1623 in T√∂nning, was a pupil of Rembrandt's and court painter of the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp. The Blue Madonna is his most famous painting. A self- portrait from 1691 can be found in the Laurentius Church in T√∂nning. Other works of Ovens can be seen in the State Museum of Schleswig-Holstein in Castle Gottorf. = Central Tower = The central tower was constructed by Friedrich Adler between 1888 and 1894 from brick. At 112 meters, it is the second- largest church spire in Schleswig-Holstein, after the Marienkirche in L√ºbeck. The tower had fallen into disrepair in the early 1950s and was restored from 1953 to 1956. = Burials = *Valdemar IV, Duke of Schleswig (?‚Äì1314) *Eric II, Duke of Schleswig (1290‚Äì1325) *Frederick I of Denmark *Conrad von Reventlow *Gustav Trolle *Sophie of Pomerania  Further reading  The German wikipedia has a large selection of books about the cathedral: Literature about Schleswig Cathedral References  External links  * Official Page of Schleswig Cathedral = Pictures = * Central Tower * Portal * Jesus Carrying the Cross on the Br√ºggemannaltar * The Entombment of Christ on the Br√ºggemannaltar * Cenotaph of Frederick I Category:Buildings and structures in Schleswig-Flensburg Category:Lutheran cathedrals in Germany Category:Lutheran churches in Schleswig-Holstein Category:Lutheran churches converted from Roman Catholicism Schleswig Cathedral Schleswig Category:Schleswig, Schleswig- Holstein ","title":"Schleswig Cathedral"},{"id":"3691009","text":"Windeck Castle (Weinheim).

It involves a resuspension of the prolapsed uterus using a strip of synthetic mesh to lift the uterus and hold it in place. It allows for normal sexual function and preserves childbearing function.Price N, Slack A, Jackson S.(2009) Laparoscopic hysteropexy: the initial results of a uterine suspension procedure for uterovaginal prolapse. BJOG 2010;117:62‚Äì68. www.bjog.org Procedure Sacrohysteropexy can be performed as an open operation or laparoscopically (via keyhole incisions). The advantages of laparoscopic approach include superior visualisation of the anatomy with laparoscopic magnification, decreased hospital stay, reduced postoperative pain, more rapid recovery and smaller incisions. The aim of laparoscopic hysteropexy is to restore and reinforce normal uterine support by suspending the uterus from the sacral promontory using polypropylene mesh. The mesh is strongly attached at two points: namely the uterus/cervix and the anterior longitudinal ligament over the sacral promontory. Hysteropexy restores the normal support of the vagina, suspending the uterus back in its anatomical position by reinforcing weakened ligaments with a mesh. This procedure allows the length of the vagina to be restored without compromising its calibre, and is therefore likely to have a favourable functional outcome. Outcomes The advantages of this operation over hysterectomy, as well as preservation of fertility, are a stronger repair, with less risk of recurrent prolapse. Cuts to the vagina itself are also avoided so it is likely there is less risk of subsequent sexual problems.

It publishes a quarterly magazine called Revolutionary Perspectives and distributes the agitational broadsheet Aurora. Works of the CWO and ICT have been cited in various academic and political sources internationally, across several countries and languages. The organisation has its origins in north England and Scotland (Liverpool, Newcastle, Aberdeen, Edinburgh), though it later grew to encompass other areas with members and sympathisers across the world. History =Founding= The group was founded in the mid-1970s with the union of Workers' Voice, based in Liverpool, and Revolutionary Perspectives, a group based in the North of England and Scotland ‚Äì some of whose members had previously been active in Solidarity. Both groups were influenced by German left communism and in particular the KAPD. Both also published articles on the German Revolution. Additionally, Revolutionary Perspectives also translated Otto Ruhle's \\"From the Bourgeois to the Proletarian Revolution\\" into English. By 1975 the two groups coalesced broadly around the positions of the KAPD's \\"Essen Tendency\\". Both groups had also taken part in international conferences sponsored by the French group R√©volution Internationale with the British group World Revolution. These two groups formed the International Communist Current, but the Workers' Voice group denounced this as \\"counter-revolutionary\\" over its defence of the October Revolution and its position on the period of transition. Revolutionary Perspectives had tried to mediate between Workers' Voice and World Revolution, but was now forced to choose. As World Revolution had already rejected its draft platform and it had disagreements on several other positions, most notably the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, Revolutionary Perspectives chose to unite with Workers' Voice to from the Communist Workers' Organisation. =Early growth= For a year the organisation grew, publishing ten issues (the journals Workers' Voice and Revolutionary Perspectives) as well as distributing thousands of leaflets at factory gates and establishing groups in several factories. However, by the end of 1976 it was clear that the wave of working class struggle which had led to the rebirth of left communism in Britain was over. The Liverpool section now began to retreat into local activity and, without issuing a document or giving any political explanation, abandoned joint political work and dissolved. This loss was followed in 1977 by the demand of the Aberdeen section that the CWO should now join the International Communist Current, which they now claimed was the communist movement. Although the majority were prepared to discuss this the Aberdeen section left within a month (it would split from the ICC within a few years to form the Communist Bulletin Group). =Merger with PCInt= In 1977 the CWO majority adhered to the international conferences initiated by the Internationalist Communist Party (Battaglia Comunista) from Italy, also known as the PCInt. In the course of these conferences, the CWO became convinced by the PCInt that the positions the latter had defended since 1943 were the best product of the left communist tradition. The two organisations formed the International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party in 1983. Due to their opposition to Stalinism/Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, Maoism, and Trotskyism ‚Äì as well as their theoretical basis originating in the Italian left ‚Äì the CWO has erroneously been referred to as a \\"Bordigist\\" or \\"council‚Äìcommunist\\" organisation by some authors. A key distinction between the politics of the CWO/ICT and that of Bordigists is that the former do not view the party as the class itself, but an important tool used to fight for a communist perspective in the mass organs of proletarian power that are the workers' councils. For some time in the 1990s it was Sheffield that became a temporary HQ for the organisation. =ICT and recent growth= The International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party was eventually joined by left communist groups in France, Canada, the United States and Germany. In recognition of this expansion it moved towards a closer coordination of its activities in 2009 with the formation of the Internationalist Communist Tendency. The CWO remains an integral part of the ICT. An initiative that the organisation was at the centre of in 2003‚Äì2004, known as No War But the Class War (NWBCW), was revived in 2018 by the CWO with the Anarchist Communist Group; the goal behind this move was to highlight the need to oppose all imperialist wars, including efforts of national liberation and other forms of lesser evilism espoused by social democratic and other left-wing groups ‚Äì and instead focusing on workers' unity and class struggle. The views of NWBCW can be succinctly summed up by a 2017 statement from the CWO: \\"The only war which is worth fighting is the class war ... if the workers of all countries united and refused to fight, there would be no war!\\". In its long-time history, the CWO circulated hundreds of thousands of leaflets and publications that it had produced over the years.

The parish includes the village of Callow End and the hamlets of Bastonford, Clevelode, Collett's Green, and Deblins Green. Powick lies on the A449 and has two bridges across the River Teme, one ancient and one modern. The village contains a primary school, three pubs - The Crown, The Red Lion and The Three Nuns, a garage and a Chinese restaurant/takeaway. It is locally pronounced \\"Pow-ick\\" (the \\"ow\\" rhyming with the word \\"mow\\"). History =Powick Old Bridge= Powick Old Bridge over the River Teme The old bridge across the Teme at Powick is late mediaeval with 17th-century alterations, built of sandstone with brick parapets. It is a grade I listed structure. In 1642 the bridge was the scene of one of the first skirmishes between Royalist and Parliamentarian soldiers in the English Civil War in what became known as the Battle of Powick Bridge. It was a short, sharp, but decisive cavalry engagement that resulted in a victory for the Royalists and showed the Parliamentarian cavalry their shortcomings, setting the tone for the early stages of the conflict. A long ballad gives a surprisingly detailed account of the battle.Ballad of Powick Bridge Rump Songs (1662). The more famous Battle of Worcester later on in the war, in 1651, was fought in part in much the same locality close to the River Teme, when the two northern-piers of the bridge were destroyed by the Royalists. The church in Powick village was used by the Royalists as a lookout point as it commanded elevated views over the surrounding countryside and the bridge and its approaches. Its tower has a lot of pockmarks from small bore cannon balls which were fired by Parliamentarian gunners to deter the Scottish Royalist forces using the tower. They extend up the south face of the tower from as low as head height up to the top. =Powick Hospital= Collett's Green - the former hospital A mile from the village towards Malvern was the site of the Victorian complex of the county psychiatric hospital, generally referred to as Powick Hospital. The hospital was notorious for its use of LSD in therapy and mistreatment of patients. Built in 1852, the hospital finally closed in 1989 and was mostly demolished shortly thereafter. The name Powick entered the local colloquialisms and became synonymous for mental disorder in many informal expressions relating to madness or stupidity. Before he became England's most famous composer, in 1879 at the age of 22 Edward Elgar was appointed bandmaster of the asylum until about 1886, and wrote compositions for the asylum's band. =Victorian power station= Powick Mill A former water mill, next to Powick Bridge, was converted in 1894 to become the world's first combined steam/hydro electric power station. Electricity from this mill provided about half the city of Worcester's needs. The Powick site continued generating until the 1950s. When it closed, it was converted into a laundry and has since been converted into residential apartments. The site was chosen as a mill site from at least the 11th century, and very probably earlier than that. The mill leat was dug in 1291. A succession of water mills replaced each other throughout the Middle Ages and into the 16th century and later. The mill is a Grade II Listed Building.

The Western Division of the Minor Counties Championship is made up of ten teams with each team playing six three-day fixtures throughout the season, completing home and away games against each side over a three-year cycle. Devon also plays in the 50 over a side MCCA Knock Out Trophy. The county has an outstanding record in both the Championship and the one-day knockout trophy. The Minor Counties Championship is based on matches of two innings per side over three days. Counties are arranged into two geographical groups of ten ‚ÄìEastern and Western divisions -and teams plays three home and three away matches against other sides within their division; each year, the fixture list is altered so that over a three- year cycle each side plays the other teams in their division. At the end of the season, the team with the best record from the Eastern Division plays the winner of the Western Division for the Minor Counties Championship, over four days.

An embryo county organization existed in the 1820s, and a county club was initially founded in 1861. It went out of existence briefly in 1897 but was re-formed on 26 November 1899, and joined the Minor Counties‚Äô Championship in 1901. At present twenty Minor Counties participate in two competitions. Devon was the scene of a county club‚Äôs foundation on 18 August 1875, but not its own. Somerset County Cricket Club was set up by some Somerset Gentlemen players at a meeting at Sidmouth CC, immediately after a match against the Gentlemen of Devon. An application was made for first-class status and entry to the County Championship in 1948. However, the county was turned down. Devon has won the Minor Counties Championship eight times, one of them shared.

In May 2007 the Minster ceased to act as the parish church of Bishopwearmouth. It is one of the Greater Churches. History A church dedicated to St Michael & All Angels has stood on this site for over a thousand years. For most of that time, it has been known as ‚ÄòBishopwearmouth Parish Church‚Äô. The parish of Bishopwearmouth, south of the River Wear was founded in around 940AD, with an original stone church being built shortly afterwards. The first evidence of a church on the site arose in a 1930s excavation when Saxon stones were found. Due to colliery subsidence, the church was virtually re-built beyond recognition in the early 20th century, but not all parts of the former church were lost. In 1998, following the grant of City status, the church was redesignated as ‚ÄòSunderland Minster‚Äô:http://www.ncs-uk.com/work-starts-at-sunderland-minster/ the second Minster church in England since the Reformation (following Dewsbury Minster in West Yorkshire in 1994). In May 2007, with the adoption of Benedict Biscop as Sunderland‚Äôs Patron Saint, the church was redesignated as an Extra Parochial Place with the addition of St Benedict Biscop in its title.https://www.seeitdoitsunderland.co.uk/sunderland-minster It is a Grade II* listed building. Role of the Minster Until May 2007 the team of ministers carried out traditional parish duties as well as serving the city by hosting services of remembrance, providing chaplaincies for the retail and industrial workforces in the city centre, as well as being used by the University chaplaincy. It continues to play host to special services and worship events for the whole city, as it did for many years as Bishopwearmouth Parish Church. In 2007 the Minster ended its parish role, and these functions were transferred to the Parish Churches of St Nicholas and St Ignatius. Since then the Minster describes itself as \\"A church for the whole City\\".

It was released on March 23, 2010 by A&M; Records and So So Def Recordings as a soundtrack single from the film Why Did I Get Married Too?, which starred Jackson. The song was later included on Jackson's compilation album Icon: Number Ones. It was written by Jackson, Johnt√° Austin, Bryan-Michael Cox and Jermaine Dupri and produced by Jackson, Cox, and Dupri. Initially titled \\"Trust in Me\\", the song was written about the different character's personas and emotions in the film. \\"Nothing\\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who praised it as \\"classic pop\\", and noted that it was possibly influenced by her brother Michael Jackson's recent death. Despite the fact that it was not officially released to radio formats for airplay, the song managed to achieve moderate rotation on adult contemporary and jazz formats. A music video for the song was directed by Tim Palen and premiered in April 2010. Jackson performed \\"Nothing\\" on the ninth season finale of American Idol and on the Essence Music Festival, which Jackson headlined. Background \\"Nothing\\" was composed by Janet Jackson, Johnt√° Austin, Bryan-Michael Cox and Jermaine Dupri and produced by Jackson, Cox, and Dupri. It was released on March 30, 2010 as the theme for Why Did I Get Married Too?, which starred Jackson. It was released as a stand-alone single in addition to appearing on the Why Did I Get Married Too? soundtrack, and was later included on Jackson's Icon: Number Ones compilation. \\"Nothing\\" was strongly considered for a nomination for \\"Best Original Song\\" at the 83rd Academy Awards, but ultimately was not nominated. On February 11, 2010 Jackson revealed the song's title on her official Twitter account. Janet's official site announced \\"Janet composed 'Nothing' as an emotional ballad that reflects and supports the powerful themes of the film..[&] evokes the emotional turmoil the Why Did I Get Married Too? characters experience throughout the film.\\" Initially titled \\"Trust in Me\\", Jackson spoke to The LA Times about the song, stating \\"Even though it sounds like a sad song, it's hopeful. When you really listen to it, it's really hopeful.\\" When asked why she felt the song resonated with so many fans, Janet replied that she felt the song helped people relate to the characters in the movie.Alive Magazine, April 2010, page 56 Music supervisor Joel C. High, who recruited artists to appear on the film's soundtrack, commented \\"we were lucky to have Janet involved, especially at a time where she was going through a lot. We were basically finished with the picture when she told Tyler she wanted to write something. It's a strong love song [...] and is our big end title finish.\\" Co-producer Jermaine Dupri also spoke about the song, revealing \\"We had to do this record in like three days to get it into this movie ‚Äì it was a last minute thing that her and Tyler [Perry] talked about.\\" Dupri also added \\"You haven't heard Janet sound like this in a long time and I think the song is perfect for the movie. It's a really good record.\\" Promotion To promote the song and film, Janet held a contest on her official website titled \\"Janet's Everything for Nothing Experience\\", which allowed the winner to receive a personally autographed copy of her Number Ones compilation, with the grand-prize winner receiving an autographed Why Did I Get Married Too? poster. Expressing gratitude to her fans, Jackson tweeted \\"Thank u for all the love on 'Nothing.' I hope u will enjoy Why Did I Get Married Too this week!\\" Critical reception MTV qualified \\"Nothing\\" as having \\"waves of heartfelt emotion\\" and \\"mournful beauty\\". Rolling Stone described the track as \\"classic pop,\\" adding that the lyrics reflect the tensions and turmoil between the film characters. Cristen Maher from AOL Music's The Boombox called the song \\"an uplifting ballad...about the ups and downs that occur when two people are in love. The overall message is that when it comes to love, nothing can stand in the way of making things right.\\" Maher adds \\"Jackson ‚Äî who is still coping with the loss of her brother Michael ‚Äî drew inspiration from her grief for her theatrical performance...transferring her sorrow beautifully into a moving and deeply heartfelt ballad.\\" Idolator stated that the song \\"reminds us that, despite all the overproduction and sexed-up whispering on her last few singles, Janet can actually still deliver solid vocals‚Äîsomething that was hardly apparent on ‚ÄúWe Are The World 25\\". Entertainment Weekly described the song as an \\"airy ballad, on which she cries out for more communication in a troubled relationship.\\" Deborah Vankin of The Los Angeles Times called it \\"a touching, melodic ballad about truth, trust and relationships\\", adding that the song is \\"generating almost as much Oscar buzz as it feels riddled with grief [...] Even though Jackson says \\"Nothing\\" is not about her brother, whom she won't talk about much these days, the song's melancholy and emotional grit leads one to wonder. It's no stretch to think that Jackson, who's known for having a particularly strong work ethic and occasionally losing herself in creative projects during turbulent times, was channeling the fallout of her personal tragedy into her music.\\" Music video Jackson shot the music video for \\"Nothing\\" on March 24, 2010, with it being premiered the following week on AOL Music. The video was directed by Tim Palen, photographer and co- President of Theatrical Marketing at Lions Gate Entertainment, the company that released Why Did I Get Married Too?. The video features several shots of Jackson in mirror-like projections accompanied by powerful and passionate clips from the film. Internationally, the video was released to music channels on July 19. A behind the scenes segment on the filming of the video was shown on TV Guide Network's Hollywood 411. The \\"Nothing\\" music video was included in the \\"Special Features\\" segment of the Why Did I Get Married Too? Blu-ray and DVD. AOL Music's The Boombox commented \\"the superstar‚Äôs newest video for ‚ÄòNothing‚Äô encompasses the message of the song, with a stark blackness acting as a backdrop to Jackson's emotional release.\\" Idolator called the video \\"heavy on the singing, light on the Nasty\\", noting the stripped down approach of the clip was \\"hardly a tour de force\\". Live performances Jackson made a surprise appearance on the ninth season finale of American Idol to perform a medley of \\"Nothing\\" and \\"Nasty\\" after joining the contestants to perform a rendition of her hit ballad \\"Again\\". MTV expressed that Jackson provided the audience with waves of heartfelt emotion as she sang \\"Nothing\\". Zap2it stated that the performance of \\"Nothing\\" was moving. Neon Limelight stated that Jackson \\"brought the crowd to its feet. The song was also performed at the Essence Music Festival, which Jackson headlined, with the performance from the event broadcast on TV One. \\"Nothing\\" was later included on the setlist of Jackson's Number Ones, Up Close and Personal tour in 2011. The song was performed after a video interlude displaying scenes from Jackson's various acting roles, including Poetic Justice, Why Did I Get Married Too?, and Good Times. MuuMuse commented on the tour's performance, saying \\"Perched on top of a stool, Jackson delivered a 1-2-3 punch of some of her biggest ballads‚Äìincluding 'Again,' 'Let's Wait Awhile,' and her latest offering, 'Nothing'‚Äìas the crowd lovingly swayed and sang along.\\" Track listing *Digital single / promotional CD single (SSD 2631)Janet Jackson - Nothing (CD) at Discogs #\\"Nothing\\" ‚Äì 3:25 Charts { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" - !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2010) !scope=\\"col\\"Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\"US Hot Adult R&B; Airplay  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"15 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"58 } References External links * Category:2010 singles Category:2010s ballads Category:Janet Jackson songs Category:Pop ballads Category:Song recordings produced by Jermaine Dupri Category:Songs written for films Category:Songs written by Bryan-Michael Cox Category:Songs written by Janet Jackson Category:Songs written by Jermaine Dupri Category:Songs written by Johnt√° Austin Category:2010 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Bryan-Michael Cox ","title":"Nothing (Janet Jackson song)"},{"id":"3691144","text":"right Bedfordshire County Cricket Club is one of 20 Minor County clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales.

It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico by San Jos√© Island (also referred to as St. Joseph Island). Aransas Pass is the most direct navigable outlet into the Gulf of Mexico from the bay. The cities of Aransas Pass and Port Aransas are located at the southern end, and Rockport is found on the central western shore. The bay is oriented laterally northeast-southwest, and is extended by Redfish Bay to the southwest, Copano Bay to the west, Saint Charles Bay to the north, and Mesquite Bay to the northeast. Aransas Bay is part of the Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve. Aransas Bay is one of seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas. There is a rich history of settlements on the bay, including ancient Native American campgrounds dating back millennia, 19th-century European immigrant towns such as Lamar and Aransas, and the present day cities of Rockport, Fulton and Aransas Pass. Resources such as shrimp, fish, oysters and oil are found in or near the bay, and contribute to the local economies. History Humans first inhabited the area surrounding Aransas Bay approximately 6,000 to 8,000 years ago. The name derives from a group of indigenous people called the Aransas Indians, whose 4,000-year-old campsites have been found near the bay. The nomadic Aransas, left the area circa 1200 to 1300 CE. According to archeologists, the Karankawa and Coahuiltecan had coalesced as people and migrated into the area by 1400. They had severe losses and were much reduced by the 1800s due to new infectious diseases contracted from European explorers. Alonso √Ålvarez de Pineda of Spain is believed to be the first European to sail the bay, circa 1519. For over a century later, the Spanish had little interest in the area until the French established a colony in Texas in the late 17th century. At this time, Alonso De Le√≥n was ordered to found a settlement in the area, but no permanent colony on the bay was ever established. During the years of Mexican control, the bay was put off limits to settlement by the authorities. An empresario granted in 1828 allowed Irish and Mexican immigration. In 1832, the settlement of Aransas City on the bay, was founded by James Power. After the development of the nearby port Lamar in 1840, Aransas City was deserted by 1846. But Lamar soon met a similar fate, after being burnt to the ground during the American Civil War. The city of Aransas, which was founded on San Jose Island around the same time as Lamar, was also destroyed in the fighting. During the war, the bay was a strategically significant waterway for the transfer of freight, due to its protection from Gulf seas by barrier islands. As a result of the destruction from the war, the new ports of Fulton and Rockport were developed in the later 1860s. At first, Rockport was intended as a deep-water port, but after a series of mishaps, Aransas Pass was selected when deepening was approved in 1879. By 1912, a 100 feet wide and 8¬Ω feet deep channel was operational. After hurricanes ransacked the port in 1916 and 1919, the United States Army Corps of Engineers chose Corpus Christi as the preferred deepwater port for the lower Gulf Coast. Later twentieth-century development has been based on the area's natural beauty. In the 1960s, the affluent resort of Key Allegro, located between Rockport and Fulton, was founded. By 2000, 24,615 people lived in the surrounding Aransas County, including the cities of Rockport, Fulton, Aransas Pass and the unincorporated Key Allegro, Holiday Beach and Estes. The outer Refugio County located on the shore of Copano Bay, had 7,828 residents. Features Aransas Bay (orange), Redfish Bay (red), Mission Bay (lime), Port Bay (olive), Copano Bay (aquamarine), Saint Charles Bay (light blue), Dunham Bay (violet), Carlos Bay (pink), Sundown Bay (yellow) and Mesquite Bay (brown). On average, the Aransas Bay system is 3 meters deep, and covers approximately 539 square kilometers. The system is made up of the bay itself and its extensions. The main extensions include: Saint Charles Bay, to the east of the Lamar peninsula; Copano Bay, to the west of both the Live Oak and Lamar peninsulas, Mesquite Bay to the bay's northeast, and Redfish Bay to the southwest. Redfish Bay is sometimes considered an extension of Corpus Christi Bay. Together with its extensions, Aransas Bay forms one of seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas, receiving the discharge from the Mission River and the Aransas River, as well as smaller streams such as Copano Creek. Every second, approximately 28 cubic meters of water flows into the bay. Water exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas Pass. As a result of the seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 15 parts per thousand, compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. Fresh water flows also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay. Combined, the fresh water influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system's volume, which is judged to be minimal. Texas State Highway 35 runs parallel to the shore of Aransas Bay on its route from Corpus Christi to Houston. The highway includes the 1.5 mile long Copano Bay causeway, which connects the Live Oak and Lamar peninsulas at the confluence of Copano and Aransas Bays. The first causeway was constructed in 1933, but was replaced in 1966 with the Lyndon Baines Johnson causeway. The former causeway was transformed into a fishing pier in later years. In 1981, nearly 10,000 vehicles passed over the bridge on a daily basis. Ecosystem Brown pelican flying over Fulton harbor A wide variety of wildlife can be found in and around Aransas Bay. According to Texas Parks and Wildlife, the following fish have been caught in the bay: catfish, black drum, red drum, eel, southern flounder, crevalle jack, yellowtail amberjack, ladyfish, silver perch, pigfish, pinfish, sea trout, blacktip shark, bull shark, sheepshead, mangrove snapper, common snook and toadfish. Shrimp, Oysters and crabs also reside in the waters. The sea grass carpets found at numerous locations, provide a habitat and an ideal place for fish to spawn. The grasses also act as a filter, clearing the bay of environmental contaminants. Many birds migrate to the area around Aransas Bay, most notably to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Year-round residents include least grebe, brown pelican, neotropic cormorant, white-faced ibis, roseate spoonbill, black-bellied whistling-duck, mottled duck, white-tailed hawk, crested caracara, pauraque, golden-fronted woodpecker, great kiskadee, green jay, long-billed thrasher, olive sparrow, seaside sparrow, and bronzed cowbird. The endangered whooping crane has also been spotted near the bay. Despite the fact that there were only 15 in 1900, over 180 are found in the wild today. The whooping crane's and other birds' survival depends on the availability of blue crab. Thousands of crab traps have been removed to preserve the population. Industry Rockport Beach on Aransas Bay. Given the location of Aransas bay, shipping has always been a major industry. Following the Civil War, the meatpacking industry became a major source of income for ports on the bay, especially Rockport and Fulton, where numerous slaughterhouses were constructed. In the early years of meatpacking, cattle were slaughtered strictly for their hide since there was no way to refrigerate the meat. As a result, most of the left over cow parts not used as pig feed, were disposed in the bay. This changed in 1871, when an ice machine was installed in a packing plant. By this time, the meatpacking industry near Aransas Bay reached its prime. Prior to the decline of the industry in the area, in 1880, 93% of the beef from Texas slaughterhouses were processed in Rockport-Fulton. Along with fishing, oyster farming and most notably shrimping became major industries on the bay in the early 20th century. Shipbuilding also developed and reached its prime following the first World War. During World War II, the United States Navy took over several shipyards. In 1936, oil was discovered on the bay. By 1946, 13 wells were in operation. In 1990, 498,703 barrels were produced, part of the 77 million barrels produced between 1936 and 1990. Today, tourism is a prosperous industry. Numerous hotels are set up along the bay for individuals wanting to fish, bird or sight-see. A large concentration of hotels are located in Rockport, where the bay's only beach (Rockport Beach) is located.

Primality certificates allow the primality of a number to be rapidly checked without having to run an expensive or unreliable primality test. \\"Succinct\\" usually means that the proof should be at most polynomially larger than the number of digits in the number itself (for example, if the number has b bits, the proof might contain roughly b2 bits). Primality certificates lead directly to proofs that problems such as primality testing and the complement of integer factorization lie in NP, the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time given a solution. These problems already trivially lie in co-NP. This was the first strong evidence that these problems are not NP-complete, since if they were, it would imply that NP is subset of co-NP, a result widely believed to be false; in fact, this was the first demonstration of a problem in NP intersect co-NP not known, at the time, to be in P. Producing certificates for the complement problem, to establish that a number is composite, is straightforward: it suffices to give a nontrivial divisor. Standard probabilistic primality tests such as the Baillie‚ÄìPSW primality test, the Fermat primality test, and the Miller‚ÄìRabin primality test also produce compositeness certificates in the event where the input is composite, but do not produce certificates for prime inputs.  Pratt certificates  The concept of primality certificates was historically introduced by the Pratt certificate, conceived in 1975 by Vaughan Pratt,Vaughan Pratt. \\"Every prime has a succinct certificate\\". SIAM Journal on Computing, vol. 4, pp. 214‚Äì220. 1975. Citations, Full-text. who described its structure and proved it to have polynomial size and to be verifiable in polynomial time. It is based on the Lucas primality test, which is essentially the converse of Fermat's little theorem with an added condition to make it true: : Lucas' theorem: Suppose we have an integer a such that: :* an ‚àí 1 ‚â° 1 (mod n), :* for every prime factor q of n ‚àí 1, it is not the case that a(n ‚àí 1)/q ‚â° 1 (mod n). : Then n is prime. Given such an a (called a witness) and the prime factorization of n ‚àí 1, it's simple to verify the above conditions quickly: we only need to do a linear number of modular exponentiations, since every integer has fewer prime factors than bits, and each of these can be done by exponentiation by squaring in O(log n) multiplications (see big-O notation). Even with grade-school integer multiplication, this is only O((log n)4) time; using the multiplication algorithm with best-known asymptotic running time, the Sch√∂nhage‚ÄìStrassen algorithm, we can lower this to O((log n)3(log log n)(log log log n)) time, or using soft-O notation √ï((log n)3). However, it is possible to trick a verifier into accepting a composite number by giving it a \\"prime factorization\\" of n ‚àí 1 that includes composite numbers. For example, suppose we claim that n = 85 is prime, supplying a = 4 and n ‚àí 1 = 6 √ó 14 as the \\"prime factorization\\". Then (using q = 6 and q = 14): * 4 is coprime to 85, * 485‚àí1 ‚â° 1 (mod 85), * 4(85‚àí1)/6 ‚â° 16 (mod 85), 4(85‚àí1)/14 ‚â° 16 (mod 85). We would falsely conclude that 85 is prime. We don't want to just force the verifier to factor the number, so a better way to avoid this issue is to give primality certificates for each of the prime factors of n ‚àí 1 as well, which are just smaller instances of the original problem. We continue recursively in this manner until we reach a number known to be prime, such as 2. We end up with a tree of prime numbers, each associated with a witness a. For example, here is a complete Pratt certificate for the number 229: * 229 (a = 6, 229 ‚àí 1 = 22 √ó 3 √ó 19), ** 2 (known prime), ** 3 (a = 2, 3 ‚àí 1 = 2), *** 2 (known prime), ** 19 (a = 2, 19 ‚àí 1 = 2 √ó 32), *** 2 (known prime), *** 3 (a = 2, 3 ‚àí 1 = 2), **** 2 (known prime). This proof tree can be shown to contain at most 4\\\\log_2 n - 4 values other than 2 by a simple inductive proof (based on theorem 2 of Pratt). The result holds for 3; in general, take p > 3 and let its children in the tree be p1, ..., pk. By the inductive hypothesis, the tree rooted at pi contains at most 4\\\\log_2 p_i - 4 values, so the entire tree contains at most : 1 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^k (4\\\\log_2 p_i - 4) = -4k + 4\\\\log_2 p_1 \\\\cdots p_k \\\\leq 4\\\\log_2 p - 4, since k ‚â• 2, and p1...pk = p ‚àí 1. Since each value has at most log n bits, this also demonstrates that the certificate has a size of O((log n)2) bits. Since there are O(log n) values other than 2, and each requires at most one exponentiation to verify (and exponentiations dominate the running time), the total time is O((log n)3(log log n)(log log log n)), or √ï((log n)3), which is quite feasible for numbers in the range that computational number theorists usually work with. However, while useful in theory and easy to verify, actually generating a Pratt certificate for n requires factoring n ‚àí 1 and other potentially large numbers. This is simple for some special numbers such as Fermat primes, but currently much more difficult than simple primality testing for large primes of general form.  Atkin‚ÄìGoldwasser‚ÄìKilian‚ÄìMorain certificates  To address the problem of efficient certificate generation for larger numbers, in 1986 Shafi Goldwasser and Joe Kilian described a new type of certificate based on the theory of elliptic curves.Goldwasser, S. and Kilian, J. \\"Almost All Primes Can Be Quickly Certified\\". Proc. 18th STOC. pp. 316‚Äì329, 1986. Full text. This was in turn used by A. O. L. Atkin and Fran√ßois Morain as the basis for Atkin-Goldwasser-Kilian-Morain certificates, which are the type of certificates generated and verified by elliptic curve primality proving systems. Just as Pratt certificates are based on Lucas's theorem, Atkin‚ÄìGoldwasser‚ÄìKilian‚ÄìMorain certificates are based on the following theorem of Goldwasser and Kilian (lemma 2 of \\"Almost All Primes Can Be Quickly Certified\\"): : Theorem: Suppose we are given: :* a positive integer n not divisible by 2 or 3; :* Mx, My, A, B in \\\\mathbb{Z}_n (the integers mod n) satisfying My2 = Mx3 \\\\+ AMx \\\\+ B and with 4A3 \\\\+ 27B2 coprime to n; :* a prime q > n^{1/2} + 1 + 2n^{1/4}. : Then M = (Mx, My) is a non-identity point on the elliptic curve y2 = x3 \\\\+ Ax + B. Let kM be M added to itself k times using standard elliptic-curve addition. Then, if qM is the identity element I, then n is prime. Technically, an elliptic curve can only be constructed over a field, and \\\\mathbb{Z}_n is only a field if n is prime, so we seem to be assuming the result we're trying to prove. The difficulty arises in the elliptic-curve addition algorithm, which takes inverses in the field that may not exist in \\\\mathbb{Z}_n. However, it can be shown (lemma 1 of \\"Almost All Primes Can Be Quickly Certified\\") that if we merely perform computations as though the curve were well-defined and do not at any point attempt to invert an element with no inverse, the result is still valid; if we do encounter an element with no inverse, this establishes that n is composite. To derive a certificate from this theorem, we first encode Mx, My, A, B, and q, then recursively encode the proof of primality for q < n, continuing until we reach a known prime. This certificate has size O((log n)2) and can be verified in O((log n)4) time. Moreover, the algorithm that generates these certificates can be shown to be expected polynomial time for all but a small fraction of primes, and this fraction exponentially decreases with the size of the primes. Consequently, it's well-suited to generating certified large random primes, an application that is important in cryptography applications such as generating provably valid RSA keys.  Impact of \\"PRIMES is in P\\"  \\"PRIMES is in P\\" was a breakthrough in theoretical computer science. This article, published by Manindra Agrawal, Nitin Saxena, and Neeraj Kayal in August 2002, proves that the famous problem of checking primality of a number can be solved deterministically in polynomial time. The authors received the 2006 G√∂del Prize and 2006 Fulkerson Prize for this work. Because primality testing can now be done deterministically in polynomial time using the AKS primality test, a prime number could itself be considered a certificate of its own primality. This test runs in √ï((log n)6) time. In practice this method of verification is more expensive than the verification of Pratt certificates, but does not require any computation to determine the certificate itself.

She was the daughter of H. H. Asquith, Prime Minister from 1908‚Äì1916, and later became active in Liberal politics herself, being a leading opponent of appeasement, standing for Parliament and being made a life peer. She was also involved in arts and literature. Her illuminating diaries cover her father's premiership before and during the First World War and continue until the 1960s. She was Sir Winston Churchill's closest female friend, apart from his wife, and her grandchildren include the actress Helena Bonham Carter. Early life Violet Asquith was born in Hampstead, London, England, and grew up in a heavily political environment, living in 10 Downing Street at the time her father occupied it, and socialising with the key political figures of her day. She did not go to school, but was educated at home by governesses, and later sent to Paris and Dresden to improve her languages. Her mother, Helen Kelsall Melland, died of typhoid fever when Violet was only four. Her stepmother was Margot Tennant. Her best friend when she was young was Venetia Stanley, who had an affair with her father. Violet quarrelled constantly with her formidable stepmother Margot, much to her father's distress; in later life she admitted that despite their differences she respected Margot for her absolute devotion to Asquith. Violet Bonham Carter's father served a long and influential term as Prime Minister, especially during the peacetime portion of his premiership (1908‚Äì1914) when he presided over the People's Budget and the House of Lords limiting Parliament Act 1911. He was Prime Minister at the beginning of the First World War and then headed a coalition with the Conservative Party beginning in May 1915 until his resignation in December 1916. The Liberal Party split thereafter between followers of Asquith and of David Lloyd George, who had replaced him as Prime Minister. As the Liberal Party fell on hard times in the 1920s she became a tireless defender of her father and his reputation, beginning by campaigning for him at the 1920 Paisley by-election. She was particularly close to Winston Churchill, a leading member of her father's (and later Lloyd George's) administration, and whom she (successfully) urged her father to promote to the Cabinet in 1908. She was dismayed at his engagement that year to Clementine Hozier, whom Violet thought \\"as stupid as an owl\\". In late August, between his engagement and his marriage, Churchill spent a holiday with the Asquith family at New Slains Castle on the Scottish coast, and later admitted that he had \\"behaved badly\\" to Violet, as they were \\"almost engaged\\". Some days after his departure Violet went missing one evening, and she was discovered after a dangerous search by local people lasting several hours. Journalists were told that she had slipped and fallen onto a ledge, hitting her head, but in fact she had been found lying uninjured near the coastal path. Michael Shelden suggests that Churchill's holiday with Violet may have been the reason for Clementine's last-minute threat to call off their wedding, and that Violet's subsequent adventure on the cliffs may have been \\"an unhappy young woman's cry for attention\\".Shelden 2013, pp. 180‚Äì91. Marriage and children Violet Bonham Carter, Lady Ottoline Morrell, and an unidentified man. She married her father's Principal Private Secretary, Maurice \\"Bongie\\" Bonham Carter, in 1915. They had four children together: * Helen Laura Cressida Bonham Carter, Mrs Jasper Ridley, mother of the economist Sir Adam Ridley. * Laura Miranda Bonham Carter, Lady Grimond, wife of the Liberal Party leader Jo Grimond. * Mark Bonham Carter, Baron Bonham-Carter, a Liberal Member of Parliament before going to the House of Lords, and father of Jane Bonham Carter, Baroness Bonham-Carter of Yarnbury. * Raymond Bonham Carter, father of the actress Helena Bonham Carter. Political career Lady Violet lived in an age when women were uncommon in frontline British politics. She was nonetheless active as President of the Women's Liberal Federation (1923‚Äì25, 1939‚Äì45) and was the first woman to serve as President of the Liberal Party (1945‚Äì47). In the 1945 general election she stood for Wells, coming third, while in 1951 she stood for the winnable seat of Colne Valley. In the 1953 Coronation Honours she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE). As an old friend, Churchill arranged for the Conservatives to refrain from nominating a candidate for the constituency, giving her a clear run against Labour. She was nonetheless narrowly defeated. She continued to be a popular and charismatic speaker for Liberal candidates, including for her son-in-law Jo Grimond, her son Mark, and the then-rising star Jeremy Thorpe, and she was a frequent broadcaster on current affairs programmes on radio and television. Perhaps her greatest contribution, however, was as a much-esteemed orator and perceptive thinker on politics and policy issues, dedicated to classic Liberal politics in the mould of her father. She spoke on many platforms throughout the 1920s and 1930s, and along with Winston Churchill (and others), she very early on saw the dangers of European fascism. In seeking to awaken Britain and the world to the fascist peril, she joined and animated a number of anti-fascist groups (such as The Focus Group), often in concert with Churchill, and spoke at many of their gatherings. In a 1938 speech she mocked Neville Chamberlain's dealings with Nazi Germany as the policy of 'peace at any price that others can be forced to pay'. When the rest of the Czechoslovakia was destroyed on 15th of March 1939 she was supporting Czechoslovakian refugees and those which were persecuted by the Nazis. In the postwar years she was an active supporter of the United Nations and the cause of European Unity, advocating for Britain's entry into the Common Market. In the non-political sphere, she was also active in the arts, including serving as a Governor of the BBC from 1941‚Äì46, and a Governor of the Old Vic (1945‚Äì69). Her active political life was combined with air raid warden duties during the Second World War. Additionally, she was an avid keeper of diaries, which now form an important original source for historians of early 20th century Britain and contain many perceptive character sketches, as well as insights into contemporary events. Indeed, it was Lady Violet who in her book Winston Churchill As I Knew Him (1965), published in the U.S. as Winston Churchill: An Intimate Portrait, supplied one of the most famous ‚Äì and telling ‚Äì anecdotes about Winston Churchill, one apparently not recorded in her diaries or contemporaneous letters: this recounted how during the course of a deep conversation at the dinner party at which they first met, Churchill concluded a thought with words to the effect that \\"Of course, we are all worms, but I do believe that I am a glow worm.\\"Violet Bonham Carter, Winston Churchill as I Knew Him (London: Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1965; published in the USA as Winston Churchill: An Intimate Portrait), p. 16 On 21 December 1964, she was created a life peer as Baroness Asquith of Yarnbury in the County of Wiltshire, one of the first new Liberal peers in several decades. She became extremely active in the House of Lords. Her previous title, Lady Violet, was a courtesy title from her father's elevation to the peerage as Earl of Oxford and Asquith in 1925, and her husband was a knight of the realm. She and her husband were one of the few couples who both held titles in their own right. Death She died of a heart attack, aged 81, and was interred at St Andrew's Church, Mells, Somerset, near the home of her late brother, Raymond.

It is dedicated to studying and exploring the land, peoples, art and history of Alaska. The museum displays material from its permanent collection, along with regular visiting exhibitions. History The museum opened in 1968 in a building with an exhibition of 60 borrowed Alaska paintings, a collection of 2500 historic and ethnographic objects, and a staff of two. It was designed by Mitchell/Giurgola Architects. The museum has grown steadily and expanded three times since then, most recently in 2010, to its current size of with a collection of 25,000 objects and 500,000 historic photographs, and a staff of more than 50. First accredited in 1973, the museum has maintained its accreditation since. In 1992, the museum became the home for the Alaska office of the Smithsonian's NMNH Arctic Studies Center, which supports the museum's mission through research, education, and exhibitions. Service The Anchorage Museum is \\"a world-class museum located in the heart of Alaska's largest city\\". It welcomes over 180,000 annual visitors from Alaska and from around the world and serves as a cultural center for the community. The museum is repeatedly ranked among Alaska's top ten visitor attractions. Each year it presents 16‚Äì20 changing exhibitions complemented by education programs and activities. In 2006, 20,993 students and 47,836 adults participated in education programs. Permanent exhibits include an Alaska history gallery, Alaska art galleries, the Imaginarium Discovery Center science galleries and the Smithsonian Arctic Studies Center, which features Alaska Native artifacts on long-term loan from the Smithsonian Institution. The museum's library/archives are in frequent demand by publishers, scholars, and other researchers for its information and images. Titles held in the Library are accessible to students, scholars and the public via interlibrary loan on the web. The Smithsonian Institution's Arctic Studies Center conducts public programs and collaborative research programs to increase understanding of northern peoples, cultures and environments. It develops exhibitions and offers professional museum training workshops frequented by museum and cultural center personnel from across the state. =Geographic area served= The museum serves its statewide mission by organizing and presenting programs and exhibitions in Anchorage, as well as by traveling exhibitions throughout the state. Examples include exhibits shared with museums in Unalaska, Bethel, Homer, Ketchikan, Kenai, Fairbanks, Kodiak, Eek and Juneau. The museum provides professional recommendations on collections, exhibitions, education, archival organization and conservation to other Alaska museums, cultural centers and the public. Permanent collection The Anchorage Museum has over devoted to its permanent collection with a focus on Alaska history, Art of the North and Ethnography.Anchorage Museum =Alaska Gallery= A landscape painting of Denali, the tallest peak in North America by Sydney Laurence on display at the Anchorage Museum This gallery is devoted to Alaska's rich history from the native fauna through the time of the first early migrations to the present. The Alaska Gallery exhibits more than 1,000 objects and is one of the most complete presentations of Alaskan history and ethnology. Full-scale and miniature dioramas give insight into the lifestyles of Alaska's Native peoples, exploration and settlement by the Russians, the gold rush era, World War II and statehood in 1959.Anchorage Museum =Art of the North= The permanent art collection represents the vast range of art from Alaska and the circumpolar North. Seven galleries on the museum's ground floor are devoted to this collection. Exhibits include landscape paintings, drawings from early European expeditions to Alaska, works by contemporary artists, and an entire gallery of paintings by Sydney Laurence, perhaps Alaska's best known artist. Exhibitions and programs Exhibitions include juried shows, interpretive exhibitions and traveling exhibitions from other museums. The museum provides a substantial range of exhibits and programs that acquaint Alaskans with the art, culture, history and science of other peoples and places. In recent years, the museum has presented \\"Wrapped in Pride: Ghanaian Kente and African American Identity\\", \\"Tibet: Mountains and Valleys, Castles and Tents\\", \\"Woven Treasure: The Coverlets of Norway\\", and several exhibitions of Korean and Japanese ceramics. The museum also seeks to ensure that its Alaska-focused programming and exhibitions represent the diversity of immigrant heritages in Alaska and the Far North. Public programs include lectures, classes, workshops, films, public and school tours, and special events. Governance The museum is operated by the Anchorage Museum Association, a private non-profit organization under a long term contract with the Municipality of Anchorage. Its annual budget comes from earned income, fundraising and grants, and from the municipality. The municipality owns the museum facility and collections. The Anchorage Museum Foundation, a 501(c)(3) functionally integrated supporting organization, manages the permanent endowment and oversees the expansion project. =Staff= There are about 50 FTE staff members and they are organized into the following departments: Administration, Enterprise, Education, Exhibitions, Library/Archives, and Collections. The onsite personnel for the Smithsonian's Arctic Studies Center include an archeologist and an anthropologist. The museum relies on a robust volunteer program. Over 300 volunteers work as docents, in the shop, and in education, collections, exhibits and library/archives. Facilities Several Alaska Native arrows and a bow rest in the conservation lab at the museum in late March 2011. The museum's 170,000 square feet (16,000 m2) include galleries for interpretive exhibitions of its permanent collection and galleries for changing exhibitions. A large atrium, two classrooms and a 230-seat auditorium host a wide variety of programs, classes and special events. Back-of-house includes exhibit prep workshops, collections storage, and workspace, including a conservation laboratory. Expansion The new wing features the Smithsonian Institution's Arctic Studies Center, through which 600 Alaskan Native artifacts have returned to Alaska from the National Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of the American Indian for a long-term installation. There also are new galleries for changing exhibitions, an expanded library/archives, and improved visitor services, including Muse restaurant and a gift shop. fritted glass. The new extension to the museum was planned by David Chipperfield Architects Ltd., London. It created a new entrance and appearance for the whole museum by implementing a highly unique fa√ßade and building set-up. The fa√ßade was custom designed and supplied by Overgaard Ltd., Hong Kong to Architectural Wall Systems of West Des Moines, Iowa, a speciality glazing contractor. The scope of materials for this one-of-a-kind fa√ßade includes approx. 5900 m¬≤ of custom insulated fritted glass. This glazing type and pattern has never before been used and was specially developed for the project by both Architectural Wall Systems and Overgaard Ltd. To meet the extreme environmental conditions the insulated glass units are 24 mm thick. The outside sheet is tempered 6 mm low- iron sheer with a silver mirror frit. The inside sheet is 6 mm low-iron clear sheet. The frit is silver reflective on one side and metallic on the other. All glass units were pre-assembled prior to shipping to allow for easy installation.

Like the original Amerindian version it is usually made in a large pot and can be reheated and eaten over several days because the cassareep starts preserving the meat. Versions of the dish are also served in several other countries in the Caribbean, including Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, St. Vincent and Jamaica.

They contain fruit juice, have no artificial colours or flavours, and come in five flavours: lemon (yellow), lime (green), strawberry (red), blackcurrant (purple) and orange (orange). Rowntree's Fruit Pastilles originated in Fawdon, Tyneside, England in 1881. History At Rowntree's factory in Fawdon, Tyneside in 1881, Rowntree introduced Fruit Pastilles, and the product proved to be a great success, accounting for about 25 percent of the company's tonnage by 1887. Packaging Tubes of Fruit Pastilles are wrapped in foil-backed paper (paper on the inside, foil on the outside) with a paper wrapper over the top. The paper wrapper is green in colour with \\"Fruit Pastilles\\" written along the front in large lettering. Along the bottom of the lettering there are pictures of different types of fruit all relating to the flavours within the packet, The top bears the \\"Rowntree's\\" brand name. Fruit Pastilles come in a small pack weighing , containing 14 pastilles, but are also available in larger bags weighing . They are also available in boxes and larger round cardboard tubes. Marketing and advertising The 1972 television advertising campaign used the song Pistol Packin' Mama with the tag line \\"Pastille Pickin' Mama, pass those pastilles round\\". To drive awareness of the 25% fruit juice recipe in Fruit Pastilles, Rowntree conducted a 105-day experimental marketing campaign. At family events, top-end grocers and service stations they invited families to join in their 'What Can You Do But Chew?' talent shows, tying in with the brand's sponsorship of Britain's Got Talent. 427,240 product samples were distributed as brand ambassadors tried to engage parents with the '25% fruit juice' message. 93% of the consumers involved said they'd had a positive shift in brand perception, whilst more than half were 'highly likely' to purchase post campaign. A more recent TV commercial shows a man about to chew on a Fruit Pastille when he is surrounded by medieval people who declare whether he'd chew the pastille or go out on a date with a fair maiden. In the end he has to chew. The commercial concludes with the message \\"Rowntree's Fruit Pastilles with real fruit flavour. You can't help but chew!\\" A commercial from the 1980s has recently been revived, featuring a child daring a basketball player to not chew on a pastille. The slogan from the previous ad is still used.

Thomas Wrightington was born in Massachusetts. He was a shoemaker from Fall River, Massachusetts and moved to San Diego in 1833. He came with Abel Stearns on the Ayucucho, while Stearns continued up the coast to Los Angeles. Wrightington was probably the second American settler in San Diego, after Henry D. Fitch. Wrightington was naturalized as a Mexican citizen in 1838. He served as a volunteer in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Wrightington married Juana Machado Alipas, a widow with three children and daughter of Jos√© Manuel Machado, one of the first soldiers at the Presidio of San Diego and Serafina Valdez. She was born in June 1814. They had 3 sons and 1 daughter. Juana Machado Alipas de Wrightington, along with being a wife and mother, often rode with Father Ubach into the back country to visit the Indian rancher√≠as and to check conditions. Her neighbors called her the \\"Florence Nightingale of Old Town.\\" Wrightington served several offices under the Mexican and American governments. During 1844 and again during 1847 ‚Äì March 1848 he was Suplente (Substitute Justice of the Peace or Mayor) of San Diego Pueblo. Wrightington lived in the adobe built by his wife's first husband, Damasio Alipas around 1830. Wrightington added a wing in 1852. The adobe still stands in Old Town State Historical Park, in the west corner of the town square, and is open to the public as a retail store. Richard Henry Dana, Jr. in his novel Two Years Before the Mast commented on first coming ashore at San Diego that :sailor-like, [we] steered for the first grog-shop. This was a small mud building, of only one room, in which were liquors, dry and West India goods, shoes, bread, fruits, and everything which is vendible in California. It was kept by a Yankee [Thomas Wrightington], a one-eyed man, who belonged formerly to Fall River, came out to the Pacific in a whale-ship, left her at the Sandwich Islands [Hawaii] and came to California. ... the liquor was a real (12¬Ω cents) a glass. Wrightington died in 1853. According to Dana he \\"fell from his horse when drunk, and was found nearly eaten up by coyotes\\". Wrightington's widow Juana Wrightington remained in the house until the late 1890s. A room was rented out of her house to Dr. George McKinstry for over 30 years as a physician's office, with Juana as a nurse. Her final days were spent with her daughter Serafina Israel in Coronado. She died on December 24, 1901. Juana is buried in Calvary Cemetery (now Pioneer Park) in Mission Hills, San Diego with a headstone that reads \\"JUANITA WRIGHTINGTON 1814‚Äì1901\\".

It was founded in 1063Discover Caen by William the Conqueror and is one of the most important Romanesque buildings in Normandy. William the Conqueror Tomb of William the Conqueror The concurrent founding of the Abbey of Saint-√âtienne to the West of the Caen Castle and the Abbey of Sainte- Trinit√© (Abbaye aux Dames) to its East seems to be a direct result of the reconciliation process of William, Duke of Normandy (soon after to become William I, King of England), and Pope Leo IX. William fell out with the pope when he married his cousin Matilda of Flanders after 1049 despite Leo's interdiction. Lanfranc of Pavia, Prior of Bec Abbey, who himself had initially expressed concerns regarding the marriage, acted on William's behalf to secure Leo's forgiveness. For this successful service, Lanfranc was made abbot of Saint-√âtienne. William's wife Matilda died in 1083 and was buried in the Abbaye aux Dames. After his own death in 1087 in Rouen, the body of King William was sent to Caen to be buried in Saint-√âtienne, according to his wishes. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb. The corpse was too large for the space, and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church. William's tomb has been disturbed several times since 1087, the first time in 1522 when the grave was opened on orders from the papacy. The intact body was restored to the tomb at that time. In 1562, during the French Wars of Religion, the grave was again opened and the original tombstone of black marble, similar to that of Matilda in the Abbaye aux Dames, was destroyed. William's bones were scattered and lost, with the exception of one thigh bone. This lone relic was reburied in 1642 with a new marker, which was replaced 100 years later with a more elaborate monument. This tomb was again destroyed during the French Revolution, but was eventually replaced with the current early 19th-century ledger stone in white marble. Architecture Interior view of St.-√âtienne The abbey was to be built in Caen stone, and construction began in 1066. For many decades during the 11th century, there was a mutually fruitful competition between Saint-√âtienne and its sister building Sainte-Trinit√©. An important feature added to both churches in about 1120 was the ribbed vault, used for the first time in France. The two abbey churches are considered forerunners of the Gothic. The original Romanesque apse was replaced in 1166 by an early Gothic chevet, complete with rose windows and flying buttresses. Nine towers and spires were added in the 13th century. The interior vaulting shows a similar progression, beginning with early sexpartite vaulting (using circular ribs) in the nave and progressing to quadripartite vaults (using pointed ribs) in the sanctuary. Later history As a consequence of the Wars of Religion, the high lantern tower in the middle of the church collapsed and was never rebuilt. The Benedictine abbey was suppressed during the French Revolution and the abbey church became a parish church. From 1804 to 1961, the abbey buildings accommodated a prestigious high school, the Lyc√©e Malherbe. During the Normandy Landings, inhabitants of Caen found refuge in the church; on the rooftop there was a red cross, made with blood on a sheet, to show that it was a hospital (to avoid bombings).

It is the opening track from their 1991 album Achtung Baby, a record on which the group reinvented themselves musically by incorporating influences from alternative rock, industrial, and electronic dance music. As the album's opening track, \\"Zoo Station\\" introduces the band's new sound, delivering industrial-influenced percussion and several layers of distorted guitars and vocals. Similarly, the lyrics suggest the group's new intents and anticipations. The introduction, featuring an \\"explosion\\" of percussion and a descending glissando for a guitar hook, was meant to make the listener think the album was mistakenly not U2's latest record or that their music player was broken. The song's lyrics were inspired by a surrealistic story about Berlin from World War II that lead vocalist Bono heard, when overnight bombing damaged the zoo and allowed animals to escape and wander around the city's rubble. Bono was also inspired by the city's Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station and used it as a metaphor for a reuniting Germany. \\"Zoo Station\\" was performed as the opening song at every concert on U2's Zoo TV Tour. The song received positive reviews from critics, many of whom analysed the song as a representation of the band's reinvention. Writing and recording Following difficult recording sessions at Hansa Studios in Berlin in late 1990, U2 undertook the second phase of the recording sessions for Achtung Baby in Dublin.McCormick (2006), pp. 224‚Äì225, 232 They struggled with the song \\"Lady With the Spinning Head\\" (later released as a B-side), but three separate tracks, \\"Zoo Station\\", \\"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\\" and \\"The Fly\\", were derived from it. The band ultimately decided to take \\"Zoo Station\\" in a more industrial direction than \\"Lady With the Spinning Head\\". Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station, colloquially called Bahnhof Zoo (\\"Zoo Station\\") in Germany, partially inspired the song's lyrics. \\"Zoo Station\\" came together near the end of the recording sessions when audio engineer Flood was mixing the song and introduced distortion to the drums. The song's direction was largely influenced by the production team of Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Flood. Lead vocalist Bono had been disappointed with his vocals from early recording sessions for the album and told the production team, \\"Let's just try something that's gonna put me in a completely different place\\".Stokes (2005), p. 96 After they distorted his voice to make it sound as if it were coming from a megaphone, Bono was inspired to sing in a persona, as the effect gave his vocals a different \\"emotional feel\\". Flood mixed the final track with the assistance of Shannon Strong. Along with Robbie Adams, Strong also assisted Flood with engineering. Lanois provided additional guitar during recording. With Achtung Baby, the group sought to recover some of the Dadaist characters and stage antics they had dabbled with in the late 1970s as teenagers. U2 had abandoned these ideas for more literal themes in the 1980s. However, for the new album, the band was interested in no longer making obvious sense. Accordingly, the lyrics for \\"Zoo Station\\" were inspired by the surrealism of a story about Berlin during World War II that Bono heard. Animals escaped the city's zoo after it was damaged in overnight bombing, and as a result, rhinoceroses, pelicans and flamingoes wandered around the next morning while people were sifting through the rubble. Bono was also inspired by Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station, also known as \\"Zoo station\\", previously the main railway station in West Berlin. The station was notorious as a haunt for drug dealers, prostitutes and pimps, pick-pockets and transients, particularly prior to German reunification, when it was run by the East German railway. He compared the song to the station, saying \\"it was written as an opening track, the beasts breaking out of their cages\\", and was interested in using the zoo as a metaphor and he took further inspiration from the subway station representing Europe at a crossroads. During recording, Eno created several prototype mixes of the song. The Edge recalled how these different mixes assisted the band in creating the final version of the track. One of these early versions was later released under the title \\"Bottoms (Watashitachi No Ookina Yume)\\" as a bonus track on the UK and Japanese promotional releases of the experimental 1995 album Original Soundtracks 1 by Passengers, a side project by U2 and Eno, as well as a B-side on some versions of the \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" single. \\"Bottoms (Watashitachi No Ookina Yume)\\" is an instrumental track and was described by The Edge as a \\"crazy\\" mix.Stokes (2005), p. 194 He added \\"'Bottoms' was done in Japan, and we just built on that mix. Sometimes you can end up with something completely distinctive.\\" Although \\"Zoo Station\\" was not released as a single, it was included on a 12-inch promotional recording to promote U2's Zoo TV Tour in North America, along with studio and remix versions of \\"Lady with the Spinning Head\\". Composition As the first track on an album that was a major reinvention for the band, \\"Zoo Station\\" was an introduction to U2's new sound. The song features layers of distorted guitar and vocals, and industrial-influenced percussion. Irish rock journalist Bill Graham cites David Bowie's album Low as a major influence on \\"Zoo Station\\", which he called a \\"new brand of glam rock\\" with \\"Spartan rhythms and sudden flurries of melody\\".Graham (2004), pp. 43‚Äì47 The song is played at a tempo of 130 beats per minute in a 4/4 time signature, but only one element of the song's introduction, a marimba-like texture, is played in common time.Fast (2000), pp. 45‚Äì48 This sound, which has been compared to that of a clock ticking, was achieved by picking the guitar's D string behind the bridge and the stopbar. On the second half of the third beat, the song's signature guitar riff, a distorted descending glissando, enters. The glissando descends past the octave it begins in by a major second before returning to it. After the second time it is played, an \\"explosion\\" of percussion is heard, playing on beat four of every second measure on two occasions. This percussion sound, played by Flood, enters early the third time, being played on beat two.Assayas (2005), p. 75 The drums then enter, before stopping and starting again. Much like the song's guitar sounds, the drums' timbre is noticeably different from previous U2 songs as it exhibits a \\"cold, processed sound, something like beating on a tin can\\".Zak (2001), pp. 68‚Äì70 Amidst layers of various guitar sounds, the bass enters, the part played in the introduction and verses consisting of repeating G and A notes, mimicking the ascending portion of the guitar riff after the glissando overshoots the octave. After the bass begins, the song's regular groove is established. At 0:45, the chord progression changes. Fifteen seconds later, the song returns to the previous chord progression and the introduction ends. Guitarist The Edge explained that some of the sounds in the introduction that resemble keyboards were actually created by him on guitar. Of the song's introduction, bassist Adam Clayton says, \\"When people put on the record, we wanted their first reaction to be either 'this record is broken' or 'this can't be the new U2 record, there's been a mistake.' So there is quite a dramatic extended intro where you just don't know what you are listening to.\\" Author Albin Zak, in his book The Poetics of Rock, says of the introduction, \\"Before any words are sung, the sounds alone alert the listener that the band has moved into new expressive territory.\\" After the introduction, the song follows a conventional verse-chorus form. The first verse begins one minute into the song, with Bono announcing, \\"I'm ready, I'm ready for the laughing gas\\". During the verses, he sings primarily in a medium-to-low range and his vocals are treated with heavy processing, which takes out the bottom of the sound and \\"emasculate[s]\\" his voice. The processing also introduces a wavering quality to his vocals. The guitar glissando continues to be played during the verses. The first chorus begins at 1:44, and the music mirrors the change in chord progression from the introduction's last 15 seconds. During the chorus, the bassline becomes more dynamic, playing descending quarter notes of G‚ÄìF‚ÄìD‚ÄìC‚ÄìD‚ÄìC‚ÄìA‚ÄìG‚ÄìA, before resuming the previous G and A pattern. Bono's vocals also become more dynamic in the chorus, featuring layers of both \\"open- throated\\" singing and monotone lyric recitation, as well as both processed and unprocessed vocals. Along with introducing the band's new sound, the song opens the album as a statement of intent. Lyrically, new anticipations and appetites are suggested (\\"I'm ready for what's next\\"), as is a willingness to throw caution to the wind and take risks (\\"I'm ready to let go of the steering wheel\\"). Some of the lyrics, particularly those in the bridge before the final chorus, use the eponymous subway station as a metaphor for time: \\"Time is a train / Makes the future the past / Leaves you standing in the station / Your face pressed up against the glass\\". Bono cites the enjoyment of his first child born in 1989 as a major influence on Achtung Baby, as was his wife's second pregnancy during the album's 1991 recording. Bono says babies influenced the lines from the first verse, \\"I'm ready to say I'm glad to be alive / I'm ready, I'm ready for the push\\".McCormick (2006), pp. 216, 221 Reception and legacy Upon the release of Achtung Baby, \\"Zoo Station\\" was praised by many critics. Steve Morse of The Boston Globe said the song was one on which \\"sonic assaults are teamed with dreamily processed vocals that recall Beatles psychedelia\\". The Orlando Sentinel called it \\"blistering\\" and praised the low mixing of Bono's vocals, which allowed The Edge's \\"new versatility\\" on guitar to draw more attention. BBC Music enjoyed \\"The Edge's guitar squall and electronics\\" creating a \\"dense sound [that] is irresistible\\", noting that \\"Zoo Station\\" was one track where the strategy \\"creates moods rather than hummable tunes\\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that the song \\"announces a change, starting with a metallic clank, a buzzing guitar slide and a repeated electronic crunch‚Äînothing ethereal\\". He also noted that Bono's voice was \\"electronically masked and the band's old style traded for a pushy bassline and a percussive stomp, although U2 can't resist some sweeter interludes\\". Rolling Stone was complimentary of The Edge, comparing his style of guitar playing on the song to using a rhythm instrument by \\"repeating a dark, buzzing phrase that drives the beat\\". Allmusic reviewed the track favourably, saying \\"there are layers to Bono's lyrics\\" and that by the end of the track, the song and the band are \\"soaring\\". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune likened the song's introduction to \\"trying to out-demolish Ministry\\" with \\"grating metal-on-metal percussion and a belching guitar\\". He commented that the \\"rude awakening\\" that the song provides on the album as the opening track could only compare with the \\"fingernails-on-chalkboard guitar scuzz\\" of Neil Young's \\"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\\" from Rust Never Sleeps. The song subsequently appeared as one of seven U2 songs in the 2006 music reference book 1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories, and Secrets.Creswell (2006), pp. 377‚Äì378 \\"Zoo Station\\" is featured in the 2002 British comedy-drama film About a Boy. In one scene, the main character, Will (Hugh Grant), turns up the volume of the song as a \\"childless effort\\" to ignore Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), a boy ringing Will's doorbell, prompting Marcus to ring it in unison with the beat of the song. The song was covered by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails on the 2011 cover album AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered. Live performances During performances of \\"Zoo Station\\" on the Zoo TV Tour, Bono would arrive on-stage as his stage persona \\"The Fly\\". \\"Zoo Station\\" made its live debut on the opening night of the Zoo TV Tour on 29 February 1992 in Lakeland, Florida, and was performed as the opening song at each of the 156 Zoo TV concerts. During performances of \\"Zoo Station\\", Bono appeared on-stage silhouetted against a giant screen of blue and white video noise, making his entrance as his leather-clad stage persona \\"The Fly\\",Flanagan (1996), p. 61 often goose-stepping his way onto the stage. The Edge described the visual imagery displayed for the song in the context of Zoo TV's \\"sensory overload\\" that was intended as a commentary on mass media: \\"'Zoo Station' is four minutes of a television that's not tuned in to any station, but giving you interference and 'shash' and almost a TV picture.\\" \\"Zoo Station\\" was not played during the subsequent PopMart and Elevation Tours, but it returned to the group's set lists on the Vertigo Tour. The song was most often performed during the first encore, along with other Achtung Baby/Zoo TV-era songs, as part of a mini-Zoo TV set paying homage to the band's 1990s era. It made its last appearance in November 2006 and was not played live again until the September 24, 2015 concert on the Innocence + Experience Tour. Live performances of the song appear on the video releases Zoo TV: Live from Sydney and Vertigo 2005: Live from Chicago. A live version of \\"Zoo Station\\" from the Vertigo Tour also appears as a B-side on the maxi single for \\"Window in the Skies\\".

Their style of music is a combination of various rock subgenres, including grunge and post-hardcore. History =Seaweed and Despised (1989‚Äì1991)= The band started out in 1989, consisting of vocalist Aaron Stauffer, guitarist Clint Werner, guitarist Wade Neal, bassist John Atkins, and drummer Bob Bulgrien. All 5 members were still attending high school at the time, and most of them were already active in other local bands. Their first major tour was alongside the band Superchunk. Throughout the next few years, the band would release various one-off singles. In 1990, a smaller label known as Tupelo (known for releases by the bands Jawbreaker, Nirvana, and The Melvins) approached the band to release their first album. Instead, the band compiled their previous singles, and recorded 1 new song, to release Seaweed. As stated in later interviews and the name of the band's 1993 album, this is considered to be the band's first major release. In 1990, Seaweed signed to the thriving Seattle label Sub Pop. The label wanted a single but the band wanted a full-length. They met halfway, and released the EP Despised. 6 songs would be brand new tracks, recorded with producer Jack Endino. The remaining 4 tracks were slightly remixed from their previous release, Seaweed; thus, angering their former label Tupelo. =Weak and Four (1992‚Äì1994)= The band continued their relationship with Sub Pop, releasing their third major release (and first actual full-length) in 1992, titled Weak. Again produced by Endino, the band supported the album with a summer U.S. tour, followed by a condensed European tour with the band Pavement, stretching 69 shows over 71 days. After the exhausting touring schedule, the band went home to record their follow-up album. After impressing Sub Pop with their self-production work on a 2-song single titled \\"Measure\\", the label allowed the band to self- produce their 1993 effort Four (being the band's 4th major release). Sub Pop promoted the album more heavily than their past albums, releasing more versions of this album and having their songs featured on more compilations. Around this time, Seaweed toured with the bands Bad Religion and Green Day, a tour that Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt joked as \\"The BadGreenWeed Tour\\". Four contained the single \\"Kid Candy\\", which was most prominently featured in a season 4 episode of the TV show Beavis and Butt-head. \\"Losing Skin\\" was also released as a single from this album, and would be more prominently featured on the soundtrack for the video game NHL 2K7 13 years later. Seaweed would get another shot at exposure, as their cover of Fleetwood Mac's hit song \\"Go Your Own Way\\" was featured in the 1994 film Clerks and its soundtrack, despite being recorded a year earlier. Also in 1994, the band made an appearance on the radio program hosted by John Peel.[ John Peel Sub Pop Sessions 1989-1993] AllMusic =Spanaway and Actions and Indications (1995‚Äì1999)= After fulfilling their contract to Sub Pop, Seaweed found a new home on major record label Hollywood Records. Their 1995 album Spanaway became the band's major label debut, and their most successful to date. The single \\"Start With\\" would be Seaweed's only appearance on a Billboard chart, peaking at #38 on the Alternative Songs chart in 1995. In the summer of that year, Seaweed was notable as being a part of the lineup for the first ever Vans Warped Tour; however, unlike many of the other bands, they would not make anymore appearances after that year. Despite the label's initial large financial advance and marketing promises, the album did not sell well as expected. It took the band over a year to be released from their contract. Afterwards, the band would experience their first lineup change, as drummer Bulgrien left the band. He was replaced by Quicksand drummer Alan Cage. They would decide on the label Merge Records as their next home. The label was putting out albums by Seaweed's friends such as Superchunk and Neutral Milk Hotel, and so the transition was seamless. The band's next album, Actions and Indications, came out in early 1999; however, the exposure from their previous 2 albums had diminished, and the band was exhausted from touring. After playing an anniversary show for Merge Records in the summer of 1999, Seaweed disbanded. =Reunion (2007‚Äì2014)= In 2007, Seaweed reunited to play sporadic shows, including Sub Pop's 20th anniversary show in 2008. The reunited lineup included new member Jesse Fox on drums. The band had mentioned a new album was being recorded, titled Small Engine Repair. The album never came to fruition, as the band did not have a creative drive, and also did not want to extensively tour. A few songs from these sessions were later released in 2011, as the \\"Service Deck\\"/\\"The Weight\\" single. Since the band's albums spanned different labels, the only release to see a reissue is 1999's Actions and Indications, which included 3 unreleased bonus tracks as a download. Since their reunion in 2007, the band has played various shows and festivals, but no full tour. Their last show was in May 2014. Frontman Stauffer works as a nurse in Northern California and has said \\"It‚Äôs hard to play a show because it hurts me physically. I only have one show in me. I can‚Äôt do two.\\" Band members =Final= *Aaron Stauffer ‚Äì vocals (1989‚Äì1999, 2007‚Äì2014) *Clint Werner ‚Äì guitar (1989‚Äì1999, 2007‚Äì2014) *Wade Neal ‚Äì guitar (1989‚Äì1999, 2007‚Äì2014) *John Atkins ‚Äì bass (1989‚Äì1999, 2007‚Äì2014) *Jesse Fox ‚Äì drums (2007‚Äì2014) =Former= *Bob Bulgrien ‚Äì drums (1989‚Äì1996) *Alan Cage ‚Äì drums (1996‚Äì1999) Discography =Albums= *Seaweed (EP) (1990, Leopard Gecko/Tupelo) *Despised (EP) (1991, Sub Pop) *Weak (1992, Sub Pop) *Four (1993, Sub Pop) *Spanaway (1995, Hollywood Records) *Actions and Indications (1999, Merge Records) =Singles= *Seaweed 7\\" (1989, Leopard Gecko) *#\\"Inside\\" *#\\"Stargirl\\" *#\\"Re-think\\" *#\\"Love Gut\\" *Just A Smirk 7\\" (1990, Leopard Gecko) *#\\"Just A Smirk\\" *#\\"Installing\\" *Seaweed/ Superchunk/ Geek\\" (1990, Leopard Gecko) *#\\"Patchwork\\" *Deertrap 7\\" (1991, K Records) *#\\"Deertrap\\" *#\\"Carousel\\" *Bill 7\\" (1992, Subpop) *#\\"Bill\\" *#\\"Pumpkin (Wwax)\\" *Bill 12\\"/CD (1992, Subpop) *#\\"Bill\\" *#\\"Pumpkin (Wwax)\\" *#\\"Squint: The Killerest Expression\\" *Measure 7\\" (1992, Subpop) *#\\"Measure\\" *#\\"Turnout\\" *Measure 12\\"/CD (1992, Subpop) *#\\"Measure\\" *#\\"Turnout\\" *#\\"Taxing\\" (demo version) *Go Your Own Way CD (1993, Subpop) *#\\"Go Your Own Way\\" *#\\"Losing Skin\\" (remix) *#\\"Card Tricks\\" *#\\"She Cracked\\" (Nathan Rox) *Go Your Own Way 7\\"/CD (1993, Subpop) *#\\"Go Your Own Way\\" *#\\"Losing Skin\\" (remix) *#\\"She Cracked\\" *Kid Candy PROMO CD (1993, Subpop) *#\\"Kid Candy\\" (radio edit) *#\\"Sing Through Me\\" *#\\"Shephard's Pie\\" *Free Drug Zone CD (1995, Hollywood) *#\\"Baggage\\" (demo version) CD only *Free Drug Zone/Losing Skin Green Vinyl 7\\" (1996, Hollywood) *#\\"Baggage\\" (demo version) CD only *Service Deck/The Weight 7\\" (2011, No Idea Records) =Music Videos= *One Out of Four (1991) *Bill (1992) *Squint (1992) *Measure (1993) *Losing Skin (1993) *Kid Candy (1993) *Start With (1995) =Compilation appearances= *The Estrus Lunch Bucket (Estrus, 1990) **\\"Bewitched\\" *Three's A Company (Simple Machines/Merge Records/Leopard Gecko, 1990) **\\"Patchwork\\" *The Estrus Half-Rack (Estrus, 1991) **\\"Foggy Eyes\\" (Beat Happening) *International Pop Underground Convention (K Records, 1991) **\\"Bill\\" *Fortune Cookie Prize (Simple Machines, 1992) **\\"Foggy Eyes\\" (Beat Happening) *Revolution Come 'n' Gone (Subpop, 1992) **\\"Baggage\\" *International Hip Swing (K Records, 1993) **\\"Deer Trap\\" *Alternative Route '94 (?) **\\"Losing Skin\\" *Jabberjaw No. 4 (Mammoth Records, 1994) **\\"My Letters\\" *Jabberjaw No. 5 Good To The Last Drop (Mammoth Records, 1994) **\\"My Letters\\" *John Peel Sub Pop Sessions (Sub Pop, 1994)[ John Peel Sub Pop Sessions 1989-1993] AllMusic **\\"Sit in Glass\\" **\\"She Cracked\\" *Music From The Motion Picture Clerks (Sony, 1994) **\\"Go Your Own Way\\" *West X North-South (Vagrant Records, 1995) **\\"Sing Through Me\\" *Oh, Merge (Merge Records, 1999) **\\"Brand New Order\\" *Live At Emo's (Rise Records, year ?) **\\"Baggage\\" *Patchwork Compilation (Mere Exposure Records, 2002) **\\"Days Missed Dearly\\" *Nowcore!

Life In 1158 or 1159 Nigel, Bishop of Ely paid Henry II to appoint his natural son, Richard FitzNeal, as the king's treasurer.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 103Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: Volume 1, St. Paul's, London: Prebendaries: Chiswick Richard was the great nephew of Roger, bishop of Salisbury, who had organized the exchequer under Henry I, when it was separated from the Chamberlain's office in the king's household. Henry II, who was an astute judge of character and inspired great loyalty, was well served by Richard, who held the post of Lord Treasurer at the head of Henry's exchequer for almost the next 40 years. Concurrently Richard was Dean of Lincoln, a major administrative position in an important English diocese. In 1184 he was made Prebendary of Aylesbury.Prebendaries 1092 to 1842 ‚Äì Aylesbury accessed on 3 September 2007 He also held the prebend of Chiswick in the diocese of London. In 1177 Henry II asked FitzNeal to write a book about his work. The book, Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer (Dialogus de Scaccario), is the first administrative treatise of the Middle Ages, a unique source of information on royal finances and the methods of collecting them in the twelfth century. Its preface instructs the novice in governance that it is not the function of the exchequer officials to decide on the merit of royal policy, merely to execute it. The secular bureaucracy is the instrument of the king's will, and the royal power ebbs and flows according to whether his treasury is full or empty. He wrote at the end of the work that he had \\"laid my axe to the virgin and rough wood and cut for the royal buildings timber that a more skilled builder may smooth with his adze\\".Quoted in Clanchy From Memory to Written Record p. 19 It is in the Dialogue that Richard recorded an oral story told to him by Henry of Blois, grandson of William the Conqueror and Bishop of Winchester, about the origins of Domesday Book, which according to Henry of Blois's story was made so that \\"every man might be content with his own rights, and not encroach unpunished on those of others\\".Clanchy From Memory to Written Record p. 25 As well as being treasurer, FitzNeal was rewarded with the position of bishop of London from 1189 until his death in 1198.

The park is located two miles (3 km) northwest of the city of Crystal River, on Museum Point off U.S. 19/98. Under the title of Crystal River Indian Mounds, it is also a U.S. National Historic Landmark (designated as such on September 29, 1970). History The park contains a six-mound complex, occupied from the Deptford period through Santa Rosa-Swift Creek culture and up to the Late Fort Walton period. This timespan makes it one of the longest continually occupied sites in Florida, believed to have been occupied for 1,600 years. Native Americans traveled long distances to the complex to bury their dead and to engage in trading activities. An estimated 7,500 people may have visited the complex annually when it was occupied. The complex contains burial mounds, temple/platform mounds, a plaza area, and a midden. The earliest burials at the site are believed to be located in the conical mound and date back to about 250 BC. Many of the people buried in this mound had copper tools and ornaments buried with them. The copper artifacts came from the Ohio River area through a trade network developed by the Hopewell culture that existed at the time. There seemed to be indirect trading between the people who lived here and the Hopewell culture. People that were buried later did not have this type of artifacts buried with them and some burials do not contain artifacts. This tells us that over the 2,000 years that ancient people used the site, burial practices and ceremonies changed. It also tells us that trading with the northern portions of North America changed. The shell and sand ring also contains burials some of which were placed between layers of shells while others were not. It is not clear why this occurred or whether it was related to status or just a change in the burial customs. The platform was constructed as burials filled in the gap between the ring and the cone. It is estimated that about 1,200 to 1,500 people are buried in this complex.Crystal River State parks Over a period of approximately 1,900 years, beginning about 500 BC, the Native Americans at the Crystal River Site threw away great quantities of materials that would form the middens that adorn the site. This \\"midden material\\" contained various kinds of woodland animal bones, fish bones, turtle shells, broken pottery, broken hand tools and arrowheads. By the time of abandonment, the midden area had reached in length, in width, in depth, and was formed into a crescent shape. Two large platform mounds are believed to have been used primarily for ceremonial purposes. A paved loop trail passes by each mound, with signs interpreting the mounds. A 55 step observation deck atop the park's largest mound, Temple Mound, provides a panoramic view of the area. The park contains coastal marsh and is part of the Great Florida Birding Trail. The park is also home to a limestone slab, possibly a \\"stele\\", on which is a crudely carved human face and torso. This is odd because the slab is one that is not found on other mound sites except in locations such as the Caribbean, South America, and Central America. At this particular site there were at least four of these large stones placed by the inhabitants in their ancient time. This carving shows that the person represented possessed long hair in a plume over the left shoulder. There has been debate as to how strongly this inscribed stone slab was influenced by the monumental stelae of Mesoamerica. Although there may be some evidence for contact between the Huastec Culture of the Mexican Gulf Coast and the American Southeast,Bullen, Ripley P. (1966). \\"Stelae at the Crystal River Site, Florida\\". American Antiquity, 31(6):865 those claims which suggest the most direct connections are probably unfounded. The slab is today housed on the site within a metal cage. Recreational activities Activities include salt and fresh water fishing, picnicing, bird watching and a boat tour of Crystal River. Amenities include a small picnic area. The visitor center/museum features an open captioned video about the tribes that once lived in the area, and houses a collection of artifacts from the site, including arrowheads, pottery, jewelry, stone and bone tools. A centerpiece diorama dominates the interior of the museum, depicting a scale model of the site as it may have looked centuries before its abandonment. Hours Florida state parks are open between 8 a.m. and sundown every day of the year (including holidays). The museum is open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Thursday through Monday. The museum is closed Tuesday and Wednesday. See also *Mound *Mound builder (people) *Earthwork (archaeology) References Sources *Thomas J. Pluckhahn, Victor D. Thompson.

Biography He was born in Modena, and moved to Parma with his father, a mask-maker who served the Farnese court. In 1595 Schedoni traveled to Rome, where he apprenticed briefly under Federico Zuccari with the sponsorship of Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma.Miller, Dwight C. \\"Schedoni, Bartolomeo\\". Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. After falling ill, he returned to Parma. The baroque art historian Count Carlo Cesare Malvasia (1616‚Äì1693) claims that Schedoni trained under Annibale Carracci in Bologna, although this is questionable; his early work reveals instead his study of Correggio's works in Parma. Schedoni's earliest known commission was in 1598. He left Parma after an imprisonment for assault, and relocated to Modena. There he served as painter to the court of Cesare d‚ÄôEste, and collaborated with Ercole dell'Abate in decorating the ceiling of the Sala del Consiglio Vecchio of the Palazzo Comunale. After an interruption caused by Schedoni's imprisonment for another altercation, this work was completed in July 1607. After December 1607, he worked in Parma for the court of Ranuccio I. The duke greatly esteemed Schedoni, and gave him a farm at when Schedoni married in 1611. Schedoni's works included small devotional images and the large altarpiece Holy Family in Glory Worshipped by SS John the Baptist, Francis of Assisi, Lawrence and Peregrinus. Schedoni died on 23 December 1615. According to the Modenese chronicler Giovanni Battista Spaccini, he died in a \\"fit of passion\\"‚Äîpossibly a suicide‚Äîafter a night of heavy gambling losses. Style Deposition, 1613, Galleria Nazionale of Parma Schedoni's paintings often depict brilliantly lit figures set against a dark background. Great emphasis is given to the angular patterns of brightly colored drapery, which, according to the art historian Lawrence Gowing, \\"almost obscure the narrative content of the scene and instead disseminate a pervading sense of emotional emergency.\\" Schedoni's late manner shows the influence of Ludovico Carracci. Another important influence on Schedoni's style and subjects was Caravaggio, whose Entombment of Christ (1603‚Äì04) provided the prototype for Schedoni's Deposition (c. 1613) in the Galleria Nazionale of Parma.Zirpolo, Lilian H. (2010). Historical Dictionary of Baroque Art and Architecture. Lanham, Md: Scarecrow Press. p. 480. . The Parmesan painter Giovanni Lanfranco was among those who found inspiration in Schedoni's theatrical style. Schedoni's masterpieces are in the Galleria Nazionale of Parma, and were the two paintings intended for the altar of the church of the Capuchin convent in Fontevivo, near Parma.

Title page of A System of Heraldry. Alexander Nisbet (bapt. 23 March 1657; died 7 Dec. 1725) was a Scottish lawyer and antiquarian. He is remembered for his works on the subject of heraldry, which are generally considered to be some of the most complete and authoritative ever produced in the British Isles. Life Nisbet was born in Edinburgh, the third of ten children of Adam Nisbet WS and his wife Janet, only daughter of Alexander Aikenhead WS. Adam, and later Alexander, were chiefs of the ancient Nisbet family, of Nisbet in Berwickshire; however, the family had recently lost much of their wealth due to their zealous support of King Charles in the civil war, and had been forced to sell their ancestral estate. In his Essay on Additional Figures and Marks of Cadency, Nisbet remarks that he \\"had a very early inclination to the study of herauldry, and when a boy ... looked on its figures with wonder, and often wish'd to know their names and signification.\\" Nisbet matriculated at Edinburgh University in 1675, where he studied philosophy. After graduating in 1682, he was employed as a solicitor for a number of years before giving it up in order to devote his full-time to his historical and heraldic studies. He later became a teacher, instructing various members of the nobility, including the Earl of Carnwrath. Around the turn of the 18th century he set out to create a comprehensive treatise on heraldry. He initially intended to obtain funding via subscription, but finding that this would not produce enough money, he appealed to the Scottish Parliament for help. Though they promised him ¬£248 6s 8d, this was never delivered, and the passing of the Act of Union put paid to any chance of further parliamentary assistance. Nisbet's System of Heraldry was finally published in 1722, over twenty years after he had first set out to write the work. He died three years later, likely in poverty, and was buried close to the Nisbet Tomb in Greyfriars Kirk, though the exact location is now lost. His contemporary George Crawford wrote of him: \\"he was a worthy, modest gentleman, who had as many friends and as few enemies as any man I have known.\\" In 1934 his kinsman Robert Chancellor Nesbitt arranged for John Buchan to unveil a memorial plaque in Greyfriars, which can still be seen today. Nisbet never married, and as such, the linear line of the Nisbets of that Ilk ended upon his death. The chiefly line was reestablished in 1995, in the favour of distant cousin Robert Anthony Ellis Nesbitt. Publications * An Essay on Additional Figures and Marks of Cadency.

Jakuba w Szczecinie, German: Jakobskathedrale or also Jakobikirche Stettin) - was built by the citizens of the city and modeled after the Church of St Mary in L√ºbeck. It is the largest church in Pomerania and for many years after the reformation was part of the Pomeranian Evangelical Church, but since World War II and the handing over of Stettin (name of the city in German language) from Germany to Poland it has been rebuilt as a Roman Catholic cathedral. History The church was established in 1187 and the Romanesque-style building was completed in the 14th century. One of its two towers collapsed during a storm in 1456 and destroyed part of the church. Reconstruction lasted until 1503 and the entire church was remodelled based on a single-tower hall church design. The church was destroyed again in 1677 during the Scanian War and rebuilt between 1690 and 1693 in the Baroque style. In 1893, the church was remodelled again however, the west tower collapsed during a storm in 1894 and had to be rebuilt. This renovation was completed in 1901 leaving the church with a spire of 119 metres (390 feet). Air raids on the night of 16 August 1944 during World War II resulted in collapse of the spire added in 1901 and extensive damage to other parts of the building. The north wall, all altars and artworks inside were destroyed by the bombs and ensuing fire. Following the war, government officials were reluctant to allow reconstruction of the church however, a heritage conservator pointed out that demolition of the remaining structure would be more costly than rebuilding it. In 1971, work began on the church and continued for three years. The north wall was reconstructed in a modern style which did not harmonize with the rest of the building and the tower was stabilized, but the spire was not rebuilt. Instead, the tower was capped with a short hip roof or pyramid roof resulting in a height of 60 metres (196 feet). In 2006, another renovation commenced which included new heating systems and flooring.

The character is a rat (furthering the reference to Mickey Mouse on his name) who thinks up crazy plans for getting food, and expresses an ironic view of humanity. The spirit of the strip is sarcastic, and sometimes nonsensical. It first appeared in 1985 in the S√£o Paulo newspaper Folha, when its creator won a contest for new comic artists. The strip is usually about animals. The episodes feature both one-time characters (from protozoans to dinosaurs), and a regular cast of characters, whose leader is N√≠quel N√°usea. Humans also appear occasionally. A few of the characters' names embody specific jokes: for instance, the name of the character \\"Flit\\" (a drug-abusing cockroach, who enjoys insecticides, and is N√≠quel's best friend) is originally a brand-name for an insecticide spray. The name of the rat \\"Rato Ruter\\" comes from the American company Roto-Rooter, which specializes in clearing clogged drains.

The film follows a troubled cop, Madeline Foster (played by Maura Tierney) as she pursues a kidnapper who calls himself Harry Houdini (Adrien Brody). The film was shot on location in New York City. Plot \\"Harry Houdini\\" (Adrien Brody) has kidnapped and buried alive a rich businessman's wife. He demands $1 million in cash from the woman's husband in return for the release of the location of her burial site before she runs out of oxygen. He also states that if police involvement is initiated, he will ensure she is never found alive. As expected, however, police involvement is initiated and Detective Madeline Foster (Maura Tierney) is assigned with the task of finding the buried woman and catching Houdini. It is quickly realized though that Houdini, in fact, wanted the police to get involved so he could commit a second kidnapping - that of Foster. When Houdini is finally caught as the result of a car chase involving him and Detective Foster, she attempts to get him to reveal the location of his buried victim. When Foster's initial interrogation of Houdini proves unsuccessful, the FBI are assigned to take over the case, although they do not have any more luck. In a plot twist, it is revealed that Houdini has already committed a murder, that of his accomplice. He now has nothing to lose and the police realize the death of the buried woman would not be as significant as first thought. However, Houdini offers them a final lifeline - if he is allowed to talk to Foster, alone, he will allow his victim to be recovered alive. The police, now just puppets in Houdini's plan, agree to his request. Troubled, Foster begins to reveal her darker side to Houdini and he sees a kindred spirit in her. Soon after, it is revealed that Houdini was in fact a painter in the police department, and outlined the entire building in a very detailed map. Just as Foster is revealing the truth, Houdini takes her to the place where he buried the first woman. Foster escapes her hold, and releases the woman and takes Houdini's gun, then pushes him inside the coffin. As he taunts Foster, she shoots him rather than burying him. Popular culture =Exhibits= The House of Houdini is a museum and performance venue located at 11, D√≠sz square in the Buda Castle in Budapest, Hungary. In addition to housing the largest collection of original Houdini artifacts in Europe, it includes original props from the latest \\"HOUDINI\\" film Oxygen (1999). =Other media= The deathcore bands Job for a Cowboy and Killwhitneydead have both released songs that feature a sound sample from this film where the woman is being buried. Job for a Cowboy included the sample in their track \\"Catharsis for the Buried\\" which appears as an intro for their Doom EP (2005). Killwhitneydead included the sample (among others from this film) on their song \\"I Already Have Enough Friends (Take Two)\\" (2004).

August 12, 1964, Culiacan, Sinaloa) is an educator, politician and writer who came to national attention in Mexico as the 2018 presidential campaign manager for Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador. Her work in social media for the campaign has been particularly recognized. Life and education Clouthier is one of eleven children born to Leticia Carrillo and politician Manuel Clouthier, the 1988 National Action Party presidential candidate who died in an automobile crash in 1989, when she was in her mid-20s. She is one of three children to go into politics. She stated that while she does not deny her roots, she is more than just the daughter of Manuel Clouther, ‚ÄúI am not just a last name‚Ä¶ I make my own way.‚Äù Although she comes from a well-to-do agricultural family, she went to public schools, such as the General √Ångel Flores public school in Culiac√°n, as well as her masters in public administration at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Nuevo Le√≥n. She also attended the private Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies. She has also taken various extracurricular courses in education, teaching, human right and civics, at schools such as the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University. She believes her experiences in public education allows her to build bridges among the social classes. Although Clouthier grew up in Sinaloa, she has spent most of her life in Nuevo Le√≥n, currently a resident of San Pedro Garza Garc√≠a. She is currently married to Jos√© Mart√≠nez and the couple has two children, Mar√≠a and Lucas. Career before 2018 presidential campaign Clouthier began her career as a teacher and translator. She cofounded and ran a translation business from 1986 to 1990. From 1982 to 1994 she taught English, Mexican history and socioeconomics in schools such as Monterrey Tech and the Centro Universitario M√©xico. She was principal at the preparatory school of the Universidad Metropolitana de Monterrey, a school for economically-disadvantaged children. Clouthier founded and held positions in several social service organizations. From 2000 to 2003, she was an advisor to the Instituto Nacional de las Mujeres. In 2009, she was one of the founders of Evoluci√≥n Mexicana A.C., which promotes civic responsibility and democracy. Between 1989 and 1997 she held various administrative positions with the San Pedro Garza Garc√≠a municipality such as direction of human affairs, assistant to the secretary of primary services and the director of tourism, education and sports. From 1997 to 2001, she was the coordinator of junior high education and social services with the Secretariat of Education of the state of Nuevo Le√≥n. Initially, Clouthier followed her father into the National Action Party (PAN) and was a member from 1991 to 2005. With this party, she served as a federal deputy from 1991 to 1994, then again from 2003 to 2005. However, she became disillusioned with this party, and left even though she was criticized for betraying her father. Today, she says that it is a ‚Äúbad copy of the Institutional Revolutionary Party,‚Äù the party that her father was so against. In 2009, she was a candidate for municipal president for San Pedro with Nueva Alianza. Election campaign of Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador Clouthier has come to national attention as the campaign manager for 2018 presidential campaign of Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador. She offered some benefits to choose Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador to elect Mexican president Despite her history, her choice to support L√≥pez Obrador came as a surprise to her family. However, she states that many of the candidate's political positions are similar to those of her father, who was also called a populist. Despite her close association with L√≥pez Obrador, she is not a member of his party. She states she has disagreements with L√≥pez Obrador but will not say what they are publicly. Clouthier's main success has been managing the candidate's and campaign's online presence, especially in social media and particularly in a Twitter account called Abre M√°s Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes Wider). One of her sisters once told her that if Twitter did not exist, Clouthier would have invented it. She discovered Twitter during her work with various civic organizations, as a way to reach the public quickly. Then she began using it for lower-level political campaigns, especially for recruiting. She likes the platform because it is immediate, short and direct, considering it a natural ally for the campaign. She directs a team responsible for social media messaging, focused on pushing the campaign's narrative and defending against attacks by other candidates. In particular, she has been successful in communicating political ideas through videos, images, GIFs and memes. Her social media work riffs off of popular culture and statements by the other campaigns. For example, she had an image of L√≥pez Obrador photoshopped with the gauntlet from Infinity War with the five gems of power. Underneath the image appear the word ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù disintegrating. Her success in this area has moved her into the spotlight, now appearing more traditional media, and other more traditional publicity moves. She boarded the Metro in Mexico City to pass out flyers among riders along with the Regeneraci√≥n newspaper. However, not all of her work with the campaign has been successful. Media and opposing candidates challenged tweets made asserting that between 2001 and 2004, when L√≥pez Obrador headed the Mexico City government, that Mexico City had attracted 57.8% of the country's foreign investment, stating that ‚Äú‚Ä¶the numbers do not lie.‚Äù However, according to the Secretariat of the Economy, the city attracted only 26.36%. Other numbers off too. The scandals was dubbed in the press ‚ÄúPejenomics‚Äù after the candidate's nickname Another problem on Twitter occurred when she appeared in a photo with a Rolex watch. The image contrasted with the austere image of the campaign, forcing her to state that it had been a gift from her husband on the birth of their second son. In Buzzfeed News, she stated that she should not be called a feminist because the term ‚Äúis out of fashion as such‚Äù (est√° pasado de moda como tal) and for her, it is not about creating spaces for women in the workplace but rather that women have access to services they need for their families, such as childcare. The statement caused some controversy. There was a false report that she suspended activities due to death threats, but she says she was never threatened. She was relatively unknown at the start of L√≥pez Obrador's campaign, but became one of its main protagonists, becoming an icon. Clouthier's work succeeded in bringing may young people to the campaign, and her popularity is such is that other candidates have reminded voters that L√≥pez Obrador is running for president and not her. Publications Clouthier has written for various publications. She coedited the Cuaderno de Trabajo de Cultura de la Legalidad, had a column with the El Financiero, Reporte Indigo and Peri√≥dico Noroeste newspapers and wrote for the Players of Life magazine from 2010 to 2014. Clouthier has published four books: Cr√≥nica de un fraude anunciado with Jes√∫s Cant√∫ and Cuahut√©moc Rivera (1992) Maqu√≠o Mi Padre (2006) Una visi√≥n del Congreso (2006) Parejas Parejas with Valeria Guerra (2017) References Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico) Category:Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education alumni Category:Universidad Aut√≥noma de Nuevo Le√≥n alumni Category:Women members of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico) Category:National Action Party (Mexico) politicians Category:Mexican people of French descent Category:National Regeneration Movement politicians ","title":"Tatiana Clouthier"},{"id":"3691521","text":"The Basilica of St. Michael (or Basilique Saint-Michel, in French), is a Flamboyant Gothic church in Bordeaux, France.

Aleman got the nickname \\"Hook\\" from his boxing career in high school. He is also famous for being the only person in the United States ever to be acquitted of murder, then legally tried and convicted for murder when the initial trial was found to be corrupt. This is not considered a case of double jeopardy as the initial trial was found to be corrupt; the Chicago judge was recruited specifically to acquit Aleman during a bench trial. Early life Born in the Taylor Street area of Chicago, Aleman was the first of three sons of Louis Aleman and Mary Virginia Baratta. The legendary Taylor Street was the port-of-call for Chicago's Italian Americans. Aleman was a nephew of future Chicago Outfit acting mob boss Joseph Ferriola and uncle to Joseph Aleman. Aleman's mother was Italian, his father a native of Durango, Durango Mexico who was involved in narcotics trafficking. In a 1997 interview, Aleman said that his father beat him every day. The only relief Aleman got was from ages seven to eleven, when Louis was in prison. In 1956, Aleman graduated from Crane Technical High School and enrolled in the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts to study commercial art. In 1958, he graduated with a two-year degree in that field. Aleman went to work selling race track program sheets and produce from the South Water Street Market. In 1964, Aleman married Ruth Felper Mustari, a widow with four children, who died in 2000 at age 68. Due to an accident as a teenager, Aleman was unable to produce children of his own. However, according to Ruth and his stepchildren, he was a loving and kind husband and father.Profile: Harry Aleman ~ The Chicago Syndicate. Thechicagosyndicate.com (2005-10-03). Retrieved on 2010-12-19. Start of criminal career In 1962, Aleman was charged with assaulting Howard Pierson, the 23-year-old son of a Chicago police commander. The incident started when Aleman, at a bar with his brother and friends, pushed a woman through a large window. Pierson chased Aleman out of the bar, then flagged down a police car. Police soon stopped Aleman and started questioning him. When Pierson arrived at the scene, the enraged Aleman punched Pierson, breaking his jaw. Aleman was convicted, but received only two years' probation. During the 1960s, Aleman was also arrested for malicious mischief, illegal gambling, possession of burglary tools, assault, aggravated assault, grand theft auto, armed robbery, and aggravated kidnapping. Work as enforcer In the early 1970s, Aleman decided to force independent bookmakers in Chicago to pay extortion payments, or \\"street tax\\", to the Outfit. If the bookmakers refused, Aleman was willing to use force on them. According to law enforcement and the Chicago Crime Commission, Aleman committed 13 murders in Chicago between 1971 and 1976. His alleged victims included Richard Cain, a top aide to boss Sam Giancana, along with counterfeiters, mob informants, a security guard from a Miami museum that failed to pay his gambling debts, a former police officer, and another mob enforcer. Aleman was prosecuted for only one murder: the 1972 Logan killing. FBI agents were reported to have said that Aleman \\"oozed menace\\" and his mere presence was usually enough to enforce the Outfit's will.Lives Remembered. Telegraph (2010-05-18). Retrieved on 2010-12-19. =Logan murder= On September 27, 1972, Aleman fatally shot Teamsters official William Logan in his Chicago neighborhood. Two witnesses watched Aleman commit the murder and prosecutors thought they had a strong case. According to prosecutors, the reason for Logan's murder was that the union man was obstructing Aleman's crew from hijacking trucks. However, shortly before Aleman's trial started, Chicago attorney Robert Cooley was approached by First Ward political boss Pat Marcy and asked to take over as Aleman's lawyer. Although Cooley suggested that he could easily win an acquittal by discrediting the witnesses during cross- examination. Marcy insisted that the Chicago Outfit preferred a bench trial with a judge who could be bribed to acquit. Marcy warned Cooley that, if he accepted the job and failed to deliver, the Outfit would murder him. Thinking instantly of a close friend, Cook County Circuit Court Judge Frank J. Wilson, Cooley said he knew a judge whom no one would ever suspect. After taking the case, Cooley \\"picked up information that was total dynamite. The hit, I learned, had nothing to do with unions and all the other crap in the indictment. It was strictly personal. Billy Logan, the victim, had been married to Harry's cousin. They had a bitter divorce and argued constantly over custody of their son. Logan used to beat her up big time. The final straw came after one of the fights when she said, 'You better be careful, cause Harry won't be happy about it.' And Logan replied, 'Fuck that guinea.' He probably could have beaten her up a few more times and it wouldn't have mattered. But Harry wasn't going to let some Irish goon get away with calling him a guinea.\\"Robert Cooley, When Corruption Was King: How I Helped the Mob Rule Chicago and Then Brought the Outfit Down, Carroll & Graf Publishers, 2004. Pages 19-20. Meanwhile, Cooley approached Judge Wilson and offered him $10,000 to take over the case and acquit Harry Aleman. Wilson agreed, but later requested more money to compensate for the risk. As a result, Aleman was acquitted in a bench trial.Aleman Finally Convicted (IPSN 97-10-12). Ipsn.org.

Retrial During the late 1980s, investigators started Operation GamBat, an extensive investigation into decades of corruption and mob ties inside the Chicago court system. In February 1990, fearing prosecution for his actions during the 1977 Logan trial, retired judge Frank Wilson shot himself to death at his Arizona retirement home. In 1991, Aleman pleaded guilty to extorting money from bookmakers Anthony Reitinger and Vince Rizza in 1972. Aleman was convicted and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. In 1993, based on Robert Cooley's testimony, Aleman was re-indicted for the 1972 Logan slaying. In 1997, Aleman was convicted of the Logan murder and sentenced to 300 years in state prison. Aleman's re-trial and subsequent conviction are historic as he is the first American to be retried for murder following a fraudulent first trial.

It established that bribery affecting a bench trial does not preclude the possibility of a second trial: if in said bench trial the defendant is found not guilty, but evidence shows that an act of bribery took place between the defendant and the judge, the defendant can be retried again for the same crime, and this second trial cannot be considered double jeopardy, as jeopardy had never attached in the first place. In short, as actual loss of life or limb had never been a possibility (unlike in most trials), the first trial, by being conducted by a venal and bribed judge, must be considered a counterfeit one; and any resulting retrial (before a non-venal jurist) must be considered to have original jeopardy attached (i.e. the possibility of actual loss to life or limb is real and true).

The company's products include servers, computer clusters, networking components, digital storage, software solutions and a HPC cloud. Penguin Computing started as a Linux server company and now works on the design, engineering, integration, and delivery of solutions that are based on open architectures and non-proprietary components from a variety of Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) providers. Penguin Computing was an early contributor to the Open Compute Project (OCP).  High performance clusters  Penguin Computing operated as a Linux server company until it acquired in 2003 Scyld Software, a leader in Beowulf cluster management software. Penguin Computing is based in Fremont, California. The company's early software solutions were offered under its Scyld brand and included Scyld ClusterWare for cluster provisioning and management, as well as the Scyld Cloud Manager for cloud- enabled HPC environments. In 2015, Penguin Computing was awarded a contract with the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) tri-laboratory Commodity Technology Systems program, or CTS-1. Under the $39 million contract, Penguin Computing provided over 7 petaFLOPS of computing power at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Coincident with this contract win, Penguin Computing built up a division to focus specifically on the federal HPC market. The CTS-1 contract was one of the first and largest deployments of Intel's Omni-Path high-performance communications architecture. This resulted in Penguin Computing being awarded with Intel's \\"Partner of the Year - HPC Technical Computing\\" award.  Open Compute Project (OCP)  Penguin Computing was an early contributor to the Open Compute Project (OCP), is a member of the project foundation, and one of a limited number of authorized OCP providers. In November 2015 Penguin Computing announced the developed of its Tundra Extreme Scale (Tundra ES) product line with the intention of applying the findings of the OCP to high performance computing. In 2020, Penguin Computing announced the new Tundra AP line of servers, which support Intel Server System compute modules in an OCP form factor.  HPC cloud computing  In 2009 Penguin Computing launched Penguin Computing On- Demand (POD) which offers high performance computing (HPC) cloud computing. The POD cloud was one of the first remote HPC services offered on a pay-as- you-go monthly basis. Like its high performance clusters, the POD cloud is a bare-metal compute model to execute code, but each user is given virtualized login node. Penguin Computing offers users more than 150 pre-installed commercial and open source applications. POD computing nodes are connected via nonvirtualized 10 Gbit/s Ethernet or QDR InfiniBand networks. The POD Cloud data center has redundant Internet links and user connectivity ranging from 50 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s. At POD's launch Penguin Computing's CEO Charles Wuischpard contended that because of the performance overhead from virtualization, other clouds were not suited to HPC and that the computing nodes allocated to customers may be far apart, causing latency that impairs performance for some HPC programs.  SMART division  In 2018 Penguin Computing was bought by the publicly traded SMART Global Holdings for a $60 million purchase price, with a further $25 million due if Penguin Computing hits certain profit milestones. The $60 million included the assumption of Penguin Computing‚Äôs debts, the company has borrowed $33 million from Wells Fargo to fund a new manufacturing facility. In the first quarter of financial year 2018 Penguin Computing had a gross profits of $10.3 million on sales of $48.5 million. HPC computer clusters were the main source of revenue. Penguin owned 1.2 percent of the HPC server market and when the company was bought by SMART it had ten supercomputers in the TOP500.

It was constructed between the 16th and 18th centuries in two styles: late Gothic and Baroque. Building began in 1513 and the cathedral was consecrated in 1733. It was commissioned by Ferdinand V of Castile of Spain. It was declared a national monument by royal decree in 1887. Architectural style The building began at a time when the gothic style was becoming less popular and was merging with the new Renaissance style, giving the resulting Plateresque style in Spain. However, this cathedral retained more of its Gothic character because the authorities wanted the new cathedral to blend with the old one. Thus the new cathedral was constructed, continuing with Gothic style during the 17th and 18th centuries. However, during the 18th century, two elements were added that broke with the showy form with the predominant style of the building: a Baroque cupola on the crossing and the final stages of the bell tower (92 m). The new cathedral was constructed without the subsequent destruction of the old cathedral as normally happened but a wall of the new cathedral, leans on the North wall of the old one. For this reason, the old cathedral had to be reinforced, and the bell tower was constructed on the old one. Two of the main architects of the cathedral were Juan Gil de Honta√±√≥n and his son Rodrigo Gil de Honta√±√≥n in 1538. Its main entrance consists of three richly decorated arcs, each leading to the three naves (sections) of the church. Restoration after the Lisbon earthquake Cracks and broken windows are visible reminders of the devastating effects of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, still visible today. After the earthquake, repairs were necessary to the cupola and the base of the tower which were reinforced with a lining of lines of sillares, in the form of a pyramid trunk that spoiled the basic profile of the tower (this tower is a virtual twin of the tower of the cathedral of Segovia). The moment of this catastrophe is commemorated with the \\"Mariquelo\\" tradition on October 31, when every year residents climb to the cupola high above and play flutes and drums. Restoration in 1992 Among the ornate carvings on the fa√ßade are those of a faun eating an ice cream and of an astronaut added during restoration work in 1992, when one of the artisans engaged in the project chose to carve strange figures into the stone.Article at Snopes C√∫pula Catedral nueva de Salamanca.jpgInterior of the dome Catedral de Salamanca lateral.JPGFacade of the Puerta de Ramos of the New Cathedral from the Plaza de Anaya Sculpture of astronaut added to New Cathedral, Salamanca, Spain, during renovations.JPGAstronaut sculpture, added during renovations in 1992 Faun New Cathedral Salamanca.JPGDetail of the facade of the New Cathedral of Salamanca: faun with ice cream.

It was part of a railroad system that ran from the community of Elizabeth near Marietta, Georgia, northward to Murphy in far western North Carolina, and to Delano just south of Etowah in southeast Tennessee. History Originally incorporated in 1854 as the Ellijay Railroad after the town of Ellijay, Georgia, it was renamed the Marietta, Canton & Ellijay Railroad, and finally the Marietta and North Georgia Railroad, finally beginning construction in 1874. Beginning at the Western & Atlantic Railroad in Elizabeth (now within Marietta city limits), it connected through Blackwells, Noonday, Woodstock, Lebanon/Toonigh, Holly Springs, and Canton, taking until 1879 to do so. It continued to Marble Cliff in 1883, and to Ellijay in 1884. In 1887, it was completed to Murphy, and merged with the Georgia and North Carolina Railroad, causing another slight name change to the Marietta and North Georgia Railway, rather than the previous \\"Railroad\\". It was converted from three-foot (775mm) narrow gauge to standard gauge as far north as Blue Ridge, Georgia in 1890, and from there to Murphy in 1897. This also allowed a continuous route from Atlanta, Georgia to Knoxville, Tennessee, with the completion of a route southward from the wye at Etowah/Delano by the Knoxville Southern Railroad, actually a subsidiary of the M&NGR.; This route runs eastward along the Hiwassee River to Farner, Tennessee, then south along the Tennessee side of the North Carolina state line, through Ducktown, then the twin towns of Copperhill, Tennessee and McCaysville, Georgia, then through Epworth before meeting the existing line at Blue Ridge. In order to meet the construction deadline, engineers designed a double switchback, which required that railcars be brought up or down four at a time to and from the river elevation to make the turn out of or into the valley. Extremely inefficient and time-consuming, it was replaced by what is known as the Hiwassee Loop, taking trains nearly twice around Bald Mountain, with the train passing over its own tracks on a wooden trestle. This gave the route the \\"Hook and Eye Line\\" nickname, with the \\"hook\\" being another switchback in Georgia, and the eye being the loop. (Both were later bypassed before ceasing original operations.) Most of the AK&N;'s stock was purchased by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad in 1902, which gave the L&N; a complete route from Atlanta to Cincinnati via Knoxville. L&N; moved its Atlanta division headquarters to Etowah, where the train station now serves as a museum owned by the city. After CSX Transportation was formed in the 1980s, the old M&NGR;/AK&N; lines were mostly sold off. The entire main line from Marietta to Etowah is in use by two companies today, the Georgia Northeastern Railroad for freight from Elizabeth Yard to Ellijay, since 1998 the Blue Ridge Scenic Railway (owned by GNRR) from Blue Ridge to McCaysville, and since 2004 the Tennessee Valley Railroad from Copperhill to Delano. The Georgia portion north of Ellijay is actually owned by the Georgia Department of transportation having been purchased from the GNRR. The historic trestle and loop at Bald Mountain were saved by Glen Sprigs Holdings, along with the rest of the railroad from the McMinn/Polk county line all the way to the Tennessee/Georgia State Line, and then leased to the Tennessee Overhill Association. Except for the east/west portion along the Hiwassee River, the entire route follows one road, numbered as Georgia 5 and Tennessee 68.

Amiable raced until she was three years old, retiring in 1895 to the Duke of Portland's Welbeck Stud. Plagued with fertility problems, Amiable was a failure as a broodmare and produced only one foal that survived to adulthood. She was pensioned for the last 11 years of her life and was euthanized at the age of 24 in November 1915. Background Amiable was foaled in 1891 at the Welbeck Stud near Welbeck Abbey in North Nottinghamshire, the estate of her breeder the Duke of Portland. Amiable's sire, St. Simon, won the 1884 Ascot Gold Cup and was the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland for much of the 1890s and first decade of the 20th century. Her dam, Tact, was a full-sister to the mare Gravity, the dam of 1901 Ascot Gold Cup winner William the Third, and Florence. Tact was bought by Lord Lurgan as a potential racing prospect, but when the mare did not succeed on the turf was given to the Duke of Portland for use as a broodmare at the Welbeck Stud. As a stipulation of the transfer, any produce of Tact were to be jointly owned by Lord Lurgan and the Duke of Portland. In addition to Amiable, Tact produced the good racehorses Charm and Manners. Amiable had severe stringhalt in both her hind limbs, causing her to greatly flex her hocks and pick her feet high off the ground with every step. The condition was more evident when Amiable walked than when she galloped and grew more pronounced toward the end of her racing career. \\"Our Van\\", writing for Baily's Magazine, described her appearance in the paddock before the 1894 St. Leger Stakes as a \\"half comic element\\" because the filly \\"kept picking up her legs as if she were walking on hot bricks.\\" Racing career Amiable was trained by George Dawson, who had also trained the Epsom Derby winners Donovan and Ayrshire for the Duke of Portland. Amiable was jointly owned by the Duke of Portland and Lord Lurgan during her racing career. =1893: two-year-old-season= In the spring at Newmarket, Amiable was second by a length to the Duke of Westminister's Grey Leg in the Two-year-old Plate. Amiable finished second to her stablemate Schoolbook in the Royal two-year-old Plate run in May at Kempton Park. In July, Amiable ran second to Sanderling in the Lavant Stakes. In August at York, Amiable won the 1,000 sovereign Princess of Wales's Plate, beating Wherwell by a couple of lengths. In November at Liverpool, Amiable finished third in the Knowsley Nursery Handicap to Jacob and Xury. She finished the season with two wins in nine starts. =1894: three-year-old- season= On 11 May at the Newmarket spring meeting, Amiable won the 1,000 Guineas Stakes in a 13 horse field. Mecca was the front runner from the start followed closely by Throstle and Jocasta. Mecca held on to the lead until the halfway mark, being passed at the hill by Lady Minting. Ridden by Bradford, Amiable overtook Lady Minting in front of the grandstand to win by a margin of three lengths over Lady Minting and Mecca. Attendance at the 1894 running of The Oaks held on 8 June was rated by the London Times as average, likely owing to the threat of rainstorms. Rumours had circulated before the race that Amiable had gone lame on one leg, leading her to initially be placed at long odds in the betting. Starting against 10 other horses at 2 to 1 odds, Amiable hung at the back of the field for the early part of the race, far behind the front runner Sarana. Amiable was not a contender until nearing the straight, edging out Sweet Duchess and Sarana to win by three quarters of a length. A few weeks later, Amiable dead heated with the filly Jocasta for third place in the Coronation Stakes, won by Throstle. In September, Amaible was fourth in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster, losing to Throstle, Ladas and Matchbox. A few days later, Amiable won the Park Hill Stakes, beating Sarana and Lady Normanton. In the last start of her career, Amiable was unplaced in the Cesarewitch Stakes. Amiable injured her leg at the Liverpool meeting in November and was scratched from all of her engagements. She was retired from racing at the end of the season and became a broodmare at the Welbeck Stud in 1895. Breeding career Amiable was not successful as a broodmare, producing only one foal that survived to adulthood. Amiable produced twins to Morion during her first season at stud in 1896, the foals dying at birth. A colt sired by Carbine, named Amnesty, was born in 1897. Amnesty was later gelded and made no impact in the stud. Amiable's 1898 filly sired by Carbine died young and she delivered a stillborn foal sired by Crowberry in 1901. Amiable was infertile in 1898 and from 1902 to 1904 and aborted a foal in 1900. She was not bred from 1904 until she was euthanised in November 1915. Amiable is buried on the grounds of the Welbeck Stud.

He also directed a series of popular Russian-language screwball comedies \\"Peculiarities of National...\\": Peculiarities of National Hunt (1995), Peculiarities of National Fishing (1998), Peculiarities of the National Hunt in Winter Season (2000), and Peculiarities of National Politics (2003). These and made in a similar vein together with Operation Happy New Year, containing much humor about alcohol-related adventures and stunts. Rogozhkin's film Transit (Peregon) was released in 2006. It is a \\"wartime tragicomedy\\" about the relationship between Soviet soldiers in the Far Eastern outpost in Chukotka and the American female pilots who bring them U.S.-made airplanes from Alaska through the lend-lease program. As in The Cuckoo, Rogozhkin cast a number of amateur actors for Peregon.

A part of the Tetris game series, the game supports up to ten players locally, and supported up to four players online with the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. Tetris DS features several new modes of play, each with a different Nintendo theme. Themes include Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Balloon Fight, Donkey Kong, and Yoshi's Cookie. Multiplayer gameplay also incorporates items to be used competitively. Game modes =Standard mode= Standard mode plays much like traditional Tetris, although in Tetris DS, the play field is on the bottom screen, and a Nintendo themed gameplay clip loops on the top screen. This gameplay varies depending on how far you have gotten in the game. Standard mode can be played as a one player marathon, multiplayer with two players or one player versus a computer controlled opponent. Standard mode features a Super Mario Bros. backdrop, a Super Mario Bros. 3 backdrop and several other Nintendo Entertainment System game backdrops. One player Marathon mode ends at level 20 (after 200 lines), although Endless mode can be unlocked after finishing Marathon mode. For the Mario backdrops, Mario advances through familiar levels as the player clears lines. There are eventually other backdrops based on other games that appear later in the mode. All of the backdrops each have their own background music, with the exception of backdrops from levels 16 through 19. These backdrops share a song called \\"Rushed Tetris\\" which contained elements from Excitebike, Urban Champion, Devil World, and Duck Hunt. In Endless mode, if the player reaches beyond level 20, the cycle of backdrops repeats. The highest visible score in Endless mode is 99,999,999, the highest visible level is 999, and the highest visible number of lines completed is also 999. Once exceeded these displays continue to show these maximum values. A small glitch in the game means that once the score has surpassed the maximum of 99,999,999 it is not saved in the records screen. Like most iterations of Tetris, Tetris DS's Standard mode has variations to the basic formula of the game. The player is allowed to hold a Tetrimino by pressing L or R. This allows the player to insert the tetrimino currently on the screen into a small box for future use, and will swap places with a piece after the button is pressed again. This does not work when pressed twice in a row (holding a piece, then attempting to hold the adjacent piece after). The speed of the falling Tetriminoes increases noticeably faster than in other games, and at Level 18 and above, Tetriminoes are instantly on the ground the moment they appear. However, a Tetrimino will not lock into place until the player does not move or rotate it for a set amount of time. This means that the player can keep the piece in play indefinitely by rotating it consistently. This \\"infinite rotation\\" rule was first seen in The Next Tetris and negates much of the difficulty that comes with the increased falling speed, so that a good player can clear hundreds of levels in an Endless Marathon. One thing to note about rotations is that the final movement of a T-shaped tetrimino can be considered a T-Spin if it gained any height whatsoever. This means that actual T-Spins can be considered invalid, while moving a T-shaped tetrimino up a slope can be considered a T-Spin. Another thing to note is that I-Spins, L-Spins, J-Spins, S-Spins, and Z-Spins are not recognized by the game. =Mission mode= Mission mode can be played competitively, or as a marathon to beat your own score. The top screen displays your objective or \\"mission,\\" while the bottom screen displays the playing field. A timer in the form of red hearts slowly disappears; when a player completes the objective, the hearts fill anew and the player is assigned a new objective. Also, completing an objective erases the bottom four lines of blocks from the playing field. Failing to complete the objective in time will result in added blocks to the bottom of the pile. An example of an objective is for the player to clear three lines with an \\"L\\" shaped Tetrimino. Other examples include clearing five lines while only receiving square Tetriminoes, or clearing three lines simultaneously with anything except a bar-shaped Tetrimino (in this case, using a bar Tetrimino will not clear the objective). Mission mode features a The Legend of Zelda backdrop. When playing Mission in the multiplayer function, it is the only mode where the player cannot 'lose'. The screen may max out, but the player will lose points (up to a total of negative one hundred -100), however you can only finish this game and lose due to points, it is impossible to lose like a normal Tetris game. =Push mode= Push mode is a competitive play mode for two players, or one person versus a CPU controlled opponent. Both players start with a 1x1 block floating in their field, and must place Tetriminoes on that to form a base (if a Tetrimino is dropped where it won't land on anything, it will simply fall out of the screen). Whenever two or more lines are cleared simultaneously, the player's side of the pile moves down, \\"pushing\\" the opponent's side upwards (The player's side is seen on the top screen, while the bottom screen shows the opponent's side upside-down, since the bottoms of both players' piles push against each other). The goal is to push the pile down so it overlaps the opponent's danger line. Push mode features a Donkey Kong backdrop. =Touch mode= In Touch mode, a player uses the Nintendo DS stylus to \\"touch\\" and \\"slide\\" static Tetriminoes to create rows. When enough Tetriminoes have cleared, a cage of balloons is released. Touch mode has no timer, nor do Tetriminoes fall from the top. The playing field spans both DS screens; but only Tetriminoes appearing in lower touch screen could be moved. A Touch Puzzle mode is also available, where for each level, a given objective must be achieved, but the Tetriminoes cannot be rotated. Touch mode features a Balloon Fight backdrop. This is the only mode which uses Tetris 2's cascading gravity, allowing chain reactions to occur. =Catch mode= In Catch mode, a player controls one central block, which can be moved in all directions and rotated. The player \\"catches\\" falling Tetriminoes, which adhere to the central block; once a player has a segment of 4x4 or greater, it will flash for ten seconds, then detonate. The player can then use the explosion to destroy Metroids, the enemies, or Tetriminoes. While the 4x4 square flashes, more blocks can be attached to it to gain more points when it detonates (the flashing portion only expands if another four blocks are added to one of its sides). Pressing X will immediately detonate the blocks. If any Tetriminoes fall beyond the boundaries, the central block is hit by enemies, or a falling Tetrimino touches the central block while it is being rotated, the player will lose energy. Energy is depicted at the bottom of the screen as a bar, and some energy is restored when a 4x4 or greater area of blocks is detonated. If energy runs out, or Tetriminoes are stacked so far that the central block is longer than the entire screen, the game is over. Catch mode features a Metroid backdrop. =Puzzle mode= In Puzzle mode, the top screen displays the playing field that is already several lines high, with several gaps; the bottom screen displays a limited selection of Tetriminoes to choose from. A player must select the shape and orientation of a Tetrimino to fill the gaps and clear the screen. There is no time limit. Puzzle mode features a Yoshi's Cookie backdrop. Each Puzzle completed gives you 10 Tetris Points. Multiplayer Standard mode and Push mode are capable of online and DS-to-DS wireless play. Push mode is available for two players in multiplayer matches whereas Standard mode is available for two players (without items) or four players (with items). In addition, Mission mode is only capable of DS-to-DS wireless play, but Standard mode is available for up to ten players, using only one Tetris DS playing card. Reception Tetris DS received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GamePro said: \\"Tetris DS is an amazing puzzle package, and is easily one of the best DS games to date.\\" Nintendo Power said that \\"you may not love all of it, but you will love much of it.\\" Game Informer said, \\"I can't think of any better way to kill a long plane ride.\\" GameSpot said, \\"It's a much better version of Tetris than other recent incarnations, but it's still saddled with some unfortunate compromises.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of two nines, one eight, and one nine for a total of 35 out of 40. The A.V. Club gave it a B+ and said it was worth playing for \\"That fateful moment when you realize falling Tetrimino[e]s are emblazoned on the insides of your eyelids. Real gamers play Tetris while they blink.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald gave it three- and-a-half stars out of five and said, \\"The best addition is multiplayer action. Up to 10 nearby mates can battle wirelessly and faraway foes can be challenged online. But purists might consider changes such as a hold box for troublesome pieces, previews of the next six blocks and infinite spins to be far less welcome.\\" However, The Times gave it three stars out of five and stated: \\"A little too retro to be anything other than a game to play in short bursts, this new-look Tetris would be just the thing for a short journey.\\" =Sales= By July 25, 2007, Tetris DS had sold 2.05 million copies worldwide, with over 1 million of them sold in Japan alone. =Awards= *IGN: Editors' Choice Award  Notes  References External links *Official website * Tetris DS at Nintendo.com * Category:2006 video games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:Nintendo games Category:Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection games Category:Tetris Category:Touch!

From 1945 to 1964, the City of Le Havre commissioned Auguste Perret and his studio to head the rebuilding of the entire city after it had been completely decimated by the British during World War II.‚ÄúLe Havre, France.‚Äù Organization of World Heritage Cities. St. Joseph's was built between 1951 and 1957/58 as part of this reconstruction. It acts as a memorial to the five thousand civilians fallen and the usual sanctuary dedicated to a patron saint; in this case Saint Joseph, fittingly the patron saint of a happy death, fathers, workers, travelers, and immigrants.\\"Saint-Joseph's Church.\\" Le Havre, World Heritage Site. The church was designed by the chief architect for the reconstruction of Le Havre, Perret, who was the teacher and mentor to the Swiss architect Le Corbusier. A centrally-planned building, Saint Joseph's Church was envisioned as a beacon for the city. The church's single, central tower dominates the city skyline, easily visible from the city's port. Perret's vision created a building resembling a lantern, now fondly referred to as the ‚Äúlantern tower‚Äù or the ‚Äúlighthouse at the heart of the city.‚Äù Made of concrete, St Joseph's is a product of modern architectural innovation in Post-War France. The tower is 107 meters tall and acts as a beacon visible from out at sea, especially at night when illuminated. Stained glass by Marguerite Hur√© Perret brought in his previous colleague Marguerite Hur√© (1896-1967) for the stained glass in the new church. Their most notable collaborations were the √âglise Notre-Dame du Raincy and Saint Joseph's church in Le Havre. Hur√© contributed to the rebirth of sacred art in France in the early twentieth century through her introduction of abstraction into religious stained glass. She developed a style sans images or words, using color to convey her desired theme--much in the way music conveys feeling via sound. Hur√© and Perret shared a desire to reject decorative art in preference of constructive art that was collectively understated yet awe-inspiring and told a story or promoted further improvement/advancement.\\"Saint-Joseph's Church.\\" Le Havre, World Heritage Site. The compact nave's architectural lines lead the eye to the altar and then up to a three-tiered, square base with triangular supporting structures. The triangular supports point the eye to the octagonal column that makes up the majority of the tower. A singular, chunky, spiral staircase rises from the base of the octagonal shaft to the bell room. Separated into 18 layers, each side of layers 2 to 17 exhibits an identical, geometric pattern made of wood and elongated stained glass. Revived in the nineteenth century, Hur√© used the ‚Äúantique‚Äù glass making technique that involves mouth-blowing the colored glass to achieve the desired shape.\\"Artists at Work during the Reconstruction.\\" Le Havre, World Heritage Site. The repeated pattern reflects Hur√©'s dedication to the symbolic power of color and her rejection of iconographic representation. Each side of the octagon has its own distinctive color combination of four to six colors repeated up each layer of the side. Using a selection of seven primary colors (orange, yellow, green, purple, red, greenish and white), Hur√© manipulated each base color to make a total of fifty different hues.\\"Saint-Joseph's Church.\\" Le Havre, World Heritage Site. The pattern appears different depending on how close the viewer is to the windows. From far away the very geometric, organized pattern softens, the colors meld to create new hybrid colors, and the glass's shapes converge to become four dumbbell-like columns on each half of the side. The bottom of the tower has the strongest harmonized hues that gradually lighten on the way to the top giving the impression that the light comes from above, through the lighter glass. Hur√© organized the colors based on the cardinal directions with the dead wood and red colors on the north side, green and purple to the east, golden shades to the south, and pink and orange shades to the west.\\"Saint-Joseph's Church.\\" Le Havre, World Heritage Site. The colors vary drastically depending on the photo used as reference, but each group emanates a distinctive tone drawn from the various interactions and optical mixing of the different colors. The glass's placement and choice of color follow a symbolic code that organizes colors and shapes per research by the Atelier d‚ÄôArt Sacr√© (the Sacred Art Workshop) on theological virtues.David, Veronique. \\"Marguerite Hur√©.\\" The overall feel of this tower is that of being in a kaleidoscopic tunnel whose colors converge to create a ‚Äúsymphonic poem‚Äù, an overwhelming assault of color. While the first example of non-figurative symbolism in religious stained glass was Hur√©'s work at the Voreppe seminary chapel, she takes her abstraction one step farther with St Joseph's by abandoning symbolic geometric design to focus purely on her exploration of the emotional arousal of color.David, ‚ÄúMarguerite Hur√©.‚Äù Throughout her life, Hur√© continued to make figurative stained glass pieces, though her re-imagination of religious iconography through color symbolism and geometric abstraction was her largest contribution to art history.

Built in the 14th century as the main church of the city, it has been described as \\"the main Gothic monument within church architecture in Sk√•ne\\". The church was a spiritual centre during the Reformation, and was one of only a few churches in what was at the time medieval Denmark that suffered damage due to iconoclasm as a consequence of the Reformation. St. Peter's Church contains late medieval murals of recognized high quality, as well as a number of unusual furnishings. The altarpiece, made in 1611, is one of the largest in the Nordic countries. History =Historical background= Aerial view of the church within its urban context St. Peter's Church is the oldest church in Malm√∂, as well as the oldest preserved brick building, and originally the only parish church of the city. It is characteristic for the younger medieval cities of Sk√•ne, such as Malm√∂, to only have one original parish church; nearby Lund, an older settlement, in contrast had a high concentration of churches early on. The explanation is probably that Malm√∂ rose to significance at a time when the land was already subdivided into parishes following the Christianization of Scandinavia in the preceding centuries. Malm√∂ began a rapid expansion thanks to the lucrative trade in herring around 1200 and the city was part of the economic infrastructure around the Hanseatic League and the Sk√•ne Market. By the end of the Middle Ages the city had established itself as the most important commercial city in the province. St. Peter's Church has been described as \\"the main Gothic monument within church architecture in Sk√•ne\\" and as a \\"very good and strongly authentic representative of Baltic Brick Gothic\\". During the 14th century, St. Peter's Church was the largest town church in Denmark.The province of Sk√•ne, including Malm√∂, did not become a part of Sweden until 1658, following the Treaty of Roskilde. It is part of an urban structure with a still largely intact medieval street layout. The church played an important role as a spiritual centre during the Reformation, with the Reformer active as a priest in the church. One of only four occurrences of violence due to iconoclasm during the Danish Reformation occurred in St. Peter's Church in 1529, when Claus Mortensen led the destruction of much of the ornamentation in the church, deemed \\"too Catholic\\" by the Reformer. Of the more than sixty pre-Reformation altarpieces, only one survived more or less intact. It was also following the Reformation (in 1555) that the interior of the church was whitewashed. =Construction= Construction of the presently visible church began in the early 14th century, replacing an older Romanesque church at the same location. It was probably inaugurated in 1319 and dedicated to saints Peter and Paul, but the construction was finished only around 1380. The church is an example of Brick Gothic architecture found around the Baltic Sea, arguably most well-represented in the Marienkirche in L√ºbeck, which was also likely used as a direct model when building St. Peter's Church. It also displays certain influences from contemporary French Gothic architecture. The church was constructed with red bricks and was built as a Gothic basilica with a western church tower and a transept that connects to the ambulatory of the pentagonal chancel. It has subsequently been rebuilt and expanded throughout the centuries, but overall retains its original appearance. =Later alterations= The church has been altered several times since its construction. The original church tower collapsed in 1420, prompting the construction of a new tower and new vaults supporting the ceiling in the western part of the building. Already in 1442, the tower again suffered a partial collapse and had to be rebuilt. It was rebuilt again as late as 1890, when it attained its present appearance after a renovation. The tower is tall. Five side chapels were erected during the late 15th century and the early 16th century, of which three survive to this day. Two of them are named after the saints Anne and Mary, respectively. The third was dedicated to Saint George but is popularly called Kr√§markapellet (\\"The chapel of the vendors\\") and was built for Malm√∂'s guild of cloth dealers but used by several of the city's guilds whose coats of arms can still be seen in the chapel. The church porch was also built some time after 1420. A substantial reconstruction of the church was made in 1847‚Äì1853 under the guidance of Carl Georg Brunius. The church was at the time in an unarguably bad condition but Brunius' renovation has nonetheless been criticized for having been harsh. The church was given an entirely new, copper roof, and large parts of the walls were replaced with new bricks. A large part of the ambulatory was entirely dismantled and rebuilt, and nearly all the buttresses of the church were heavily reconstructed. The whitewashed interior was renewed, and many of the church's Renaissance furnishings were removed; the altarpiece and organ facade were saved contrary to the wishes of Brunius, but the altarpiece was painted grey. Between 1904 and 1910, another series of renovations were carried out. During this time, the altarpiece was restored to its earlier vibrant colours and the murals in Kr√§markapellet uncovered and restored. Smaller renovations and alterations have also been made during the 20th century. The chapel originally dedicated to Saint Anne was rebuilt in 1964. Between 1965 and 1967 the interior of the church was renovated, and the murals in Kr√§markapellet carefully restored. Additional restorations of the murals were made in 1999. In the 1980s, bathrooms, a cloakroom and an information desk were installed in the church. In 2011, another major restoration of the interior of the church was carried out. Interior View of the interior from the entrance Mural depicting a griffin in Kr√§markapellet. A griffin also appears on the coat of arms of Malm√∂. , a collection of books from 1506‚Äì1570 in the church The inside of the church is characterized by the tall nave, reaching at the transept. The walls, pillars and vaults are whitewashed, giving the interior a light and bright atmosphere. Its present state is largely that which it attained at the early 17th century. =Murals= Kr√§markapellet is richly decorated with late medieval murals. Some of the paintings may have been made in the 1460s while others date from the early 1510s. They were made by an unknown master or workshop. The murals have been described as being both \\"iconographically sophisticated\\" and \\"technically accomplished\\" and in stark contrast to the na√Øvet√© typical for the many murals made in the countryside churches of the province at approximately the same time. The murals cover both the walls and the vaulted ceiling, and displays several different motifs, both secular and religious, set among a background of flowing, green vines. =Altarpiece= The altarpiece of the church is one of the largest in the Nordic countries. It is made of oak wood and reaches a height of . It was made in 1611 by several local master carpenters: Jacob Kremberg, , Curt Snedker, √ñllrich Svarfer and Henrik K√∂nnicke together with , a court painter in the service of Christian IV of Denmark, and the painter Pieter Hartman, a local resident. The altarpiece consists of four storeys or levels, one above the other. In the lowermost part there is a depiction of the Last Supper in the centre, and on each side wooden sculptures of Moses and John the Baptist, respectively. Above this there is a depiction of the Crucifixion, and above this there is a representation of the ascension. At the very top is the name of God, Yahweh, displayed. =Pulpit= The pulpit of the church was inaugurated in 1599. It was commissioned by a member of the city council, Engelbret Fris (or Engelbrekt Friis) and made by . It displays a certain likeness to the pulpit in Lund Cathedral, inaugurated a few years earlier. It is made of black limestone and light sandstone, gilt in several places. The rich ornamentation depicts scenes from the life of Christ. =Baptismal font= The baptismal font is also made by Daniel Thomisen, and was commissioned by another city council member, Rasmus Ludvigsen. It dates from 1601 and similarly to the pulpit it is made of black limestone. The font is octagonal and six of its sides are decorated with scenes from the Bible. One of the other two sides displays the monogram of the donator and the other an inscription commemorating the donating of the font to the church. =Other furnishings= The organ is from 1951 but its facade dates from the late 18th century. Modern stained glass windows are located in the chapel of St. Anne, while the chapel of St. Mary contains a wooden Madonna made in 1995, inspired by a medieval Madonna in the Historical Museum at Lund University. The church also contains several elaborate decorated memorials over deceased burghers of the city. The church also contains a small library, , with around 40 books from 1506‚Äì1570.

She is known as a national martyr among the Kurds. Birth and childhood She was the third out of five children born to a Kurdish farmer, Dalaho Qasim, and his wife Kan√Æ. She was born in Xaneq√Æn but was relocated to Irbil when she was four years old. The Qasims lived in wretched poverty, relying on rations for food and clothes.  Education  Leyla and her brother √áiyako were taught Arabic and agriculture by their mother when they were aged six and eight. In 1958 she entered elementary and later finished secondary school in Xanek√Æn. In 1971 she moved to Baghdad to study sociology at the University of Baghdad. Political activism Leyla Qasim was sixteen years old as Abdul Rahman Arif was overthrown by Ba'ath party leader, General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr in 1968. Leyla was disturbed by the violent takeover in the capital. During the late 1960s, Leyla and √áiyako wrote pamphlets on the horrors of the Ba'ath party including the new leader, Saddam Hussein, whom they described as being against Kurdish independence. Leyla spoke to several Kurds in the Northern region of Iraq about the Ba'ath regime and the loose morals of the members. Leyla was told that her words were inspiring sedition. In 1970 she joined the Kurdistan Students Union and the Kurdistan Democratic Party. On 28 April 1974 she was detained together with four others and accused of attempting to hijack a plane. She was arrested, tortured and, in Baghdad on 12 May 1974, ultimately hanged after a lengthy show trial, broadcast throughout Iraq.What Kind of Liberation? Women and the Occupation of Iraq by Nadje al Ali and Nicola Pratt. Berkeley: University of California Press. 2009 She was the first woman to be hanged by the Iraqi Ba'ath party. Executed along with Qasim were other Jawad Hamawandi, Nariman Fuad Masti, Hassan Hama Rashid and Azad Sleman Miran.  Remembrance  Many Kurdish families named her children Leyla after her. Every year the anniversary of her death is remembered by many Kurds. In Kelar there exists a Leyla Qasim Park.

Devoted mainly to opera, it also includes concerts of orchestral, chamber, vocal and solo instrumental music. Establishment The first festival took place in July 1948. It was founded by Countess Lily Pastr√©, who covered the entire costs in 1948.Le Salon de Lily, Hommage √† la Comtesse Pastr√©, m√©c√®ne , Culture 13Edmonde Charles-Roux parle de la Comtesse Lily Pastr√© , Culture 13Lily Pastr√©, m√©c√®ne √©clair√© et √¢me g√©n√©reuse, La Croix, 4/8/13David Coquille, Lily Pastr√©, du vermouth pour un conte de f√©e, La Marsellaise, April 07, 2014 It was made up of three or four concerts in the cour de l'Archev√™ch√©, a concert in the Saint-Sauveur cathedral, and six further concerts and recitals in various locations throughout the town. An opera was added to these concerts, Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte, a work practically unknown by the French public at the time. However, it was not until 1949 that the festival became a success with its production of Don Giovanni. From inception until 1974, the festival was directed by Gabriel Dussurget who devoted much attention to the artistic and detailed aspects of the productions, which in turn attracted much attention to the festival. In 1970, Mstislav Rostropovich premiered Henri Dutilleux's Tout un monde lointain..., now considered as one of the most important additions to the cello repertoire of the 20th century, at the festival. Under the direction of Bernard Lefort from 1974 to 1982, the Festival became devoted to bel canto opera and, in general, a celebration of the voice. Performances of 19th century operas by Verdi and Donizetti were given by the reigning stars of bel canto such as Montserrat Caball√©, Jos√© Carreras, Marilyn Horne, and Katia Ricciarelli, and the Festival spread throughout the town. From 1982, a broadening of the repertoire to include baroque to modern operas (Britten and Prokofiev, in particular) characterized the era of director Louis Erlo, who gave preference to Mozart by staging new productions of his most famous works, but also the early operas written in the composer's youth. In 1998 St√©phane Lissner took over the festival, accomplishing a complete renovation of the Th√©√¢tre de l'Archev√™ch√© and thus making it the heart of the Festival. New operas were commissioned, most recently the 2005 production of Julie by the Belgian composer Philippe Boesmans, based on Strindberg's Miss Julie. In 2006, it featured concerts and operas as well as master classes. These included Wagner's Das Rheingold conducted by Sir Simon Rattle with Sir Willard White as Wotan; Mozart's The Magic Flute, conducted by Daniel Harding; Rossini's The Italian Girl in Algiers; the Berlin Philharmonic playing Mahler's 5th Symphony; and Pierre Boulez, conducting and on the piano and works by Henry Purcell. From 2007 the festival was directed by Bernard Foccroulle, who commissioned, among others, George Benjamin's opera with Martin Crimp Written on Skin. Foccroulle was replaced in 2018 by Pierre Audi. Performance spaces Performances are given in a variety of locations, including: *the Th√©√¢tre de l'Archev√™ch√©, in the courtyard of the former archbishop's palace *the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Provence, opened in 2007 *the Jeu de Paumes, a restored 18th century theatre *the courtyard of the H√¥tel Maynier d'Opp√®de *the Th√©√¢tre du Grand Saint-Jean, in the grounds of a chateau near Aix See also * List of opera festivals References External links * Festival d'Aix-en- Provence at Google Cultural Institute Category:Opera festivals Category:Classical music festivals in France Category:Tourist attractions in Aix-en-Provence Category:Music festivals established in 1948 Category:Early music festivals Category:1948 establishments in France ","title":"Aix-en-Provence Festival"},{"id":"3691751","text":"Thomas Paine Asset-based egalitarianism is a form of egalitarianism which theorises that equality is possible by a redistribution of resources, usually in the form of a capital grant provided at the age of majority. Names for the implementation of this theory in policy include universal basic capital and stakeholding, and are generally synonymous within the equal opportunity egalitarian framework.Cunliffe, J & Erreygers, G (2004) The Origins of Universal Grants: An Anthology of Historical Writings on Basic Capital and Basic Income Historical development The idea has been around since Thomas Paine (January 29, 1737 ‚Äì June 8, 1809) in his work Agrarian Justice 1795, and complemented his other thesis of basic income.Paine, T (1795) Agrarian Justice Two independent schools of thought were developed on the subject, involving individuals from the American labor movement and scholars of the Belgian School. However, the same reasoning (given by both schools) behind the basic capital proposal is the redistribution of wealth usually funded by an inheritance tax in order to provide a universal and unconditional sum of money (or capital assets) at the age of majority. From most authors, the intention was to create a nominal grant for everyone based on a deserved natural inheritance of the earth. Relationship with policy In the policy format, asset-based egalitarianism is usually seen as the opposite policy proposal of Philippe Van Parijs and his thesis of basic income,Van Parijs, P (1995) Real Freedom for All: what if anything can justify capitalism? but asset-based egalitarian proposals have received less academic attention. However, more recently the wave of third way politics has seen much more emphasis placed on responsibility and equality of opportunity and has reopened an old debate. Some famous recent work on the policy efficaciousness of universal basic capital or asset-based egalitarianism has been conducted by Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott in The Stakeholder Society. In this policy proposal, the method of funding the 'stake' was by means of a wealth tax and provides a sum of $80,000 for those reaching the age of majority. In actual policy, Gordon Brown and the British Labour Party initiated the United Kingdom Child Trust Fund, while in the United States the idea has been implemented in the form of individual development accounts and argued for by Michael Sherraden. These remain the nearest practical examples. One of the motivations of the related policy such as the Child Trust Fund is clear from this excerpt: Criticism Asset-based egalitarian policies, such as the Ackerman and Alstott proposals, are often criticised as not being egalitarian. Due to different people having different abilities and talents to utilise financial wealth, there is always a risk that those without formal financial education would alienate their own freedom by dissipating their capital or \\"stakeblowing\\". Stuart White argued that unless education corrected for this, there would be an inegalitarian outcome, as people fundamentally have different asset-management capacities.White, S (2006) ‚ÄúThe Citizen‚Äôs Stake and Paternalism‚Äù in Ackerman, B et al.

She is perhaps most remembered for The Swan Suit.Helena Nyblom at runeberg.orgJohn Bauer at www.bpib.com She died in Stockholm. Biography John Bauer, to Helena Nyblom's fairy tale \\"The Ring\\". Helena was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, daughter to the Danish painter J√∏rgen Roed. Her brother was the painter Holger Roed. In September 1864 she married the Swedish academic Carl Rupert Nyblom, Associate Professor of Aesthetics at Uppsala University, and at the end of the month the newly- weds took a steamer to Uppsala. Helena's first writings were poems and short stories. The stories, written in Danish and then translated into Swedish by her husband, were first published in the Ny Illustrerad Tidskrift (New Illustrated Journal) and subsequently collected in four volumes between 1875 and 1881. Helena did not think highly of the stories, which she regarded as potboilers. (The Nybloms had six children and needed the money.) Innately musical, she put more of herself into her poems, many of which were later set to music by Emil Sj√∂gren and other composers. Her first collection of poems, written in Danish, came out in 1881. It attracted attention not just in Denmark, but also in Sweden, where it was praised by the poet Carl Snoilsky. She published her first fairy tales in 1897, when she was 54 years old. In all she wrote more than 80 fairy tales, in which she mixed Swedish folklore, ancient myths and romantic motifs. Many of her tales contain clear feminist messages. Besides publishing her own collections, she also contributed to the Swedish folklore and fairy tales annual Among Gnomes and Trolls, where many of her tales were illustrated by John Bauer. In 1895, Helena converted to Roman Catholicism in St. Eugenia's Church (Stockholm). The conversion received great attention in the media and she endured much criticism in her circle of friends to have fallen for Rome. Her husband, himself not a Catholic, publicly defended her conversion. The Catholic minority in Stockholm was proud of the famous convert. (Because Nyblom converted in adulthood her children were educated in Church of Sweden, but a son converted later in life and gave rise to a large Catholic family.) Nyblom died 9 October 1926, and is buried in Uppsala Old Cemetery.

At the 2011 census the population had been incorporated in Loggerheads. History The name means \\"land once cultivated and left fallow(Ley) in the near ash trees\\" Ashley Dale and Jugbank. Mainly sandstone cottages now mixed in with modern housing. From medieval times men have indiscriminately hacked clearings in the forests, then linked them with tracks and lanes following no specific pattern. The church of St John the Baptist possesses a 17th-century tower with the remainder built in 1860-62 by J. Ashdown of London in a style representative of the 13th-14th century. The church is notable for its collection of funerary art from several centuries. The spectacular tomb of Sir Gilbert Gerard (d. 1592) and his wife Anne Radcliffe (d. 1608) was later supplemented by free-standing, kneeling figures of their son, Thomas Gerard, 1st Baron Gerard and his son, Gibert 2nd Baron Gerard. This composite family group dominates the Gerard Chapel, on the north side of the church. This is balanced on the south side by the Kinnersley Chapel, containing the memorials of the Kinnersleys of Clough Hall. Most impressive is the sculpture of Thomas Kinnersley I, by Francis Leggatt Chantrey. His son and successor is commemorated by a large and elaborate structure, the work of Matthew Noble. Near to the church is a mound as yet unexcavated but thought to be a burial ground from the time of the Black Death.

It is spoken in Guinea Bissau, Senegal and The Gambia. It is also called by its native speakers as guinensi, kriyol, or . Guinea-Bissau Creole is spoken as a native tongue by approximately 15% (190,000) of Bissau-Guineans and as a second language by approximately 50% (as of some time before 1992). A variant of Guinea-Bissau Creole is also spoken in southern Senegal, mainly in the region of Casamance, a former Portuguese colony, which is known as Portuguis Creole or Casamance Creole. Creole is the majority language of the inhabitants of the Casamance region and is used as a language of commerce. Standard Portuguese is the official language of Guinea- Bissau, but Guinea-Bissau Creole is the language of trade, informal literature and entertainment. It is not used in either news media, parliament, public services or educational programming. History The creole languages of Upper Guinea are the oldest-known creoles whose lexicons derive heavily from Portuguese. They first appeared around Portuguese settlements established along the northwest coast of Africa; Guinea-Bissau Creole was among these Portuguese-lexified creoles to have emerged. Portuguese merchants and settlers started to mix with locals almost immediately. A small body of settlers called lan√ßados (\\"the thrown out ones\\"), contributed to the spread of the Portuguese language and influence by being intermediaries between the Portuguese and natives. There are three main varieties of this creole in Guinea-Bissau and Senegal: Bissau and Bolama, Bafata, and Cacheu‚ÄìZiguinchor. The creole's substrate language is the language of the local peoples: Mandingas, Manjacos, Pep√©is and others, but most of the lexicon (around 80%) comes from Portuguese. The Portuguese-influenced dialect of Casamance, known as Portuguis Creole or Casamance Creole, similar to the one of Cacheu (Guinea-Bissau) has some influence of French. ' (, English: Children of the Land) and ' (Port. ', Eng. Children of Nobles) speak it, all of them are known, locally, as Purtuguis because they adopt European habits, are Catholics and speak a Creole. They are descendants of Portuguese men and African women. Most of them have Portuguese surnames, such as da Silva, Carvalho or Fonseca. The former Casamance Kingdom made a friendly alliance with the Portuguese and the local king adopted European lifestyle, and there were Portuguese in his court. In 1899, the city was ceded to France and in the middle of the 20th century, the language spread to the surrounding area. After Senegal's independence from France, the Creole people were seen as friends of the French, and discrimination by the more numerous northern Wolof-speaking community started, which has caused Casamance to struggle for independence since 1982. Today, although they continue to struggle, the movement is more placid and learning Portuguese is popular in Casamance because they see it has a link to their past. It is also learned across Senegal since the independence of the country from France. In Senegal, the creole is the first language of at least 46,500 people (1998); it is mainly spoken in Ziguinchor, but there are also speakers in other Casamance cities and in The Gambia. The use of Guinea-Bissau Creole is still expanding but with growing interference from Portuguese (due to television, literacy, prestige and emigration to Portugal) and African languages (through the migration of speakers of native African languages to the main urban centres of Guinea-Bissau, where the creole is prevalent). Example Universal Declaration of Human Rights Creole: Tudu pekaduris ta padidu libri i igual na balur suma na diritus. Suma e dadu kapasidadi di pensa, e tene tambi konsiensia, e dibi di trata nutru suma ermons. Portuguese: Todas as pessoas que nascem s√£o iguais e livres nos direitos.

Lavaux consist of 830 hectares of terraced vineyards that stretch for about 30 km along the south-facing northern shores of Lake L√©man. Although there is some evidence that vines were grown in the area in Roman times, the actual vine terraces can be traced back to the 11th century, when Benedictine and Cistercian monasteries controlled the area. It benefits from a temperate climate, but the southern aspect of the terraces with the reflection of the sun in the lake and the stone walls gives a mediterranean character to the region. The main wine grape variety grown here is the Chasselas.  World Heritage site  Under cantonal law, the vineyards of Lavaux are protected from development. Since July 2007, Lavaux is a UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Since 2016, the vineyards of Lavaux are not treated with synthetic pesticides any more.

In 1977, the voters of the Canton of Vaud accepted (55%) the cantonal popular initiative \\"Save Lavaux\\" Consequently, in 1979, a law was made to protect Lavaux (Loi sur le plan de protection de Lavaux). In 2003, the new constitution of the Canton of Vaud came into force but did not contain the article about the protection of Lavaux. A second popular initiative \\"Save Lavaux\\" was launched to re-introduce it and was accepted in 2005 by 81% of voters. In 2009, Franz Weber launched a third initiative \\"Save Lavaux\\" to reduce the possibilities to build new buildings in Lavaux, which was rejected on 19 May 2014 by 68% of voters.

It was founded in 1904 to serve the educational needs of the new city of Kennewick. It is one of only a few schools to have its music department honored with the title of \\"Grammy Signature School\\". The school is part of the Kennewick School District. The current building, constructed in 1954 and originally named Edwin S. Black Senior High School, is located at 500 S. Dayton St., and incorporates the remainder of the second high school building, which until 1966 served as Park Junior High School (now known as Park Middle School) as an annex. Both buildings were renovated in the mid-1990s, the annex first, then the main building. The first building has long since been demolished, the location became until 1994 the location of Kennewick School District 17's administration. For 64 years until the founding of Kamiakin High School, Kennewick High School served as the sole high school in the city. Its colors are orange and black, and its mascot is a lion. Football and soccer games are played at Neil F. Lampson Stadium, which is located on the high school's grounds and is shared by both Kamiakin and Southridge High School. Athletics Recently, because of a change in enrollment accounting by the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association, Kennewick High, along with Kamiakin and Southridge, was reclassified as a 3A school. As a result, the Columbia Basin Big 9 Conference (which consisted of 11 schools), was reconfigured into the Mid Columbia Conference. The new conference now consists of 8 schools; four 3A and four 4A. Kennewick High is in the 3A division, along with Kamiakin, Southridge, Hanford High School. The 4A division consists of Richland High School, Pasco High School, Walla Walla High School, and Chiawana High School. Kennewick High School has a traditional rivalry with Kamiakin High School, however in recent years both schools have become bigger rivals with Southridge High School than with each other. Fight song The school's fight song, \\"Onward Kennewick\\", is based upon the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison's fight song, (as well as the Wisconsin state song) \\"On, Wisconsin!\\", with the words 'Onward Kennewick' replacing 'On, Wisconsin', as well as minor changes in the lyrics, depending on whatever sport season it was.

It originally aired weekday mornings between 5-10am on then-flagship radio station KXJM (Jammin 107.5 FM), with the last four hours of the show being broadcast live online with fully produced video, and repeated every four hours until the next show. The show was also on at various hours in the morning on its syndicated affiliates. From its conception on February 12, 2000 to May 12, 2008 the show's flagship station was the \\"Original\\" Jammin' 95.5 KXJM (now KXTG). The Playhouse also had a nightly TV show called Playhouse TV that was able to be watched on Comcast's On Demand service in the Portland and Eugene areas. The show was aired nightly on Comcast in the Portland and Eugene metropolitan areas on channel 14 until the service was discontinued. The Playhouse was canceled by KXJM on December 1, 2009.http://www.allaccess.com/net- news/archive/story/67695/the-playhouse-is-gone-from-jammin-107-5 It is unclear at this time what the circumstances were surrounding their departure from KXJM.

A frequent caller nicknamed \\"Special Jen\\", who appeared to be intellectually disabled, was invited on stage. P.K. then asked if it were true that she \\"had learned how to wipe herself.\\" When someone else then asked \\"to see her ass,\\" she pulled down her pants, according to an audience member. \\"All the while, the cast of The Playhouse jumped around, pointing, mugging at each other, slapping their foreheads, stomping their feet, et. cetera,\\" said another witness. This all came after a similar event in February where another DJ broadcast a conversation with a woman suffering from schizophrenia saying she was \\"the ugliest, fattest lady I've ever seen in my life.\\" Mental-health advocates then flooded the station with calls and persuaded a major advertiser to yank its ads. In response to the \\"Special Jen\\" incident, Program Manager Tim MacNamara issued orders that 'Jen' be kept off the air and out of any future Playhouse events.Once again, the live wires at Jammin 95.5 have shown their superiority --by embarrassing vulnerable people, Willamette Week =The Portland biking incident= On July 13, 2006, Neveen told a story about a friend who had recently hit a cyclist with her car while driving downtown. She then mentioned that she had another cyclist punch her car hood, and cut her off in traffic. In response, host P.K. encouraged listeners to call in and tell more stories of cyclists who had been smashed by cars because the thought of it \\"really pumped him up.\\" He went on to say how much he hated cyclists who didn't obey traffic laws and stated, \\"When I hear on TV that a cyclist has been hit and killed by a car I laugh, I think it's funny. If you are a cyclist you should know I exist, that I don't care about you. That I don't care about your life.\\" Local Radio Host Riles up Bike Community, Portland Mercury Community group \\"Bike Portland\\" attempted to stage a protest in front of the KXJM studios, but were soon turned away by the program manager of the station, Tim McNamara. The studio's phone lines were flooded with various threats of harm, media attention, and protest.

The show was told that Chung had previously visited a local army office, inquiring about where he could \\"purchase a machine gun\\". Chung was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward after the incident, but on 16 September 2009 the show received a new handwritten letter sent from the institution, in which he re- detailed his wish to \\"sue for $6 billion\\" or a settlement of $100 million to \\"have a good time with.\\"The Playhouse broadcast of 16 September 2009 However, the letter also provided a clue as to the motive for the physical and written attacks; Chung wrote of a 'radio wife' that he had met at a 'radio school' many years ago, and subsequently lost contact with. He apparently knew that the lady listened to the show and phoned in to express his feelings on-air, only to be cut off by the host before he could do so.The Playhouse broadcast of 17 September 2009 As a result, the show's team believe Chung blames them for this failed love. Despite all of the controversy and threat, P.K. expressed his willingness to make peace with Chung, saying \\"the possibility is there to be on his good side.\\" There is no information yet on Chung's release date from the hospital. =Cancellation on KXJM= On December 1, 2009 The Playhouse was canceledhttp://www.allaccess.com/net- news/archive/story/67695/the-playhouse-is-gone-from-jammin-107-5 on its home station KXJM (Jammin 107.5 FM). At this time, it is unclear what the circumstances surrounding their departure were. Within hours of their disappearance from Jammin 107.5's website, a new website surfaced for the show at playhousedemo.com. In the weeks prior to their cancellation, the station began to require that music be played every so often during each broadcast of the show, much to the frustration of the hosts. It is unknown if this was a factor in their departure from KXJM. The following day, December 2, 2009, it was announced via Ivan's Twitter and Facebook accounts that they will be returning to a \\"new PDX home\\" in early 2010, and was able to be heard on KSEQ in Fresno, CA. In February 2010, Ivan announced through his Facebook account that himself and PK will do mornings at KKHH in Houston, TX starting Monday, February 22 and named \\"The Hot Show\\". It is unclear if DuRyan and Tony will join them in Houston. Since moving to Houston, there has been no further news of a move back to Portland.

Market segments can also correlate with location, and this can be useful in targeted marketing. Geomarketing is applied in the financial sector through identifying ATMs traffic generators and creating hotspots maps based on geographical parameters integrated with customer behavior.Geomarketing Geomarketing has a direct impact on the development of modern trade and the reorganization of retail types. Site selection becomes automated and based on scientific procedures that saves both time and money. Geomarketing uses key facts, a good base map, Whois data layers, consumer profiling, and success/fail criteria. GPS tracking and GSM localization can be used to obtain the actual position of the travelling customer. Software GIS software is used to display data that can be linked to a geographic region or area. It can be used to: * Recommend nearby social events. * Determine where the customers are (on country, city, street or user level). * Determine who the customer is (on organisation or user level), or make a guess on it based on earlier encounters by tracking IP address, credit card information, VOIP address, etc. * Visualize any data in a geographic context by linking it to a digital map. * Locate a web client's computer on a digital map. * Calculate summary information for specific areas. * Select customers within specific areas. * Select customers with a certain radius of a point. * Using micro-geographic segmentation select customers similar to a specific type in the rest of the country. Some of the software used includes Geoconcept Sales&Marketing; Portal, MapInfo, ArcGIS (ESRI), RegioGraph (GfK), WIGeoWeb (WIGeoGIS) assorted open source like Mapwindow, DIVA (which while normally used for bio-diversity creates very visually pleasing density maps), GRASS (which works in Linux and Windows environments) GeoEdge (tracking local ads and pages). Several other software are available. Indeed, Google Earth provides an excellent set of images that are always useful. Applications =Different content by choice= Location-based social media marketing uses geo-specific tools to draw imaginary perimeters that will display all of the social content posted by users in that particular area. A typical example for different web content by location is the FedEx website at FedEx.com where users have the choice to select their country geo ‚Äî location first and are then presented with different site or article content depending on their selection. =Automated different content= Individuals can deliver different content in internet marketing, through paid or organic search results, based on the geographical geolocation of the targeted audiences. =Other applications= * Solve problems regarding location of a new retail outlet * Map consumer demand trends to best distribute products and advertising. This links with trade zone management. * Scope digital advertising towards individual consumers and producers. * Research consumer shopping patterns and observe traffic within shopping centers and between retail outlets. It also helps in visualisation of market research findings and help improve the overall planning ability of organisations. * Improve customer cooperation. * Creation of sales territories We can define the geo-marketing as a strategy and mechanism that provides valuable information that helps in the process of making business decisions using geographical information. The functions of this to search and evaluate marketing opportunities, analyzing geographical information such as location residential areas, topography, it also analyzes demographic information such as age, genre, annual income and lifestyle. This information can be segmented as primary data and sub-segmented as secondary data; in addition, it helps us to develop successful promotional campaigns achieving our marketing goals. This also works with retail chain stores in the sales industry, real estate, and renewable energy, among others. With geomarketing, the general data of a company changes to be more specific regarding their customers and market trends. This allows companies to use secondary data wisely, providing excellent results at low cost compared with traditional market research methods. All data is acquired accurately with GPS equipment and geographical information software, once the data is acquired, this information is processed by professionals in the field. Geomarketing has helped companies to acquire valuable information such as transit behaviors, most visited places or areas, etc., this information will help these companies to deliver the right message (or promotion), at the right time and place. Most companies use their mobile apps to obtain this information. Mobile apps became more sophisticated using GPS, Bluetooth, and also social networks to obtain their market information, this information helps to improve their promotional campaigns. According to comScore, about 60 percent of all Internet activities in the U.S. originates from mobile devices and about half of total Internet traffic flows through mobile apps. One example of Geo Location is Google Maps ‚Äî you can search in Google Maps Restaurants near me and it will show different options around your location. One important factor that companies (in this case restaurants) is that they must be sure to optimize their business in Google's directory list.

It is the result of research carried out in the mid-1980s by Terrence Sejnowski and Charles Rosenberg. The intent behind NETtalk was to construct simplified models that might shed light on the complexity of learning human level cognitive tasks, and their implementation as a connectionist model that could also learn to perform a comparable task. NETtalk is a program that learns to pronounce written English text by being shown text as input and matching phonetic transcriptions for comparison. Achievements and limitations NETtalk was created to explore the mechanisms of learning to correctly pronounce English text. The authors note that learning to read involves a complex mechanism involving many parts of the human brain. NETtalk does not specifically model the image processing stages and letter recognition of the visual cortex. Rather, it assumes that the letters have been pre-classified and recognized, and these letter sequences comprising words are then shown to the neural network during training and during performance testing. It is NETtalk's task to learn proper associations between the correct pronunciation with a given sequence of letters based on the context in which the letters appear. In other words, NETtalk learns to use the letters around the currently pronounced phoneme that provide cues as to its intended phonemic mapping.

In his remarks to the board and in his publications he would urge art museums to display masterpieces of art, not reproductions, and make it easy for the visitor to engage with them; to consider the visitor's comfort (he coined the term \\"museum fatigue\\"); and to focus on aesthetics, not on art history. He also introduced docents to the museum, coining that word. His major publication Museum Ideals of Purpose and Method (1918) is an extended argument for this idea of the museum.

The back cover of the album shows it as two words \\"ULTRA violet\\" in the mixed-case style of the track listing, but the inside package material of some issues of the album has it as one word. is a song by Irish rock band U2, and the tenth track from their 1991 album Achtung Baby. Ostensibly about love and dependency, the song also lends itself to religious interpretations, with listeners finding allusions to the Book of Job and writers finding spiritual meaning in its invocation of the light spectrum. The song's composition and recording incorporate both serious and throwaway elements, in keeping with the rest of Achtung Baby. While not released as a single, the song has appeared in two films and a U2 business venture was named after it. \\"Ultraviolet\\" played a featured role during the encores of the group's 1992‚Äì1993 Zoo TV Tour, 2009‚Äì2011 U2 360¬∞ Tour, and the Joshua Tree Tour 2017. Recording \\"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\\" began as two different demos, one variously called \\"Ultraviolet\\" and \\"69\\" (which eventually evolved into the B-side \\"Lady with the Spinning Head\\") and an alternately arranged demo called \\"Light My Way\\".Stokes (2005), pp. 102, 106 Over the course of the recording sessions, U2 added various overdubs to the song, but producer Brian Eno believed these additions negatively impacted the track. Eno aided the group in editing down the song, and he explained his assistance as such: \\"I'd go in and say, 'The song has gone, whatever it is you liked about this song is not there anymore. Sometimes, for example, the song would have disappeared under layers of overdubs.\\" Composition and interpretation \\"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\\" is written in a 4/4 time signature. The lyrics of \\"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\\" are addressed to a lover, and imply that their relationship is threatened by some sort of personal or spiritual crisis, coupled with a sense of unease over obligations.Graham (2004), p. 50 Indeed, lead vocalist Bono has called the song \\"a little disturbed\\". The song opens with 45 seconds of soft synthesizers and ethereal vocals, somewhat akin in atmospherics to the group's early 1980s songs \\"Tomorrow\\" and \\"Drowning Man\\"; during this, Bono laments that \\"sometimes I feel like checking out.\\"Beeaff (2000), p. 39 This is followed by the entrance of drums and guitar in a familiar U2 rhythm, as Bono describes the burdens of love and how he is \\"in the black; can't see or be seen.\\" Each verse culminates with the refrain \\"Baby, baby, baby, light my way.\\" Flood, who engineered and mixed the recording, noted that there was considerable laughter and debate during the sessions about whether Bono could get away with singing the repeated \\"baby\\"s, one of the most heavily used clich√©s in pop songs and one that he had avoided up to that point in his songwriting; Flood later commented that \\"he got away with it alright.\\"Cogan (2008), p. 66 The U2 360¬∞ Tour staging of \\"Ultraviolet\\" features the claw-like stage awash in indigo and violet light. Although the song is ostensibly about love and dependency, like many U2 songs, it also lends itself to religious interpretations. Listeners have heard an allusion to the Book of Job 29:2‚Äì3 and its tale of God serving as a lamp upon Job's head walking through the darkness. Robyn Brothers suggests that ultraviolet light is \\"a metaphor for a divine force both unseen to the naked eye and ultimately unknowable to the human intellect.\\"Brothers (1999), p. 258 Conversely, Steve Stockman, author of Walk On: The Spiritual Journey Of U2, sees \\"Ultraviolet\\" as being about Bono's wife Ali Hewson, and \\"how when he feels like trash, she makes him clean,\\" but says there is good reason to interpret the song as being just as much about God.Stockman (2005), p. 72 The song's title supports this view: indigo and violet rarely appear in song lyrics as frequently as other colours, while ultraviolet represents an unseen wavelength beyond the visible spectrum.Rooksby (2006), pp. 80‚Äì81 As such, the title evokes the image of black light or an invisible force permeating the darkness, whose connotations are spiritual and personal, as well as technological, reflecting themes of modern alienation explored elsewhere on Achtung Baby and its follow-up album, Zooropa.Scharen (2006), pp. 135‚Äì136 Dianne Ebertt Beeaff, author of A Grand Madness: Ten Years on the Road with U2, sees the song's narrator as longing for assistance from any source, religious or secular: \\"This is a real plea, a bleary worn-down drained wish to disappear. A drowning man desperate to hold hands in the darkness, to have someone else point the way, to be safe and obscure.\\" Atara Stein sees \\"Ultraviolet\\" as one of several selections on the album in which the protagonist in crisis has elevated his lover into an object of worship, desperate for her to \\"return to her initial role as his guide and salvation.\\"Stein (1999), p. 271 \\"Ultraviolet\\" is also one of several songs Bono has written on the theme of woman as spirit, and it echoes the band's 1980 song \\"Shadows and Tall Trees\\" by juxtaposing love with the image of ceilings.Gilmour (2005), p. 66, 76 A line in Raymond Carver's late 1980s poem \\"Suspenders\\", about the quiet that comes into a house where no one can sleep, was subconsciously recycled by Bono into the lyric.Flanagan (1995), p. 346 In Achtung Babys running order, \\"Ultraviolet\\" serves, with the other two songs at the album's end, \\"Acrobat\\" and \\"Love Is Blindness\\", to explore how couples face the task of reconciling the suffering they have imposed on each other.Flanagan (1995), p. 22 The song features a Motown sound-style \\"telegraph key\\" rhythm, which gave it the feeling of a pop song. This and the \\"baby, baby\\" refrain gave the song a throwaway quality that fit in with Achtung Babys mission of deconstructing U2's image. Paradoxically, the arrangement also featured U2's 1980s \\"repeato-riff\\" guitar style and the rest of the lyric was a serious love song that dealt with themes of anxiety and despair. Bono has described \\"Ultraviolet\\" as \\"an epic U2 song [but] the key of it left my voice in a conversational place and allowed a different kind of lyric writing.\\"McCormick (2006), p. 228 Producer Eno wrote that a combination of opposites within each song was a signature characteristic of Achtung Baby and that as part of that, \\"Ultraviolet\\" had a \\"helicopterish melancholy\\". In Achtung Babys album package, \\"Ultraviolet\\" is presented next to a photograph of a crumbling Berlin building that has a Trabant parked in front of it. Reception Rolling Stone noted that \\"Ultraviolet\\" was one of the album's songs that hearkened more to the group's past than their new sound, saying that Edge's \\"soaring peals on [it] are instantly recognizable\\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that compared to much of the album's grim depictions of personal relations, \\"Ultraviolet\\" depicts love as a haven. In contrast, U2 write John Jobling sees \\"Ultraviolet\\" as continuing the album's theme of \\"two people tearing each other apart\\", despite its \\"spectral pop\\" arrangement.Jobling (2014), p. 221 The Boston Globe heard echoes of The Rolling Stones' 1966 song \\"Out of Time\\" in the chorus of \\"Ultraviolet\\". Entertainment Weekly called it the album's highlight, \\"where Bono's soaring voice and the Edge's pointillistic guitar meld to create one of those uplifting moments we listen to U2 for\\". Cedarville University literature professor Scott Calhoun says of one lyrical portion of \\"Ultraviolet\\", \\"That's so evocative and works as beautiful writing away from the music. It can stand on its own on the page and, of course, it's even more effective when accompanied by the music.\\" Other writers were less enthusiastic. Q magazine felt that the song was weak and that \\"Bono falls back on his old habit of trying to be 'inspirational' by banging up the heat from simmer to meltdown between the verse and chorus.\\" U2 chroniclers Bill Graham and Caroline van Oosten de Boer also see the song as a throwback to the group's earlier sound, but say that \\"the band doesn't sufficiently develop the initial idea to warrant the five minutes of 'Ultra Violet'\\". While \\"Ultraviolet\\" was not released as a single, it was used in a scene at the end of the 2006 Adam Sandler film Click, in which Sandler's character drives home from Bed, Bath and Beyond to happily see his family, and make up for the mistakes he made with his universal remote control. It was also featured in the 2007 film The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. The name Ultra Violet was also given to one of U2's improvised mid-1990s business initiatives, a joint merchandising venture with MCA Inc.'s Winterland division; the partnership soon dissolved, but not before producing several hundred thousand pairs of Bono \\"Fly\\" glasses.Gorman (2003), p. 283Fallon (1994) Live performances Performances of \\"Ultraviolet\\" on the 360¬∞ Tour consist of Bono wearing a laser-embedded suit and singing with a microphone embedded into a glowing steering wheel that hangs from above. \\"Ultraviolet\\" was first performed at Lakeland Arena in Lakeland, Florida on 29 February 1992 at the start of the Zoo TV Tour, and it remained a staple of the band's set lists for the first four legs of the tour, often preceded by a prank call by Bono as his alter-egos Mirror Ball Man or Mr. MacPhisto. The Edge played the song on his Gibson Explorer. It was staged with silver-and-mauve lights thrown against two glitter balls, causing light fragments to swirl around the audience, and with lasers flashing in quick rhythms.Beeaff (2000), pp. 60‚Äì61, 66‚Äì67 Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone characterised its essence as \\"desperately searching\\" and said that it helped transition the Zoo TV show towards an ambiguous, introspective conclusion. It became writer Beeaff's favourite live song on the tour, with Bono's intense, unrestrained singing producing a strong communal energy; she singled out the March 1992 Hampton Coliseum show as one in which Bono's fervent performance approached the point of emotional breakdown and generated \\"a transcendent and draining experience for everyone.\\" Although acknowledging the song is an \\"epic ... with some gorgeous aspects\\", Edge has said the song is unwieldy to play live. During Zoo TV, almost all of the numbers from Achtung Baby (and the rest of the set list) were augmented by sequencers to fill out the sound; on \\"Ultraviolet\\", under-the-stage keyboard tech Des Broadberry playing a sampled guitar figure in the background during Edge's solo parts.Flanagan (1995), p. 85 Its last performance as part of the tour was on 28 August 1993 in Dublin, after which the song was retired and did not appear on any of U2's next three subsequent tours (PopMart, Elevation, and Vertigo). The song was revived a decade and a half later with the launch of the U2 360¬∞ Tour on 30 June 2009 in Barcelona, where it was once again performed as part of the encore. It was introduced by a robotic voice reading excerpts from the poem \\"Funeral Blues\\" by W. H. Auden, followed by Bono's appearance wearing a laser-studded jacket on a darkened stage illuminated only by a glowing steering wheel-shaped microphone that hangs from above. During the performance, Bono would alternatively embrace or hang from the microphone, or twirl around it, or swing it overhead to emphasize the lyrics. The New York Times said its use as \\"a love song that can double as devotional\\" helped keep the show's music and messages in balance, while the Chicago Tribune said that Bono sang the song with fervor as part of an encore during which \\"the show's outsized ambitions produced a neon-lighted moment that nearly justified the costly enterprise.\\" Rolling Stone called the song's performance \\"one of the show's highpoints.\\" \\"Ultraviolet\\" continued to be performed during the encore throughout the first two legs of the tour, with minor changes such as the use of a different introduction. The band also played the song during its television appearance on Saturday Night Live on 26 September 2009. In an appearance that avoided both their recent singles and best-known hits, \\"Ultraviolet\\" was played as the group's third number, in full 360¬∞ Tour staging style as the show's end credits ran by. The song has been performed on the Joshua Tree Tours 2017 and 2019, accompanied by images of historical female figures and achievers on the video screen. Covers The Killers reworked the song for the 2011 tribute album AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered. \\"Achtung Baby was U2's 'Holy shit!' moment,\\" remarked drummer Ronnie Vannucci, Jr. \\"I was in high school when it came out and we'd drive around in my friend's mom's car and rock that shit all the time. When we were asked to record a cover, 'Ultraviolet' was a unanimous choice. It's reassuring to know that we're still on the same page after all these years. We brought it back to its bare bones, dumbed it down a little, took it back to the rock song underneath.\\" The beginning of the song was also sampled by Enigma in their 1994 song \\"The Eyes of Truth\\".

Insertion sequences have two major characteristics: they are small relative to other transposable elements (generally around 700 to 2500 bp in length) and only code for proteins implicated in the transposition activity (they are thus different from other transposons, which also carry accessory genes such as antibiotic resistance genes). These proteins are usually the transposase which catalyses the enzymatic reaction allowing the IS to move, and also one regulatory protein which either stimulates or inhibits the transposition activity. The coding region in an insertion sequence is usually flanked by inverted repeats. For example, the well-known IS911 (1250 bp) is flanked by two 36bp inverted repeat extremities and the coding region has two genes partially overlapping orfA and orfAB, coding the transposase (OrfAB) and a regulatory protein (OrfA). A particular insertion sequence may be named according to the form ISn, where n is a number (e.g. IS1, IS2, IS3, IS10, IS50, IS911, IS26 etc.); this is not the only naming scheme used, however. Although insertion sequences are usually discussed in the context of prokaryotic genomes, certain eukaryotic DNA sequences belonging to the family of Tc1/mariner transposable elements may be considered to be, insertion sequences. Diagram illustrating the role of insertion sequences (\\"IS\\") in a composite transposon In addition to occurring autonomously, insertion sequences may also occur as parts of composite transposons; in a composite transposon, two insertion sequences flank one or more accessory genes, such as an antibiotic resistance gene (e.g. Tn10, Tn5). Nevertheless, there exist another sort of transposons, called unit transposons, that do not carry insertion sequences at their extremities (e.g. Tn7). A complex transposon does not rely on flanking insertion sequences for resolvase. The resolvase is part of the tns genome and cuts at flanking inverted repeats. Transposition frequency of IS elements is dependent of multiple parameters, including culture growth phase, medium composition, oxygen tension, growth scale, and structural conformation of target sites (e.g.: curvature, presence of certain motifs, DNA composition).

The film satirizes the advertising world, the portrayal of race in Hollywood films, the white power structure, and the nature of corporate corruption. In 2016, the film was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot Putney Swope, the only black man on the executive board of an advertising firm, is accidentally put in charge after the sudden death of the chairman of the board: prevented by the company by-laws from voting for themselves, in a secret ballot, most board members voted for the one person they thought could not win: Putney Swope. Renaming the business \\"Truth and Soul, Inc.\\", Swope replaces all but one of the white employees with blacks and insists they no longer accept business from companies that produce alcohol, tobacco or toy guns. The success of the business draws unwanted attention from the United States government, which considers it \\"a threat to the national security\\". Production In an interview on the DVD version of the film, Downey states that Arnold Johnson had great difficulty memorizing and saying his lines during the film shoot. Downey says he was not concerned because he had developed a plan to dub in his own voice to replace Johnson's. Though the movie is in black-and-white, Truth and Soul's commercials are shown in color. Release The film opened on July 10, 1969 at Cinema II in New York City and grossed $32,281 in its first week. The film opened in Los Angeles on January 21, 1970 and the film's poster of a girl representing the middle finger of a hand, caused controversy and was not printed by the Los Angeles Times and was not reprinted by the Los Angeles Herald Examiner after initial complaints. The advertisement also caused controversy in Chicago with the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Today refusing to publish it, and it being pulled by the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Daily News, who all later published the advertisement without the girl as the middle finger. Roger Ebert was embarrassed by the Sun-Times censorship and the film set a house record of $16,000 at the 3 Penny Cinema in Chicago when it opened in February 1970 and, in LA, it was felt that the controversy also gave a boost to the film. =Home media= The film was released on DVD on May 22, 2001 by Rhino Home Video. Legacy The character Buck Swope (portrayed by Don Cheadle), from Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights, was named as an homage to this film. Robert Downey Sr. also made a small cameo in Boogie Nights as the owner of a recording studio. The character Wing Soney, a Chinese businessman, was the inspiration for Cosmo, the Chinese character throwing firecrackers during the drug deal scene. Paul Thomas Anderson, Louis C.K., and Jim Jarmusch have cited the film as an inspiration for their approach to filmmaking. The song \\"Shadrach\\" by the Beastie Boys, from their 1989 album Paul's Boutique, mentions the film in the lyric \\"Music for all and not just one people, and now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel\\". Dialogue from the film is sampled on The Avalanches‚Äô 2016 album Wildflower. Putney Swope was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2019.

It has a population of 26,111 (2010) and forms part of a larger urban area with the neighbouring town of Don Benito. Founded in the thirteenth century as Aldeanueva de Medell√≠n, the city was an important centre for the Mesta in the Middle Ages. It was the birthplace of Pedro de Valdivia who conquered Chile for the Spanish crown.  Location  Located in the county of Vegas Altas, Villanueva itself is the main gate of La Serena, another county of Extremadura to which it historically belongs. It is separated by only 5 km from Don Benito, forming Villanueva de la Serena-Don Benito, an urban agglomeration of around 60.000 inhabitants, making one of the most important agricultural, industrial and services centres in Extremadura. M√©rida (capital of Extremadura) and Badajoz (biggest city in the region) are respectively 58 and 116 km from Villanueva de la Serena. The natural trail (green way) of Vegas del Guadiana or \\"V√≠a Verde de las Vegas del Guadiana y las Villuercas\\" begins in this city. Data Jos√© Manuel Calder√≥n, First NBA player from the community of Extremadura. Detroit Pistons player Jos√© Calder√≥n was born in Villanueva de la Serena. Pedro Guti√©rrez de Valdivia] was a Spanish conquistador and the first royal governor of Chile. La Carrerita, a festivity of cultural interest, is celebrated in this city every last Sunday in the Easter week.

Automobility, more simply, refers to the utilization of automobiles as the major means of transportation. This phenomenon occurred primarily following the Second World War as a result of monumental social, economic, and political transformations. Americans began to move away from the city and into the suburbs, infrastructure and roads were dramatically improved, and governmental activism made travel safer and more efficient. It is argued, though, that mass automobility unintentionally fostered in hazardous pollutants due to emissions, higher mortality rates, and racial segregation in which the only beneficiary of the movement was the white middle-class. Impact on Suburbanization With an overlapping longing to own a home during this era, Americans looked to migrate away from the inner cities and settle in neighboring suburbs. Initially, though, inhabitants were constrained by the proximity of public transportation so that suburbs were only established within walking distance of the nearest trolley, bus, or train stop. However, thanks in large part to mass automobility, government programs, and improved road systems over time, Americans were no longer confined to these parameters and could now seek more expansive housing opportunities. Public transportation was unable to meet the new individualistic demands of the American public and, therefore, citizens hollowed out cities economically and demographically through their departure. This mass exodus and suburbanization also piloted strip development, the formation of shopping centers, the creation of fast-food restaurants, the making of drive-in theaters, the construction of bigger and better supermarkets, and the implementation of many other concepts that are connected with the mass consumption and application of automobile use. And, further, the assembly line techniques that helped meet the demand of the automobile consumers at the time contributed to the mass production of other goods like refrigerators, washing machines, and radios. Government Action The government programs that facilitated suburbanization also contributed to the mass automobility crusade. First and more closely related to the housing boom, The G.I. Bill provided World War II veterans with educational services, unemployment compensation, and various loans to purchase homes and start businesses. The passing of this proposal permitted a much more accommodating attitude toward mobility and leaving the city. Secondly, the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, signed into law by Dwight D. Eisenhower, authorized the expenditure of billion for the construction of 41,000 miles of the Interstate Highway System. The bill was originally designed for prompt evacuation and movement purposes in the event of a war in the United States and was the largest civil engineering project in human history at the time. This act now represents an immense political and financial commitment to a car and truck based land transportation society. It made travel easier and cost-effective, and greatly expedited the transfer of goods, people, information, and ideas. In addition to these factors, some other influencing issues with government involvement that allowed for such great automobility during this time were high tariffs on foreign products, the high availability of domestic petroleum, and low fuel prices. Negative Consequences There were some negative consequences associated with mass automobility as well. The emissions from cars left the country under a blanket of smog and led to some regulatory actions and standards from the government like the Clean Air Act in 1963 and 1970. Other safety legislation was passed to make cars more reliable and sounder after death rates were overwhelming and devastating. And, lastly, because owning an automobile and a home was a symbol of social status and wealth, the mass depopulation of inner cities of the white middle-class was accelerated by the movement which increased racial discrimination.

He began formal art studies at the age of 16 when he entered the Imperial Academy in Vienna, where he studied under Edmund von Hellmer.Collecting Sculpture. Fall 2001. New York: John Graham & Sons, Inc., 2001. 17. In 1886, he won a scholarship that allowed him to study in Rome for two years. While there he developed a love of Renaissance art that was to affect the nature of his mature sculpture. Upon returning to Austria, Konti worked as an architectural modeler. In 1890, 1891 or 1892 (depending on the source) Konti moved, permanently as it turned out, to America, there going straight to Chicago, where he began working on sculptural decorations for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition.Duncan, Alice Levi. Paul Manship and His Circle. New York: Gerald Peters Gallery, Inc., 2006. 7.Grubb, Nancy, and Carol A. McKeown. Paul Manship. New York: Cross River Press, Ltd., 1989. 22. When the work there was completed, he moved to New York City and commenced working as an assistant for fellow Austrian expatriate Karl Bitter. Konti's skills as a modeler kept him in much demand--for the 1900 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York; for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis; and for the 1915 Panama Pacific Exposition in San Francisco. In 1906 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1909. Konti died in Yonkers, New York on January 11, 1938. Architectural sculpture Like many sculptor of that epoch Konti created architectural sculpture. His works in this arena include: * Tympanum, Grace Chapel, New York City, 1894.Presumably the sculpture in tympanum above front door in this photo and in closer view, although this is another tympanum sculpture at the church. * Spandrel figures, the Elbridge Gerry Mansion, New York City, 1895. * Three Graces (for which Audrey Munson served as the model) Hotel Astor, New York City, 1907. * Frieze: ‚ÄúA Festival Procession of the Arts,‚Äù Gainsborough Studios, 222 Central Park South, New York City, 1908. * Statues of Justinian and Alfred the Great, Cuyahoga County Courthouse, Cleveland, Ohio, 1910. **Twelve statues: Herbert Adams, Daniel Chester French, and Herman Matzen each modeled two of the others.

Origins Military pilot training during World War I was undertaken by private contractors; principally the New Zealand Flying School of the Walsh Brothers in Auckland and the Canterbury Aviation Company formed by Henry Wigram in Christchurch. When the New Zealand Permanent Air Force was formed in June 1923, war surplus Avro 504K and Bristol F2B Fighters transferred from Britain were used for training purposes, supplemented from 1929 by de Havilland Gypsy Moths and replaced from 1931 by Hawker Tomtits and Avro 626s. A single two seat Gloster Grebe provided conversion training on that type. in anticipation of the delivery of Vickers Wellington bombers, twin engine monoplane training began on the first of 229 Airspeed Oxfords in 1938. World War II By the outbreak of World War II the more modern of these types had been formed into No. 1 Flying Training School RNZAF at Wigram, while advanced training on types such as the Oxford had been separated. Due to the Commonwealth Air Training Plan, other schools were under construction at Taieri, and Woodbourne. A large number of additional FTSs followed with the first few years of the war, while from 1939 335 de Havilland Tiger Moths manufactured in Wellington provided the main primary trainers. Until 1941 much advanced training was done on retired combat types such as the Hawker Hind, Vickers Vildebeest and Fairey Gordon but these were gradually replaced by 202 locally assembled North American Harvards. Post war Harvards continued to be used until the mid-1970sCT/4E Airtrainers at the Whenuapai air show in March 2009After the second world war, primary flying training was conducted by No.1 Flying Training School at Taieri, and from 1956 Wigram. The Tiger Moths were phased out, Harvards being used for ab intio training, de Havilland Devon and two seat De Havilland Vampires being used for advanced training. 1 FTS became the Pilot Training Squadron in 1966. The squadron received a small number of AESL Airtourer in 1970 and re-equipped with Pacific Aerospace CT-4B Airtrainers in 1976, these subsequently being replaced by more powerful CT-4Es. Advanced training on BAC Strikemaster and Aermacchi MB-339 shifted to No. 14 Squadron RNZAF, twin engined training on Fokker Friendships and later Cessna Golden Eagles and Beechcraft Super King Airs being undertaken by No. 42 Squadron RNZAF. No. 3 Squadron undertook basic rotary training with the Bell 47. When Wigram closed in 1993 the squadron shifted to Ohakea. Current syllabus Currently students are put through a 34-week course of lectures and flying, the latter being 108 hours dual instruction and 38 hours solo flying and then are streamed into rotary or multi engine courses before acquiring their wings. Some Malaysian and Singaporean Air Force pilots are also trained. The Squadron motto is 'ab ovo usque', (Latin; 'from the beginning').

It was also an online retailer owned by Home Decor Products from 2004 to 2009. History A Hechinger Store in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in 1999. Sidney L. Hechinger had initially established himself in the wrecking and salvage business in 1911, and in 1919 opened his first hardware store in Southwest Washington, D.C. Sidney Hechinger focused his hardware business exclusively on retail customers in 1924, eschewing contractors and builders. His decision foresaw the rise of the home improvement industry before the sector even had a name. The five-store company reorganized in 1953, with Sidney's son John and son-in-law Richard England becoming partners in the company, which was divided into a retail hardware business and a wholesale building supplies company, the latter being called Richard England Associates. John also served as the first appointed City Council chairman of Washington, D.C. In 1972, John Hechinger, Sr. and brother- in-law Richard England took the ten-store company public with an offering of 400,000 shares. John Hechinger, Jr. became the third generation of Hechingers to head the company when he was named president of the 54-store chain in 1986. Later that year, Hechinger Co. announced plans to reincorporate in Delaware, which was approved in a January 1987 shareholders' meeting. Hechinger had grown to a 69-store chain by the time it made its December 1987 offer to acquire the six stores of Virginia Beach, Virginia-based Home Quarters Warehouse (HQ) for $66 million. HQ had been founded in 1984 by W.R. Grace & Co. in the mold of big-box stores such as Home Depot, and operated as a separate division of Hechinger Co. In the 1980s, it underwent a massive expansion of both HQ and the Hechinger Co. divisions, opening big-box stores to better compete with rivals Home Depot and Lowe's. In January 1995, Hechinger announced it would close or reformat 22 of its 131 stores, including closing all 14 of the Home Quarters Warehouse stores in North and South Carolina. In August of that year, Hechinger Co. consolidated HQ with Hechinger in a further restructuring. Searching for a niche, Hechinger management in 1997 launched new, smaller concept stores such as Better Spaces in Albany, New York in February and Wye River Hardware & Home in Wheaton and Rockville in August. In July 1997, Los Angeles, California-based investors Leonard Green & Partners announced plans to buy Hechinger Co. for $3 per share, or about $127 million, intending to merge Hechinger with Builders Square, which it had purchased from Kmart for $10 million. However, when Hechinger posted a second quarter loss of $40.6 million in August, Leonard Green cut their offer price, and ultimately purchased Hechinger Company for $2.375 per share, or about $100.2 million, in September 1997. After several rounds of store closings, the Hechinger Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 11, 1999, but the reorganization failed. Later that year, in September 1999, Hechinger's assets were liquidated, including its 117 remaining stores. In 2004, Home D√©cor Products bought the Hechinger brand name and opened an online retailer the following year,Kelly, John, \\"A Familiar Brand, Reborn in Pixels\\", The Washington Post, March 28, 2006 which sold the same products as the former brand. On February 5, 2009, it was announced that the site would shut down and Hechinger would no longer sell tools. The site closed shortly thereafter.

The lineage of 1st MLG dates back to 1 July 1947 when it was activated as the 1st Combat Service Group (1st CSG), Service Command, Fleet Marine Force at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In the same month, 1st CSG was relocated to Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California. =Korean War= In August 1950, 1st CSG was deployed to Kobe, Japan; and was subsequently deployed in September 1950 to Inchon, Korea, assigned to the 1st Marine Division. They participated in the Korean War, fighting at Inchon- Seoul, Chosin Reservoir, the East-Central front, and the Western front. In August 1951, they were reassigned to the Fleet Marine Force; and in October 1951, reassigned to the 1st Marine Division. In May 1953, they were again reassigned to Fleet Marine Force and relocated to MCB Camp Pendleton, California. On 1 March 1957, 1st CSG was redesignated as the 1st Force Service Regiment. =Vietnam War= In May 1965 detachments of 1st FSR were sent to Okinawa and Vietnam. In August 1965 Headquarters Battalion, 1st FSR were sent to Vietnam. In February 1967, the 1st Force Service Regiment was deployed to the Republic of Vietnam. On 15 February 1967, they were redesignated/assigned as the 1st Force Service Regiment, Force Logistic Command, Fleet Marine Force and assigned to the III Marine Amphibious Force.

(December 2006, USMC photo) The Marines of 1st MLG were deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom on four occasions. ;First deployment: The 1st FSSG deployed to Iraq in early 2003 in response to the continual rejection of UN inspectors. In March 2003, 1st FSSG elements joined the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF) in the crossing into Iraq. After approximately one month and the fall of Bagdad, the war was declared over. The Marines of 1st FSSG along with the 1st MEF redeployed back into the States over the rest of the summer 2003. ;Second deployment: In January 2004, the 1st FSSG deployed to Iraq for a second time ‚Äì for 14 months to various camps in Iraq to include Camp Taqaddum (Headquarters), Camp Fallujah, Al Asad Air Base, Camp Habbiniyah, and, after the Abu Ghraib scandal, they took over guarding the prison as well. The group was involved with Operation Al Fajr (The Second Battle of Fallujah), the operation to retake the city of Fallujah. The artillery that helped bombard the city were stationed in the 1st FSSG HQ area. They returned to Camp Pendleton in early 2006. In October 2005, the group was redesignated as 1st Marine Logistics Group in an effort to make the name reflect the mission. The lower subordinate units were reorganized and some renamed. ; Third deployment: In February 2007, the Group returned from their third deployment, having served in several locations, including Camp Fallujah, Camp Taqaddum and Al Asad Air Base. The deployment was part of two seven-month assignments, but many Marines stayed for the greater duration of 14 months. ; Fourth deployment: In February 2008, under the command of BGen Robert R. Ruark, took over for the 2nd Marine Logistics Group (Forward) at Camp Taqaddum, operating in Al Anbar Province.

It is a popular and widely used pattern for both freshwater and saltwater game fish and is generally listed as one of the top patterns to have in any fly box. John Gierach, a noted fly fishing writer discussed the Woolly Bugger first in his chapter on streamers in Good Flies. Woolly Buggers are typically fished in streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and tidal flats. Today, Woolly Buggers are tied in a wide variety of styles and colors to imitate a wide range of game fish prey.  Origin  Although the original Woolly Bugger pattern was believed to have been created by Pennsylvania fly tyer Russell Blessing as early as 1967 to resemble a hellgrammite, or dobsonfly nymph, its precise origin is unknown, but is clearly an evolution of the Woolly Worm fly, which itself is a variation‚Äîintentional or not‚Äîof the British palmer fly, which dates back to Walton and beyond.  Imitates  left The Woolly Bugger, depending the specific material used and how it is fished can be assumed to resemble large nymphs, baitfish, leech, drowning terrestrial insects, clamworms, crayfish, shrimp or crabs.  Materials  The Woolly Bugger fly is constructed with a marabou tail (with or without some sort of flashy material in the tail), a chenille or fur body, and a hackle palmered from the tail to the head of the fly. Tying the pattern with a rib of fine copper wire helps protect the palmer hackle. The underbody may be weighted with lead or tungsten wire. Popular colors are olive, brown, and black for freshwater use. Brighter colors and combinations of colors are especially popular for steelhead, salmon and saltwater use.  Variations and sizes  Woolly Bugger flies are typically tied on number 2 to 14 long or extra long hooks. Variations include Woolly Buggers weighted with brass or tungsten beads, brass or tungsten cones, brass, lead or tungsten dumbbell eyes.

The leaves are oval to oblong, long and broad, glossy green, hairless, with a pale midrib and a short petiole long; they are arranged in opposite pairs. The flowers are white to dark pink with a darker red centre, with a basal tube long and a corolla diameter with five petal-like lobes. The fruit is a pair of follicles long and broad.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan .Flora of China: Catharanthus roseusCollege of Micronesia: Catharanthus roseusJepson Flora: Catharanthus roseus Ecology In the wild, C. roseus is an endangered plant; the main cause of decline is habitat destruction by slash and burn agriculture.DrugDigest: Catharanthus roseus It is also, however, widely cultivated and is naturalised in subtropical and tropical areas of the world like Australia, Malaysia, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. It is so well adapted to growth in Australia, that it is listed as a noxious weed in Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory, and also in parts of eastern Queensland. Pale Pink with Red Centre Cultivar Cultivation As an ornamental plant, it is appreciated for its hardiness in dry and nutritionally deficient conditions, popular in subtropical gardens where temperatures never fall below , and as a warm-season bedding plant in temperate gardens. It is noted for its long flowering period, throughout the year in tropical conditions, and from spring to late autumn, in warm temperate climates. Full sun and well-drained soil are preferred. Numerous cultivars have been selected, for variation in flower colour (white, mauve, peach, scarlet and reddish-orange), and also for tolerance of cooler growing conditions in temperate regions. Notable cultivars include 'Albus' (white flowers), 'Grape Cooler' (rose-pink; cool-tolerant), the Ocellatus Group (various colours), and 'Peppermint Cooler' (white with a red centre; cool-tolerant). In the USA it often remains identified as \\"Vinca\\" although botanists have shifted its identification and it often can be seen growing along roadsides in the south. In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).  Uses  The species has long been cultivated for herbal medicine. In Ayurveda (Indian traditional medicine) the extracts of its roots and shoots, though poisonous, are used against several diseases. In traditional Chinese medicine, extracts from it have been used against numerous diseases, including diabetes, malaria, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Many of the vinca alkaloids were first isolated from Catharanthus roseus, including vinblastine and vincristine used in the treatment of leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma. A periwinkle shrub Coming in different colours This conflict between historical indigenous use, and recent patents on C.roseus-derived drugs by western pharmaceutical companies, without compensation, has led to accusations of biopiracy. C. roseus can be extremely toxic if consumed orally by humans, and is cited (under its synonym Vinca rosea) in the Louisiana State Act 159. C. roseus is used in plant pathology as an experimental host for phytoplasmas. This is because it is easy to infect with a large majority of phytoplasmas, and also often has very distinctive symptoms such as phyllody and significantly reduced leaf size.  Phytochemistry  Vinblastine and vincristine , chemotherapy medications used to treat several types of cancers, are found in the plant and are biosynthesised from the coupling of the alkaloids catharanthine and vindoline. The newer semi-synthetic chemotherapeutic agent vinorelbine, used in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, can be prepared either from vindoline and catharanthine or from the vinca alkaloid leurosine, in both cases via anhydrovinblastine. The insulin-stimulating vincoline has been isolated from the plant. Rosinidin is the pink anthocyanidin pigment found in the flowers of C. roseus. Lochnericine is a major alkaloid in roots.

Shows run nightly from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Weekend shows run during the months of May and September. Shows begin at dusk and run 25 to 30 minutes. The fountain was the brainchild of Dr. William ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Creason, a longtime resident, dentist, and former mayor of Grand Haven. He was a timeless visionary who saw the potential in the beautification of the Grand Haven waterfront. The fountain was modeled after a Przystawic musical fountain show which Bill saw in Germany while providing dentistry for the US Navy after World War II. Many themes are used in the fountain's performances. The fountain's narration takes on personas ranging from a 12-year-old girl to a grown man. A Patriotic themed program runs each July 4 along with fireworks and, in August, a program saluting the United States Coast Guard runs yearly during the Coast Guard Festival; in 2011 a special introduction and closing song were introduced honoring the men and women of the United States Coast Guard. The special introduction and closing featured music performed by the USCG Band. Fountain viewing, not including July 4 or the festival, is estimated at around 10,000 annually. How it works Designed by a local engineer, William Morris Booth II (who is also the patent holder), and built in 1962 by volunteers (at an estimated cost of $250,000), it was the largest musical fountain in the world at that time. The display comprises a small number of water formations grouped in odd and even segments, with the same formations on each. Augmented by curtains of water at the back and front, a large fanlike array called the Peacock, and three fire hose nozzles - one placed vertically in the center, and the others aimed at an angle from each end - the show produces a simple Dancing Waters style display. Colored lights are arrayed along the front of the fountain in individually controllable groups in red, blue, amber and white, and the back curtain and Peacock sprays have their own lights - green and yellow for the back curtain, and two sets each red, blue and amber for the Peacock. In addition, nozzles called \\"sweeps\\" provide the moving effects, swaying side-to-side. A patented drive mechanism allows each pair of sweeps to follow or oppose each other in direction of movement, to move along long or short paths, and to move at any of three speeds, allowing the moving water to follow nearly any kind of music. The original show used punched paper cards, though computers control the new system. The nozzles and pumps have never been changed, only cleaned and cared- for; and shows must still be programmed by hand. In 1983 the fountain switched from punch tape to an Allen-Bradly PLC allowing for better control over the valves and lighting. The new control system also introduced using a Radio Shack TRS 80 Model 4 to program shows. Programmers were required to type special commands into a text editor, compile the show script, and then record it out through a 300 baud modem to a four track real-to-real tape unit. The maximum number of command that could be sent to the fountain we 12 per a second. This process took on average took over 200 hours to produce a single 20 minute performance. In September 2006, a new PC based programming and playback system was introduced. The Grand Haven Musical Fountain Animated Choreographer was released to the public to encourage the development of new shows and allowed programmers to visually choreograph the fountain. In addition, the new playback system allowed for more complex water and lighting effects by eliminating the need for tape playback by directly controlling the Allen-Bradly PLC. New shows now typically feature over 5000 water and lighting commands in a 20 min. performance. In 2017 the software was updated to take advantage on the new lighting and water effects, and is freely downloadable.

In anticipation of the defeat of Nazi Germany and its allies this commission was to study the postwar political problems in Europe and make recommendation to the three governments, including the surrender of the European enemy states and the machinery of its fulfillment. After the EAC completed its task it was dissolved at the Potsdam Conference in August 1945. 1944 The EAC had its seat in London at Lancaster House and started its work on 14 January 1944. William Strang was the British delegate, while on the American and Soviet sides the respective ambassadors were the delegates, John G. Winant and Fedor Tarasovich Gusev. The American military advisor was Cornelius Wendell Wickersham. George F. Kennan was a member of the American delegation in 1944. At the Tehran Conference it was decided to hand over a large portion of German territory to Poland with the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line as the eastern border of post- war Germany, and discussion about a possible partition of Germany were initiated by Roosevelt. Based on these premises, the EAC worked out the following recommendations during 1944: * Partition of Germany into three occupied zones, each controlled by one power. * Creation of the Allied Control Council (ACC) * The ACC could only act in consensus. * Partition of Berlin in three sectors. * Separation of Austria which would also undergo a tripartite occupation, and Vienna to be occupied by three powers. * Establishment of an Allied Commission for Austria. * Draft instructions for the \\"unconditional surrender of Germany\\" * Proposals for control machinery for administration. * Establishment of an Allied Commission for Italy. 1945 The work of the EAC was discussed at the Yalta Conference in 1945 where a major modification was approved as France received a seat on the ACC, and a future occupation zone in Germany was carved out from territory assigned to Great Britain and the United States. In addition, France received a future occupation zone in western Austria. On 5 June 1945 the European Advisory Commission assumed briefly full control over Germany. Members included General Dwight Eisenhower for the US, Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery for Britain, and Marshal Georgy Zhukov for the Soviet Union. The commission delimited German territory to its territory of 31 December 1937 minus territory handed over to Poland and the Soviet Union, divided Germany into four zones of occupation under American, British, French, and Soviet military administration and separately divided Berlin into four sectors. The Commission ceased to exist after the Potsdam Conference, and the ACC was nominally the highest power in Germany, while in reality, each occupied zone was ruled by the respective occupying power Aftermath The recommendations of the EAC shaped the development of postwar Europe. While it was by no means obvious at the Potsdam Conference that Germany would be partitioned into two states, the recommendations of the EAC allowed each occupying power full control over its occupied zone and deprived the ACC of an overruling influence. The subsequent Cold War thus was reflected in the partition of Germany as each occupying force could develop its zone on its own. The EAC failed to be specific about length and terms of occupation and different zones underwent different occupation experiences. The Soviet- occupied zone suffered disproportionally from war reparations while the Western Zone benefited from stimulatory economic impacts such as the Marshall Plan. Legally, the EAC ceased to function following the establishment of the Council of Foreign Ministers at the Potsdam Conference.

History The party was founded in April 1977 in Gallarta (Biscay) after the 7th general assembly of ETA, during the Spanish transition to democracy. Its ideology was based on a blend of \\"independentism\\" and socialism - originally, they tended to be rather Marxism-Leninism, but subsequently moved towards Eurocommunism. EIA made a coalition with the Basque section of the Communist Movement of Spain (Movimiento Comunista de Espa√±a), creating a coalition named Euskadiko Ezkerra. They won a seat in the Spanish Congress of Deputies, occupied by Francisco Letamendia (also known as \\"Ortzi\\") and another in the Senate, occupied by Juan Mar√≠a Bandr√©s. It campaigned for the \\"no\\" in the 1978 referendum to approve the Spanish constitution, but in favour of the Basque Statute of Autonomy in the referendum held in 1979. EIA disappeared in 1982, when Euskadiko Ezkerra became a political party. References * Gaizka Fern√°ndez Soldevilla, Agur a las armas.

This confirmation is often, but not always, provided by some form of external review, education, assessment, or audit. Accreditation is a specific organization's process of certification. According to the U.S. National Council on Measurement in Education, a certification test is a credentialing test used to determine whether individuals are knowledgeable enough in a given occupational area to be labeled \\"competent to practice\\" in that area.  Types  One of the most common types of certification in modern society is professional certification, where a person is certified as being able to competently complete a job or task, usually by the passing of an examination and/or the completion of a program of study. Some professional certifications also require that one obtain work experience in a related field before the certification can be awarded. Some professional certifications are valid for a lifetime upon completing all certification requirements. Others expire after a certain period of time and have to be maintained with further education and/or testing. Certifications can differ within a profession by the level or specific area of expertise to which they refer. For example, in the IT Industry there are different certifications available for software tester, project manager, and developer. Also, the Joint Commission on Allied Health Personnel in Ophthalmology offers three certifications in the same profession, but with increasing complexity. Certification does not designate that a person has sufficient knowledge in a subject area, only that they passed the test. Certification does not refer to the state of legally being able to practice or work in a profession. That is licensure. Usually, licensure is administered by a governmental entity for public protection purposes and a professional association administers certification. Licensure and certification are similar in that they both require the demonstration of a certain level of knowledge or ability. Another common type of certification in modern society is product certification. This refers to processes intended to determine if a product meets minimum standards, similar to quality assurance. Different certification systems exist in each country. For example, in Russia it is the GOST R Rostest. Other types include: * Academic degrees * Cyber security certification * Digital signatures in public-key cryptography * Digital certification * Diving certification * Environmental certification * Film certification, also known as the motion picture rating systemhttp://www.mpaa.org/ * Music recording sales certification, such as \\"Gold\\" or \\"Platinum\\" * Nursing credentials and certifications * Professional certification (computer technology) * A type certificate is issued to signify the airworthiness of an aircraft manufacturing design  Third-party certification  In first-party certification, an individual or organization providing the good or service offers assurance that it meets certain claims. In second-party certification, an association to which the individual or organization belongs provides the assurance.Dovetail Partners Third-party certification involves an independent assessment declaring that specified requirements pertaining to a product, person, process, or management system have been met. In this respect, a Notified Body is a third-party, accredited body which is entitled by an accreditation body. Upon definition of standards and regulations, the accreditation body may allow a Notified body to provide third-party certification and testing services. All that ensures and assesses compliance to the previously-defined codes but also to provide an official certification mark or a declaration of conformity.  In software testing  For software testing, the certifications can be grouped into exam-based and education-based. For exam-based certifications the candidate must pass an exam, which can also be learned by self-study. For example, for International Software Testing Qualifications Board Certified Tester by the International Software Testing Qualifications Board or Certified Software Tester by QAI or Certified Software Quality Engineer by American Society for Quality. Education-based certifications are the instructor-led sessions, where each course has to be passed. The Certified Software Test Professional and the Certified Software Test Professional by International Institute for Software Testing are such examples. It is common for people who require certifications to undergo paid structured learning to help them achieve their goals.

The most widely used barks are derived from the trees Trichilia catigua and Erythroxylum vaccinifolium. Other catuaba preparations use the bark of trees from the following genera or families: Anemopaegma, Ilex, Micropholis, Phyllanthus, Secondatia, Tetragastris and species from the Myrtaceae. It is often claimed that catuaba is derived from the tree Erythroxylum catuaba, but this tree has been described only once, in 1904, and it is not known today to what tree this name referred. E. catuaba is therefore not a recognised species (Kletter et al.; 2004). Local synonyms are Chuchuhuasha, Tatuaba, Pau de Reposta, Piratancara and Caramuru. A commercial liquid preparation, Catuama, contains multiple ingredients, one of these being catuaba from Trichilia catigua. An infusion of the bark is used in traditional Brazilian medicine as an aphrodisiac and central nervous system stimulant. These claims have not been confirmed in scientific studies. In catuaba is found a group of three alkaloids dubbed catuabine A, B and C. A study by Manabe et al. (1992) showed that catuaba extracts from Catuaba casca (Erythroxylum catuaba Arr. Cam.) were useful in preventing potentially lethal bacterial infections and HIV infection in mice.

He was president of Williams College and supervised the United States Fuel Administration during World War I. He was the son of President James A. Garfield. Biography Garfield was the son of President James A. Garfield and First Lady Lucretia Garfield, and the brother and law partner of Secretary of the Interior James Rudolph Garfield. At the age of 17 he and his 15-year-old brother James watched in horror as their father was shot down by assassin Charles Guiteau. Harry A. Garfield (third from the left) and siblings. Former residence of Harry Augustus Garfield After graduating from Williams College in 1885, he went on to study law at Columbia Law School, spending his second year reading law at All Soul's College in Oxford and the Inns Court in London. He taught Roman history and Latin for a year in St. Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire, and from 1888 to 1903 practiced law in Cleveland. He was professor of contracts in the law school of Western Reserve University from 1891 to 1897, and in 1896 helped to organize the municipal association of Cleveland, where he also served as president of the Chamber of Commerce from 1908 to 1909. He was professor of politics at Princeton University from 1903 to 1908. While at Princeton, he befriended future president Woodrow Wilson. In 1908, Garfield became a law professor and eighth president of his alma mater, Williams College in Massachusetts. He was president of the American Political Science Association from 1921 to 1922. He was a hereditary companion of the Ohio Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States by right of his father's service as a major general in Union Army during the American Civil War. Fuel Administrator In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson asked him to run the nation's United States Fuel Administration during World War I. Garfield's duty was to conserve the coal supply and keep the price within reasonable bounds. Local committees were appointed throughout the country to study local conditions and their reports formed the basis for the prices fixed in different localities. The ensuing winter was unusually severe, and serious shortage of coal threatened. Because of the shortage of coal in the northeastern United States, especially in New York City and Ohio, Garfield's administration of the office was severely criticized in the press, but an investigation by the United States Congress showed that the shortage was due to failure of the railroads to meet the extra demands upon them, and federal control of the roads was instituted on December 28, 1917. Garfield also issued his \\"idle Mondays\\" order in January 1918, which closed non- essential industries for five consecutive days beginning January 18 and on every Monday thereafter up to March 25. This roused a storm of protest from many manufacturers, and the U.S. Senate voted a resolution, requesting postponement, but this reached him after the order had been signed. On February 14, however, the order was suspended and priority for certain shipments substituted. He disapproved of the method of settling the coal strike in December 1919 and resigned his office, resuming that of president of Williams College. For his service as Fuel Administrator, Garfield was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the War Department. Williams College Garfield served as President of Williams College until his retirement in 1934. Family Garfield married his second cousin, Belle Hartford Mason, and had four children with her. He is buried in the faculty cemetery at Williams College. Works *America's coal problem in 1918. Washington, Govt. Print.

The show was hosted by Mark Goodman, with Linda Kollmeyer as his co-host and Bill Barber as announcer. The show was produced by Mark Goodson Productions (later Jonathan Goodson Productions), and premiered on July 9, 1994. The show was renamed Illinois' Luckiest in 1998 and aired until 2000. For contestants to appear on the show, they had to purchase an Illinois Instant Riches/Illinois' Luckiest scratch-off ticket from an Illinois Lottery retailer. Common for the lottery game shows of the 90s, if they uncovered three television set symbols on the ticket, the ticket was sent into a submission address, or redeemed physically at the nearest lottery office. Players were randomly chosen from those tickets to be in the show's contestant pool, but only a certain number of them would be selected to play an on-stage game. Several of the games on this show were transported to and from some other lottery game shows, most notably Flamingo Fortune (Florida), Bonus Bonanza (Massachusetts), and NY Wired (New York); the differences are mentioned in this article. Elements from these games also carried over to the quarterly-based Michigan Lottery game show Make Me Rich. Rules (Illinois Instant Riches) Fifteen contestants were in the contestant pool. Kollmeyer would spin a wheel that was hooked to lights above each contestant's seat. When the wheel stopped, the player whose seat was lit would play a game, in addition to winning a set of lottery tickets. During a special remote broadcast from Arlington Race Course in 1997, the selection and bonus rounds were modified. Random numbers were drawn to choose contestants, pulled from the same kind of machine used for their lottery drawings. Also, the original bonus game, Knockout, was played in place of the current (at the time) game, Pot O'Gold, and modified its format to account for the returning champion. Flamingo Fortune and Bonus Bonanza used the same wheel procedures, but with different ways to show whom the wheel picked, and with a different number of players. Flamingo Fortune used 30 players, in three groups of 10, and a TV screen that showed the person's name and face. Bonus Bonanza used 27 players, in three groups of 9, and used a spotlight that the wheel was hooked to. =Mini-games= Force Field A magnet was suspended from the ceiling above a table of 10 magnets arranged in a circle. The magnets had corresponding money amounts: $1,000-$5,000, $8,000, $10,000, $12,000, $15,000, and $20,000. The pendulum was placed on a launcher locked on the outer ring of the table, and could be moved to any position along the ring. Contestants released the pendulum, and it would swing, then become attracted to one of the magnets‚Äîthe player won the amount of money associated with the magnet. That space was then replaced with a \\"Wipe Out\\". The contestant then re-launched the pendulum‚Äîideally, winning more money in the process. If the pendulum landed on \\"Wipe Out\\", the contestant lost all of the money accumulated in the first swing. At this point, another \\"Wipe Out\\" was placed over the amount from swing #2 (or, if the contestant did \\"Wipe Out\\", it was simply left alone) and another was placed on the lowest dollar amount still left on the table, bringing the maximum total number of \\"Wipe Out\\" spaces to three. The largest dollar amount on the table was multiplied by 5. The contestant could either choose to risk their money on one final swing or stop with what they had; hitting a \\"Wipe Out\\" would cause them to go bankrupt, but hitting a money space added the money total to their total. The maximum payoff was $127,000. Home Run (a.k.a. Touchdown, Fast Break, and Home Stretch) Contestants were shown a board with 3 \\"players\\": an orange player, a blue player, and a yellow player. They were then shown a board of 12 numbered boxes, and asked to call out numbers, one at a time. Finding three of a color ended the game and awarded the contestant a cash prize ‚Äî $1,000 (for the orange player), $10,000 (for the blue player), or a cash prize of up to $100,000 (for the yellow player). Before the game, the contestant would choose from one of four cards, each of which hid a different cash amount (one each of $25,000, $50,000, $75,000, and $100,000), to determine the jackpot value for the yellow player. If the yellow player finished first, the contestant won the jackpot value. The game motif had a baseball theme, which was changed to a football theme for football season, basketball for basketball season, and a horse race theme for a special at a local race track. Host Goodman often made jokes about the players going on strike when the game changed themes. On a 1994 episode that marked the first time the game was played as Touchdown, he said, \\"We used to have baseball players. They went on strike; we got rid of them! Boom! They're gone!\\" For the first few episodes on which it was played, the orange player was worth only $1. It quickly became $1,000. Flamingo Fortune renamed this game Grand Prix after the Daytona Grand Prix in NASCAR. There was a red, yellow, and blue car used. The red car earned the contestant $5,000 if it won the race. The yellow car earned the contestant $25,000 if it won the race. If the blue car, labeled \\"Grand Prize\\", won the race, the contestant would choose from one of four cards (A, B, C, or D). Two cards hid $50,000; the other two hid $100,000. NY Wired renamed it Saratoga after Saratoga Springs, home to a famous horse track, using red, yellow, and blue horses, much like the Home Stretch variant on IIR. The red horse won $10,000, yellow, $20,000 and blue (labeled \\"Big Purse\\"), either $40,000 or the growing jackpot. Like IIR, the contestant chose from a series of cards to determine the value for the blue horse, but unlike IIR, it took four on a match to determine the winning value. Mismatch This game had the contestant stand behind a pair of containers that he/she couldn't see the contents of. Each container had three colored balls: red, yellow, and green. The contestant would draw one ball from the container on their right to establish a \\"base\\" color. The player was then spotted $5,000 and asked to draw a ball from the other container. Pulling out a different color would earn the contestant another $5,000, while failing added nothing. After three pulls, the contestant was offered the choice to stop or try for one last pull. A second ball of the base color would then be added to the mix. A mismatch would triple the money, while a match cost the contestant half of their earnings. The maximum payoff was $60,000. This game was known as Danger Ball on Bonus Bonanza in Massachusetts. The rules and payout were the same as in Illinois, only contestants did not have to pull a ball from the container to establish a \\"base\\" color; instead, they told host Brian Tracey and co-host Dawn Hayes which color was to be the Danger Ball. Vortex Contestants were shown 7 balls, arranged in a line‚Äîfive yellow and two red. They were positioned at the top of a funnel-like table, designed so that when the balls reached the bottom, they would form a daisy-like pattern with one ball surrounded by the other six. The object was to have a yellow ball in the middle. The contestant was given a cash prize (originally $3,000, later $4,000) and asked to release the balls by pulling a lever that sent the balls down the funnel and into the center circle at the bottom. If a yellow ball was in the middle, their winnings were doubled. For the second pull, a yellow ball was swapped for a red one, but the contestant's winnings tripled if the center ball came up yellow. For each of these first two pulls, contestants did not lose any money if the center ball came up red. A contestant could stop after two pulls, or opt for a third pull, where there were 4 red balls and 3 yellow balls. If the contestant chose to continue, their cash total quadrupled if a yellow ball was in the middle, but lost half of their winnings if a red ball was in the middle. The maximum payoff was $72,000 (later $96,000). This game was first used for Bonus Bonanza in Massachusetts. It used the same rules and payouts as in Illinois. The $72,000 jackpot was won at least twice on both IIR and Bonanza. Knockout This game utilized a round table, divided into 12 sections. Four cylinders were placed on the table, and a cube was placed in the middle. When turned on, the cube would vibrate and move around the table in a random manner‚Äîpotentially knocking down the cylinders. The contestant was spotted $3,000 and in the first round, the cube was activated for 10 seconds. Any cylinder still standing after that earned the contestant an additional $1,500/cylinder. The cube was then activated for another 15 seconds, and any cylinders still remaining after that were worth an addition $2,500. After two rounds, any remaining cylinders were removed and one cylinder was placed on the table. The contestant could opt to take his/her winnings or have the cube activated for another 20 seconds. If the final cylinder was still standing after that, their winnings quadrupled. If it was knocked over, the contestant lost half of their winnings. The maximum payoff was $76,000. Wrecking Ball Twelve buildings were placed on a rotating platform. A \\"crane\\" with the wrecking ball was nearby. The contestant would turn his/her back to the platform and pull a lever to release the wrecking ball. The ball would swing through the platform six times, knocking over the buildings. Each building remaining after Round 1 was worth $1,500, and each building remaining after Round 2 was worth an additional $3,000. The contestant could stop at this point or opt for one more round of six swings. Three buildings were placed on the platform, or if there were more than 3 still standing after Round 2, they were simply left alone. If at least three buildings were left standing after this round, the contestant's winnings were doubled. Otherwise, the contestant lost half of his/her winnings. The maximum payoff was $108,000. This game was first used as Beach Ball on Flamingo Fortune. The only difference being that it used sandcastles, plus, the double-or-nothing parts required only two standing instead of three. The prizes were reduced: $1,000 for each castle standing in Round 1, $2,000 in Round 2. Unlike IIR, Flamingo Fortune contestants who survived the third round of six swings were offered another chance to double their money; the catch was that the ball now had to swing eight times. The amount needed to stay standing was still two. Double Dollars This was the only game that was played on every episode of Illinois Instant Riches from the beginning of the run up to the format/name change in 1998 (although it returned in 2000). The contestant would pull a lever that launched a ping pong ball to the top of the board, through swinging paddles, through a series of pegs, and into one of eight slots at the bottom of the board. Landing in an empty slot was worth $5,000. Each empty slot added another $5,000. If a ping pong ball landed in a slot that was already occupied, the contestant would be issued a strike. After two strikes, the contestant could stop and take his/her winnings, or opt for another pull. If a ping pong ball landed in an empty slot, the contestant would have his/her money doubled, and would be offered another pull. If the contestant earned their third strike, they would lose half of their winnings. Play would continue until all eight slots were filled, a third strike was issued, or the contestant chose to stop. The theoretical maximum payoff was $640,000, but this would require three of a contestant's first four balls landing in the same slots, followed by each following ball landing in a new slot. Bonus Bonanza and Flamingo Fortune both renamed this game Freefall (not to be confused with the game \\"Freefall\\" mentioned below when IIR became Luckiest). This was because there was no pegs in between the swinging paddles and the bottom set of pegs above the slots. Thus, the ping pong ball took a freefall towards the slots. The payout was the same. =Bonus Games= The show had three bonus games throughout the run, which involved the three contestants chosen to play the mini-games during the show. Knockout The contestants were positioned around a table divided into 12 wedges. The three contestants would draw numbers from 1 to 12, and have a cylinder placed on that numbered wedge. A toy cube was placed in the center of the table, and turned on for 30 seconds. When it was activated, the cube would shake and bounce around the table in a random manner, potentially knocking over the cylinders in the process. If a cylinder was still standing after 30 seconds, the contestant won anywhere from $7,500 to $100,000. In 1997, the show traveled to Arlington Race Course. Because for obvious reasons, the Pot O' Gold set couldn't come along, a special version of Knockout was played: the returning champion chose a spot on the arena, and the challenger got the spot directly 180 degrees from it. The bouncing cube was released, and whoever had the cylinder still standing once one knocked out was the winner. If it was the champion, he won another $20,000. If it was the challenger, he got the cash bonus hiding underneath the spot on the arena, up to $100,000. This game was later carried over to Bonus Bonanza in Massachusetts as the permanent bonus game, with values from $7,500 to $200,000. Thunderball Similar to the children's game KerPlunk, a large container was placed center stage containing 15 balls (roughly the size of basketballs). They were suspended in the top of the chamber by 10 numbered rods. One at a time, each player drew a number from a board, and the corresponding rod was removed from the container. Depending on their position inside the container, some of the balls could fall to the bottom‚Äîcontestants were eliminated if they lost five balls or dropped the last ball out of the top of the container. The remaining contestant would select one of the numbers he/she had, which contained amounts ranging from $10,000 to $100,000. Pot O' Gold The \\"Pot O' Gold\\" game debuted in 1995 and utilized returning champions from previous weeks. The champion would stand at the end of a path behind a secret keypad with three small buttons and a big red button. The opponent (the biggest money winner from the current show) stood at the front of the path, with eight spaces between the two. The first five steps were numbered 1 to 5, and the last three had cash. The opponent could take up to three steps at a time, but the champion was charged with predicting which step the opponent would pick, known as placing a booby-trap. After the opponent took his/her position, Goodman would ask the champion to spring the trap (press the red button). If the opponent dodged the trap, the game would continue. If not, the opponent had to return to their original position. Each step had a yellow light that would turn to a flashing orange whenever the booby-trap was sprung, in case the player hit the trap. If the player avoided the trap, the yellow light flashed, and the orange light would light up where the booby-trap was placed. Opponents won and took over the championship if they landed on one of the last three spaces on the path‚Äìthe first was worth $10,000, the second was worth $25,000, and the last was marked \\"Big Money\\". If the opponent ended on this space, he/she could pick from a tray of five coins worth anywhere from $40,000 to $200,000 in $40,000 increments. If the champion successfully trapped the challenger twice, the game ended with the champion winning an additional $20,000. There was a six- show limit, only achieved once (although one champion won his 7th week during the show's 1997 trip to Arlington Race Course). For the following telecast the next week (in addition to the first time \\"Pot O' Gold\\" was ever played), the top two money winners competed. The top winner assumed the champion's while the runner-up assumed the challenger's role. Flamingo Fortune renamed this game Treasure Island. The rules were the same, except that the \\"BIG MONEY\\" step was replaced by a picture of a treasure chest, and the top prize was increased to $500,000 while the bottom prize from the chest of coins was upped to $50,000. This is because there were ten coins to choose from if the challenger won. The $500,000 was won at least once. Blue lights were used to indicate the player's choice, and the booby-trapped step lit up in red instead of orange. If the champion successfully trapped the newcomer twice, the prize was $25,000 instead of $20,000. Rules (Illinois' Luckiest) On August 22, 1998 the show underwent a revamp in terms of set, name, and gameplay in addition to Tony Russell replacing Bill Barber as announcer. Eighteen contestants were selected to play three games. Before each round, six contestants chose an envelope with an answer to a polling question asked to people all across Illinois (Ex.: What is the best food invented in the past 1,000 years?). The three people holding the Top 3 answers would continue to play the game. On January 29, 2000 the show had yet another rule change. This time, there were 25 people instead of 18 (although on the episode Kollmeyer mentioned there were still 18 contestants), and they divided amongst themselves into five teams of 5 each. Each team stood in one of the pinball slots from 1 to 5, and whoever's slot was picked would play the next game. Lots were drawn before each game to determine the captain for each game, and it was possible for the same team to play all three mini-games. Teams were not allowed to pick the same step. =Mini-games= Knockout Played during the first format, this game underwent a rule change to accommodate the new format. Contestants bid on how long the bouncing cube could bounce around a circular table without knocking down one of two cylinders on the table. If the cube didn't knock a cylinder down, the high bidder(s) won money: $2,000 in Round 1, $3,000 in Round 2, and $5,000 in Round 3. If a cylinder was knocked down, everyone but the bidder won the money. A $10,000 bonus was awarded to the player with the most money after Round 3, and was split if a tie occurred. The maximum payoff was $20,000. Freefall Played during the first format, this was revamped version of \\"Double Dollars\\". To start, Goodman would launch a ball up a machine similar to the Double Dollars game board from IIR and each of the names of the three contestants were in a bag (or the numbers 1, 2, and 3 were printed on balls and placed into a fish tank with water). One player was chosen by Kollmeyer at random. That person would launch a ball up the machine. If the ball landed in one of the seven unoccupied slots, that person won $2,000. Kollmeyer would then go back in the bag and pull out one of the three names. This time, if the ball landed in one of the six unoccupied slots, the player won $4,000. Every successive time a ball landed in an open slot was worth $2,000 more than the previous. If a ball landed in an occupied slot, that contestant was eliminated and all the money he or she accumulated was cut in half (if the player won nothing, they won $500). Also, one could freeze at any time before they chose to launch the ping pong ball. The player with the most money after everyone was eliminated or had frozen won a $10,000 bonus, which again was split if a tie occurred. The maximum payoff was $66,000. The strike sound effect and graphic from \\"Double Dollars\\" carried over to \\"Freefall.\\" Force Field Played during the first format, everyone began with $3,000 and wagered their money hoping a pendulum would land on a WIN space. The game was played on a round board with a pendulum in the middle and 10 magnets arranged in a circle on the table. For Round 1, six areas were marked WIN and four were marked LOSE, and contestants could wager up to half their money. If a WIN space was hit, the contestants won the amount of money wagered (and lost the amount if a LOSE space was hit). For Round 2, four areas were marked WIN (one was regular, one was WIN √ó 2 (double the wager), one was WIN √ó 3 (triple the wager), and one was WIN √ó 4 (quadruple the wager)) and there were six LOSE spaces. The contestants could wager as much as they wanted in this final round. Again, a $10,000 bonus was awarded to the player with the most money, and was split in case of a tie. The maximum payoff was $32,500. Kollmeyer took charge of this game entirely by herself, similar to what Goodman would ultimately do with the return of \\"Double Dollars.\\" Splashdown Introduced on the 25th Anniversary Special and officially added on January 29, 2000, this game had the players face a board of 18 numbered rods, split into three rows (numbered 1 to 4 on top, 5 to 10 in the middle, and 11 to 18 on the bottom), each holding up a colored ball. Rods 1 through 4 held up two reds and a green, the rest held yellow balls. The captain of the team would draws a number, and that rod was removed from the playfield. If a yellow ball splashed down into the water, the team won $5,000. If no balls splashed down, the team won $500. The only way the game ended (besides the captain saying \\"I'll stop\\") was if a red or green ball splashed down. If a red ball splashed down, either by itself or with other colored balls (including the green one), the team would lose half their winnings. If the green ball splashed down without either red ball, the team's total was bumped to $50,000 on the Special, or $75,000 on the series proper (The maximum payment was $50,000 or $75,000). This game was first introduced after the cancellation of the Florida lottery game show Flamingo Fortune, which first carried it. The rules were the same, except the money payout was given to one individual person, and was $1,000 for no ball splashing down, $10,000 for a yellow ball splashing down, and $100,000 for the green ball splashing down with no red ball. A red ball splashing down, even with the green one, still cost players half their money. Splashdown was renamed Niagara for NY Wired after Niagara Falls. The value was $1,000 (later $500) for no ball splashing down, $6,000 (later $2,500) for a yellow ball splashing down, and the progressive jackpot for the green ball. Red still took away half the player's money. Vortex IL2 Introduced on January 29, 2000. Same rules as IIR, except the money was split by the team. The team captain was assigned to pull the lever that released the balls. The Money Machine IL2 Introduced on the 25th Anniversary Special. The team captain, placed in a money machine with money blown all over the place by jets (similar to the 2002 version of Beat the Clock) had 45 seconds to grab as much lottery money as possible. The lottery money had one $1,000 bill within a ton of $50 and $100 bills. The captain could grab money flying through the air and stuff it into his/her apron, but could not pick up money off the floor. After 45 seconds, the jets were turned off, and the auditors separated the money grabbed from the money left on the floor into two boxes appropriately labeled \\"Money Grabbed\\" and \\"Money Left on the Floor.\\" The team then had to guess where the $1,000 bill was. If correct, their winnings were bumped up to $50,000. If not, they only won the money grabbed. The money was split by the team members. When the game debuted on Illinois' Luckiest the rules were different. After the captain was done in the machine, the team had to make a decision. They could keep the money grabbed or gamble it for $75,000 if they believed the captain grabbed the $1,000 bill. If they gambled and the bill was grabbed, they won the top prize. However, if they gambled and the bill wasn't grabbed, the winnings were reduced to $10,000. Double Dollars IL2 Introduced on January 29, 2000. Same rules as IIR, except the money was split by the team. The team captain, instead of pulling a lever, had to press a button on a signaling device modeled after the devices used on shows such as Jeopardy!. The button was also used for the \\"Double Dollars\\" spin-off game, \\"Freefall,\\" described above. =Bonus Games= $100,000 Pinball IL1 All 18 players competed in this game. Each contestant would step behind a slot that corresponded with a hole that a computerized pinball could land in. In Round 1, there are three slots. The contestants who chose the correct slot each won $1,000 and advanced to next round. The rest were eliminated. Round 2 had four slots; surviving this round awarded another $1,000 and a chance at the $100,000 in Round 3. Round 3 had five slots. Everyone who survived all three rounds divided $100,000. The pinball machine moved to the start of the game midway through the run, used to determine the contestants to play a mini-game. Pot O' Gold IL2 In the Luckiest run, Pot O' Gold was slightly reformatted, since the show no longer had returning champions. The top winner of the show was the defender, and the other players all moved up the road as a team sharing the cash prizes ($10,000, $25,000, or \\"Big Money\\"), depending on how money people avoided the booby-traps. Also, there were only four steps before the $10,000 prize, and the lowest \\"Big Money\\" coin was lowered to $30,000. The defender would trap two spaces before the other players moved a maximum of three spaces. Each space had a \\"railroad gate.\\" If the gate went down, players who took the space were eliminated. If the defender won, he/she picked from envelopes labeled A, B, or C, winning one of the cash prizes. If the envelope read \\"BIG MONEY\\" he/she got to pick from the gold coins. If the challengers won (depending on the number left), they split the cash prizes, and if they won the \\"BIG MONEY,\\" they conferred with each other before choosing a gold coin. On the 25th Anniversary Special, this version of the game was played with a guaranteed giveaway of $200,000, so that if the defender won, he/she kept it all to himself/herself, but if the challengers won (depending on how many were left), they got to split it. Notes The show was not only seen in Illinois, but also nationally Saturday nights on Superstation WGN, headquartered in Chicago. As a result, it was WGN's highest-rated Saturday program at the time, airing at 7:30/6:30c in most stations. In spite of cancellation, Kollmeyer still remains with the station doing lottery drawings. She also served as hostess on the previous Illinois lottery show, $100,000 Fortune Hunt. A 25th anniversary special aired in 1999, celebrating 25 years and over $12.5 billion in winnings, and offering up to $350,000 (the whole $350,000 was won on that episode), with a guarantee giveaway of $200,000. With Mark Goodman unavailable (due to the fact he wasn't a native of Illinois, but New York), Kollmeyer took the helm, helped by Jeanne Sparrow and Chicago radio personality Bill Lapp. The games played were Rolling Thunder (which was never played again after this), the Money Machine (which was later incorporated into the regular version of Luckiest), and Splashdown. The main theme song, that was used during the Illinois Instant Riches era, was originally composed in 1989, for an unsold Mark Goodson pilot, that was taped at CBS for ABC with Peter Tomarken, called TKO.http://www.usgameshows.net/x.php?show=TKO&sort;=0 It was also used for another unsold Goodson pilot in 1990, that was also taped at CBS for ABC with Vicki Lawrence, called Body Talk.http://www.usgameshows.net/x.php?show=BodyTalk&sort;=0 It was also used in Bonus Bonanza.

The Games excluded women from competition, but Revithi insisted that she be allowed to run. Revithi ran one day after the men had completed the official race, and although she finished the marathon in approximately 5 hours and 30 minutes and found witnesses to sign their names and verify the running time, she was not allowed to enter the Panathinaiko Stadium at the end of the race. She intended to present her documentation to the Hellenic Olympic Committee in the hopes that they would recognize her achievement, but it is not known whether she did so. No known record survives of Revithi's life after her run. According to contemporary sources, a second woman, \\"Melpomene\\", also ran the 1896 marathon race. There is debate among Olympic historians as to whether or not Revithi and Melpomene are the same person.  Biographical elements  = Before the 1896 Olympics = Coubertin believed \\"that contact with women's athletics is bad for [the male athlete], and that these athletics should be excluded from the Olympic programme\\". Stamata Revithi was born in Syros in 1866. Records of her life from 1896 show that she was living in poverty in Piraeus in 1896. At that point she had given birth to two children, a son who died in 1895, aged seven, and another child who was seventeen months old by the time of the 1896 Olympics. According to Olympic historian Athanasios Tarasouleas, Revithi, who was blonde and thin with large eyes, looked much older than her age.Tarasouleas, The Female Spiridon Loues, 11 Revithi believed that she could gain employment in Athens, and so walked there from her home‚Äîa distance of . Her journey took place several days prior to the Olympic marathon, a special race of invented as part of the athletics program, and based on Michel Br√©al's idea of a race from the city of Marathon to the Pnyx. Br√©al took inspiration from Pheidippides, who, according to legend, ran the distance from Marathon to Athens to announce the Greek victory over Persia at the Battle of Marathon, and died immediately after giving his message.Martin & Gynn, Running through the Ages, 5‚Äì6; Young, A Brief History of the Olympic Games, 166 En route to Athens, Revithi encountered a male runner along the road. He gave her money and advised her to run the marathon to become famous, and, consequently, earn money or more easily find a job.Olympic historians do not all agree on why Revithi decided to run the marathon race. It is thought by some of them that Revithi's goal in this decision was to secure a position for work (DeFrantz, Women in Sport, 185; Eleftheratos, 11 April 1896 [PDF]). Jere Longman (In Footsteps of History) wonders \\"why anyone would want to run 24 miles for a civil service job\\". According to Martin & Gynn (Running through the Ages, 21), \\"the male runner told her (Revithi), apparently in jest, that the best way to get rich was to run the marathon and win\\" (see a similar version of the story by Tarasouleas [The Female Spiridon Loues, 11; Stamata Revithi, \\"Alias Melpomeni\\", 53]). Emet Malone (And at the Starting Line...) believes that, after Revithi was rejected, \\"she ran the course anyway to prove a point\\". After this discussion Revithi decided to run the race: she had enjoyed long- distance running as a child, and believed she could beat the male competitors.Tarasouleas, Stamata Revithi, \\"Alias Melpomeni\\", 53; Tarasouleas, The Female Spiridon Loues, 11 The 1896 Olympic Games were the first held in the Modern era and the most important international multi-sport event Greece had ever hosted.The Greeks believed that substantial advantages for their country might arise from the hosting of the Games (Philimon, Organization of the Games of 1896, 10). The rules of the Games generally excluded women from competition. Influenced by both his times‚Äîin the Victorian era women were considered to be inferior to menDomosh & Seager, Putting Women in Place, 143; Payne, Different but Equal, 21‚Äîand his admiration for the ancient Olympic Games, when only men were allowed to participate in the events, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the visionary of the modern Olympic Games, was not in favour of women's participation in the Olympic Games or in sports generally. He believed that a woman's greatest achievement would be to encourage her sons to be distinguished in sports and to applaud a man's effort.DeFrantz, Women in Sport, 185; Miragaya, The Female Olympian, 313‚Äì314 = 1896 marathon = Revithi arrived at the race location, the small village of Marathon, on Thursday, 9 April , where the athletes had already assembled for the following day's race. She attracted the attention of the reporters and was warmly greeted by Marathon's mayor, who sheltered her in his house.Eleftheratos, 11 April 1896 (PDF) She answered the reporters' questions and was quick-witted when a male runner from Chalandri teased her, predicting that when she entered the Stadium, there would be no crowds left. Revithi retorted that he should not insult women, since male Greek athletes had already been humiliated by the Americans.Tarasouleas, The Female Spiridon Loues, 11. Americans had won golden medals in nine of the twelve athletics events during the previous days. Spiridon Louis entering the Panathinaiko Stadium at the end of the marathon. Only 9 of the 17 male runners finished the marathon, one day before Revithi's race.Philimon, Organization of the Games, 87‚Äì90 Prior to the start of the race on the morning of Friday, 10 April , the old priest of Marathon, Ioannis Veliotis, was scheduled to say a prayer for the athletes in the church of Saint John. Veliotis refused to bless Revithi because she was not an officially recognized athlete. The organizing committee ultimately refused her entry into the race. Officially, she was rejected because the deadline for participation had expired; however, as Olympic historians David Martin and Roger Gynn point out, the real problem was her gender.Greek participants had been chosen through two trial national races, which had taken place on 10 and 24 March . Another athlete, Carlo Airoldi, was also not allowed to run because he was a professional (Martin‚ÄìGynn, Running through the Ages, 12, 21). According to Tarasouleas, the organizers promised that she would compete with a team of American women in another race in Athens, which never took place.Tarasouleas, Stamata Revithi, \\"Alias Melpomeni\\", 54; Tarasouleas, The Female Spiridon Loues, 12 Beginning at 8:00 the following day, Revithi ran the marathon course on her own. Before starting, she had the town's only teacher, the mayor, and the city magistrate sign a statement testifying to the time she departed from the village. She ran the race at a steady pace and reached Parapigmata (the place where the Evangelismos Hospital stands today, near the Hilton Athens) at 13:30 (5¬Ω hours).Martin & Gynn, Running through the Ages, 22; Tarasouleas, Stamata Revithi, \\"Alias Melpomeni\\", 55; Tarasouleas, The Female Spiridon Loues, 12. However, some of the authors who believe that \\"Melpomene\\" and Revithi are the same person attribute to the latter the more favorable time of 4¬Ω hours. E.g. Miragaya, The Female Olympian, 314, who cites Revithi was not allowed to enter Panathinaiko Stadium‚Äîher race was stopped in Parapigmata by a few Greek military officers whom she asked to sign her handwritten report to certify her time of arrival in Athens.Eleftheratos, 11 April 1896 (PDF); Tarasouleas, Stamata Revithi, \\"Alias Melpomeni\\", 54 She stated to the reporters that she wanted to meet Timoleon Philimon (the General-Secretary of the Hellenic Olympic Committee) to present her case. Historians believe that she intended to present her documents to the Hellenic Olympic Committee in the hopes that they would recognize her achievement. Neither her reports nor documents from the Hellenic Olympic Committee have been discovered to provide corroboration.Martin & Gynn, Running through the Ages, 22 = Aftermath = There is no account of Revithi's life following the marathon. Although some newspapers printed articles about her story in the build-up to the marathon, these reports did not follow up on her life after the race. It is not known whether she met Philimon or if she ever found a job.Eleftheratos, 11 April 1896 (PDF); Martin‚ÄìGynn, Running through the Ages, 21‚Äì22; Tarasouleas, The Female Spiridon Loues, 11 As Tarasouleas stated, \\"Stamata Revithi was lost in the dust of history\\".Tarasouleas, The Female Spiridon Loues, 12 Violet Piercy, of the United Kingdom, was the first woman to complete an officially timed marathon race: she clocked a time of 3 hours and 40 minutes in a British race on 3 October 1926.Lovett, Olympic Marathon, Chapter 25 Women were finally allowed to run the Olympic marathon at the 1984 Summer Olympics, when American Joan Benoit won the inaugural race in a time of 2 hours and 24 minutes.Joan Benoit, IOC  Melpomene  Edward Simmons, 1891; Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C. According to certain modern Olympic historians and journalists, Melpomene and Revithi are the same person, and the Greek woman was attributed the name of the Muse. In March 1896, a French-language newspaper in Athens (the Messager d'Ath√®nes) reported that there was \\"talk of a woman who had enrolled as a participant in the Marathon race. In the test run which she completed on her own [...] she took 4¬Ω hours to run the distance of 42 kilometres which separates Marathon from Athens.\\"Martin & Gynn, Running through the Ages, 20 Later that year, Franz K√©m√©ny, a founding International Olympic Committee member from Hungary, wrote in German that, \\"indeed a lady, Miss Melpomene, completed the 40 kilometres marathon in 4¬Ω hours and requested an entry into the Olympic Games competition. This was reportedly denied by the commission.\\"Martin & Gynn, Running through the Ages, 21 According to Martin and Gynn, \\"a peculiarity here is why there is no first name for Melpomene\\". The Messager report faded into obscurity for about 30 years before it was revived in 1927 in an issue of Der Leichtathlet.Tamini, Women always in the Race, 206 Olympic historian Karl Lennartz contends that two women ran the marathon in 1896, and that the name \\"Melpomene\\" was confirmed by both K√©m√©ny and Alfr√©d Haj√≥s, two-time Olympic swim champion of 1896.However, Haj√≥s confuses the race at the beginning of March with the one 11 April, about which Tarasouleas reports (Lennartz [1997], 20). Lennartz presents the following account: a young woman named Melpomene wanted to run the race and completed the distance in 4¬Ω hours at the end of February or the beginning of March. The organizing committee, however, did not allow her to run, and the newspaper Akropolis criticized the committee for its decision.Hungarian sport historian Eva F√≥ldes, Women at the Olympics, 105‚Äì114, gives a similar account of Melpomene's story. The Olympic Marathon took place on 10 April 1896, and another female runner, Stamata Revithi, took 5¬Ω hours to run the course on 11 April 1896. The newspapers Asti, New Aristophanes and Atlantida reported this on 12 April 1896.Lennartz, Two Women Run the Marathon, 20. For a similar account of events, see Jenkins, Sports Science Handbook , 314; Lovett, Olympic Marathon, Chapter 25; Mallon & Widlund, The 1896 Olympic Games, 14. Lucas (A History of the Marathon Race, 132) refers to \\"Melpomene\\" and her time (4¬Ω hours) but not to Revithi. However, Tarasouleas argues that no contemporary press reports in Greek newspapers mention Melpomene by name, while the name Revithi appears many times;Tarasouleas, Stamata Revithi, \\"Alias Melpomeni\\", 55. Martin & Gynn (Running through the Ages, 22) assert that the name \\"Melpomene\\" was described in foreign reports many years later (in 1927, when Der Leichtathlet revived the Messenger's report). Tarasouleas suggests that Melpomene and Revithi are the same person, and Martin and Green argue that \\"a contemporary account referring to Revithi as a well-known marathon runner could explain the earlier run by a woman over the marathon course‚Äîthis was by Revithi herself, not Melpomene\\".Martin & Gynn, Running through the Ages, 22; Tarasouleas, Stamata Revithi, \\"Alias Melpomeni\\", 55, quoting Estia of 4 April , and Asti of April 11 . The daily Athens newspaper Estia of 4 April 1896 refers to \\"the strange woman, who, having run a few days ago in the Marathon as a try-out, intends to compete the day after tomorrow. Today she came to our offices and said 'should my shoes hinder me, I will remove them on the way and continue barefoot'.\\" Moreover, Tarasouleas notes that on 13 March 1896, another local newspaper indicated that a woman and her baby had registered to run the marathon, but again her name is not mentioned. Trying to resolve the mystery, Tarasouleas asserts that \\"perhaps Revithi had two names, or perhaps for reasons unknown she was attributed the name of the Muse Melpomene\\".Tarasouleas, Stamata Revithi, \\"Alias Melpomeni\\", 54‚Äì55. Miragaya (The Female Olympian, 314) believes that after her marathon run, athletics officials could not remember Revithi's name so they labeled her \\"Melpomene\\", who is the Greek muse of tragedy. \\"Looking at Stamata Revithi, they could see only tragedy, not her extraordinary feat.\\" See also * Women at the Olympics  Citations and notes   References         * Category:1866 births Category:Year of death unknown Category:Greek female marathon runners Category:Greek female long-distance runners ","title":"Stamata Revithi"},{"id":"3692428","text":"Boeotarch (, Boiotarches) was the title of the chief officers of the Boeotian Confederacy, founded in 379 BC after a rebellion freed the cities of Boeotia from Spartan dominance. There were seven Boeotarchs, democratically elected from seven electoral districts throughout Boeotia. As the largest city of the region, Thebes generally elected four of the Boeotarchs, while the other three represented outlying districts. The number of Boeotarchs, however, may not have remained constant at seven. They may have not even represented districts in the same way as the earlier Boeotian League. Any Boeotian was eligible for election. Boeotarchs assumed office on the first day of the Boeotian year (1 Boukataios), and gave up office at the end of each year. Failure to relinquish power was a capital offence. The function of the Boeotarchs were roughly equivalent to that of the Athenian strategos, acting as both political leaders and generals in battle. And indeed, many other political, military, and judicial offices in the Boeotian League were copied from the Athenian model. The Boeotians also had an archon, but unlike the Athenian archon, his duties were merely symbolic. The sole responsibility of the Boeotian archon was in lending his name to the name of the year, a practice borrowed from the Athenians.

It originally had a Stalinist political stance; it retained a Marxist-Leninist stance until German reunification in 1990. The Neues Deutschland that existed in East Germany had a circulation of 1.1 million as of 1989 and was the communist party's main way to show citizens its stances and opinions about politics, economics, etc. It was regarded by foreign countries as the communist regime's diplomatic voice. Since the fall of communism, the Neues Deutschland has lost 98 percent of its readership and has a circulation of 18,595 as of 2020.

Stalin\\" ND was formed in 1946 as a Lizenzzeitung after the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) were forcibly merged to form the SED in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. The first edition of ND was published on 23 April 1946 in conjunction with the founding of the SED. ND replaced the SPD organ Das Volk and the KPD organ Deutsche Volkszeitung. Karl Maron was the first chief editor of the daily and served in the post until 1950. Before the reunification of Germany in October 1990, ND had a circulation of a million and was second only to the youth newspaper junge Welt in readership. During this period the editor-in-chief of ND was Wolfgang Spickermann. However, it has been claimed that Neues Deutschland failed to reach much of the East German population.  After reunification  Current Editor's office building in Berlin After reunification, ND's readership diminished greatly. In 2020, ND had a circulation of 18,595. While most large newspapers in Germany have a problem with declining circulation, ND is particularly vulnerable in that the majority of its readers are over 60 years old. ND produces both a national edition and regional editions for Berlin and Brandenburg. J√ºrgen Reents, who has political roots in both the Party of Democratic Socialism and the Green Party, has been the editor in chief of ND since 1999. One of his major goals has been to transform ND's image from a propaganda leaflet to a more respected newspaper. In October 2005 the editors moved from Elsenbr√ºcke to Franz-Mehring Platz in Berlin. Three months later, Olaf Koppe took over management of the newspaper. Each issue of the daily between 1945 and 1990 was digitalized by the Berlin State Library in June 2013. = Profile = ND is now oriented towards a democratic socialist viewpoint and is owned partially by The Left party. The twin goals of the newspaper are to give those in eastern Germany a voice and to represent the democratic socialist viewpoint without being the organ of The Left or any other political party. While eastern German themes dominate the features and the community pages, the political section looks at leftist politics throughout Germany. Authors and politicians from diverse political backgrounds have also been represented on the pages of the newspaper. For example, Friedrich Schorlemmer, a known critic of The Left party and the political left in general, has been a guest writer. Other traditional sections of a newspaper are also included, such as an advice page, a television guide, notifications and classifieds, opinion columns, and theme sections dealing with health, environment, and other issues. The letters to the editor are often cited as examples of viewpoints of the Left party from other media sources. As with most daily German newspapers, ND is published daily Monday through Friday, with a weekend edition published on Saturdays. In November 2006, the newspaper also started a youth insert called Sacco and Vanzetti. Beginning in March 2007, ND successfully started publishing online.

The fortification was established by the Normans in the wake of the invasion of England in 1066, to protect the route from Wales to Hereford. Possibly commissioned by William fitz Osbern, the Earl of Hereford, the castle comprised earthworks with timber defences. In 1135, a major Welsh revolt took place and in response King Stephen brought together Skenfrith Castle and its sister fortifications of Grosmont and White Castle to form a lordship known as the \\"Three Castles\\", which continued to play a role in defending the region from Welsh attack for several centuries. At the end of the 12th century, Skenfrith was rebuilt in stone. In 1201, King John gave the castle to a powerful royal official, Hubert de Burgh. During the course of the next few decades, it passed back and forth between several owners, including Hubert, the rival de Braose family, and the Crown. Hubert levelled the old castle and built a new rectangular fortification with round towers and a circular keep. In 1267 it was granted to Edmund, the Earl of Lancaster, and remained in the hands of the earldom, and later duchy, of Lancaster until 1825. Edward I's conquest of Wales in 1282 removed much of Skenfrith Castle's military utility, and by the 16th century it had fallen into disuse and ruin. The castle was placed into the care of the state by the National Trust in 1936, and is now managed by the Cadw heritage agency. History =11th‚Äì12th centuries= Skenfrith Castle was built in the wake of the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Shortly after the invasion, the Normans pushed up into the Welsh Marches, where William the Conqueror made William fitz Osbern the Earl of Hereford; Earl William added to his new lands by then capturing the towns of Monmouth and Chepstow. The Normans used castles extensively to militarily subdue the Welsh, establish new settlements and exert their claims of lordship over the territories. Skenfrith Castle was one of a triangle of fortifications built in the Monnow valley around this time, possibly by Earl William himself, to protect the route from Wales to Hereford. The first castle on the site was built from earth and timber. The earldom's landholdings in the region were slowly broken up after William's son, Roger de Breteuil, rebelled against the King in 1075. In 1135, a major Welsh revolt took place, however, and in response King Stephen restructured the landholdings along this section of the Marches, bringing together Skenfrith Castle and its sister fortifications of Grosmont and White Castle back under the control of the Crown to form a lordship known as the \\"Three Castles\\". Conflict with the Welsh continued, and following a period of d√©tente under Henry II in the 1160s, the de Mortimer and de Braose Marcher families attacked their Welsh rivals during the 1170s, leading to a Welsh assault on nearby Abergavenny Castle in 1182.; In response, the Crown readied the castle to face an attack, and in 1186, ¬£43 was spent developing the defences followed by more work in 1190, probably establishing a stone keep and curtain wall. =13th‚Äì17th centuries= In 1201, King John gave the Three Castles to Hubert de Burgh. Hubert was a minor landowner who had become John's household chamberlain when he was still a prince, and went on to become an increasingly powerful royal official once John had inherited the throne.; Hubert began to upgrade his new castles, starting with Grosmont, but was captured while fighting in France. While Hubert was in captivity, King John took back the Three Castles and gave them to William de Braose, a rival of Hubert's. King John subsequently fell out with William and dispossessed him of his lands in 1207, but de Braose's son, also called William, took the opportunity presented by the First Barons' War to retake the castles.; Foundations of the hall range Once released, Hubert regained his grip on power, becoming the royal justiciar and being made the Earl of Kent, before finally recovering the Three Castles in 1219 during the reign of King Henry III. During Hubert's tenure, Skenfrith was entirely rebuilt; the old castle was levelled and a new rectangular castle with round towers and a central circular keep was constructed in its place. Hubert fell from power in 1232 and was stripped of the castles, which were placed under the command of Walerund Teutonicus, a royal servant; having been reconciled with the king in 1234, the castles were returned to him briefly but he fell out with King Henry III again in 1239 and they were taken back once again and assigned to Walerund. Walerund built a new chapel at the castle in 1244, and repaired the keep's roof. In 1254, Skenfrith Castle and its sister fortifications were granted to King Henry's eldest son, and later king, Prince Edward. The Welsh threat persisted, and in 1262 the castle was readied in response to Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd's attack on Abergavenny in 1262; commanded by its constable Gilbert Talbot, Skenfrith was ordered to be garrisoned \\"by every man, and at whatever cost\\". The threat passed without incident. Edmund, the Earl of Lancaster and the capitaneus of the royal forces in Wales, was given the Three Castles in 1267 and for many centuries they were held by the earldom, later duchy, of Lancaster.; Little further work was carried out at Skenfrith, although repairs were carried out to the tower and gates under King Henry VI. King Edward I's conquest of Wales in 1282 had removed much of the castle's military utility, although it continued to be used as an administrative centre. By 1538, Skenfrith Castle had fallen into disuse and then into ruin; a 1613 description noted that it was \\"ruynous and decayed\\". =18th‚Äì21st centuries= In 1825, the Three Castles were sold off to Henry Somerset, the Duke of Beaufort. It was eventually acquired by the lawyer Harold Sands, who carried out some conservation of the site; he went on to give the castle to the National Trust. Skenfrith was placed into the care of the state in 1936, and extensive repair work was carried out. In the 21st century, Skenfirth Castle is managed by Cadw and protected under UK law as a grade II* listed building.

The current castle was created by Hubert de Burgh in the early 13th century, when the earthworks of the 11th-century Norman castle were flattened and spread out over the current site to a depth of ; the 12th-century stone fortifications and buildings were demolished at the same time. Hubert's castle forms a polygon, with four walls approximately 80 metres, 60 metres, 60 metres and 40 metres (260 ft, 200 ft, 200 ft and 130 ft) long respectively, and was built from Old Red Sandstone.; It was originally protected by a stone- revetted, water-filled moat, deep and wide, fed by the river. The moat is now filled in and grassed over. The castle was entered from the north-west side over a bridge and through a gatehouse, both since destroyed. The curtain wall survives to a height of up to , and was probably originally topped by a parapet and protective timber hoarding.; The castle had circular towers on each corner, probably only used for storage and defence, of which three still survive, the north-west tower having been reduced to its foundations. A watergate on the eastern side of the castle led down to the Monnow. A two- storey hall range stretched across the south-western inside of the castle, of which only the foundations now survive. Originally the hall range comprised a long room on the northern end, and a smaller chamber to the south, although the northern section was subsequently subdivided. The floor level of the hall range was later raised due to flooding, with the ground floors being filled in with gravel. The main hall would have been on the first floor, above the surviving ground floor fireplace. The south end of the range held a water reservoir for the castle. On the opposite side of the hall range was a kitchen block, of which nothing now survives above ground. The three-story circular keep in the middle of the castle is high and , across with a protruding staircase tower on its south-western side.; It closely resembled similar keeps built during this period in France by Philip II and at Pembroke by William Marshal; its staircase tower was similar to others built across the Welsh Marches at the time, including at Caldicot and Longtown.; Earth was piled up around the plinth at the base of the keep, probably to defend the base of the walls, with the result closely resembling a motte. Originally it would have been topped with defensive wooden hoarding, with an external wooden staircase reaching up to the entrance on the first floor: the current, ground floor entrance was cut out of its walls at a later date. The basement was accessed by a trapdoor and used as a storeroom.; The first floor chamber would have been an antechamber, while the second floor chamber was fitted with windows, a large fireplace and a private latrine, and would have provided living accommodation for the lord.

It was located at the former Belgrade fairground site near the town of Zemun, in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). The camp was organized and operated by SS Einsatzgruppen units stationed in occupied Serbia. It became operational in September 1941 and was officially opened on 28 October of that year. The Germans dubbed it the Jewish camp in Zemun (). At the end of 1941 and the beginning of 1942, thousands of Jewish women, children and old men were brought to the camp, along with 500 Jewish men and 292 Romani women and children, most of whom were from Ni≈°, Smederevo and ≈†abac. Women and children were placed in makeshift barracks and suffered during numerous influenza epidemics. Kept in squalid conditions, they were provided with inadequate amounts of food and many froze to death during the winter of 1941‚Äì42. Between March and May 1942, the Germans used a gas van sent from Berlin to kill thousands of Jewish inmates. With the gassings complete, it was renamed Zemun concentration camp () and served to hold one last group of Jews who were arrested upon the surrender of Italy in September 1943. During this time it also held captured Yugoslav Partisans, Chetniks, sympathizers of the Greek and Albanian resistance movements, and Serb peasants from villages in other parts of the NDH. An estimated 32,000 prisoners, mostly Serbs, passed through the camp during this period, 10,600 of whom were killed or died due to hunger and disease. Conditions in Sajmi≈°te were so poor that some began comparing it to Jasenovac and other large concentration camps throughout Europe. In 1943 and 1944, evidence of atrocities committed in the camp was destroyed by the units of SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Paul Blobel, and thousands of corpses were exhumed from mass graves and incinerated. In May 1944, the Germans transferred control of the camp over to the NDH, and it was closed that July. Estimates of the number of deaths at Sajmi≈°te range from 20,000 to 23,000, with the number of Jewish deaths estimated at 7,000 to 10,000. It is thought that half of all Serbian Jews perished at the camp. Most of the Germans responsible for the operation of the camp were captured and brought to trial. Several were extradited to Yugoslavia and executed. Camp commander Herbert Andorfer and his deputy Edgar Enge were arrested in the 1960s after many years of hiding. Both were given short prison sentences in West Germany and Austria, respectively, though Enge never served any time given his old age and poor health. Background The Belgrade Fair before World War II The site that became the Sajmi≈°te concentration camp during World War II had originally been an exhibition centre built by the Belgrade municipality in 1937 in an attempt to attract international commerce to the city. The centre's modernist pavilions featured elaborate displays of industrial progress and design from European countries, including Germany. Its architectural centerpiece was a large tower which was used by Philips to transmit the earliest television broadcasts in Europe. Much of the centre stood empty and unused until the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. The country was dismembered following the invasion, with Serbia being reduced to Serbia proper, the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat, which was occupied by the Germans and placed under the administration of a German military government. Milan Nediƒá, a pre-war politician who was known to have pro-Axis leanings, was then selected by the Germans to lead the collaborationist Government of National Salvation in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia. The civilian administration in the country was headed by SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Harald Turner, who commanded the Einsatzgruppen Serbien. Originally led by SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Wilhelm Fuchs, and later by SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer August Meyszner with SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Emanuel Sch√§fer as his deputy, the group was responsible for ensuring internal security, fighting opponents of the occupation, and dealing with Jews. alt=map showing the partition of Yugoslavia, 1941‚Äì43 Meanwhile, the extreme Croat nationalist and fascist Ante Paveliƒá, who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini's Italy, was appointed Poglavnik (\\"leader\\") of an Usta≈°e-led Croatian state ‚Äì the Independent State of Croatia (often called the NDH, from the ). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day Croatia, all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern-day Serbia into an \\"Italian-German quasi-protectorate.\\" NDH authorities, led by the Usta≈°e militia, subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the Serb, Jewish and Romani populations living within the borders of the new state. Zemun, the town where the Sajmi≈°te fairgrounds were located, was ceded to the NDH. The occupation of Zemun ‚Äì during which non-Croats such as Serbs, Jews and Roma were relentlessly persecuted by the Usta≈°e ‚Äì would last until late 1944. By this point, more than 25 percent of Zemun's pre-war population of 65,000 had perished. A large- scale uprising erupted in Serbia following the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Although they took no part in the rebellion, Jews were targeted for retaliatory execution by the Germans. The Germans soon implemented a number of anti-Jewish laws, and by the end of August 1941, all Serbian Jewish males were interned in concentration camps, primarily at Topovske ≈†upe in Belgrade. History =Establishment= Jews were rounded up by the Germans after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. In the fall of 1941, Turner ordered that all Jewish women and children in Serbia be concentrated in a camp. At first the Germans considered creating a ghetto for the Jews in the Gypsy quarter of Belgrade, but this idea was quickly dismissed due to the area being considered \\"too filthy and unhygenic.\\" When several other plans to intern the Jewish and Romani populations of Belgrade failed, a concentration camp was established on a peninsula surrounded on three sides by the Sava river, and located in full view of Belgrade's central Terazije Square. The camp was positioned in a manner which made escape almost impossible. It was located near administrative and police centres, as well as the Belgrade central railway station, which allowed for the efficient transport of Jews to the camp from the many towns in the region. Its purpose was to detain Jewish women and children that the Germans claimed \\"endangered\\" public safety and the Wehrmacht. The Germans dubbed Sajmi≈°te the \\"Jewish camp in Zemun\\" (). The camp was intended to hold as many as 500,000 people captured from rebels areas across occupied Yugoslavia. The name \\"Semlin\\" was derived from the German word for the former Austro-Hungarian frontier town of Zemun, where the camp was located. Despite being located on the territory of the NDH, it was controlled by the German military police apparatus in occupied Serbia. NDH authorities did not object to its establishment and told the Germans that it could be located on NDH territory as long as its guards were German rather than Serb. Soon after the camp was established, SS-Scharf√ºhrer Edgar Enge of the Belgrade Gestapo became its commander. Initially, the campgrounds held about 500 male Jewish inmates who were given the task of running the camp's so-called \\"self- administration\\" and were made responsible for distributing food, dividing up labour, and organizing a Jewish guard force which patrolled along the camp. The exterior of the camp, however, was guarded on a rotation basis by twenty- five members of Reserve Police Battalion 64. By October, all male Jewish inmates and most male Romani inmates were killed. Most were executed in four major waves, with frequent killings occurring in mid-September and between 9 and 11 October. On each occasion, inmates were told that they were being transported to a camp in Austria with better labour conditions but were instead taken to Jabuka in the Banat or to a firing range on the outskirts of Belgrade, where they were killed. Sajmi≈°te officially opened on a wider scale on 28 October 1941. The last of the initial male Jewish inmates were killed on 11 November. =Judenlager Semlin= A gas van similar to one used in Sajmi≈°te. At the end of 1941 and the beginning of 1942, approximately 7,000 Jewish women, children and old men were brought to the camp, along with a further 500 Jewish men and 292 Romani women and children. Most of these people were from the outlying Serbian towns, primarily Ni≈°, Smederevo and ≈†abac. Women and children were placed in makeshift barracks that were barely heated, and whose windows were shattered due to German bombing raids carried out during the invasion of Yugoslavia. Originally constructed as fair pavilions, the largest of these barracks held up to 5,000 prisoners. Inmates suffered during numerous influenza epidemics, slept on wet straw or bare floorboards, and were provided with inadequate amounts of food. Starvation was widespread, and Jewish inmates appealed unsuccessfully to Serbian authorities for more food to be provided to the camp. Consequently, a high number of detainees, especially children, died in late 1941 and early 1942, with many inmates freezing to death in one of the coldest winters on record. The Romani inmates were kept in far more miserable conditions than their Jewish counterparts. They also slept on straw in an unheated hall, but were kept separate from non- Romani prisoners. The majority of Romani inmates were released after six weeks of detention. Most Jewish inmates remained detained, with the exception of ten Jewish women who were married to Christian men. In January 1942, SS- Untersturmf√ºhrer Herbert Andorfer was appointed to replace the inexperienced Enge as commander of the camp. Enge was subsequently made Andorfer's deputy. That month, German military authorities demanded the camp be cleared of Jews in order to accommodate the growing number of captives taken in battles with the Partisans. By February the camp held about 6,500 inmates, ten percent of whom were Romani. In early March, Andorfer was informed that a gas van had been sent to the camp from Berlin. The Sauer van had been delivered upon the request of the German military administration chief in Serbia, Harald Turner. Stricken with guilt over having to play a central role in the murder of the Jewish inmates, some of whom he had developed good relations with, Andorfer requested a transfer; this was denied. In order to ensure the quickness and efficiency of the gassings, he made announcements intended to convince the prisoners that they were going to be transferred to another, better-equipped camp. He went so far as to post fictitious camp regulations, and announced that prisoners would be allowed to take their bags with them. Many detainees registered for the supposed transfer, hoping to escape the camp's terrible living conditions. Inmates who had volunteered to leave the previous evening climbed into the van the next day in groups of between 50 and 80. The drivers of the van, SS-Scharf√ºhrers Meier and G√∂tz, distributed candy to children in order to win their affection. Afterwards, the doors of the van were sealed shut. The van then followed a small car driven by Andorfer and Enge, before crossing the border into German-occupied Serbia. It was here that one of the drivers exited the van and crawled underneath it, diverting its exhaust into the interior of the vehicle and killing the inmates with carbon monoxide gas. The van was then taken to the Avala firing range, where corpses were dumped into mass graves freshly dug by Serbian and Romani prisoners. Such gassings became routine, and the gas van arrived every day except Sunday. Rumours quickly circulated about the gassings, with news reaching German troops stationed in Belgrade and even some Serbians. Consequently, the gas van was nicknamed the \\"soul killer\\" () by the Serb population exposed to these rumours. It is thought that the gassings took the lives of as many as 8,000 inmates, mostly women and children. The seven Serbian prisoners that had participated in unloading the murdered inmates from the van were shot after the gassings stopped, but the gravedigger, a Serb named Vladimir Milutinoviƒá, survived. \\"Eighty-one or eighty-two trenches were prepared and I helped dig all of them,\\" he recalled. \\"At least 100 people [fit] into each trench [...] These ones were only for those suffocated in the truck. We dug a different set for those who were shot.\\" Few inmates remained in the camp after the gassings stopped, mostly non-Jewish women who had been married to Jews. They were released several days later, after being sworn to secrecy. Apart from Sajmi≈°te inmates, the 500 patients and staff of the Belgrade Jewish Hospital, as well as Jewish prisoners from the nearby Banjica concentration camp, were also killed in the gas van. The last Jewish prisoner in Sajmi≈°te was killed on 8 May 1942, and the gas van used at the camp was returned to Berlin on 9 June 1942. It received a technical upgrade there, and was then transferred to Belarus where it was used to gas Jews in Minsk. Shortly after leading the extermination of the Jewish inmates in Sajmi≈°te, Andorfer and Enge were assigned different Security Police roles. Andorfer later received an Iron Cross 2nd Class for running the camp, and won a promotion. =Anhaltelager Semlin= With the extermination of the original Jewish inmates completed, the camp was renamed Zemun concentration camp () and served to hold one last group of Jews who were arrested upon the surrender of Italy in September 1943. It also held captured Yugoslav Partisans, Chetniks, sympathizers of the Greek and Albanian resistance movements, and Serb peasants from villages in the Croatian Usta≈°e-controlled regions of Srem and Kozara, where they had been detained in the Jasenovac concentration camp. Conditions deteriorated to such an extent that some began comparing it to Jasenovac and other large concentration camps throughout Europe. The camp became the main transit point for Yugoslav prisoners and detainees on their way to labour locations and concentration camps in Germany. An estimated 32,000 mostly Serb prisoners passed through Sajmi≈°te during this period, 10,600 of whom were killed or died due to hunger and disease. Alarmed by the fact that the campgrounds could easily be seen from across the Sava, in late 1943, the new German ambassador to Serbia proposed that the camp be moved deeper into NDH territory, because its \\"[continuing existence] before the eyes of the people of Belgrade was politically intolerable for reasons of public feeling.\\" His requests were ignored by German authorities. By the end of 1943, the Germans made an effort to erase all traces of the atrocities committed in the camp by burning records, incinerating corpses, and destroying other pieces of evidence. This task was undertaken by SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Paul Blobel, who arrived in Belgrade in November 1943. Upon arrival, he ordered the head of the local Gestapo, SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Bruno Sattler, to form a special detachment that was to be responsible for the exhumation and burning of bodies. The detachment was led by Lieutenant Erich Grunwald, and composed of ten security policemen and 48 military policemen. The digging battalions were composed of 100 Serbian and Jewish prisoners. Exhumations occurred from December 1943 to April 1944, and thousands of bodies were burned. All the prisoners that were present during the exhumations were shot, except for three Serbs who managed to escape. Allied aircraft bombed Sajmi≈°te on 17 April 1944, killing about 100 inmates and inflicting heavy damage to the camp itself. On 17 May 1944, the Germans transferred control of the camp over to the NDH. It was closed that July.  Aftermath and legacy  A monument commemorating the victims of the camp After the war, Yugoslavia's new communist government announced that 100,000 people had passed through Sajmi≈°te between 1941 and 1944, half of whom were killed. The Yugoslav State War Crimes Commission later estimated that as many as 40,000 may have been killed in the camp, including 7,000 Jews. According to the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, the death toll was exaggerated by the communists for political purposes, and the real number of inmates was about 50,000, with 20,000 killed. It is estimated that half of all Serbian Jews perished in the camp. The Staro Sajmi≈°te memorial cites 23,000 fatalities, of which 10,000 were Jewish. Most of those responsible for the camp's operation were captured and brought to trial. Following the war, many prominent German officials, including Turner, Fuchs and Meyszner, were extradited to Yugoslavia by the Allies, and subsequently executed. Andorfer escaped to Venezuela with the assistance of the Roman Catholic Church. He returned to Austria in the 1960s, and was subsequently apprehended and tried on the minor charge of being an accessory to murder, for which he was sentenced to 2¬Ω years' imprisonment. Andorfer's deputy Enge was apprehended in the 1960s and sentenced to 1¬Ω years' imprisonment. He avoided serving his sentence due to his old age and poor health. Guards suspected of executing prisoners were never tried, though they served as eyewitnesses in several trials in West Germany. Sajmi≈°te stood abandoned until 1948, when it was transformed into a youth workers' headquarters during the construction of New Belgrade. = Memorial = Belgrade Jews murdered during the Holocaust, including those at Sajmi≈°te, were not commemorated by Yugoslavia's post-war Communist government until 30 years after the war ended. The old Sajmi≈°te fairgrounds are marked by small plaques and a monument to commemorate those detained or killed in the camp. The plaques were dedicated in 1974 and 1984, respectively. In 1987, the Sajmi≈°te fairgrounds were granted cultural landmark status by the government of Yugoslavia. A monument, high and created by the artist Miodrag Popoviƒá, was erected on the banks of the Sava on 22 April 1995, marking 50 years of victory over the Nazism and Serbian Holocaust Remembrance Day. No memorial centres or museums have ever been built on the former campgrounds. The campgrounds are now used to house low-income residents. In February 1992, as provided by the detailed urban plan, the neighborhood was to be fully reconstructed to its pre-war look, an idea opposed by some architects, with added memorial and commemorative objects. The entire complex was to be transformed into one large memorial, but it all remained on paper. The idea was constantly present, gaining media and political momentum in the 2010s, but as of 2018 nothing has been actually done. In November 2018 it was announced that a monument to the humanitarian Diana Budisavljeviƒá will be placed along the quay, next to the already existing memorial. Budisavljeviƒá saved 15,000 children (12,000 of which survived) from perishing in the Concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia, operated by the Usta≈°e regime during World War II. City decided to erect a monument in her memory already in October 2015, but only now set the location. The monument was to be finished and dedicated in the second half of 2019. No work has been done regarding this project and in November 2019 city announced the monument to Budisavljeviƒá will be erected across the Sava, in the old section of the city. On the section facing the access to the Branko's Bridge, there were tumbled remains of two massive concrete columns, with their foundations. They were part of the camp's gate. In 2014, sculptor and professor , with minimal intervention, shaped them into two heads, with iron bars forming the face (eyes, mouth) and spiky hair. The readymade work was described as an artifact, monument and work of art, all in one. On 24 February 2020, the National Assembly of Serbia adopted the Law on Memorial Center \\"Staro Sajmi≈°te\\". It is organized as the state cultural institute for, among other duties, keeping the memory on victims of the Nazi concentration camps Judenlager Semlin and Anhaltelager Semlin. For the first time, one law in Serbia recognized the genocide in the Independent State of Croatia, the Holocaust and the Samudaripen, as World War II genocides of the Serbs, Jews and Romani people, respectively. The center will also adapt the remains into the proper memorial. The law will be applied from January 2021. = Controversies = Croatian author Anto Kne≈æeviƒá caused considerable controversy in May 1993 when he suggested that Serbs, not Germans, had been responsible for running the camp. This claim was vehemently denied by Jewish historians and Belgrade's Jewish community. The neglected and desolate complex housed in time some prominent artists (painters and sculptors) as former fair buildings were awarded to them as their ateliers. Also, some other facilities moved-in over time, like the kafanas and gyms, but the major public controversy arose in April 2019 when it was announced that a privately owned kindergarten will be open in one of the buildings. The investor, Milorad Krsmanoviƒá, purchased the building (the Simiƒá pavilion) in 1998, but the court later voided the contract, which didn't prevent him from using the venue as a disco club, gallery, restaurant and gym since then. A fierce public debate ensued, including city administration asking for the state government to \\"re-think about the permit\\", government claiming that there is no legal cause to stop it, Jewish and parents organizations which are against it and the investor who blames the state of trying to rob him. The debate also pointed again to the 75 years long inability of the state to arrange the complex properly. According to Jovan Byford, from the very beginning Sajmi≈°te was one of the main motives of the struggle of Serbian and Croatian quasi-historians. Authors in Serbia at the end of the eighties increasingly claimed that Sajmi≈°te was located on the territory of the Independent State of Croatia. Most often, the intention was not to \\"transfer\\" victims of this camp to Croatia, but to point out that the collaborationist government in Serbia had no influence on the events in this camp since Sajmi≈°te was under German administration and on the territory of another state. According to some authors in Serbia, Nedic's government in Belgrade cannot bear responsibility for the Holocaust. This argument was also used by the collaborators in post-war trials. However, those who saw the fact that Sajmi≈°te was formally located on the territory of the Independent State of Croatia, they saw confirmation that it was an Ustasha camp. In 1990 Politika article Sajmi≈°te is mentioned along with Jasenovac and Jadovno, as the site of an Ustasha crime against Jewish, Serbs and Roma. Authors from Croatia responded to such claims with a counterattack. Apart from disputing the claim that Sajmi≈°te was an Ustasha camp (especially not at the time when Jews were imprisoned there), they tried to prove that the Serbs were the biggest executioners in it.Byford, Jovan; (2011) Staro sajmi≈°te: mesto seƒáanja, zaborava i sporenja. Beogradski centar za ljudska prava p. 147-150, . = Philosophical assessment = Ljiljana Blagojeviƒá, professor and architect, said that \\"Staro Sajmi≈°te is town of the collective with also dreamed of final Solution\\". Jovana Krstiƒá, also and architect, said that Staro Sajmi≈°te is the unique phenomenon in the world as no other localities merged the symbols of prosperity and downfall in such a unique and tragic way. She identified the locality with Pierre Nora's term lieux de memoire, a place where the memory persists even though the locality changed its appearance and stopped being a milieux de memoire, the real environment of a memory. Writer David Albahari wrote: \\"It's a place that doesn't simply humiliate by its inhumanity, but also by its complete exposing to Belgrade, which silently watched it from across the river\\".

Located near Po≈æega city center and at the foot of the hill where a medieval fortress once stood, this cathedral is a beautiful example of Baroque architecture. Construction The cathedral building was funded by Franjo Thauszy, Zagreb bishop, with 80,000 forints that were originally intended for repairs of the Po≈æega fortress, owned by bishop Thauszy at the time. The project was endorsed by empress Maria Theresa on 11 July 1754 and building started on 28 June 1756. The construction took seven years and bishop Thauszy consecrated the new church on 24 July 1763. There is no record of the craftsman who has actually built the cathedral. It is only known that the blueprints were supplied by empress Maria Teresa herself. The original tower was toppled by a storm in 1926 and had to be replaced by a new, 63 meters tall tower. Decoration The interior of the Po≈æega cathedral is decorated in playful baroque and rococo style. The interior is dominated by main altar of St. Teresa of √Åvila, gift of bishop Franjo Thauszy, presented on the occasion of the consecration of the church. Among other altars in the cathedral, the altar of St. John of Nepomuk and the altar of St. Michael the Archangel are especially noteworthy. The former was a gift of Croatian viceroy Franjo N√°dasdy, and the latter of Po≈æega-born, Kutjevo parish priest Josip Mauroviƒá. Furthermore, there is a beautiful pulpit - also a gift from bishop Thauszy, and rococo carved oak pews. Cathedral organ was built by Josip Brandl factory in Maribor and put in its place in 1900. By the end of the 19th century, six octagonal stained-glass windows have been installed. Paintings Interior of the Po≈æega cathedral is also decorated by wall paintings painted by famous Croatian painters Celestin Medoviƒá and Oton Ivekoviƒá in 1898 and 1899. Trinity painting above the main altar has been painted by two of them together, while on the ceiling of the apse there is painting of St. Teresa by Medoviƒá. Other works by Medoviƒá in the cathedral are: Evangelists Matthew and Mark - on the ceiling of the main nave, Jesus on the Mount of Olives - on the ceiling of the south nave, and St. Cyril - in the main nave.

Buck shoots a hole in their water bag and then turns back to the depot. The fugitives come within sight of the railroad‚Äôs water tank, only to see Buck‚Äôs posse station a guard. Doubling back to Terrapin Tanks, a granite sump at the edge of the desert, the robbers lose their horses in a sandstorm. Desperate for water, they find the tanks dynamited by a tenderfoot, who disappeared chasing his thirsting horses. In a covered wagon nearby lies the man's wife - Sweet's niece-in-law (Mildred Natwick) - who is in labor. While Pedro helps with the delivery, the other two laborously collect water from nearby cacti. Many hours later, the woman has a boy, whom she names \\"Robert William Pedro Hightower\\" after her benefactors. Before dying, she exacts a promise from them to save him and be his godfathers. Moved, the three desperadoes keep their vow. They find a chest filled with baby things, condensed milk, an advice book, and a Bible. Pedro offers Bob the Bible for guidance, but Bob slaps it aside. Kid, certain that a higher power guided them there, compares the baby to the infant Jesus in the manger and themselves as the Three Wise Men. Inspired by a Bible verse, they head for the town of New Jerusalem, across the desert and over a mountain. The posse later comes upon the abandoned wagon, and recognizing the possessions of his niece-in-law, Sweet believes that the fugitives killed her and sets out after them for revenge. When they cross a salt flat, Kid collapses and dies. Once past the flat, Pedro trips, breaking his leg. He asks Bob to leave him his pistol, \\"for coyotes\\"; as Bob walks toward the mountain, he hears a single gunshot. Staggering through a ravine, Bob finally falls, but in his delirium the ghosts of his two friends refuse to let him give up. Finding a donkey and her colt at the end of the ravine, he uses them to reach New Jerusalem, where he stumbles into a cantina to get drinks for himself and the baby. Just as Sheriff Sweet catches up with him, Bob collapses from exhaustion. Bob is jailed in Welcome, but with his heroic rescue of the baby, the entire town has become sympathetic towards him. Bob gives his godchild into the temporary custody of the Sweets, now his friends, but when the judge (Guy Kibbee) asks him to give up custody permanently in exchange for a suspended sentence, he refuses to break his promise to the baby's mother. Pleased, the judge gives him the minimum sentence of a year and a day; and as he leaves for prison, all the townspeople give Bob a rousing farewell.

At the beginning, stuntman Cliff Lyons is shown silhouetted against a sunset, riding Carey‚Äôs favorite horse, Sonny, over the words: \\"To the Memory of Harry Carey, bright star of the Western sky...\\" The opening credits say \\"Introducing Harry Carey, Jr.\\" but this was not his first appearance on screen. He had been in at least five pictures before this one. Young Carey had had a close relationship with Ford until this picture, but found himself the target of verbal and physical abuse that shocked him. John Wayne explained that Ford did this to everyone as a way of getting the performances he wanted. The acerbic director showed some real sensitivity when he made young Carey go home early one day. The tribute segment described above was going to be filmed, and Ford wanted to spare him. The senior Carey starred in the first film version, The Three Godfathers (1916) playing Bob Sangster, a former horsethief who is trying to go straight. In the remake Marked Men (1919), directed by John Ford, he played Harry, a prison escapee who also survives the ordeal, finding love on the way. Hell‚Äôs Heroes (1930), directed by William Wyler, stars Charles Bickford as Bob Sangster, a true desperado, who originally plans to rape the woman in the wagon, and in the end saves the baby by drinking from a poisoned waterhole, knowing it will give him enough time to get to safety. Three Godfathers (1936), stars Chester Morris as Bob, a ruthless killer, with Lewis Stone and Walter Brennan as members of the gang. He also uses the poisoned well. In the 1948 version no one is killed during the robbery, and the loot is small. It is lost before they leave town and is never mentioned again. In the 1930 and 1936 versions, which are grimmer, the bad guys are very bad, people are killed during the robbery, and saddlebags full of stolen gold play a crucial role. Film critic Leonard Maltin prefers Hell‚Äôs Heroes as the \\"most satisfying, least sentimental\\" of all the films. He praised the ‚Äúunderrated‚Äù 1936 version as \\"beautifully shot and warmly acted\\". Maltin describes the 1948 film as \\"sturdy, sentimental, sometimes beautiful\\", but feels that the last scene \\"didn't ring true\\". Reception The film has maintained its positive reception. It holds an 82% \\"Fresh\\" score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 critics. According to MGM records, the film earned $2,078,000 in the US and Canada and $763,000 overseas, resulting in a profit of $450,000.

An EB-66 tactical jamming aircraft leads four F-105 fighter-bombers as a Pathfinder. Also called synchronous radar bombing or buddy bombing, this method required the EB-66 navigator to use his K-5 radar bombing navigation system to detect the target and send a signal tone to the F-105s to drop their bombs. Throughout the bombing run, the Pathfinder employed its S-band jammers to suppress radar-controlled anti-aircraft guns. Radar film coverage from Pathfinder missions was accumulated by the USAF for more sophisticated and refined targeting, bomb damage assessment and photographic reconnaissance of North Vietnam.Jacob Van Staaveren, \\"Gradual Failure: The Air War over North Vietnam: 1965‚Äì1966\\" (Washington, D.C.: Air Force History and Museums Program, 2002), p 226‚Äì227. High level bombing (also called high-altitude bombing) is a tactic of dropping bombs from bomber aircraft in level flight at high altitude. The term is used in contrast to both World War II-era dive bombing\\"The Bomber War\\" by Robin Neillands, , p.35 and medium or low level bombing. Prior to the modern age of precision-guided munitions (PGMs), high level bombing was primarily used for strategic bombing‚Äîinflicting mass damage on the enemy's economy and population‚Äînot for attacks on specific military targets. High level bombing missions have been flown by many different types of aircraft, including medium bombers, heavy bombers, strategic bombers and fighter-bombers. The choice to use high level bombing as an offensive tactic of aerial warfare is dependent not only upon the inherent accuracy and effectiveness of the bombing aircraft and their delivered ordnance on the target, but also upon a target's air defense capabilities. From the 1940s onward, radar in particular became a powerful new defensive early warning tool, and a serious threat to attacking aircraft when they flew at higher altitudes towards their target. Bombing from medium to high altitudes, especially in the post-World War II era with sophisticated surface-to-air missiles, interceptor aircraft and radars exposes attacking bomber aircraft to greater risks of detection, interception and destruction. During World War II, various methods were employed to protect high level bombers from flak, fighter aircraft and radar detection, including defensive armament, escort fighters, chaff and electronic jamming. Modern stealth aircraft technologies, for example, can alleviate some risks inherent to high level bombing missions, but are not a guarantee of success or permanent solution for the attackers.  World War II  B-17 Flying Fortress, a famous World War II heavy bomber and high level bomber. High level bombers were primarily used by the Allies for carpet bombing (particularly later in the war), such as the bombing of Dresden or Tokyo. They were also deployed in other kinds of missions such as Operation Tidal Wave, Operation Crossbow, and the sinking of the Tirpitz. After initial operations by day suffered heavy losses, the British switched to night-time sorties where the darkness gave some protection against German fighters. Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris's strategy for the RAF Bomber Command was to attack area targets that the bombers could be more certain of hitting at night, while the U.S. preferred daylight, precision bombing techniques.\\"The Bomber War\\" by Robin Neillands, , p.23 The development since the 1930s of gyroscope- stabilised optical bombsights, such as the Norden bombsight, also helped the Allied air forces' ability to accurately strike their targets with medium- to high-altitude level bombing attacks. Nazi Germany used high level bombers such as the Heinkel He 111, the Dornier Do 17 and multi-role aircraft such as the Junkers Ju 88 against the Allies in the Battle of Britain,\\"The Bomber War\\" by Robin Neillands, , Chapter 2 both for carpet bombing and for precision attacks on British radar stations as part of Operation Eagle.\\"History of the Second World War, ed.

The French equivalent was the Mirage IV, and the UK had its V bombers. The U.S. Strategic Air Command (SAC) ordered massive high level bombing in Operation Rolling Thunder and Operation Menu during the Vietnam War.

History Parkway West High School (PWHS) was the second high school built in the Parkway School District; it opened in fall 1968 with grades 10-12. In the 1969-1970 school year, Parkway West Junior High was formed and grades 7-9 were housed in the West Senior building, operating on the same schedule as West Senior. For the 1970-71 school year, West Senior operated as a four-year high school (grades 9-12), with West Junior grades 7 and 8 attending Parkway South Junior High School on a split schedule. Members of the class of 1974 attended school in the West Senior building for five straight years. West Junior opened for the 1971-1972 school year with the new \\"open classroom\\" layout.

The fruit is very sweet, round in shape and about 7‚Äì8 cm wide in size. Trees are heavy bearing every other year, and sometimes the limbs break due to the heavy yields. Growers resort to propping the limbs up with sticks at times, though if the limb bends gradually down and grows in that position it will do better in future years. Trees can be propagated by seed, as they breed true, or grafted onto other rootstocks, trifoliate orange being the most popular. Andrew Willis of Apopka, Florida, promoted the Ponkan heavily in the early 1900s. Ponkan is also noted for having a loose rind that is very easy to peel. Cultivation Ponkans are widely grown in the United States, Brazil, Japan and China. It was originally introduced to the United States by Carlo Roman in 1880.

Fr√©mont's initial notability came from her family: she was the daughter of Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton and the wife of military officer, explorer and politician, John C. Fr√©mont. She wrote many stories that were printed in popular magazines of the time as well as several books of historical value. Her writings, which helped support her family during times of financial difficulty, were memoirs of her husband's, and her own, time in the American West‚Äîback when the West was an exotic frontier. A great supporter of her husband, who was one of the first two Senators of the new U.S. state of California and a Governor of the Territory of Arizona, she was outspoken on political issues and a determined opponent of slavery, which was excluded from the formation of California. By maintaining a high level of political involvement during a period that was extremely unfavorable for women, Jessie Benton Fr√©mont proved herself to be years ahead of her time. Early life She was born near Lexington, Virginia, the second child of Thomas Hart Benton (1782‚Äì1858) and Elizabeth McDowell (1794‚Äì1854). She was born in the home of her mother's father, James McDowell. Her father, Senator Benton, had been wanting a son, but went ahead and named her in honor of his father, Jesse Benton. Jessie was raised in Washington, D.C., more in the manner of a 19th century son than daughter, with her father, who was renowned as the \\"Great Expansionist,\\" seeing to her early education and introducing her to the leading politicians of the day, an unusual thing for the period. Jessie was very close to her father and stuck by his side. He shared with her the many books and maps in the valise that always accompanied him on their trips to and from Missouri and Virginia. She began, too, to share his dream of a nation stretching from ocean to ocean. In this manner, she became well educated in the ways of social structure and the disciplines of politics, history, literature and languages. After attaining some fluency in French and Spanish, Jessie helped in the translation of government documents. In 1840 at age 16, while studying and living at Georgetown Seminary, she met Lieutenant John C. Fr√©mont who was in Washington preparing a report on explorations (with Joseph Nicollet as commander) he had made between the Missouri River and the northern frontier of the United States. They became engaged, but her parents objected to a marriage at that time because of her age. Probably through the influence of Col. Benton, Fr√©mont then received an order from the war department to make an examination of the Des Moines River on the western frontier. Shortly after their return they were married on October 19, 1841. American West For a while after their marriage, Jessie and her husband lived on Army posts, until Fr√©mont was assigned the task of exploring the West and scouting land for future U.S. territorial expansion. It was this assignment that began the couple's rise to fame. John C. Fr√©mont A reconciliation occurred between Jessie and her father when he promoted Fr√©mont's famous explorations of the West. Senator Benton had been persuaded by his ailing wife to accept the marriage, and the couple moved into the Benton home. Fr√©mont left his pregnant wife behind in the spring of 1842 to lead his first expedition to mark the trails West. He returned, however, days before the birth of their eldest child, Elizabeth Benton \\"Lily\\" Fr√©mont, who was born November 15, 1842, in Washington D.C. He then headed off again and Jessie and the baby remained behind. Fr√©mont became known as the \\"Pathfinder to the West\\", after James Fenimore Cooper's novel, the Pathfinder Jessie, intensely interested in the details of his expedition, became his recorder, making notes as he described his experiences. Adding human-interest touches to these printed reports, she wrote and edited best-selling stories of the adventures Fr√©mont had while exploring the West with his scout, Kit Carson. Thus, she involved herself in her most happy life's work, interpreting her husband and his actions for a public eager for information about the opening of the West. Written during a time when the concept of Manifest Destiny was becoming increasingly popular, these narratives were received with great enthusiasm. Her husband was involved tangentially in the conquest of California, the annexation of which occurred as a result of the Mexican- American War. He served as the 3rd Military Governor, in 1847. At the time of the court-martial of Fr√©mont, during which he attempted to defend his actions in the Bear Flag Revolt, Jessie gave birth to a son, Benton Fr√©mont, on July 24, 1848, in Washington, D.C. The baby's death, within the year in St. Louis, she blamed on her husband's accuser, General Kearny. In 1849, Jessie and Lily made a harrowing and treacherous journey aboard ship to join Fr√©mont in California. After disembarking and crossing the Isthmus of Panama, they boarded another vessel to San Francisco. With income from their gold mines, the Fr√©monts established a home and settled into San Francisco society. As a politically informed woman, Jessie was known to get involved in city politics and discuss with the men any issues that were of importance at the time. Political life John C. Fr√©mont served from September 9, 1850, to March 3, 1851, as a Senator from California. Their third child, John C. Fr√©mont Jr., was born on April 19, 1851, at Las Mariposas, California. While the couple was visiting Paris, France, their fourth child, Anne Beverly Fr√©mont, was born on February 1, 1853. Anne died five months later, on July 11, in Washington, D.C. Their fifth and final child, Francis Preston Fr√©mont, was born on May 17, 1855, in Washington. In 1856, Fr√©mont's antislavery position was instrumental in his being chosen as the first-ever Republican candidate for President. Jessie played an extremely active role in the campaign, rallying support for her husband. One particular campaign slogan read, \\"Fr√©mont and Jessie too.\\" Her father, however, a lifelong Democrat, refused to endorse her husband's bid for the presidency. This did not stop the supporters of Fr√©mont from continuing to refer to her as the \\"first lady in the land,\\" a title her admirers continued to use throughout her life. Fr√©mont garnered many Northern votes, but ultimately lost the election to James Buchanan, though he did surpass the American Party candidate, Millard Fillmore. Fr√©mont was unable to carry the state of California. If he had taken the state of Pennsylvania he would have won. In the years following, the couple moved several times, living in California, St. Louis, and New York. She played an active role in the anti- Secession movement in California in 1861Whitewashing Civil War History Hollis Robbins and enlisted both Unitarian minister Thomas Starr King and writer Bret Harte to her crusade. When Lincoln appointed Fr√©mont as the Commander of the Department of the West in 1861, they returned to St. Louis. Jessie Fr√©mont served as her husband's unofficial aide and closest adviser. The two shared the belief that St. Louis was unprepared for war and needed reinforcements and supplies, and both pressured Washington to send more supplies and troops. She threw herself into the war effort, helping to organize a Soldier's Relief Society in St. Louis, and becoming very active in the Western Sanitary Commission, which provided medicine and nursing to soldiers injured in the war. One of the most impressive feats of her political career came shortly after Fr√©mont lost his position during the Civil War for issuing his own edict of emancipation, summarily freeing all of the slaves in Missouri, which antedated Lincoln's own Emancipation Proclamation. Jessie actually traveled to Washington and pleaded with Lincoln on behalf of her husband, but to no avail. Later years Fr√©mont sitting at home in Los Angeles The Fr√©monts would not live in St. Louis again, moving to New York and then California. In the Panic of 1873, John C. Fr√©mont, who had invested heavily in railroad stock, lost everything and declared bankruptcy. Undaunted by their financial situation, Jessie began writing books to help support the family, namely A Year of American Travel: Narrative of Personal Experience (1878), a story about her journey to California in 1849, and Souvenirs of My Time (1887). From 1878 to 1881, John C. Fr√©mont served as Governor of the Territory of Arizona. Three months after being allowed to resign from the Army with pension, he died in 1890 in a hotel in New York. After the death of her husband, the Congress, in recognition of his valued services, granted Jessie a widow's pension of $2,000 a year. In 1891, she moved into a home at the corner of 28th and Hoover Streets in Los Angeles, that was presented to her by a committee of ladies of the city as a token of their great regard.New York Times, July 26, 1891, from the Los Angeles Express, July 14, \\"Mrs. Fr√©mont's New Home --- She Occupies The House Given To Her By California Ladies,\\" p. 15Los Angeles Times, August 15, 1897, \\"Mrs. Jessie Benton Fr√©mont --- An Historic Figure Now Living Among the Roses of Los Angeles,\\" p. 16 She remained in good health until about two and a half years before her death when an accident made her an invalid, but she was able to use a wheelchair and enjoy the outdoors.

Lion-baiting is a blood sport involving the baiting of lions. Antiquity Alexander the Great Antiquity has examples where groups of dogs defeats even the 'King of Beasts', the lion. Greek legend reflects Achilles' shield with the depiction of a fight of his dog against two lions. A second is a Persian King Kambyses possessed a dog that started a fight with two full-grown lions. A third, is reported by a Roman historian, Claudius Aelianus, in which he states Indians showed Alexander the Great powerful dogs bred for lion-baiting. Certainly, ancient historians would embellish and exaggerate their stories, but they do capture the spirit of dog versus lion. The Roman Empire used to import Barbary lions from North Africa for gladiatorial games. Europe =17th century= In 1610, during the reign of James I of England the practice of lion-baiting was first recorded. The spectacle was staged for the amusement of the court. The King requested Edward Alleyn, Master of the Beargarden, to acquire the three largest and most courageous dogs. The event was as follows: :\\"One of the dogs, which was the first to be sent in the cage, was soon put out of action by the lion, which seized it by the head and neck and dragged it through the cage. A second dog was sent in and met with the same fate. The third, however, which came to its aid, immediately seized the lion by the lower jaw and gripped it securely for a considerable time until, severely injured by the lion's claws, it was forced to loosen its grip. The lion itself was injured in the fight and did not wish to continue fighting. With a sudden mighty leap over the dogs, it fled inside its den. Two of the dogs died shortly after the fight from the injuries they had suffered. The last, however, survived this splendid fight and was nursed back to health with great care by the King's son, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. Prince Henry declared: 'He had fought the king of the wild animals and should never again have to fight baser creatures!' In this way, the dog had gained for itself a safe life at the English Royal court.\\" =18th century= Cane Corsos * In the 18th century, King Frederick I of Sweden was said to have been presented with a \\"very large\\" lion from the Barbary powers, which then killed a bear after the king pitted them together in a fight. * In 1790, The Times reported a lion-baiting in Vienna as follows: :\\"There was a lion fight at the amphitheatre of Vienna, in the summer of 1790, which was almost the last permitted in that capital. The amphitheatre at Vienna embraced an area of from eighty to a hundred feet in diameter. The lower part of the structure comprised the dens of the different animals. Above those dens, and about ten feet from the ground, were the first and principal seats, over which were galleries. In the course of the entertainment, a den was opened, out of which stalked, in free and ample range, a most majestic lion; and, soon after, a fallow deer was let into the circus from another den. The deer instantly fled, and bounded round the circular space, pursued by the lion; but the quick and sudden turnings of the former continually baulked the effort of its pursuer. After this ineffectual chase had continued for several minutes, a door was opened, through which the deer escaped; and presently five or six of the large and fierce Hungarian Mastiffs were sent in. The lion, at the moment of their entrance, was leisurely returning to his den, the door of which stood open. The dogs, which entered behind him, flew towards him in a body, with the utmost fury, making the amphitheatre ring with their barking. When they reached the lion, the noble animal stopped, and deliberately turned towards them. The dogs instantly retreated a few steps, increasing their vociferations, and the lion slowly resumed his progress towards his den. The dogs again approached; the lion turned his head; his adversaries halted; and this continued until, on his nearing his den, the dogs separated, and approached him on different sides. The lion then turned quickly round, like one whose dignified patience could brook the harassment of insolence no longer. The dogs fled far, as if instinctively sensible of the power of wrath they had at length provoked. One unfortunate dog, however, which had approached too near to effect his escape, was suddenly seized by the paw of the lion; and the piercing yells which he sent forth quickly caused his comrades to recede to the door of entrance at the opposite site of the area, where they stood in a row, barking and yelling in concert with their miserable associate. After arresting the struggling and yelling prisoner for a short time, the lion couched upon him with his forepaws and mouth. The struggles of the sufferer grew feebler and feebler, until at length he became perfectly motionless. We all concluded him to be dead. In this composed posture of executive justice, the lion remained for at least ten minutes, when he majestically rose, and with a slow step entered his den, and disappeared. The apparent corpse continued to lie motionless for a few minutes; presently the dog, to his amazement, and that of the whole amphitheatre, found himself alive, and rose with his nose pointed to the ground, his tail between his hind legs pressing his belly, and, as soon as he was certified of his existence, he made off for the door in a long trot, through which he escaped with his more fortunate companions.\\" * J. March's, Zoological Anecdotes, circa 1845, has the story of a second lion-bait, which occurred in Vienna in the year 1791 as follows: :\\"Of late years the truth of the accounts which have been so long current, respecting the generous disposition of the lion, have been called in question. Several travellers, in their accounts of Asia and Africa, describe him as of a more rapacious and sanguinary disposition than had formerly been supposed, although few of them have had the opportunity to make him a particular object of their attention. A circumstance that occurred not long since in Vienna seems, however, to confirm the more ancient accounts. In the year 1791, at which period the custom of baiting wild beasts still existed in that city, a combat was to be exhibited between a lion and a number of large dogs. As soon as the noble animal made his appearance, four large bull-dogs were turned loose upon him, three of which, however, as soon as they came near him, took fright, and ran away. One only had courage to remain, and make the attack. The lion, however, without rising from the ground upon which he was lying, showed him, by a single stroke with his paw, how greatly his superior he was in strength; for the dog was instantly stretched motionless on the ground. The lion drew him towards him, and laid his fore-paws upon him in such a manner that only a small part of his body could be seen. Every one imagined that the dog was dead, and that the lion would soon rise and devour him. But they were mistaken. The dog began to move, and struggled to get loose, which the lion permitted him to do. He seemed merely to have warned him not to meddle with him any more; but when the dog attempted to run away, and had already got half over the enclosure, the lion's indignation seemed to be excited. He sprang from the ground, and in two leaps reached the fugitive, who had just got as far as the paling, and was whining to have it opened for him to escape. The flying animal had called the instinctive propensity of the monarch of the forest into action: the defenceless enemy now excited his pity; for the generous lion stepped a few paces backward, and looked quietly on, while a small door was opened to let the dog out of the enclosure. This unequivocal trait of generosity moved every spectator. A shout of applause resounded throughout the assembly, who had enjoyed a satisfaction of a description far superior to what they had expected. It is possible that the African lion, when, under the impulse of hunger, he goes out to seek his prey, may not so often exhibit this magnanimous disposition; for in that case he is compelled by imperious necessity to satisfy the cravings of nature; but when his appetite is satiated, he never seeks for prey, nor does he ever destroy to gratify a blood-thirsty disposition.\\" =19th century= Ticket to Nero \\"Great Lion Fight\\" In 1825, two more lion fights took place, staged by a promoter named George Wombwell, who travelled around England with his collection of caged wild animals. The fights were arranged in collaboration with dog dealers Ben White and Bill George. The cage measured fifteen feet square, ten feet high, with an elevated floor six feet from the ground. The old iron bars were wide enough apart for a dog to enter or escape. The first bait involved the lion named \\"Nero\\" and the second bait a lion named \\"Wallace\\". Nero The Morning Herald of 26 July 1825, provided the following account: :\\"The lion's travelling caravan was drawn close to the fighting cage, so that the door could be opened from one into the other; and the keeper, Wombwell, then going into the travelling caravan, in which another man had already been staying with the lion for some time, the animal followed him into the cage as tamely as a Newfoundland dog. The whole demeanour of the beast, indeed, was so quiet and generous, that at his first appearance, it became very much doubted whether he would attempt to fight at all. While the multitude shouted and the dogs were yelling in the ground below, he walked up and down his cage with the most perfect composure, not at all angered, or even excited. :In the meantime, Wombwell had quit the cage and the dogs were 'made ready'. These were the fallow-coloured Old English Bulldog, a brown with white legs and a third brown altogether averaging about forty pounds in weight a piece and described in the printed papers, which were distributed by the names 'Captain', 'Tiger' and 'Turk'. As the dogs were held for a minute in slips, upon which they ran from the ground to the stage, the lion crouched on his belly to receive them; but, with so perfect an absence of anything like ferocity, showed clearly that the idea of fighting, or doing mischief to any living creature, never had occurred to him. Nettel was in the second group of dogs set on Nero :At the first rush of the dogs, which the lion evidently had not expected and did not at all know how to meet, they all fixed themselves upon him, but caught only by the dewlap and the mane. With a single effort he shook them off, without attempting to return the attack. He then flew from side to side of the cage, endeavouring to get away; but in the next moment the assailants were upon him again, and the brown dog, Turk, seized him by the nose, while the two others fastened at the same time on the fleshy part of his lips and under-jaw. The lion then roared dreadfully, but evidently only from the pain he suffered, not at all from anger. As the dogs hung to his throat and head, he pawed them off by sheer strength; and in doing this and in rolling upon them, did them considerably mischief; but it amounted to the most curious fact that he never once bit, or attempted to bite, during the whole contest, or seemed to have any desire to retaliate any of the punishment which was inflicted upon him. :When he was first 'pinned', for instance, the dogs hung to him for more than a minute and were drawn, holding to his nose and lips, several times round the ring. After a short time, roaring tremendously, he tore them off with his claws, mauling two a good deal in the operation, but still not attempting afterward to act on the offensive. After about five minutes fighting, the fallow-coloured dog was taken away, lame and apparently much distressed and the remaining two continued the combat alone, the lion still working only with his paws, as though seeking to rid himself of a torture, the nature of which he did not well understand. In two or three minutes more, the second dog, Tiger, being dreadfully maimed, crawled out of the business; not the brown dog, Turk, which was the lightest of the three, but was of admirable courage and went on fighting by himself. :A most extraordinary scene ensued; dog, left entirely alone with an animal twenty time its weight, continued the battle with unabated fury and thought bleeding all over from the effect of the lion's claws, seized and pinned him by the nose at least half a dozen times; when, at length, releasing himself with a desperate effort, the lion flung his whole weight upon the dog and held him lying between his fore paws for more than a minute, during which time he could have bitten his head off a hundred times over, but did not make the slightest effort to hurt him. Poor Turk was then taken away by the dog-keepers, grievously mangled but still alive and seized the lion, for at least the twentieth time, the very same moment that he was released from under him. :The second round of the contest presented only a repetition of the first. However, the second set of dogs being heavier than the first and the lion more exhausted, it became a one-way contest. Nero, bleeding freely from the nose and head, was unable to keep his footing and slipped on the wet boards. The dogs, all three, seized him; the lion endeavoured to get rid of them in the same way as before, using his pawn and not thinking of fighting, but not with the same success. He fell and showed symptoms of weakness, upon which the dogs were taken away. This termination, however, did not please the crowd, who cried out loudly that the dogs were not beaten. :Some confusion then followed; after which the doges were again put in and again seized the lion, which by this time, as well as bleeding freely from the head appeared to have hurt one of this fore feet. Nero weakened rapidly, Mr. Wombwell announced that he gave on the part of the lion; and the exhibition was declared to at an end. The first round lasting eleven minutes with the seconds less than five. From the beginning of the contest to the end, the lion was merely a sufferer; he never struck a blow in anger.\\" Wallace Wallace makes short work of the dogs Wombwell, in the same week, submitted another of his lions to be baited and this match proved to be a very different proposition for the dogs. The Times gave an account of the contest as follows: :\\"Wombwell has, notwithstanding the public indignation which accompanied the exposure of the lion Nero to the six dogs, kept his word with the lovers of cruel sports by a second exhibition. He matched his 'Wallace,' a fine lion, cubbed in Scotland, against six of the best dogs that could be found. Wallace's temper is the very opposite of that of the gentle Nero. It is but seldom that he lets even his feeders approach him, and he soon shows that he cannot reconcile himself to familiarity from any creature not of his own species. Towards eight o'clock the factory-yard was well attended, at 5s. each person, and soon after the battle commenced. The lion was turned from his den to the same stage on which Nero fought. The match was‚Äî1st. Three couples of dogs to be slipped at him, two at a time‚Äî2d. Twenty minutes or more, as the umpires should think fit, to be allowed between each attack‚Äî3d. The dogs to be handed to the cage once only. Tinker, Ball, Billy, Sweep, Turpin, Tiger. :In the first round, Tinker and Ball were let loose, and both made a gallant attack; the lion having waited for them as if aware of the approach of his foes. He showed himself a forest lion, and fought like one. He clapped his paw upon poor Ball, took Tinker in his teeth, and deliberately walked round the stage with him as a cat would with a mouse. Ball, released from the paw, worked all he could, but Wallace treated his slight punishment by a kick now and then. He at length dropped Tinker, and that poor animal crawled off the stage as well as he could. The lion then seized Ball by the mouth, and played precisely the same game with him as if he had actually been trained to it. Ball would have been almost devoured, but his second got hold of him through the bars, and hauled him away. Turpin, a London, and Sweep, a Liverpool dog, made an excellent attack, but it was three or four minutes before the ingenuity of their seconds could get them on. Wallace squatted on his haunches, and placed himself erect at the slope where the dogs mounted the stage, as if he thought they dared not approach. The dogs, when on, fought gallantly; but both were vanquished in less than a minute after their attack. The London dog bolted as soon as he could extricate himself from the lion's grasp, but Sweep would have been killed on the spot, but he was released. Wedgbury untied Billy and Tiger, casting a most piteous look upon the wounded dogs around him. Both went to work. Wallace seized Billy by the loins, and when shaking him, Tiger having run away, Wedgbury cried out, 'There, you see how you've gammoned me to have the best dog in England killed.' Billy, however, escaped with his life; he was dragged through the railing, after having received a mark in the loins, which (if he recovers at all) will probably render him unfit for any future contest. The victory of course was declared in favour of the lion. Several well-dressed women viewed the contest from the upper apartment of the factory.\\" Wallace was the first African lion to be bred in the UK, having been born in Edinburgh in 1812. He was probably named after Scottish fighter William Wallace. He died in 1838, and his stuffed body placed in the museum in Saffron Walden, Essex. When in 1930 Marriott Edgar wrote his humorous monologue The Lion and Albert, he called the lion \\"Wallace\\". =Outrage= The public were outraged at the promotion of such baiting spectacles and the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Wombwell's lion baits were the last to be staged in the United Kingdom.

The Gordon was a conventional two-bay fabric- covered metal biplane. It was powered by variants of the Armstrong Siddeley Panther IIa engine. Armament was one fixed, forward-firing Vickers machine gun and a Lewis Gun in the rear cockpit, plus of bombs. The aircraft was somewhat basic; instruments were airspeed indicator, altimeter, oil pressure gauge, tachometer, turn and bank indicator and compass. Development The Gordon was developed from the IIIF, primarily by use of the new Armstrong Siddeley Panther engine. The prototype was first flown on 3 March 1931, and around 80 earlier IIIFs were converted to a similar standard, 178 new-built aircraft were made for the RAF, a handful of IIIFs being converted on the production line. 154 Mark Is were produced, before production switched to the Mark II with larger fin and rudder; only 24 of these were completed before production switched to the Swordfish. The naval version of the Gordon, used by the Royal Navy, was known as the Seal. Service Fairey G1-34 Mk.II The type had mostly been retired from Royal Air Force and Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm service prior to the Second World War, although No. 6 Squadron RAF, No. 45 Squadron RAF, and No. 47 Squadron RAF, still operated the type in Egypt. Six of these aircraft were transferred to the Egyptian Air Force. 49 Gordons were dispatched to the Royal New Zealand Air Force in April 1939, 41 entering brief service as pilot trainers. The RNZAF found the aircraft worn out and showing signs of their service in the Middle East ‚Äì including at least one scorpion. The last of these ‚Äì and the last intact Gordon anywhere ‚Äì was struck from RNZAF service in 1943. Seven Gordons were adapted to target towing and stationed at No 4 Flying Training School at RAF Habbaniya in Iraq. At the end of April 1941 these aircraft were hastily converted back into bombers, and in early May they took part in the defence of Habbaniya against Iraqi forces threatening and then attacking the School. Survivors The only known survivor is RNZAF Gordon Mark I NZ629, which is under restoration in New Zealand. On 12 April 1940 two trainee pilots Walter Raphael (pilot) and Wilfred Everist (passenger) of 1 Service Flying Training School were flying NZ629 from Wigram on a flight over the Southern Alps on a \\"war-load climb to 15,000 feet\\" training mission. The aircraft entered a spin above the Southern Alps and the crew prepared to bail out, but the aircraft recovered. Moments later it hit trees on top of a ridge on Mount White and flipped backwards down the side of the steep slope, leaving the aircraft hanging in the trees and both Raphael and Everist unconscious. When Raphael regained consciousness he feared the plane would soon catch fire, so he pulled Everist, who was still unconscious, out of the wreckage. Raphael walked to a shearers' hut, carrying Everist who was badly injured. The airframe, minus instruments, guns and engine, was left suspended in trees at the crash site, which is part of a large sheep station. In 1976 it was relocated ‚Äì still largely suspended from trees ‚Äì by Charles Darby, with assistance from Walter Raphael. (Everist had been killed in action over France.) NZ629 was recovered by Aerospatiale Lama. It was stored for more than 20 years before restoration began. As of 2005 the restorers were looking for an engine. As of 2014 they are struggling to raise the funds to get the plane restored.

Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2005. ‚Äì February 12, 2013Dr. Malcom Couch Jr. (1938‚Äì2013)) was the founder and first president of the Tyndale Theological Seminary. He was a pastor, an author of many books, and writer of 40 documentaries on Bible prophecies and biblical issues.Faculty list, Scofield Graduate School & Seminary. While president of Tyndale Theological Seminary Couch recruited some very well known scholars and Bible teachers to teach the student body. Dr. Norman Geisler, Dr. Paige Patterson, Dr. Robert Lightner, Dr. Arnold G. Fruchtenbaum, and Paul Enns were used in the educational endeavors at Tyndale Seminary.1999-2000 Tyndale Seminary Catalog After Dr. Couch retired from Tyndale Seminary he became a Vice President of the Scofield Graduate School and Seminary located in Modesto, California. Couch was part of the Pre-Trib Study Research Group that was founded by Tim LaHaye and Thomas Ice. He was also a member of Tyndale Seminary's Conservative Theological Society.  Education of Mal Couch  Couch earned several degrees. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from John Brown University. Then he earned a Master of Arts from Wheaton College. From there he earned his Masters of Theology degree from Dallas Theological Seminary. While there Couch studied under some of the famous Dallas Dispensationalists like John Walvoord, Charles C. Ryrie, and J.D. Pentecost. He also earned a Doctor of Theology degree from Louisiana Baptist University. He also earned two additional degrees beyond his ThD with a D.D. and Philosophy Doctorate from Arkansas Biblical Graduate School. As a teacher, he taught at various colleges and seminaries throughout his career. He taught at Philadelphia College of the Bible (Now CAIRN University), Moody Bible Institute, and Dallas Theological Seminary. He founded Tyndale Theological Seminary and led as its president until his retirement. He then served as Vice President of Scofield Theological Seminary as he worked with various students he mentored through various academic degrees.  Theology of Mal Couch  Dr. Couch held to the full inspiration and inerrancy of Scripture. He wrote \\"God Has Spoken: Inspiration and Inerrancy\\" to express this conviction. Couch affirmed an epistemological foundation that shows that the ultimate authority is sacred scripture. Mal's colleague Dr. Norman Geisler calls these two truths, inspiration and inerrancy, \\"epistemological fundamentals\\" which are \\"tests of evangelical veracity.\\"Norman Geisler, Systematic Theology, Vol. Four: Church & Last Things (Bloomington MN: Bethany House Publishers, 2005), 566. Dr. Couch tenaciously held to the full, absolute, and errorless book known as the Holy Bible. Coupling that truth of inspiration and inerrancy Mal embraced along with its subsequent application of a historical grammatical interpretation methodology (plain or literal interpretation), Mal understood that faith would naturally lead the saint towards the other great truths about sin, Christ, redemption, love, and grace. His loyalty to the Word revealed his loyalty to Christ Jesus. We cannot in one sentence claim to believe the Bible as truth and yet then interpret it in such a way that we undermine the very words used by God to convey his heart and mind to us. To do so reveals immaturity at the least and at most possibly hypocrisy.Keith Sherlin, \\"Preface,\\" in Evangelical Bible Doctrine: Articles in Honor of Dr. Mal Couch, eds. Kenny Rhodes and Keith Sherlin (Bloomington Indiana, Authorhouse, 2015). Therefore, Dr. Couch taught that believers must not only base our belief on the Bible but they must also make sure to interpret that Bible with a proper hermeneutic, which for him has been the historical grammatical hermeneutic that he presented in his book \\"An Introduction to Classical Hermeneutics: A Guide to the History and Practice of Biblical Interpretation.\\" Mal's colleague Dr. Norman Geisler calls this the \\"hermeneutical fundamentals\\" which is a \\"test for \\"evangelical consistency.\\" Couch also labored in love to show God's sovereignty in both creation and re- creation with his various lectures and teachings. Mal has shown not only God's work in the past with creation,Mal recruited two scholars to write about the original Creation in his book: \\"The Fundamentals of the Twenty-First Century.\\" Jobe Martin wrote chapter five: \\"The Reliability and Historicity of the Biblical Creation Account,\\" and Henry Morris wrote chapter 6: \\"The Fall, the Curse, and a Groaning World.\\" the present in salvation and sanctification, but he has also faithfully pointed us to the future restoration where Christ will return to rule and reign as King. Throughout his numerous books he has edited or written, such as the \\"21st Century Biblical Commentary Series,\\" \\"The New Covenant\\" and \\"My Eyes Shall See the King,\\" along with \\"The Coming of the Holy Spirit\\" people can see the teachings about God's original creation, man's fall into sin, Christ's work of redemption, and the Holy Spirit's work in creating and empowering the body of Christ for the task of the Great Commission. As Mal stated in his own words, \\"The King and kingdom were rejected by the Jewish people. The kingdom would be postponed until some far‚Äîoff future time. Meanwhile, a new dispensation, the Church, would begin\\" and the \\"disciples would then be sent forth, clothed with power from on high\\" so the \\"clear salvation message\\" could be \\"proclaimed 'to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.'\\"Mal Couch, Twenty First Century Biblical Commentary Series: The Gospel of Luke: Christ The Son of Man, ed. Ed Hindson (Chattanooga TN: AMG Publishers, 2006), 237. In teaching about this body of Christ and Christ's future return for the Bride, his spiritual family, Dr. Couch wrote \\"A Biblical Ecclesiology.\\" In that work Mal has laid a solid foundation for all of us to rest upon, as well as to build upon, for future church planting and reformational work of existing churches. This was a practical manual on the church. His book, \\"A Pastor's Manual on Doing Church\\" takes the doctrine of the church and fleshes it out in practical reality. Additionally Couch wrote and edited \\"A Bible Handbook to the Acts of the Apostles\\" so people can go back to Scripture and actually see the first hand principles and patterns of the first disciples of Christ. Too, he labored diligently to warn people about current evils and threats to the family of Christ. Mal's love for people is harnessed around the value, sanctity, and importance of godly family life in both the physical and spiritual realms. His book \\"Issues 2000: Evangelical Faith & Cultural Trends in the New Millennium\\" sets forth a clarion call for people to be aware of ungodly philosophies, the dangers of technology, mysticism, and the social dangers that seek to damage the saint, the body of Christ, and individual families. He warned others often about secular (anti- biblical) psychology, materialism, mysticism, hedonism, evolution, feminism, existentialism, relativism, and Gnosticism as \\"the philosophies destroying Evangelical Churches.\\" Mal also labored with his partner in grace, Lacy Couch. Concurrently working with Mal in those ministry efforts he had a faithful and fruitful ministry with his beloved wife Dr. Lacy Couch. His efforts to seek to cure evils among the body of Christ were also complemented by the efforts of his talented, intelligent, and spiritual wife, who extended the ministry further with her efforts in teaching and biblical counseling ministry to families. Lacy taught with Mal in the seminary and she instilled some of the greatest truths for a healthy spiritual life in her students through her counseling courses. Her courses and lectures on family life, counseling, and other related biblical truths were refreshing and probably somewhat reminiscent of Priscilla in the NT era. In fact, Mal and Lacy's collective ministry serve to remind people of the value and importance of team ministry such as an Aquilla and Priscilla ministry and how a family unit ministry can be a strong antidote to the current evils that plague people today. In fact, together Mal and Lacy seemed to model well the life of a biblical familial patriarchy that opposed not only gender feminism but also male chauvinism. They modeled for the students a pattern that we can imitate today. Mal and Lacy avoided the extremes of male chauvinists who claim women have no place or role in the work of Christian ministry. Yet too they also avoided the opposite extreme of matriarchy/gender-feminism that says women are to have absolute and/or independent rule over the body of Christ. They modeled something like what we read about in the pages of Scripture: a man and woman team ministry. Just as God called Adam and Eve to take dominion over the earth, Mal and Lacy worked collectively to take dominion over their local spheres of influence through their calling to minister as a team. \\\\---- John F.

Throughout the 19th century, Manhattanville bustled around a wharf active with ferry and daily river conveyances. It was the first station on the Hudson River Railroad running north from the city, and the hub of daily stage coach, omnibus and streetcar lines. Situated near the famous Bloomingdale Road, its hotels, houses of entertainment and post office made it an alluring destination of suburban retreat from the city, yet its direct proximity to the Hudson River also made it an invaluable industrial entry point for construction materials and other freight bound for Upper Manhattan. With the construction of road and railway viaducts over the valley in which the town sat, Manhattanville, increasingly absorbed into the growing city, became a marginalized industrial area. In the early 2000s, the neighborhood became the site of a major planned expansion of Columbia University, which has campuses in Morningside Heights to the south and Washington Heights to the north. Manhattanville is part of Manhattan Community District 9, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10027 and 10031. It is patrolled by the 26th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. History =Colonial period and establishment= The village of Manhattanville was founded in 1806 and quickly gained prominence as an outpost of the city. The village grew around the crossroads of Bloomingdale Road and Manhattan Street, now roughly Broadway and 125th Street. The village's original streets were laid out by Jacob Schieffelin and other wealthy merchants, mostly Quakers, who had country seats in the area. The town thrived as a result of the development of Manhattan Street from the Hudson River, whose convenient access also became a crucial catalyst in the growth of the older village of Harlem to the southeast on the Harlem River. Situated at approximately the same latitude, Harlem and Manhattanville flourished together throughout the 19th century as the two most prominent villages in upper Manhattan.Manhattanville forts Manhattanville sits in a valley formerly called Moertje David's Vly (\\"Mother David's Valley\\"; in Dutch, ' is short for ', or \\"valley\\") during the Dutch Colonial period and as Harlem Cove during the English Colonial period. During the American Revolutionary War, the valley was also known as the Hollow Way, where the main action of the Battle of Harlem Heights began under the command of General George Washington. During the War of 1812 the valley's southern ridges figured as the site of the Manhattanville Pass, whose defense fortifications and breastworks included Fort Laight and Blockhouse No. 4,*Fort Laight *Blockhouse No. 4 which became the sites of Morningside Gardens Houses and PS 36, respectively. Daniel F. Tiemann's paint factory Manhattanville's early population was a diverse and eclectic mix of intermarried American patriots and British loyalists; at least one prominent former African slave trader (this seems to be a reference to Michael Hogan, whose wife was of mixed British and Indian ancestry, born in Bombay); slave owners and enslaved African-Americans; Quaker anti-slavery activists and free black abolitionists; tradesmen, poor laborers and wealthy industrialists.Eric K. Washington, Manhattanville, Introduction Many were affiliated with the same institutions, principally the historic New York City landmarked St. Mary's Protestant Episcopal Church, organized in 1823, which was the first Episcopal church to dissolve pew rent in 1831, and the Manhattanville Free School (established in 1827, later Public School No. 43) still at their original sites. Manhattanville's most prominent resident was industrialist Daniel F. Tiemann (1805‚Äì1899), owner of the D. F. Tiemann & Company Color Works, who was also Mayor of New York City from 1858 to 1859. The Tiemann laboratory and factory which was originally located on 23rd Street and Fourth Avenue in Gramercy, near Madison Square Park, relocated uptown to Manhattanville in 1832, in part due to an underground spring of running water at the new uptown location, which is today the site of 560 Riverside Drive.Baptista, Robert J., \\"D.F. Tiemann & Co. Color Works, Manhattanville, New York City\\", Colorants Industry History, July 7, 2009 =Immigration and urbanization= According to Eric K. Washington, ‚ÄúWith Manhattanville‚Äôs formation, the new village quickly became a significant suburban destination along the Bloomingdale Road [today‚Äôs 125th St.]... Manhattanville flourished naturally as a nexus of various transportation arteries.‚ÄùWashington, Manhattanville 9. In the late nineteenth century, Manhattanville experienced a development boom of residential buildings, churches, hospitals, institutional construction, and transportation made it a desirable location for the brewery business. Later noteworthy population changes occurred around the mid-19th century following the opening of the Hudson River Railroad in 1850, with an influx of mostly Catholic Irish (who established the Church of the Annunciation in 1854) and Germans (who established St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in 1860). After the American Civil War, the Jewish immigrant population that began to distinguish itself in Harlem gradually filtered into the western blocks of Manhattanville (and established Chevra Talmud Torah Anshei Marovi, also known as Old Broadway Synagogue, in 1911). Other prominent 19th-century Manhattanville institutions included the Academy of Convent of the Sacred Heart (later called Manhattanville College) and Manhattan College. In 1904, the opening of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)'s new Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line, now part of the on the New York City Subway, galvanized Manhattanville's radical transformation from rural exburb to an extension of the growing city, with the elevated railway providing rapid transit downtown. Cuban, Dominican and Puerto Rican immigrants moved into the area during the 20th century. By the 1970s, the southern part of Manhattanville (up to about 125th Street) was being filled by Columbia and Barnard College students, staff and faculty, as the university continued to expand. West 125th Street has experienced a general economic upturn since the end of the 1990s. Many of the buildings below 125th Street have converted to cooperative ownership as the area experiences continuing gentrification and increasing demand for housing. In collaboration with the community, the city has developed a plan for the 125th Street corridor focusing on reinforcing and building upon its strengths as an arts and cultural corridor. =21st century= University expansions 125th Street station Manhattanville is the site of a planned major expansion of Columbia University. The university purchased several square blocks of the neighborhood between 125thBecause of the dogleg shape of 125th Street on the west side, 125th Street and 129th Street merge, and so only four or five blocks are involved in the tract. and 133rd Streets on the south and north and between Broadway and 12th Avenue on the east side of Broadway from 131 to 134, west of the housing projects. According to the plan, the physical plant of those blocks will be partly demolished to construct a new campus, secondary school and park land, designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano. Local residents feared the impact of the further gentrification from this expansion in addition to the possible, and controversial, use of eminent domain. In 2006, Columbia built a new School of Social Work on Amsterdam Avenue at 122nd Street. In June 2007, the New York City Department of City Planning certified that Columbia's application for the rezoning is complete. This action launched the public review and comment period under the city's Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, which lasted until the end of 2007. In December of the same year, the New York City Council voted to approve Columbia‚Äôs proposed rezoning of the site. Renzo Piano Workshop designed three structures for the Manhattanville Campus; these structure were complete by 2018. Other colleges have been building dormitories in the area as well. To the north, the 589-student dorm The Towers finished construction in June 2006 as an extension of the City College of New York on St. Nicholas Terrace. This is the first time that City College has housed students on the campus. Occupancy began in August 2006. To the south, near 122nd Street, the Manhattan School of Music also built a dormitory around 2003. In 2006, Jewish Theological Seminary of America opened a smaller dormitory on 122nd Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. In August 2009, at 135th Street and Convent Avenue, City College completed the construction of a new School of Architecture and Urban Design building (The Bernard and Anne Spitzer School of Architecture, named after the New York real estate developer and philanthropist, Bernard Spitzer and his wife).From the architects' website\\"The Bernard and Anne Spitzer School of Architecture. New York, New York. Rafael Vi√±oly Architects\\", Architectural Record Based on a pre-existing 1950s structure, the old Cohen Library on South Campus, this redesign and reconstruction by Rafael Vi√±oly Architects is intended to add a modern aesthetic to the eclectic architectural mix in the area. West Harlem Piers West Harlem Piers Construction of the West Harlem Piers Waterfront park began in April 2006, after a groundbreaking ceremony in November 2005. The park, funded by the New York City Economic Development Corporation and designed by W Architecture and Landscape Architecture, includes a fishing pier, a kayak launch, sculptures, and water taxi landings. Stretching from 125th Street to 132nd Street, partly on land formerly used as a parking lot, it is one of a series of contemporary landscape architecture projects (including the High Line and Brooklyn Bridge Park) that reclaim obsolete infrastructure as public space. It closed a gap in the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway that runs along the western side of Manhattan Island and will later connect up the Hudson River. The park opened in early October 2008, delayed through the summer by the discovery that fencing designed to prevent users from falling into the river did not meet specifications.Daniel Amsallag, Construction Snag Delays Pier Opening, Columbia Daily Spectator, September 15, 2008 The area that surrounds the park and piers is at times called ViVa (Viaduct Valley). Arts and nightlife Croton Gatehouse Artistic revitalization continued in October 2006 when The Gatehouse Theater opened as an additional facility of Aaron Davis Hall,From the Aaron Davis Hall website a venue specializing in dance. It was built by rehabilitating a former 19th century Croton Aqueduct building at 135th St and Convent Avenue. Upon completion, both Aaron Davis Hall and the Gatehouse Theater evolved to share a common name, Harlem Stage. Demographics Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Manhattanville was 22,950, a decrease of 1,822 (7.4%) from the 24,772 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012. Accessed June 16, 2016. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 7.5% (1,710) White, 25.8% (5,918) African American, 0.3% (77) Native American, 2.2% (496) Asian, 0.0% (5) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (76) from other races, and 1.1% (255) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 62.8% (14,413) of the population.Table PL-P3A NTA: Total Population by Mutually Exclusive Race and Hispanic Origin - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, March 29, 2011. Accessed June 14, 2016. The most significant changes in the racial composition of Manhattanville were the increase in the White population by 234% (1,710), the decrease in the Black population by 22% (1,656), and the decrease in the Latino population by 9% (1,508). The Asian population also increased by 75% (212) but remained a small minority, and the very small population of all other races decreased by 14% (68). The entirety of Community District 9, which encompasses Manhattanville. Morningside Heights, and Hamilton Heights, had 111,287 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 81.4 years. This is about the same as the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most residents are children and middle-aged adults: 34% are between the ages of 25‚Äì44, while 21% are between 45‚Äì64, and 17% are between 0‚Äì17. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 16% and 12% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 9 was $50,048, though the median income in Manhattanville individually was $41,453. In 2018, an estimated 24% of Community District 9 residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twelve residents (8%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 51% in Community District 9, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Community District 9 is considered to be gentrifying: according to the Community Health Profile, the district was low- income in 1990 and has seen above-median rent growth up to 2010. Sites of interest = Historic religious institutions = Four of Manhattanville‚Äôs houses of worship are historically distinguished. * St. Mary‚Äôs Protestant Episcopal Church on West 126th Street (formerly Lawrence Street), organized in 1823, was the only church in the district (indeed, in the entire Harlem territory with the exception of the Dutch Reformed Church on the East Side) in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. Its present stone building, built in 1908‚Äì1909 by T. E. Blake and the architectural firm of Carrere & Hastings, is the church‚Äôs second structure on same site of the church's original wood frame structure, built in 1824 and consecrated in 1826. In 1831, St. Marys was the first church in the Episcopal Diocese to abolish pew rentals. The marble seal inlaid into the church porch of \\"Jacob Schieffelin's Vault\\", the burial vault in which Jacob Schieffelin and his wife Hannah Lawrence Schieffelin (who were the church's land donors as well as Manhattanville's principal founders) are interred, is clearly visible to passersby. Today St. Mary's is the oldest congregation in continuous service on its original site in the entire Harlem area. In 1998, the complex of church, its adjacent frame parish house (circa 1851) and brick school building (1890) were officially designated a New York City landmark. * Church of the Annunciation (Roman Catholic) on Convent Avenue and West 131st Street, founded in 1854, was the first Catholic church to be built on Manhattan's west side above 2nd Street, and ministered particularly to the Irish Catholic laborers on the Hudson River Railroad. The Christian Brothers established the church building adjacent to Manhattan College, at 131st Street and the Bloomingdale Road (Old Broadway). The Brothers subsequently sold the adjoining church and rectory sites to John Hughes, the first Catholic Archbishop of New York. The present stone building, built in 1906‚Äì1907 by the architectural firm of Lynch & Orchard, is the church's second structure, to which the congregation moved from two blocks east in 1907. * Church of St. Joseph of the Holy Family, founded in 1860 as the Church of the Holy Family by Manhattanville's German Catholic community at the northwest corner of 125th Street and Morningside Avenue. A 100th anniversary souvenir history in 1960 noted: \\"While the construction of the church was going on . . . on May 30, of the year 1861 was celebrated what was probably the first public Corpus Christi procession in New York City.\\" Manhattanville historian John J. Hopper mentions this church in his circa 1920 reminiscences as \\"the German Catholic Church at Ninth Avenue, which my father [Isaac A. Hopper] built\\" during his boyhood on Manhattan Street from 1853 to 1865. (Although the AIA guide attributes the church‚Äôs architecture to the Herter Brothers in 1889, the incorrect building date was probably confused that of the St. Joseph R.C. School building around the corner at 168 Morningside Avenue). David Dunlap cites this church in his book, Glory in Gotham: Manhattan‚Äôs Houses of Worship, as the oldest church [building] in Harlem. * Old Broadway Synagogue, an Orthodox Jewish synagogue incorporated in 1911 under the name Chevra Talmud Torah Anshei Marovi, was built on Old Broadway (a rare vestige on Manhattan island of the Bloomingdale Road) by the architectural firm of Meisner & Uffner in 1923. The congregation formed from the mostly Ashkenazic Jewish population of Russian and Polish immigrants to New York during the 1880s who had made their way up to Central Harlem, then migrated to blocks west. The building is listed individually on the National Register of Historic Places. = Other sites of interest = Former Claremont Theatre Aside from Grant's Tomb, Riverside Church and the Manhattan School of Music near the southwestern corner, the principal landmarks in Manhattanville are the IRT Broadway Line and Riverside Drive Viaducts. Within the neighborhood is the Manhattanville Houses, a 1,272-unit development of the New York City Housing Authority, which opened in 1961. Designed in the international towers in the park style by noted Swiss-born architect William Lescaze, the development was initially created to house middle income residents. The neighborhood also contains the landmarked neo- Renaissance Claremont Theatre where Thomas Edison once shot a short film in 1915 featuring the building's entrance,Grace, Matthew, \\"New Landmark Designation: Claremont Theater\\", The New York Observer, June 7, 2006 (archived 2006)\\"Claremont Theatre: NY 1915 Thomas Edison\\", Library of Congress, film archives.

In Riverside Park, north of Grant's Tomb, is the site of the former Claremont Inn, a riverside respite and hotel for the affluent back in its heyday. It was originally built around 1775 as a private mansion and estate. By the end of the 19th century it was bought by the city of New York and leased to a hotelier. There was also a place to rent bicycles at the inn. It had a serious fire in the 1940s which caused its demise. A plan was in the making for a reuse of the inn and restaurant and grounds when yet a final fire caused its closing in 1951.

In the battle, a Theban army under Pelopidas was challenged by a substantially larger Spartan force while retreating from an abortive attack on Orchomenus, but successfully attacked and routed the Spartans. The battle marked the first occasion in the historical record in which a Spartan force had been defeated by a numerically inferior enemy in a set battle (as opposed to irregular warfare, employed by Iphicrates).Diodorus Siculus, Library 15.81.2 Prelude After an insurrection in 379/8 BC removed Spartan control over Thebes, the city set about reestablishing its control over the Boeotian League. Over several years of campaigning, the Thebans succeeded in driving Spartan garrisons out of every city in Boeotia but Orchomenus.Fine, The Ancient Greeks, 565-566 In 376 BC, Pelopidas, learning that the Spartan garrison of Orchomenus had gone on an expedition to Locris, set out with the Sacred Band of Thebes and a small force of cavalry, intending to seize the city while it was unguarded. As the Thebans approached the city, however, they learned that a sizable force had been dispatched from Sparta to reinforce the Orchomenus' garrison, and was approaching the city. Accordingly, Pelopidas retreated with his force, but before the Thebans could reach safety at Tegyra, they met the original Spartan garrison returning from Locris. Battle Map of ancient Boeotia showing the location of the city of Orchomenus The Theban force was heavily outnumbered by the Spartans opposite them. The Sacred Band numbered some 300 hoplites, while the Spartan garrison consisted of two companies, meaning that the Spartan force contained between 1,000 and 1,800 hoplites. Plutarch reports that one Theban soldier, upon seeing the enemy force, said to Pelopidas \\"We are fallen into our enemies' hands,\\" to which Pelopidas replied \\"And why not they into ours?\\" Pelopidas then ordered the Theban cavalry to charge while the infantry formed up into an abnormally dense formation. When the two phalanxes came together, the compact Theban formation broke through the Spartan line at the point of contact, then turned to attack the vulnerable flanks of the Spartans to either side. The Spartan force broke and fled, although the Theban pursuit was limited by the proximity of Orchomenus.All details about the battle are taken from the only extant description, in Plutarch, Life of Pelopidas Significance The Theban victory at Tegyra had little immediate military significance, beyond the survival of Pelopidas's force; the Spartan force, once regrouped within Orchomenus, was far too formidable for Pelopidas to press his advantage. Despite this fact, the victory was a symbolically significant event for both sides. Diodorus Siculus records that the victory at Tegyra marked the first time the Thebans had erected a trophy of victory over a Spartan force‚Äîfor while the Thebans had defeated the Spartans before, these victories had generally been in much smaller skirmishes.Diodorus Siculus, Library 15.81.2 For the Spartans, on the other hand, their defeat at Tegyra marked the first occasion on which one of their formations had been defeated by a force of equal or lesser size in set battle. For these reasons, Plutarch saw in Pelopidas' victory at Tegyra a \\"prelude to Leuctra\\", with the limited victory in 375 anticipating the day 4 years later when a similarly outnumbered Theban phalanx would deal Sparta a blow from which it would never recover.

The band was formed in 1992 by keyboardist/drummer, Jeff Hillard (a.k.a. Chillard) and keyboardist/vocalist Jason Whitcomb. Their music featured an abrasive industrial-dance sound, with funky, grind-hop drum loops overlain by harsh vocals and thought-provoking audio samples from various movies and documentaries. Their lyrics focused mostly on the issues of racism and mass media. N.A.P. released their first album Gesticulate in 1993 with bassist and pianist Dan Bates on the now defunct General Purpose Cassettes (G.P.C.) label. The electronic music was composed and sequenced with an Ensoniq EPS 16+ digital sampler. Additional sounds were taken from a Roland Juno-106 analog synthesizer. The G.P.C. label usually sold merchandise with unusual packaging, as such, the Gesticulate CD was a limited-edition release with an aluminum foil cover and screen-printed artwork. The cassette tape version was sold in a metal can. There were two different versions of the CD cover printed. The band's second release was 9mm Grudge in 1994 on the California-based Re-Constriction recording label. It was more guitar driven, however much of it was sampled including a riff from Van Halen appearing in a song. Five years later, Broadcast-Quality Belligerence was released. This marked a change in production with a shift to PC based recording software instead of their previous \\"Live Take\\" approach via DAT. This also appears to be the band's final commercial release. Newer material was released on their MP3.com page until the site changed formats.

According to CEDP, \\"Abolition will not come from the desks of local politicians or the power brokers in Washington, whose lives have likely never been touched by the death penalty and whose careers have often been bolstered by it. Abolition can only come from organizing within communities and from people demanding a change.\\"  Overview  CEDP has chapters in California, Texas, Delaware, New York, and Chicago. it has a staff of five. It was founded in 2004 and is based in Chicago. CEDP is a member of the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty. Its national board includes Yusuf Salaam, one of the since-exonerated Central Park 5, whose death was publicly urged by Donald Trump in 1989. CEDP gained prominence in attempting to save Stan \\"Tookie\\" Williams, who was executed in California on December 13, 2005, after being denied clemency by governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Previously, the CEDP was heavily involved in defending Kevin Cooper, a California inmate who was granted a new trial on the day he was scheduled to be executed, as well as Chicago's Death Row 10, death row inmates who the CEDP claims were sentenced on the basis of confessions extracted by police torture. Four of the Death Row 10 were pardoned in 2002 by then-Illinois governor George Ryan, who also emptied the state's death row in a mass commutation of sentences. The organization also opposes life imprisonment without parole. In 2016 CEDP surveyed death row inmates on their views of two California ballot measures, Propositions 62 and 66. Unsurprisingly, the inmates opposed Proposition 66, which calls for the speed-up of executions in California. However, inmates also opposed Proposition 62, since it enforces life imprisonment without parole, which is characterized by inmates, according to CEDP director Lilly Hughes, as \\"just a death sentence with a different name.\\" CEDP publishes a newsletter, The New Abolitionist.

Most product certification bodies (or product certifiers) are accredited to or aligned with ISO/IEC 17065 Conformity assessment -- Requirements for bodies certifying products, processes and services (previously ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996)ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996 an international standard for ensuring competence in those organizations performing product, process and service certifications. The organizations that perform this accreditation are called Accreditation Bodies, and they themselves are assessed by international peers against the ISO 17011 standard.ISO/IEC 17011:2017. Examples of some certification schemes include the Safety Equipment Institute for protective headgear, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Telecommunication Certification Body (TCB) program for radio communication devices, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star program, the International Commission on the Rules for the Approval of Electrical Equipment Product Safety Certification Body Scheme (IEECE CB Scheme), MAS (Materials Analytical Services) Certified Green IEQ program, and the Greenguard Environmental Institute Indoor Air Quality program. Certification schemes are typically written to include both the performance test methods that the product must be tested to, as well as the criteria that the product must meet to become Certified.ISO/IEC Guide 28:2004 Certifications (and the certificates that document their existence) are often called \\"certs\\" in the everyday jargon of various industries. Certification process A product might be verified to comply with a specification or stamped with a specification number. This does not, by itself, indicate that the item is fit for any particular use. The person or group of persons who own the certification scheme (i.e., engineers, trade unions, building code writers, government, industry, etc.) have the responsibility to consider the choice of available specifications, choose the correct ones, set qualification limits, and enforce compliance with those limits. The end users of the product have the responsibility to use the item correctly. Products must be used in accordance with their listing for certification to be effective. Product certification is often required in sensitive industry and marketplace areas where a failure could have serious consequences, such as negatively affecting the health and welfare of the people or person using that product. For example, certification is stringent in aerospace applications, since the demands for low weight tend to lead to high stress on components, requiring appropriate metallurgy and accuracy in manufacturing. Other sensitive product area examples include food, pharmaceuticals, healthcare products, dangerous goods, electrical equipments and products that have RF emissions such as computers and cellular telephones. The process for certification of a product is generally summed up in four steps: * Application (including testing of the product) * Evaluation (does the test data indicate that the product meets qualification criteria) * Decision (does a second review of the product application concur with the Evaluation) * Surveillance (does the product in the marketplace continue to meet qualification criteria) In many instances, prior to applying for certification, a product supplier will send a product to a testing laboratory (some certification schemes require the product to be sent out for testing by the product certifier instead). When the product to be certified is received at the testing laboratory, it is tested in accordance with the laboratory's internal procedures and with the methods listed in the test standards specified by the certification scheme. The resulting data collected by the testing laboratory, and is then forwarded either back to the manufacturer, or directly to the product certifier. The product certifier then reviews the product supplier's application information, including the testing data. If the certifier's evaluation concludes that the test data shows that the product meets all required criteria as listed in the certification scheme, and the decision maker(s) of the product certifier concur with the evaluation, then the product is deemed \\"certified\\" and is listed in a directory that the Product certifier is required to keep. ISO Guide 65 requires that the final decision to grant or not grant certification be made only by a person or group of persons not involved in the evaluation of the product. Products often need periodic recertification, also known as surveillance. This requirement is typically identified within the certification scheme that the product is certified to. Certification bodies may require product suppliers to perform some sort of surveillance activity, such as pulling sample products from the marketplace for testing,EPA ENERGY STAR Program, Conditions and Criteria for Recognition of Certification Bodies, Section 3 FCC Telecommunication Certification Body (TCB) Program Roles and Responsibilities, Section 23 in order to maintain their \\"listed\\" or \\"certified\\" status. Other examples of Surveillance activities include surprise audits of the manufacturing plant, supervision of the manufacturing and/or testing process,IECEE OD-2029-Ed.1.2 or a simple paperwork submittal from the supplier to the product certifier to ensure that the certified product has not changed. Other causes for recertification may include complaints issued against the product's functionality, which would require removal from the marketplace, and expiration of the original certification. These lists of examples are by no means all inclusive. Some certification schemes, or the product certifiers that operate those Schemes, may require that the product supplier operate a Quality Management System registered to ISO 9000, or that the testing be performed by a laboratory accredited to ISO 17025.ISO/IEC 17025:2005 The decision to set these requirements is most often made by the person or group which owns the Certification Scheme. Certification marks and listings of certified products Certified products are typically endorsed with a certification mark provided by the product certifier. Issuance of a certification mark is at the discretion of the individual product certifier. ISO Guide 65 does not require the product certifier to offer a certification mark in the event that a certificate is offered. When certification marks are issued and used on products, they are usually easy to see and enable users to track down the certification listings to determine the criteria that the product meets, and whether or not the listing is still active. An active certification listing must minimally include indication of the following information: * The specific product or type of product certified * The qualification standard that the product is judged to meet * The date of certification (and if applicable, its expiration) Product certifiers may choose to include much more information than that listed above, but ISO Guide 65 specifies the bare minimum which must be made available regarding the certification status of a product. These listings are typically used by an Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), such as a municipal building inspector, fire prevention officer, or electrical inspector, to compare the product's use or installation with the intent of the rating by testing. In order to comply with the code, the product listing must be \\"active\\", as products and companies can become \\"de-listed\\" due to re-testing showing that a product no longer meets qualification criteria, or a business decision by the manufacturer. The widespread availability of the Internet has led to a new kind of certification for websites. Website certifications exist to certify the website's privacy policy, security of their financial transactions, suitability for minors, among many other acceptability characteristics. In broadcast engineering, transmitters and radio antennas often must by certified by the country's broadcasting authority. In the United States, this certification was once called \\"type acceptance\\" by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and applied to most services except amateur radio due to its inherent homebrew nature. Today the FCC requires all testing of transmitters and antennas to be performed in a laboratory accredited to ISO 17025, with that laboratory being part of the overall organization that houses the Product Certification Body (TCB). Accreditation bodies The International Accreditation Forum (IAF) has a listing of all recognized Accreditation Bodies whose accreditations to the ISO Guide 65 standard are deemed equivalent. From the IAF MLA informational page: :\\"IAF is encouraging more of its members to join the MLA as soon as they have passed a rigorous evaluation process to ensure that their accreditation programs are of world standard. The consequence of joining the IAF MLA is that conformity assessment certificates issued, within the scope of the IAF MLA, by conformity assessment bodies accredited by any one of the members of the IAF MLA will be recognised in the world wide IAF program.\\" Most countries only have a single Accreditation Body representing their economy in the IAF MLA. The two exceptions are the United States with American National Standards Institute (ANSI), American National Standards Institute - American Society for Quality National Accreditation Board (ANAB, a subdivision of ANSI), American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA), and International Accreditation Service (IAS) as signatory members, and United Accreditation Foundation as Full Member of IAF (International Accreditation Forum) Europe with Germany's Technischer √úberwachungsverein (T√úV), and Korea which is represented by Korea Accreditation Board (KAB) and Korean Accreditation System (KAS). These listings are current as of March 2012, but will likely change in the future as more Accreditation Bodies undergo the required peer evaluations in order to become signatory members of the MLA. Each Accreditation Body is required to keep a listing of those organizations it accredits, as well as a Scope of Accreditation which details the activities that the organizations can perform, whether that be testing, inspection, or product certification. Accreditation Bodies routinely audit the Product Certifiers whom they have accredited in order to determine if the performance or actions of the organization have changed and do not meet the requirements of the Accreditation Body and the International Standards they are to conform to. It is not mandatory for each Accreditation Bodies to be member of IAF or to join IAF in any manner, there have been several accreditation Board like AB-CAB, ESMA, NACI etc. European Economic Area Within the European Economic Area (EEA), the majority of products are required to be ‚ÄòCE Marked‚Äô and will have the letter CE on them. It shows that the manufacturer or importer has checked that these products meet EU safety, health or environmental requirements; is an indicator of a product‚Äôs compliance with EU legislation and allows the free movement of products within the European market. By placing the CE marking on a product, a manufacturer or importer is declaring, on his sole responsibility, conformity with all of the legal requirements to achieve CE marking. The manufacturer is thus ensuring validity for that product to be sold throughout the EEA. This also applies to products made in third countries which are sold in the EEA and Turkey. If you are a manufacturer it is your responsibility to: * carry out the conformity assessment (including any testing, if required) * set up the technical file * issue the EC Declaration of Conformity (DoC) * place CE marking on a product If you are a distributor you must check the presence of both the CE marking and the necessary supporting documentation. If you are importing a product that is from a third country you have to check that the manufacturer outside the EU has undertaken the necessary steps. You must check that the documentation is available. The Europa website gives details various product categories and the relevant EU directives to which products must conform. International applications North America's nuclear industry is exempt from mandatory certification. This has allowed situations leading to remedial work such as for fireproofing of electrical circuits (circuit integrity) between nuclear reactor and control rooms in the U.S. In this case, submitors were permitted to dictate not only their test procedures, but also to construct test specimens in their own facilities, prior to fire tests on the part of laboratories. The primary example of this situation is the Thermo-Lag scandal, which came about as a result of disclosures by whistleblower Gerald W. Brown to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as well as watchdog groups, members of US Congress, and the press. In Germany, the accredited testing organizations routinely audit manufacturing locations and submit quality control test results to DIBt. While the German laboratories do not possess process standards, their methodology can uncover changes in the nature and quality of ingredients, as DIBt establishes very clear tolerances for performance.

It is flanked by the Mediterranean Sea in the region of Corniche Jijelienne and had a population of 131,513 in 2008. Jijel is the administrative and trade center for a region specialising in cork processing, leather tanning and steelmaking. Local crops include citrus and grain. Fishing is also of great importance. Tourists (mainly Algerians) are attracted to Jijel for its landscapes and fine sand beaches. Being a resort town, there are many hotels and restaurants. There are Phoenician tombs nearby. Geography and ecology Jijel is situated 30 km from Taza National Park; this national park and other vicinity features support a variety of flora and fauna. In particular, the Taza National Park is habitat for the endangered Barbary macaque, Macaca sylvanus; moreover, this primate prehistorically had a much broader distribution than at present.C. Michael Hogan. 2008 History Igilgili originally Phoenician, the city passed to the Carthaginians, the Roman Republic and Empire, the Vandals, the Byzantines, the Umayyads, the Genovese, and the Ottomans. It was conquered for the last in the 16th century by Hayreddin Barbarossa. In July 1664, the French took the city. Resistance was organised under the direction of Shaban Aga and the French were driven out in October of the same year. Jijel remained a corsair stronghold until recaptured by the French in 1839. Strong local resistance, finally subdued in 1851, resulted in the construction of three forts along its southern fringe as well as minimal colonisation. The original town was devastated by an earthquake in 1856. Communications Due to the rugged landscape, Jijel is slightly isolated. However, it is connected by road to large cities like Beja√Øa (90 km west), Setif (135 km southwest) and Constantine (150 km southeast). The city also has its own airport Jijel Ferhat Abbas Airport. Infrastructure Jijel is built along modern patterns with wide streets framed by trees. The surroundings consist largely of dense cork-oak forest. A peninsula lies right out from the coast and there is a citadel to the north. There is a hospital, previously a Catholic church (which was demolished), mosques and University of Jijel. Port A relatively new port has been built at Djen Djen,Enterprise Portuaire de Djen Djen. 2009 approximately 7 miles east of Jijel, which can handle large bulk carriers having a draft up to 18.2m. Presently, the port is mainly used by car carriers and break bulk vessels.

It is located on the river Schmiecha, a left-hand tributary of the Danube, south of T√ºbingen and west of Ulm.  History  Ebingen received city rights around 1250 from the Hohenberg ducal family. In 1367 it became a part of the kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. In the early 20th century, it was known for manufacturing velvet and cotton-velvet (Manchester) goods, stockings, stays, hats, needles, tools and tanneries. In 1975 Ebingen joined 8 other towns in the area to form the city of Albstadt. Current population is at 18,700, with all of Albstadt having around 45,000 inhabitants.  Economy  Most of the textiles industry is gone today, leaving some monuments, like Villa Haux. However, one of the world's biggest makers of industrial needles, Groz-Beckert still resides there. Other prominent local companies include Mey (knitwear), Mettler Toledo (weighing systems) and a major part of Assa Abloy security systems (Eff-Eff Brand). Ebingen also hosts the technical and computer science faculties of Albstadt-Sigmaringen University with about 3,000 students (2014).

It has a cosmopolitan distribution in tropical areas, and is found in southern Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Australia, where it grows in woodlands and gardens in rich soil and well-rotted woody material. The fruit body of the fungus is characterised by a conical to bell- shaped cap on a stalk and a delicate lacy \\"skirt\\", or indusium, that hangs from beneath the cap and reaches nearly to the ground. First described scientifically in 1798 by French botanist √âtienne Pierre Ventenat, the species has often been referred to a separate genus Dictyophora along with other Phallus species featuring an indusium. P. indusiatus can be distinguished from other similar species by differences in distribution, size, color, and indusium length. Mature fruit bodies are up to tall with a conical to bell- shaped cap that is wide. The cap is covered with a greenish-brown spore- containing slime, which attracts flies and other insects that eat the spores and disperse them. An edible mushroom featured as an ingredient in Chinese haute cuisine, it is used in stir-frys and chicken soups. The mushroom, grown commercially and commonly sold in Asian markets, is rich in protein, carbohydrates, and dietary fiber. The mushroom also contains various bioactive compounds, and has antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Phallus indusiatus has a recorded history of use in Chinese medicine extending back to the 7th century AD, and features in Nigerian folklore. Taxonomic history Phallus indusiatus was initially described by French naturalist √âtienne Pierre Ventenat in 1798, and sanctioned under that name by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801. One author anonymously gave his impressions of Ventenat's discovery in an 1800 publication: > This beautiful species, which is sufficiently characterised to distinguish > it from every other individual of the class, is copiously produced in Dutch > Guiana, about 300 paces from the sea, and nearly as far from the left bank > of the river of Surinam. It was communicated to me by the elder > Vaillant,Father of the more famous Fran√ßois Levaillant, explorer and > ornithologist, the elder Levaillant was a merchant of Metz who served as > French consul in Dutch Guiana until 1763. who discovered it in 1755 on some > raised ground which was never overflowed by the highest tides, and is formed > of a very fine white sand, covered with a thin stratum of earth. The > prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at the same > time, the very different periods of their expansion, the brilliancy and the > varied shades of their colours, present a prospect truly picturesque. The fungus was later placed in a new genus, Dictyophora, in 1809 by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux; it was then known for many years as Dictyophora indusiata. Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck placed the species in Hymenophallus in 1817, as H. indusiatus. Both genera were eventually returned to synonyms of Phallus and the species is now known again by its original name. Curtis Gates Lloyd described the variety rochesterensis in 1909, originally as a new species, Phallus rochesterensis. It was found in Kew, Australia. A form with a pink-coloured indusium was reported by Vincenzo de Cesati in 1879 as Hymenophallus roseus, and later called Dictyophora indusiata f. rosea by Yosio Kobayasi in 1965; it is synonymous with Phallus cinnabarinus. A taxon described in 1936 as Dictyophora lutea and variously known for years as Dictyophora indusiata f. lutea, D. indusiata f. aurantiaca, or Phallus indusiatus f. citrinus, was formally transferred to Phallus in 2008 as a distinct species, Phallus luteus. The specific epithet is the Latin adjective ind≈´s«êƒÅtus, \\"wearing an undergarment\\". The former generic name Dictyophora is derived from the Ancient Greek words (diktyon, \\"net\\"), and (pher≈ç, \\"to bear\\"), hence \\"bearing a net\\". Phallus indusiatus has many common names based on its appearance, including long net stinkhorn, crinoline stinkhorn,Hall (2003), p. 19. basket stinkhorn, bridal veil fungus, and veiled lady. The Japanese name , derived from the word kinugasa, refers to the wide- brimmed hats that featured a hanging silk veil to hide and protect the wearer's face. A Chinese common name that alludes to its typical growth habitat is \\"bamboo mushroom\\" (). Description Dictyophora indusiata found in Cooktown, Australia. The lacy \\"skirt\\" under the cap is the indusium. Immature fruit bodies of P. indusiatus are initially enclosed in an egg-shaped to roughly spherical subterranean structure encased in a peridium. The \\"egg\\" ranges in color from whitish to buff to reddish-brown, measures up to in diameter, and usually has a thick mycelial cord attached at the bottom. As the mushroom matures, the pressure caused by the enlargement of the internal structures cause the peridium to tear and the fruit body rapidly emerges from the \\"egg\\". The mature mushroom is up to tall and girded with a net-like structure called the indusium (or less technically a \\"skirt\\") that hangs down from the conical to bell-shaped cap. The netlike openings of the indusium may be polygonal or round in shape. Well-developed specimens have an indusium that reaches to the volva and flares out somewhat before collapsing on the stalk. The cap is wide and its reticulated (pitted and ridged) surface is covered with a layer of greenish-brown and foul-smelling slime, the gleba, which initially partially obscures the reticulations. The top of the cap has a small hole. The stalk is long,Chang & Miles (2004), p. 344. and thick. The hollow stalk is white, roughly equal in width throughout its length, sometimes curved, and spongy. The ruptured peridium remains as a loose volva at the base of the stalk. Fruit bodies develop during the night, and require 10‚Äì15 hours to fully develop after emerging from the peridium.Chang & Miles (2004), p. 348. They are short-lived, typically lasting no more than a few days. At that point the slime has usually been removed by insects, leaving the pale off- white, bare cap surface exposed. Spores of P. indusiatus are thin-walled, smooth, elliptical or slightly curved, hyaline (translucent), and measure 2‚Äì3 by 1‚Äì1.5 Œºm. =Similar species= Phallus multicolor is similar in overall appearance, but it has a more brightly coloured cap, stem and indusium, and it is usually smaller. It is found in Australia, Guam, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Papua New Guinea, Zaire, and Tobago as well as Hawaii. The cap of the Indo- Pacific species P. merulinus appears smooth when covered with gleba, and is pale and wrinkled once the gleba has worn off. In contrast, the cap surface of P. indusiatus tends to have conspicuous reticulations that remain clearly visible under the gleba. Also, the indusium of P. merulinus is more delicate and shorter than that of P. indusiatus, and is thus less likely to collapse under its own weight. Common in eastern North America and Japan, and widely recorded in Europe, the species P. duplicatus has a smaller indusium that hangs from the bottom of the cap, and sometimes collapses against the stalk. Found in Asia, Australia, Hawaii, southern Mexico, and Central and South America, P. cinnabarinus grows to tall, and has a more offensive odor than P. indusiatus. It attracts flies from the genus Lucilia (family Calliphoridae), rather than the house flies of the genus Musca that visit P. indusiatus. P. echinovolvatus, described from China in 1988, is closely related to P. indusiatus, but can be distinguished by its volva that has a spiky (echinulate) surface, and its higher preferred growth temperature of . P. luteus, originally considered a form of P. indusiatus, has a yellowish reticulate cap, a yellow indusium, and a pale pink to reddish-purple peridium and rhizomorphs. It is found in Asia and Mexico. Ecology and distribution P.Indusiatus from India The range of Phallus indusiatus is tropical, including Africa (Congo, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zaire) South America (Brazil Guyana, and Venezuela), Central America (Costa Rica), and Tobago. In North America, its range is restricted to Mexico. Asian localities include Indonesia, Nepal, Malaysia, India, Southern China, Japan, and Taiwan. It has also been collected in Australia. Like all Phallus species, P. indusiatus is saprobic‚Äîderiving nutrients from breaking down wood and plant organic matter. The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups in disturbed ground and among wood chips. In Asia, it grows among bamboo forests, and typically fruits after heavy rains.Hall (2003), p. 247. The method of reproduction for stinkhorns, including P. indusiatus, is different from most agaric mushrooms, which forcibly eject their spores. Stinkhorns instead produce a sticky spore mass that has a sharp, sickly-sweet odor of carrion.Chang & Miles (2004), p. 346. The cloying stink of mature fruit bodies‚Äîdetectable from a considerable distance‚Äîis attractive to certain insects. Species recorded visiting the fungus include stingless bees of the genus Trigona, and flies of the families Drosophilidae and Muscidae. Insects assist in spore dispersal by consuming the gleba and depositing excrement containing intact spores to germinate elsewhere. Although the function of the indusium is not known definitively, it may visually entice insects not otherwise attracted by the odour, and serve as a ladder for crawling insects to reach the gleba. Edibility and cultivation The fungus is sold dried and is usually rehydrated before cooking Thai soup made with this fungus In eastern Asia, P. indusiatus is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac. Previously only collected in the wild, where it is not abundant, it was difficult to procure. The mushroom's scarcity meant that it was usually reserved for special occasions. In the time of China's Qing Dynasty, the species was collected in Yunnan Province and sent to the Imperial Palaces to satisfy the appetite of Empress Dowager Cixi, who particularly enjoyed meals containing edible fungi.Hu (2005), pp. 94‚Äì5. It was one of the eight featured ingredients of the \\"Bird's Nest Eight Immortals Soup\\" served at a banquet to celebrate her 60th birthday. This dish, served by descendants of the Confucius family in celebrations and longevity banquets, contained ingredients that were \\"all precious food, delicacies from land and sea, fresh, tender, and crisp, appropriately sweet and salty\\".Hu (2005), p. 96. Another notable use was a state banquet held for American diplomat Henry Kissinger on his visit to China to reestablish diplomatic relations in the early 1970s.Chang & Miles (2004), p. 343. One source writes of the mushroom: \\"It has a fine and tender texture, fragrance and is attractive, beautiful in shape, fresh and crispy in taste.\\"Hu (2005), p. 110. The dried fungus, commonly sold in Asian markets, is prepared by rehydrating and soaking or simmering in water until tender. Sometimes used in stir-frys, it is traditionally used as a component of rich chicken soups. The rehydrated mushroom can also be stuffed and cooked. Phallus indusiatus has been cultivated on a commercial scale in China since 1979. In the Fujian Province of China‚Äîknown for a thriving mushroom industry that cultivates 45 species of edible fungi‚ÄîP. indusiatus is produced in the counties of Fuan, Jianou, and Ningde. Advances in cultivation have made the fungus cheaper and more widely available; in 1998, about were produced in China. The Hong Kong price for a kilogram of dried mushrooms reached around US $770 in 1982, but had dropped to US $100‚Äì200 by 1988. Additional advances led to it dropping further to US $10‚Äì20 by 2000. The fungus is grown on agricultural wastes‚Äîbamboo-trash sawdust covered with a thin layer of non-sterilised soil. The optimal temperature for the growth of mushroom spawn and fruit bodies is about , with a relative humidity of 90‚Äì95%. Other substrates that can be used for the cultivation of the fungus include bamboo leaves and small stems, soybean pods or stems, corn stems, and willow leaves. A nutritional analysis of P. indusiatus (based on specimens collected from Nigeria) determined that the egg stage of the fungus contains (per 100 g of fungus, dry weight) 33.6 g of crude protein, 1.66 g of fat, and 3.98 g of carbohydrates. The egg stage was also measured to comprise 20.9 g dietary fibre, and 88.76% moisture. The high levels of protein and fibre (which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables, respectively) suggest that the egg form of P. indusiatus is a good food source. The concentration of several mineral elements, including potassium, sodium, and iron, was also favourable compared to fruits and vegetables, although the mineral composition in the fungus is dependent on their corresponding concentrations in the soil in which they grow. Folklore According to ethnomycologist R. Gordon Wasson, P. indusiatus was consumed in Mexican divinatory ceremonies on account of its suggestive shape. On the other side of the globe, New Guinea natives consider the mushroom sacred. In Nigeria, the mushroom is one of several stinkhorns given the name Akufodewa by the Yoruba people. The name is derived from a combination of the Yoruba words ku (\\"die\\"), fun (\\"for\\"), ode (\\"hunter\\"), and wa (\\"search\\"), and refers to how the mushroom's stench can attract hunters who mistake its odour for that of a dead animal. The Yoruba have been reported to have used it as a component of a charm to make hunters less visible in times of danger. In other parts of Nigeria, they have been used in the preparation of harmful charms by ethnic groups such as the Urhobo and the Ibibio people. The Igbo people of east-central Nigeria called stinkhorns √©r√≥ ·∏øma, from the Igbo words for \\"mushroom\\" and \\"beauty\\". Bioactive properties Medicinal properties have been ascribed to Phallus indusiatus from the time of the Chinese Tang Dynasty when it was described in pharmacopoeia. The fungus was used to treat many inflammatory, stomach, and neural diseases. Southern China's Miao people continue to use it traditionally for a number of afflictions, including injuries and pains, cough, dysentery, enteritis, leukemia, and feebleness, and it has been prescribed clinically as a treatment for laryngitis, leucorrhea, fever, and oliguria (low urine output), diarrhea, hypertension, cough, hyperlipidemia, and in anticancer therapy. Modern science has probed the biochemical basis of these putative medicinal benefits. The fruit bodies of the fungus contain biologically active polysaccharides. A Œ≤-D-glucan called T-5-N and prepared from alkaline extracts has been shown to have anti- inflammatory properties. Its chemical structure is a linear chain backbone made largely of Œ±-1‚Üí3 linked D-mannopyranosyl residues, with traces of 1‚Üí6 linked D-mannopyrosyl residues. The polysaccharide has tumour-suppressing activity against subcutaneously implanted sarcoma 180 (a transplantable, non- metastasizing connective tissue tumour often used in research) in mice. Another chemical of interest found in P. indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural, which has attracted attention as a tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of melanogenesis in mammals, and is responsible for the undesirable browning reactions in damaged fruits during post-harvest handling and processing, and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs naturally in several foods, is not associated with serious health risks. P. indusiatus also contains a unique ribonuclease (an enzyme that cuts RNA into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases. Two novel sesquiterpenes, dictyophorine A and B, have been identified from the fruit bodies of the fungus. These compounds, based on the eudesmane skeleton (a common structure found in plant-derived flavours and fragrances), are the first eudesmane derivatives isolated from fungi and were found to promote the synthesis of nerve growth factor in astroglial cells. Related compounds isolated and identified from the fungus include three quinazoline derivatives (a class of compounds rare in nature), dictyoquinazol A, B, and C. These chemicals were shown in laboratory tests to have a protective effect on cultured mouse neurons that had been exposed to neurotoxins. A total synthesis for the dictyoquinazols was reported in 2007. The fungus has long been recognised to have antibacterial properties: the addition of the fungus to soup broth was known to prevent it from spoiling for several days. Experiments have shown that extracts of P. indusiatus have antioxidant in addition to antimicrobial properties. Mushroom extracts were tested against a variety of bacteria and fungi pathogenic to humans, and in some cases had antimicrobial activity comparable to the antibiotics ampicillin, tetracycline, and nystatin. One of the responsible antibiotics, albaflavenone, was isolated in 2011. It is a sesquiterpenoid that was already known from the soil bacterium Streptomyces albidoflavus. The antioxidant effect of the fungus is due to the presence of polyphenols whose role in reducing cellular damage from oxidative stress is well known. A 2001 publication in the International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms attempted to determine its efficacy as an aphrodisiac. In the trial involving sixteen women, six self-reported the experience of a mild orgasm while smelling the fruit body, and the other ten, who received smaller doses, self-reported an increased heart rate. All of the twenty men tested considered the smell displeasing. The study used fruit bodies found in Hawaii, not the edible variety cultivated in China. The study has received criticism. A way to achieve instant orgasms would be expected to gain much attention and many attempts to reproduce the effect, but none has succeeded. No major science journal has published the study, and there are no studies where the results have been reproduced.Expedition Ecstasy: Sniffing Out The Truth About Hawai‚Äòi‚Äôs Orgasm-Inducing MushroomCan a Rare Hawaiian Mushroom Really Give Women a \\"Spontaneous Orgasm\\"?

Edmund Lockyer, (21 January 1784 ‚Äì 10 June 1860) was a British soldier and explorer of Australia. Born in Plymouth, Devon, Lockyer was the son of Thomas Lockyer, a sailmaker, and his wife Ann, n√©e Grose. Lockyer began his army career as an ensign in the 19th Regiment in June 1803, was promoted lieutenant in early 1805 and made captain in August 1805. Lockyer was promoted to major in August 1819 and in August 1824 transferred to the 57th Regiment. Lockyer arrived at Sydney, capital of the British Colony of New South Wales, aboard the Royal Charlotte in April 1825 with men from the 57th; also with his wife and ten children. In August 1825, Lockyer was asked to lead an expedition to explore the upper reaches of the Brisbane River, which had only recently been settled by Europeans. On 2 September, Lockyer sailed from Sydney in the cutter , arriving at the settlement of Brisbane on 7 September. Leaving the Mermaid at Brisbane, he travelled in a small boat up the river. Lockyer saw coal in deposits on the banks, becoming the first person to identify coal in Queensland. Lockyer arrived back in Sydney on 16 October 1825, and made a report to Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane. In late 1826, Lockyer led an expedition to claim Western Australia for Britain. He sailed on the brig Amity, arriving at King George Sound on 25 December, with twenty troops and twenty three convicts. This was the beginning of the first European settlement in Western Australia. On 21 January 1827, as instructed by the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies Earl Bathurst, the Union Jack was raised and a feu de joie fired by the troops, formally annexing the territory, in assertion of the first official claim by the Imperial Government to British possession over the whole continent of Australia. The military base established by Lockyer was named Frederick Town, later renamed Albany, and would become an important deep water port. His interview with two sealers, arrested for crimes against local people, revealed intelligence of Dumont D'Urville's survey of King George Sound. Lockyer had planned an overland journey to the Swan River region in February, but learned that James Stirling had already examined the area. Lockyer was to remain in the settlement until command could be given to Captain Joseph Wakefield. Lockyer returned to Sydney on 3 April 1827, sold his army commission and settled in Sydney. In 1852 Lockyer was appointed serjeant- at-arms to the New South Wales Legislative Council and on 16 May 1856 he became the council's first Usher of the Black Rod. In September 1854 he was commissioned a captain on the formation of the Sydney Volunteer Rifle Corps, a citizens' militia force. On 18 November 1854, Lockyer married Elizabeth Colston. Elizabeth Colston was related to Mal Colston, a former Queensland Senator. Elizabeth had a brother William Edward Colston (1839-1895) who had a son Arthur Alfred Colston (1883-1926), who had a son Douglas Thomas Colston (1907-1999), the father of Mal Colston. Lockyer died from the effects of influenza on 10 June 1860 at his home in Bay Street, Woolloomooloo and was buried in Camperdown Cemetery, Sydney. The Sydney suburb of Ermington is named after Lockyer's residence, \\"Ermington House\\". A suburb of Albany, Western Australia, commemorates the city's founder. Lockyer Creek, Lockyer Valley and Lockyer Valley Regional Council in Queensland were named after Major Lockyer. His name and image were utilized in the Centenary of Albany, Western Australia and the booklet published at that time.

It lies approximately halfway between Landau and Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe. Edenkoben is one of the towns situated along the German Wine Route. Edenkoben is the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") Edenkoben. History This part of the Rhineland passed to Bavaria at 1815 following the Congress of Vienna, which reallocated many of the territories that had comprised Napoleon's empire. Like several towns in the area, Edenkoben has both a Roman Catholic and a Protestant church (recalling King Maximillian's marriage to a Protestant princess). Edenkoben's status as an administrative and cultural centre for the surrounding villages is reflected in the presence of several high-grade schools. The little town also has a considerable cultivation and trade in wine. Outside the primary (agricultural) sector, industries include the manufacture of automotive exhaust systems and of doors. In former times there was a sulphur-spring here called Kurbrunnen. Edenkoben is overlooked, on its west side, by the imposing Friedensdenkmal, from the top of which visitors can enjoy a fine view across to the Rhine. Originally constructed to celebrate German unity in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War, the memorial was renamed Friedensdenkmal (Peace Memorial) after 1945, when celebration of German military victories fell out of fashion in Europe: at the time of writing the Friedensdenkmal contains a small restaurant. The inscription on the Unification / Peace memorial reflects the determination of the German government in 1871 to downplay the extent to which the Treaty of Frankfurt resulted from military victory by Prussia. Given the frequency with which the German-speaking Rhenish provinces had been devastated by French armies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was in this region easy to emphasize the defensive nature of German unification.

Wovenhand's music combines influences from Southern Gothic music, old-time music, folk music, gospel music, and rock and roll, among other genres and styles of music.[ Wovenhand], AllMusic Conceptually and lyrically, Wovenhand reflects Edwards' strong Christian faith. History The band began in 2001 as a solo project for Edwards while 16 Horsepower was taking a temporary hiatus. Wovenhand's first live shows were performed by Edwards and multi-instrumentalist Daniel McMahon; the self-titled debut album was released in 2002 on Glitterhouse Records. Performances following this record featured Edwards, McMahon, drummer Ordy Garrison and cellist Paul Fonfara. 2003 saw the release of Blush Music, the score to a dance performance mostly composed of reworked material from the first record. Touring behind this album featured Shane Trost replacing Fonfara. In 2004, Consider the Birds was released on the Sounds Familyre label, which has also released the previous Wovenhand releases domestically. Edwards performed the bulk of the instrumentation in the studio; he and Garrison toured behind the record as a two-piece. 16 Horsepower disbanded the following year, and Edwards further focused his attention on Wovenhand. Peter van Laerhoven, a Belgian guitarist, was added to the lineup, while McMahon and Trost became inactive with the group. After 2006's Mosaic, Pascal Humbert, a founding member of 16 Horsepower, became the band's bassist. 2008's Ten Stones was the first record from the group written and performed collaboratively ‚Äì the project had thus evolved into a proper band, albeit with Edwards firmly at its head. In 2009, the band operated as a three-piece, sans Van Laerhoven. Their fifth studio album, The Threshingfloor was released in June 2010.

It amends the National Security Act of 1947 to require the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to establish requirements and priorities for foreign intelligence collected under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and to provide assistance to the United States Attorney General to ensure that information derived from electronic surveillance or physical searches is disseminated for efficient and effective foreign intelligence purposes. Central Intelligence director A number of aspects of the Directorship of U.S. Central Intelligence were addressed in Title IX of the Patriot Act. The Director was given responsibility under section 901 to establish requirements and priorities for foreign intelligence information to be collected under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), and to assist the Attorney General with disseminating intelligence information. However, the Patriot Act limited the Director and gave him no authority to direct, manage, or undertake FISA-based electronic surveillance or physical search operations unless they have been authorized by statute or executive order.Amendment was made to Section 103(c) of the National Security Act of 1947 (). Section 905 deals with matters relating to disclosure of foreign intelligence information. With the exception of information that might jeopardize an ongoing law enforcement investigation, it was made a requirement that the Attorney General, or the head of any other department or agency of the Federal Government with law enforcement responsibilities, disclose to the Director any foreign intelligence acquired by the U.S. Department of Justice. The Attorney General and Director of Central Intelligence were directed to develop procedures for the Attorney General to follow in order to inform the Director, in a timely manner, of any intention of investigating criminal activity of a foreign intelligence source or potential foreign intelligence source based on the intelligence tip-off of a memory of the intelligence community. The Attorney General was also directed to develop procedures on how to best administer these matters.section 105B of the National Security Act of 1947 () was amended to incorporate these changes. Centers The title commissioned several reports into various intelligence- related government centers. Section 906 ordered a report be written into the best way of setting up the National Virtual Translation Center, with the goal of developing automated translation facilities to assist with the timely and accurate translation of foreign intelligence information for elements of the U.S. intelligence community. The Patriot Act required this to be provided on February 1, 2002, however the report, entitled \\"Director of Central Intelligence Report on the National Virtual Translation Center: A Concept Plan to Enhance the Intelligence Community's Foreign Language Capabilities, April 29, 2002\\" was received more than two months late, which the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reported was \\"a delay which, in addition to contravening the explicit words of the statute, deprived the Committee of timely and valuable input into its efforts to craft this legislation.\\"Senate Report 107-149 - \\"To authorize appropriations for Fiscal Year 2003 for Intelligence and Intelligence-related activities of the United States Government, the Community Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Disability System, and for other purposes.\\", see the section \\"National Virtual Translation Center\\" Section 907 ordered a report to be written by February 1, 2002 on the feasibility and desirability of reconfiguring the Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury. However, this report was never written. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence later complained that \\"[t]he Director of Central Intelligence and the Secretary of the Treasury failed to provide a report, this time in direct contravention of a section of the USA PATRIOT Act\\" and they further directed \\"that the statutorily-directed report be completed immediately, and that it should include a section describing the circumstances which led to the Director's failure to comply with lawful reporting requirements.\\"Senate Report 107-149 - \\"To authorize appropriations for Fiscal Year 2003 for Intelligence and Intelligence-related activities of the United States Government, the Community Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Disability System, and for other purposes.\\", see the section \\"Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center\\" Other intelligence-related amendments A number of amendments were made to other intelligence related matters. Section 903 of the Act specifies a sense of Congress that encourages officers and employees of the intelligence community to make every effort to establish and maintain intelligence relationships with any person, entity, or group while they conduct lawful intelligence activities. Under section 902, international terrorist activities were made to fall within the scope of foreign intelligence under the National Security Act of 1947.Section 3 of the National Security Act of 1947 () was amended. Section 904 authorized the deferral of the submission to Congress of certain reports on intelligence and intelligence-related matters until either February 1, 2002 or a date after February 1, 2002, if the official involved certified that preparation and submission on February 1, 2002, would impede the work of officers or employees engaged in counterterrorism activities.

The bank is no longer in operation. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The first owner on record was August C. Beckman, who acquired the bank from another in 1900. The original bank building was wooden and painted white with the word \\"Bank\\" on the front. The bank was incorporated as the Germantown State Bank in 1904; before that, it had operated as a private banking house, the Bank of Germantown. The current stone building was built in 1920, two years after Garland changed its name from Germantown due to anti-German sentiment in the United States after its entry into World War I. Local residents apparently did not object to the bank's name, which was never changed. The bank closed in the 1930s due to the many natural disasters affecting the area. Wm. Barrett Jr. took ownership of the bank in October 1939. The next recorded owner was Joe Pankoke, from 1978 until about 1989, when it was sold to Bob Rashel of California. Rashel died in 1998, and the bank was donated to the village of Garland in his memory. The Germantown State Bank Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

They can occur when viscous magma, typically of rhyolitic or andesitic type, is involved, and share some similarities with Vulcanian eruptions. The most important characteristic of a Pel√©an eruption is the presence of a glowing avalanche of hot volcanic ash, called a pyroclastic flow. Formation of lava domes is another characteristic. Short flows of ash or creation of pumice cones may be observed as well. The initial phases of eruption are characterized by pyroclastic flows. The tephra deposits have lower volume and range than the corresponding Plinian and Vulcanian eruptions. The viscous magma then forms a steep-sided dome or volcanic spine in the volcano's vent. The dome may later collapse, resulting in flows of ash and hot blocks. The eruption cycle is usually completed in a few years, but in some cases may continue for decades, like in the case of Santiaguito. The 1902 eruption of Mount Pel√©e is the first described case of a Pel√©an eruption; the term is derived from the name of the volcano.

It is 4 km south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney. The centre of the Green Square precinct is at the junction of Bourke Road, Botany Road and O'Riordan Street. Green Square railway station on the Airport & South Line is located at this junction. The area is predominantly light industrial, with a small amount of high-density residential development. The area is undergoing one of the largest urban renewal projects undertaken in Australia. The urban renewal area spans 292 hectares. In 2012 the Lord Mayor said that, \\"Green Square would provide 20,000 new homes; 22,000 jobs; and house 40,000 new residents\\". History Advertisement for Green Square Town Centre on the platform of the railway station Green Square takes its name from the small park formerly at the junction of Bourke Road, Botany Road and O'Riordan Street. The park was named in 1938 to honour Frederick Green, Labor MP for Redfern and a tireless promoter of local industry and jobs who was a mayor of Alexandria.The City Residents Guide 2006, City of Sydney =Town centre = In December 2007, construction work began on the Green Square town centre at the intersection of Botany Road, O'Riordan and Bourke Streets, with the demolition of the Waterloo Incinerator on the site.Frew, W. Blowing Waterloo's stack for Green Square. Sydney Morning Herald, 1 January 2008. However the project moved slowly over the next few years. But in March 2012, the project entered a new phase. The Government announced that the dilapidated Joynton Smith building at the old Royal South Sydney Hospital site had been torn down to kick start the A$8 billion project. Once the demolition phase was completed (including the demolition of a number of existing buildings) work started on community infrastructure, including; a library and plaza, a community shed, a community creative centre with artists' studios and workshops and a park. The creative centre was completed in May 2018 and the library and plaza were opened in September 2018. In 2001, Landcom held an international planning competition to select a design for the Town Centre at Green Square. The team of Arets, Turner and McGregor won the competition in 2001 to masterplan the project. An LEP was subsequently prepared based on the competition winning design. In 2011 amendments to the LEP were drafted to suit the requirements of Leighton/Mirvac/Landcom who sought to increase the amount of development allowed. The amended LEP approved by the City of Sydney in 2012 included additional development height and bulk whilst increasing the amount of retail and commercial space. A new library and plaza was planned to be located near the Green Square railway station as part of the area's commercial and retail hub. The new Green Square library and Plaza will be officially opened by the Mayor of Sydney on Saturday, 27 October 2018. = Public plazas and park = In 2007 the City of Sydney and Landcom engaged in an extensive community consultation with local residents to develop plans for two public plazas: an urban stream and a local park in the town centre. The designs prepared by McGregor Coxall and a large consultant team were well received by the community and a Development Application was approved by the City of Sydney in 2009. The design won a planning award from the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects in 2009. = Library and plaza = In June 2012 another international design competition was launched for a $25 million library and the redesign of the approved $15 million plaza by the council. Five shortlisted architects were chosen by the jury to submit more detailed designs and in February 2013, the winning architect Stewart Hollenstein, in association with Colin Stewart Architects, was announced.

The scenario, by the composer, was based on the novel Askold's Grave (–ê—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–¥–æ–≤–∞ –º–æ–≥–∏–ª–∞, 1833) by Mikhail Zagoskin and the poem Rogneda (ca. 1825) by Kondraty Ryleyev. The actual Russian libretto was created by Dmitry Averkiev in the same manner as with the composer's previous opera, Judith, with the words written to fit the vocal lines after the music had been composed. This opera forms a sequel of sorts to Alexey Verstovsky's highly successful singspiel, Askold's Grave, which premiered in 1835, just the year before Glinka's A Life for the Tsar reached the stage. No less a patriotic opera than those two, Rogneda in its plot combines elements of the life of the title character with the Christianization of Russia, dated in 988 with the conversion of Vladimir I of Kiev. With its huge cast and sprawling plot, the opera demands spectacle of a Meyerbeerian order. Performance history The premiere performance took place on 27 October 1865 at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, conducted by Konstantin Lyadov (the singer Mikhail Sariotti as Vladimir Krasnoye Solnyshko), while the Moscow premiere took place during the following year at the Bolshoy Theatre in Moscow conducted by Shramek. The premiere of the opera proved to be a resounding hit, and the work remained extremely popular through the end of the Russian Empire.

Synopsis Vladimir and Rogneda by Anton Losenko (1770). :Time: The end of the 10th century :Place: In and around Kiev Note: Acts 1 and 5 may contain more than one set of stage decor =Act 1= Inside Skul'da's cave, the Supreme Priest of Perun, concerned about Prince Vladimir's failure to protect the native religion from encroaching Christianity, has decided that Rogneda -- upon Skul'da's influence -- must kill him. Rogneda enters, already prepared to avenge her father's death at Vladimir's hands. Skul'da's sorcery produces a knife with which Rogneda can perform the deed. The scene changes to a public rite of human sacrifice to the god Perun. When Rual'd, a Christian, prevents the priest from killing the first victim, he is at first threatened with death by the priests; but, after the Supreme Priest finds out that Rual'd, too, has a grievance with Vladimir, Rual'd is spared. (Vladimir kidnapped Rual'd's bride, Olava.) =Act 2= At a banquet there is celebration with Vladimir, who has returned from his successful campaign. News arrives of a failed attempt by Rual'd to rescue Olava, and Vladimir commands that Rual'd be apprehended and killed. When Dobrynya Nikitich defends Rual'd's honorable devotion to his bride, Vladimir at first threatens Dobrynya with banishment, but the court jester manages to calm the situation. =Act 3= In a forest, Rual'd comes upon some itinerant Christians. An Old Man dissuades him from taking revenge on the Prince -- who, by chance, comes on the scene with his retinue on a hunting expedition from Kiev. When Vladimir is attacked by a bear, Rual'd saves his life at the expense of his own. This sacrifice, as well as the words of the Old Man -- which mention a miracle of salvation during the coming night -- makes a deep impression on the Prince. Due to the late hour, Vladimir decides to stay with Rogneda, whose abode stands nearby. =Act 4= In her tower, Rogneda is disconsolate until she hears that Vladimir is arriving. After he settles in, the Prince dismisses his retinue and falls asleep. Rogneda, knife in hand, approaches him, but Vladimir suddenly awakens (he has had a dream of danger) and stops her, threatening with execution the next day. =Act 5= Back at Skul'da's cave, the Supreme Priest in distress consults the sorceress again. Skul'da shows him a vision in which Vladimir commands the people to drown the idol of Perun into the river. Meanwhile, in Rogneda's tower, Izyaslav (Vladimir and Rogneda's young son) intercedes for his mother, causing the Prince to leave his wife's fate in the hands of the people. Called to a veche, the people demand Rogneda's death. Izyaslav's further entreaties persuade Vladimir to forgive Rogneda, whereupon the wandering Christians appear and thank God for Vladimir's conversion.

Officially nicknamed the \\"Silver Eagles\\" and on occasion Joe's Jokers after their first commanding officer Major Joe Foss, the squadron is based at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 31 (MAG-31) and the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2nd MAW). The squadron has seen combat during World War II, the Korean and Vietnam Wars and has deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom with a final deployment in 2008 to Al Asad Airbase in western Iraq. The Squadron radio callsign is \\"Blade\\". The squadron motto, coined by Drama, is \\"SMOKEM IF YOU GOT'EM\\". It means take a break if feasible. Mission Intercept and destroy enemy aircraft under all-weather conditions and attack and destroy surface targets. History =World War II= Marine Fighting Squadron 115 (VMF-115) was organized on July 1, 1943 at Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara, California, as a F4U Corsair squadron. One of the Marine Corps most famous aces, Major Joseph Foss assumed command 16 days later. The squadron gained the nickname \\"Joe's Jokers\\", and in May 1944 joined the Pacific campaign. VMF-115 was a contributor to the American victory in the Philippines providing close air support, fighter cover, and deep air strikes in Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago. With over 18,000 flight hours during 5,856 combat sorties, VMF-115 was credited with shooting down 6¬Ω enemy aircraftSherrod History, p. 431. while losing 28 aircraft with nine pilots killed in action. To protect U.S. interests after the war and support Marines supervising the surrender of Japan, the squadron deployed to Peking, China. Communist troops began patterns of hostility leading to convoy coverage and \\"air presence\\" missions. 31 months after initial deployment, VMF-115 left the Pacific theater. =Korean War= VMF-115 F9F Panthers at Pohang, Korea, in 1953. In 1949, VMF-115 was the first Marine Corps squadron equipped with Grumman F9F-2 Panther jets, and on November 20, 1950, the first Marine squadron to carrier qualify all 18 pilots aboard the USS Franklin D. Roosevelt. The squadron then deployed to Pohang, Korea, for combat operation in February 1952. In late-June 1952 they participated in the attack on the Sui-ho Dam. Throughout the Korean War, VMF-115 expended more ordnance than any other Marine jet fighter squadron. A total of 15,350 flight hours were logged on 9,250 combat sorties with a price of 19 aircraft lost. Six pilots were lost with their aircraft in a single day and a total of 14 pilots were killed in action. Close air support was provided by VMF-115 in battles such as Bunker Hill, The Hook, Reno, Carson-Elko, Vegas, Berlin, East Berlin, and the Marines famous battle at the Chosin Reservoir. A Douglas F4D-1 Skyray of VMF(AW)-115. In the spring of 1957, the squadron received the Marine Corps' first Douglas F4D-1 Skyrays were redesignated VMF(AW)-115 and deployed to MCAF Mojave for the next six months for testing. Between 1957 and 1964, the squadron was usually based at MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina. From 19 April 1962 to 27 August 1962 the squadron was deployed aboard the aircraft carrier USS Independence (CVA-62) as part of Carrier Air Group Seven (CVG-7) to the Mediterranean Sea. From October 1962 to February 1963 the squadron was deployed to Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in support of the Cuban Missile Crisis. =Vietnam War= F-4B Phantoms of VMFA-115 and VMFA-323 on the flight-line at Danang in 1966. In 1964/65 the squadron transitioned the McDonnell F-4B Phantom II and was redesignated VMFA-115. The \\"Able Eagles\\" were deployed to Da Nang Air Base, Republic of Vietnam on October 14, 1965. During the Vietnam War, VMFA-115 flew more than 34,000 combat sorties, providing close air support for Marines during such battles as the Tet Offensive, Battle of Hue, Battle of Khe Sahn, and Task Force Delta. The squadron was awarded the Hanson Trophy in 1971 by the Commandant of the Marine Corps. In March 1971 VMFA-115 was relocated to Iwakuni, Japan. In April 1972, the squadron moved its operations to Royal Thai Air Base Nam Phong, Thailand. Here they continued to fly air to ground sorties in addition to playing a key fighter role in Operation Linebacker missions over North Vietnam. alt= =Post Vietnam= In July 1977, VMFA-115 relocated to MCAS Beaufort, South Carolina, and in October 1980 joined Carrier Air Wing 17 (CVW-17) aboard the USS Forrestal (CVA-59). During this cruise VMFA-115 participated in Cold War missions such as intercepting and escorting various Soviet aircraft. After flying Phantoms for more than 20 years, VMFA-115 began the transition to the F/A-18A Hornet on January 1, 1985, and officially stood up with 14 aircraft on August 16, 1985. The following year, the squadron became officially known as the \\"Silver Eagles.‚Äù In July 1987, VMFA-115 returned to the Western Pacific to participate in the Unit Deployment Program (UDP) at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. The squadron was recognized for superior maintenance, receiving the Secretary of Defense Phoenix Award for Maintenance Excellence, and earned the Hanson Award as Marine Corps Fighter Squadron of the Year for both 1987 and 1988. This was the first time a Marine Fighter Squadron had won the Hanson Award two consecutive years. In 1989, VMFA-115 returned to the Philippines and supported government forces during a coup attempt there. The squadron flew armed combat air patrol and escort missions, helping to stabilize the situation. The squadron‚Äôs efforts were recognized again as the coveted Hanson Award became a ‚ÄúSilver Eagle‚Äù possession in 1990 for the third time in four years. During the years from 1991 to 2000, the ‚ÄúSilver Eagles‚Äù conducted numerous six-month deployments in support of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing as part of the Western Pacific Unit Deployment Program (UDP). =Global War on Terror= An F/A-18 Hornet from VMFA-115 flying over Iraq in 2003 alt= Nearing the end of 2001, the squadron was once again designated a carrier squadron. This coincided with the first delivery of the F/A-18A+ aircraft modification. After qualifying all personnel for carrier operations the squadron deployed with Carrier Air Wing 3 (CVW-3) aboard USS Harry S. Truman in October 2002. In March 2003, the Silver Eagles fought against Iraqi forces as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, delivering more than 150 tons of ordnance. In October 2004, the squadron again deployed with CVW-3 aboard Truman for Operation Iraqi Freedom, providing close air support and overhead security in support of Iraq‚Äôs historic democratic elections. In July 2006, VMFA-115 returned to the Western Pacific for the first time since 2000 to serve under 1st MAW/III Marine Expeditionary Force for a UDP deployment. The Silver Eagles flew training sorties at various locations in Japan and squadron Marines also spent a month at Osan Air Base in South Korea. In February 2008, VMFA-115 deployed to Al Asad Airbase, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) where they were the Marine Corps‚Äô first forward-air-controller capable, single-seat F/A-18 Hornet squadron to deploy to Al Asad. The Squadron returned to MCAS Beaufort on September 17, 2008. In September 2009, the squadron transferred to Marine Aircraft Group 12 as part of the Unit Deployment Program at MCAS Iwakuni with a full complement of twelve F/A-18A+ Hornets. They returned to the States on March 1, 2010 after a seven-month deployment where they supported operations in Okinawa, Thailand, Korea the Philippines and Brunei. In 2013, they deployed to Isa Air Base, Bahrain, from March until October, returning to MCAS Beaufort upon completion. They once again transferred to Marine Aircraft Group 12, MCAS Iwakuni, Japan under the Unit Deployment Program from July through December, 2014. On December 7, 2016 an FA-18C+ of the squadron crashed into the sea off Okinawa. The pilot, Captain Jake Fredrick, ejected but did not survive. His body was recovered by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. As of the 2019 Aviation Plan, the Silver Eagles will become the third Marine F-35C squadron, scheduled to transition in FY2023.

History  Prior to statehood, Nebraska City and Omaha vied for economic and political dominance in the Nebraska Territory. In the 1850s and early 1860s, Nebraska City had been the eastern terminus of the Platte Valley freight line. However, when the Union Pacific rail line built westward from Omaha, Nebraska City lost much of its business. In an effort to regain its advantage, the businessmen of Nebraska City organized the Midland Pacific Railway Company. By 1870, the company had raised $50,000 in Nebraska City to grade the first ten miles of track. The rail line was awarded a land grant by the State of Nebraska and a bond from Otoe County. The railroad was to generally follow the path of the Platte Valley line, however, in a bid to increase its influence, the Midland Pacific line would connect to the nearby newly-founded state capital, Lincoln. Excited by the prospect of a railway, Lancaster County voted for a bond granting $50,000 to Midland Pacific Railway. However, the bond was deemed insufficient and Midland Pacific asked Lancaster County for an additional $150,000. Midland Pacific organized numerous mass-meetings in Lincoln to keep the public interested and supportive of the railroad, at one point threatening to bypass Lincoln entirely if Lancaster County would not supply it with the $150,000. After much local fundraising, spurred on by articles in the Nebraska State Journal urging citizens to do their part, the bond issue was passed and Midland Pacific built into the new capital city of Lincoln on April 22, 1871. In 1875, it merged with the Brownville, Fort Kearney and Pacific Rail Road to form the Nebraska Railway.

Six stores were sold to Ian Rogers for his new business Hypa Xtra as part of a deal which saw Hilco agree to a joint venture to acquire and operate Barry Island Pleasure Park, Dolphin bar and KR's nightclub in Barry. All Hypa Extra stores have now ceased trading, it appears, as they have all been removed of existing stock and most buildings are minus their signage. However, the one store situated on the seafront of Barry Island has been renamed to 'Bargain Master' although it is still run by the Rogers family, and still displays the old Hyper Value signage.

Biography Ashley Maher was born to British parents in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and moved to Los Angeles at the age of five. Her parents encouraged her singing from an early age, and she tried out many styles, including jazz, choral and medieval music. She even studied opera for a year in Italy. The turning point was a chance visit to a class in African music at UC Berkeley held by C.K. Ladzekpo, a master drummer from Ghana. An instant convert to West African rhythms, she studied with him for two years before finishing her degree and moving to London. In London, Maher performed with an Afro-pop band for two years before making her first demo tape, featuring her intricate vocals woven with Ghanaian drumming. The demo soon led to her signing a contract with Virgin Records and Virgin released her first two albums: Hi and Pomegranate. Both received excellent reviews worldwide. When EMI bought Virgin Records, Maher left the label and went on to independently record a third CD, The Blessed Rain, in Paris and London with West African musicians. After completing The Blessed Rain, Maher moved back to Los Angeles to continue her career. She has performed extensively and opened for major world music icons like Salif Keita, Baaba Maal, Vusi Mahlasela, Orchestra Baobab, Zap Mama, and Dobet Gnahore. Maher released a fourth CD, Flying Over Bridges, in 2006. Produced by Cameroon's Andre Manga, it features world/jazz musicians from Los Angeles as well a guest appearances by Youssou N'Dour's guitarist Jimi Mbaye and Cameroonian saxophone legend, Manu Dibango, who also co-wrote the song \\"Club Dibango and the Rising Son\\". Maher co-wrote a song called \\"Boul Bayekou\\" for Youssou N'Dour's 2006 Senegalese release Alsaama Day and his international CD Rokku Mi Rokka. In April 2008, N'Dour flew Maher to Dakar, Senegal, to rehearse with his group as a dancer for two weeks. She then performed with Youssou N'Dour and Les Super Etoiles de Dakar for two large shows: first at the Sorano Theater in Dakar and then in front of 15,000 at Paris' Bercy Arena. Since this time, online videos of Maher dancing sabar (a complex dance of Senegal's Wolof people) have been viewed by over half a million people. Maher spent September 2008 in Dakar, Senegal, recording her fifth CD, Amina, with key members of Youssou N'Dour's band, Les Super Etoiles. She spent 2009 completing the CD (with Andre Manga again producing) and touring England, Scotland, and Spain. In 2010, Maher returned to Dakar to promote Amina. She opened for Orchestra Baobab, did many interviews for radio, TV, and press, and filmed her second video from the record. Since then, she has divided her time between Dakar and Los Angeles, recording and performing with her all-star Senegalese band, while continuing to perform in the US with her Los Angeles- based musicians.

His work, while mostly ignored during his lifetime and not well known outside of the country's borders even today, is generally considered to be amongst the most important in Portuguese poetry and is widely taught in schools. This is partly due to his being championed by many other authors after his death, notably Fernando Pessoa.  Biography  Jos√© Joaquim Ces√°rio Verde was born in Lisbon, Portugal. His father was a shopkeeper and exporter of fruit products. He also had a small farm on the outskirts, at which Verde's family resided during the Summer. In 1857, an outbreak of the plague lead his father to permanently move the family to the country, where they lived until coming back to Lisbon in 1865. This early contact with the countryside instilled in Verde a deep love of nature, which would show up repeatedly in his poems about life in the country, almost always depicted in a bucolic, idyllic light. Verde, the oldest of four children, started working at his father's shop at an early age; all accounts of his family life point towards him having been brought up in a household that mostly cherished the middle class work ethic. In 1872, his sister Julia died of tuberculosis ‚Äì the grief over this loss is considered by many critics to have had a big impact on his literary work, as his poems frequently deal with the sickly, often portrayed in the guise of beautiful, innocent women. The autobiographical poem ‚ÄúN√≥s‚Äù makes explicit mention of his sister's death. Not much is known of his academic pursuits, though he did enroll in an institute of higher learning in 1873; he dropped out, however, before completing any of his exams. The tenure did result in him meeting Silva Pinto, who would go on to become his lifelong friend and, after his death, the publisher of his works. In the same year, he made public his first poems, in the local paper Di√°rio de Not√≠cias. It would prove to be the first of about forty to be released in various publications during his lifetime. During his life, Verde carried on the commercial profession of his father, only dedicating himself to poetry in his free time. In 1874, he published the poem ‚ÄúEspl√™ndida‚Äù, which garnered him a negative review by the noted Portuguese critic and social commentator Ramalho Ortig√£o. In his satirical magazine As Farpas: Ortig√£o remarked that the young poet should show himself \\"more Ces√°rio, less Verde\\" (\\"verde\\" in Portuguese meaning \\"unripe\\", i.e. inexperienced, and the mention of ‚ÄúCes√°rio‚Äù being a play on Verde's name descending from the Roman Caesar.) This deeply hurt Verde, who in fact during his lifetime would frequently complain about the indifference which greeted his work ‚Äì though he and Ortig√£o would later become friends. In 1877, Verde for the first time showed symptoms associated with tuberculosis, the same illness that killed his sister and that, in 1882, also sent his brother, Joaquim Tom√°s, to the grave. During these latter years, his interest in writing also diminished. His health deteriorated steadily. He died on July 19, 1886 in Lisbon.  Poetic profile  Ces√°rio Verde is frequently hailed as both one of Portugal's finest urban poets and one of the country's greatest describers of the countryside. Thus, Verde's poems (always written in the alexandrine structure) are mostly split into ‚Äúcity poems‚Äù and ‚Äúcountryside poems‚Äù (the few that escape these two categories dealing with love, often scorned.) Ces√°rio Verde's city poems are often described as bohemian, decadent and socially aware. He is hailed as Portugal's first great realist poet, frequently dealing with scenes of poverty, disease and moral decay. His poems also frequently deal with spleen and ennui. In \\"O Sentimento dum Ocidental\\" (\\"The Feeling of a Westerner\\"), Verde captures the atmosphere of decadence then growing in Portuguese society, comparing the past discoveries and expeditions of Portugueses sailors, as well as the works of national poet Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, to the present. He also expresses a longing to experience a larger world beyond the city, pining for ‚ÄúMadrid, Paris, Berlim, S. Petersburgo, o mundo!‚Äù (‚ÄúMadrid, Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg, the world!‚Äù) While the city is corrupt and decaying, the countryside in Verde's poetry is described as lively, fertile and full of beauty. Even the growing industrialization of agriculture isn't seen as a worrying factor, as this passage from ‚ÄúDe Ver√£o‚Äù (‚ÄúIn The Summer‚Äù) shows: ‚ÄúE perguntavas sobre os √∫ltimos inventos Agr√≠colas. Que aldeias t√£o lavadas! Bons ares! Boa luz! Bons alimentos! Olha: os saloios vivos, corpulentos Como nos fazem grandes barretadas‚Äù (‚ÄúAnd you asked about the latest inventions In agriculture. What well-washed villages! Good airs! Good light! Good food! Look: the countrymen alive, corpulent What great hat-drops they give us!‚Äù) The autobiographical poem ‚ÄúN√≥s‚Äù gives an idyllic description of Verde‚Äôs youth living on the farm ‚Äì latter poems show the countryside as the peaceful setting for picnics, and as an opportunity for long walks with female companionship. Whilst in his ‚Äúcity‚Äù poems Verde describes spleen and disease, in his descriptions of the countryside the protagonists are often strong, happy and robust.  Influences and legacy  In his poetry, Ces√°rio Verde references Balzac, Baudelaire and Herbert Spencer. His letters also contain quotes from Victor Hugo, Flaubert, Taine and Quinet. On a national level, the authors referenced are Lu√≠s de Cam√µes and Jo√£o de Deus. Although he was never very celebrated during his lifetime, Verde did socialize with many of the country‚Äôs foremost literary figures (some of these meetings may be attributed to Verde‚Äôs republican sympathies, then highly in vogue amongst the country‚Äôs intellectuals.) Fialho de Almeida is said to have greatly admired him, and other acquaintances include Guerra Junqueiro, Ramalho Ortig√£o, Gomes Leal, Jo√£o de Deus, Abel Botelho and the painter Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro. After his death, Verde‚Äôs reputation has steadily grown. He was particularly embraced by Portuguese modernists such as M√°rio de S√°- Carneiro and Fernando Pessoa (whose heteronyms √Ålvaro de Campos, Alberto Caeiro and Bernardo Soares praise Verde.) More modern admirers include Eug√©nio de Andrade and Adolfo Casais Monteiro  Published work  During his lifetime, Ces√°rio Verde published around forty poems in various papers. After his death, his friend Silva Pinto published ‚ÄúThe Book Of Ces√°rio Verde‚Äù, collecting his poems. The first edition was published in April 1887 ‚Äì two hundred copies were printed, to be dispensed as gifts only. The compilation was only made available commercially in 1901. More recent editions have respected the order in which the poems were first compiled, but added others that weren‚Äôt included in the first selection. The book now includes Verde‚Äôs entire poetic oeuvre.

While Gustav Meyer (1891) was the first to derive shqipoj from the Latin verb excipere, denoting people who speak the same language, similar to the ethno-linguistic dichotomies Sloven‚ÄîNemac and Deutsch‚ÄîW√§lsch. This etymology is widely accepted by modern Albanologists.Frash√´ri, Kristo (2013). Etnogjeneza e shqiptar√´ve - V√´shtrim historik.

This theory, now considered a folk etymology, is based mainly on the symbolic meaning of the eagle for the Albanian people, as it is their national bird, a totem associated with freedom and heroism in Albanian folklore. It has been used as a national symbol since their earliest records, and was a common heraldic symbol for many Albanian dynasties in the Late Middle Ages; an example is the flag of Skanderbeg, whose family symbol was the black double- headed eagle, which is displayed on the Albanian flag.  History  During the Middle Ages, the Albanians called their country Arb√´ria (Gheg: Arb√´nia) and referred to themselves as Arb√´resh (Gheg: Arb√´nesh) while known through derivative terms by neighbouring peoples as Arbanasi, Arbanenses / Albaneses, Arvanites (Arbanites), Arnaut, Arbine≈ü and so on.:: The words Shqip√´ri and Shqiptar are attested from 14th century onward, but it was only at the end of 17th and beginning of the early 18th centuries that the placename Shqip√´ria and the ethnic demonym Shqiptar√´ gradually replaced Arb√´ria and Arb√´resh√´ amongst Albanian speakers. This was due to socio-political, cultural, economic and religious complexities that Albanians experienced during the Ottoman era.Kristo Frasheri (1964). History of Albania (A Brief Overview). Tirana. The usage of the old endonym Arb√´nesh/Arb√´resh, however, persisted and was retained by Albanian communities which had migrated from Albania and adjacent areas centuries before the change of the self-designation, namely the Arb√´resh√´ of Italy, the Arvanites of Greece as well as Arbanasi in Croatia.:::: As such, the medieval migrants to Greece and later migrants to Italy during the 15th-century are not aware of the term Shqiptar.: Non- Albanian usage =Use in Western Europe= Skipetar/s is a historical rendering or exonym of the term Shqiptar by some Western European authors in use from the late 18th century to the early 20th century. =Use in South Slavic languages= Graffiti in the North Macedonia reading \\"Death for Shiptars\\" () The term ≈†iptar (, Shiptar; plural: ≈†iptari, Cyrillic: –®–∏–ø—Ç–∞—Ä–∏, Shiptars) used in Serbo-Croatian, Slovene and Macedonian is denoted in an offensive manner and it is also considered derogatory by Albanians when used by South Slavic peoples, due to its negative connotations. After 1945, in pursuit of a policy of national equality, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia designated the Albanian community as ‚Äò≈†iptari‚Äô, however with increasing autonomy during the 1960s for Kosovo Albanians, their leadership requested and attained in 1974 the term Albanci (Albanians) be officially used stressing a national over an only ethnic, self-identification. These developments resulted in the word ≈†iptari in Serbian usage acquiring pejorative connotations that implied Albanian racial and cultural inferiority. It continued to be used by some Yugoslav and Serb politicians to relegate the status of Albanians to simply one of the minority ethnic groups.

Ebenezer is located 69 kilometres north-west of Sydney and about 5 kilometres from the larger centre of Wilberforce. It sits on the banks of the Hawkesbury River and like typical early 19th century villages in NSW, it straggles along the roads rather than compactly around a village centre. History The town was named after Eben- Ezer in the Bible, 1 Samuel 7:12, wherein Samuel set up a stone between Mizpah and Shen and gave the name to Ebenezer. The Ebenezer Church is listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register. Church Tree where the early services were held Ebenezer Uniting Church, on the banks of the Hawkesbury River, was originally a Presbyterian chapel which is the oldest standing church building in Australia. The area was settled in 1803 by a number of free settler families who sailed to Australia on the Coromandel in 1802. These settlers worshipped under a local gum tree, which still exists on the opposite side of the road from the church. James Mein, an elder of Galashiels Kirk started holding informal services in his house at Portland and from these meetings grew a desire to build the church at Ebenezer. One of the important families in the area was the Grono family, early boat builders who built boats up to 200 tons on the Hawkesbury. They and other local families, mostly Scots who had emigrated from London, assisted in building a simple sandstone church, which was cut from sandstone along the banks of the river. The church was built in 1808-09 but not finally fitted out until 1817. An early clergyman at the church was John Youl. Its restoration has been done with recognition of the church's importance and is still used for Sunday services. More like a crofter's cottage than a church, the stone entrance porch was added in 1929 and the eastern vestry in 1966. The cedar bookcase in the porch belonged to the first minister, Dr John McGarvie, who lived in Ebenezer from 1826‚Äì1831. The first burial in 1812 was in the churchyard cemetery. Coffins were brought to the church by the river, with boatloads of mourners joining the funeral procession as it was rowed along the Hawkesbury. The cemetery is one of the most important in Australia with six generations buried in its grounds, including some of the first free settlers in the colony. Sackville ferry going to Ebenezer Schools The school at Ebenezer was opened in 1810 under the headmastership of John Youl, a layman of the Anglican Church. It operated out of the church until the 1880s when a public school was built. When this burnt down shortly afterwards, the school returned to the church. The building was a school during the week and a chapel on Sunday until the present public school opened in 1902. A schoolmaster's residence was built in 1817. It is now the oldest existing school building in Australia. The former schoolmaster's residence is used to serve Devonshire teas and has a small ‚Äòmuseum‚Äô of photos and furniture, with records of the settlers from the Coomandel. Ebenezer Public School, built in 1902, is now a Primary school with enrolments about 120. Landmarks =John Turnbull's House= John Turnbull's House is on Old Port Eringhi Road, not far from Ebenezer Church and Schoolhouse and off Tizzana Road, this wonderful old sandstone 2 storey home is alongside new houses opposite the old golf course almost at the end of the road. Only the top of John's old 2 storey home can be seen from the road, since rampant vines and trees block the view. The front part of the home and the wall facing the old golf course was built about 1807, with the remainder completed about 1810. Lewis Jones, a stonemason was responsible for the construction of the home, as there appears to be a close connection between Jones & Ralph Turnbull the eldest son of Pioneer John Turnbull. His home is built on an 1803 land grant to John Turnbull, an enthusiastic supporter of the church at Ebenezer. Famous Presbyterian minister, John Dunmore Lang, used the house when he preached at Ebenezer in 1823‚Äì24. It has been only partly restored. At either end of the home, two huge fireplaces were constructed, close to 2 metres in height. Population At the 2011 census, it had a population of 968.

Maize is low in zinc, niacin, and tryptophan, and the limited niacin found in maize is not absorbed in the digestive tract unless it has been treated with alkalis, as in the preparation of tortillas. A type of pellagra attributed to amino acid imbalance is common in India among people who eat a millet with a high leucine content. The deficiencies are usually seasonal. The (now confirmed) zeist hypotheses that pellagra might be a deficiency disease related to corn consumption was stated in 1810 by the Italian Giovanni Battista Marzari.

They are Roman Catholic and spoke the Sri Lanka Indo- Portuguese language, a creole based on Portuguese. In modern times, English has become the common language while Sinhalese is taught in school as a second language. Many Portuguese Burghers living on the east coast of Sri Lanka are of Portuguese descent; this is evident in the Sri Lanka-Indo Portuguese language, which has many affiliations to Sinhalese and Portuguese. They are mixed with other Burgher people, including Dutch Burghers. However, Portuguese Burghers are not Dutch Burghers.  Origins  The Portuguese Burghers are largely descendants of the Sri Lanka Mesti√ßos, the people of mixed Portuguese and Sri Lankan descent (commonly of a Portuguese father and a Sri Lankan mother) who appeared in the 16th century, after the Portuguese explorers found the sea route to the Indian Ocean. When the Dutch took over Coastal Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon), the descendants of the Portuguese took refuge in the central hills of Kandyan Kingdom under Sinhalese rule. In time, the Dutch and Portuguese descendants intermarried. Under Dutch rule Portuguese was banned, but the Portuguese speaking community was so widespread that even the Dutch started to speak Portuguese. In the 18th century, the Eurasian community (a mixture of Portuguese, Dutch, and Sinhalese as well as Tamil, known as the Burgher) grew, speaking Portuguese or Dutch. The Portuguese Burghers were more mixed, following Catholicism and speaking a Portuguese creole language. Despite the socio-economic disadvantage, the Burghers maintained their Portuguese cultural identity. In Batticaloa, the Catholic Burgher Union reinforced this. The Portuguese Creole continued to be used amongst the Dutch Burghers families as the informal language until the end of the 19th century. In today's Sri Lanka, the Creole is limited to the spoken form. Most of the speakers are the Burghers in the Eastern province (Batticaloa and Trincomalee). But there are also the Kaffirs (people of African origin) in the Northwestern province (Puttalam). The Portuguese, Dutch and British brought the Kaffirs to Sri Lanka, for labour purposes. They have assumed Portuguese culture and religion.  Genetics  Phenotypically Burghers can be either light skinned or dark skinned, depending on their ancestral history it is common to find Burghers with dark to light brown skin (usually Portuguese Burghers or Kaffirs) and possess European facial features common to the Mediterranean basin (see Mediterraneans). In some Portuguese Burgher families it is common to have both, very dark children and children with fair skin. Most light skinned Burghers are usually of Dutch or British descent.  Current status  At the 1981 Census, the Burghers (Dutch and Portuguese) were almost 40,000 (0.3% of the population of Sri Lanka). Many Burghers emigrated to other countries. There are still 100 families in Batticaloa and Trincomalee and 80 Kaffir families in Puttalam that still speak the Portuguese Creole; they have been out of contact with Portugal since 1656. The Burgher population worldwide is approximated to be around 100,000, concentrated mostly in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

Hugh Butler was born on a farm near Missouri Valley, Iowa on February 28, 1878. He graduated from Doane College at Crete, Nebraska in 1900, where, in 1897, he founded the Alpha Omega Fraternity. Butler toiled as a construction engineer with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad from 1900 to 1908. He entered politics as a member of the city board of Curtis, Nebraska from 1908 to 1913 and as a member of the board of education of Omaha, Nebraska. Meanwhile, from 1908 to 1940, Butler worked in flour-milling and in the grain business. Hugh Butler became a member of the Republican National Committee in 1936 and served until 1940 when he was elected to the United States Senate. He was reelected twice, in 1946 and 1952. Butler served as the chairman of the Committee on Public Lands in the Eightieth United States Congress (1947 to 1949) and as the chairman of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs in the Eighty-third United States Congress. A steadfast opponent of statehood for the Alaska Territory during most of his career in the Senate, he changed his mind during the last few months of his life. Butler died in office on the night of July 1, 1954, following a stroke that had occurred earlier in the day. Butler, along with his colleague Senator Kenneth Wherry, is best known for his intense opposition to international activities by the government, including entry into World War II the Cold War, and Korea. He reflected the isolationism of the large German-American element in Nebraska. He vigorously opposed any loans or aid to Europe, including the Marshall Plan. He did not believe that the Soviet Union threatened Nebraska's interest, and he strongly opposed the Truman Doctrine, and NATO. Whatever the issue, he could be counted on as a strong opponent of the Presidency of Harry Truman.

She also served in the Soviet Navy as EK-15 and in the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force as JDS Kiri (PF-11/PF-291/YAC-20). Construction and commissioning Originally classified as a patrol gunboat, PG-116, Everett was reclassified as a patrol frigate, PF-8, on 15 April 1943. She was laid down under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1426, at the Permanente Metals Richmond Shipyard #4, Richmond, California. Everett was launched on 29 September 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Cornelia M. Fitch, and was commissioned on 22 January 1944, with Lieutenant Commander W. L. Davis, USCG, in command. Service history =U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944‚Äì1945= After shakedown and training, Everett steamed north to Adak, Territory of Alaska, arriving there on 22 April 1944, and began 16 months of patrol and escort duty in the Aleutian Islands. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - she then proceeded to Cold Bay in the summer of 1945 and began training her new Soviet crew. =Soviet Navy, 1945‚Äì1949= Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Everett was decommissioned on 16 August 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately along with her sister ships , , , , and . Commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, Everett was designated as a storozhevoi korabl (\\"escort ship\\") and renamed EK-15 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk- Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she served as a patrol vessel in the Soviet Far East. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II. On 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned, EK-15 among them. Negotiations for the return of the ships were protracted, but on 15 November 1949 the Soviet Union finally returned EK-15 to the U.S. Navy at Yokosuka, Japan. =U.S. Navy, Korean War, 1950‚Äì1953= Reverting to her original name, Everett was given an extensive overhaul at Yokosuka, where she was recommissioned on 26 July 1950, for service during the Korean War. Assigned to primary duty as station ship at Hong Kong, she also joined the United Nations Blockading and Escort Force in operations off both coasts of Korea.

Created by Matt Cirulnick, one of its executive producers was singer/actress Jennifer Lopez. The program was panned by critics and shunned by viewers, finishing 152nd in the Nielsen TV ratings rankings for the 2005-06 season. It was canceled after eight first-run episodes. South Beach was produced by Paramount Television. There are currently no plans to release South Beach on DVD and/or Blu-ray from Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS Home Entertainment. Synopsis Vincent and Matt are two friends from Brooklyn who decide to move to glamorous South Beach in order to seek out better opportunities. Vincent has aims of meeting with beautiful women and getting ahead by any means necessary, while Matt supposedly only wants to make enough money to go back to university, since his dad blew his college fund. However, as it turns out, Matt has other reasons for going to South Beach as well. Several years previous, Matt was dating Arielle. However, he broke up with her so as to not interfere with her dreams of being a superstar fashion model and pushed her to Miami. There, Arielle met and fell in love with Alex Bauer, the young manager of Nocturnal, South Beach's hottest nightclub. Nocturnal, in turn, is located inside the glitzy Hotel Soleil, where models, celebrities, and other members of the rich and famous regularly spend their sojourns at South Beach. The Hotel Soleil is owned by Alex's mother Elizabeth, a shrewd businesswoman who believes her son is weak and does not have a head for business. On top of that, Elizabeth seems to have a penchant for dating younger men that are her son's age. Matt's arrival in South Beach caused friction with Alex, who was jealous of his previous relationship with Arielle. Elizabeth didn't help things when she gave Matt a job at the Hotel Soleil (thus ensuring that he and Arielle would be seeing a lot of each other) and evidently also had an eye for him as well. Things culminated in a fight between Alex and Matt at Nocturnal; however, Alex ultimately apologized to Arielle about the fight, and Matt agreed to respect Alex and Arielle's relationship. Vincent, meanwhile, originally took a job at the Hotel Soleil as a \\"spray boy\\" for female guests who were tanning poolside. However, he soon fell into the dubious employ of one Robert Fuentes, an investor in the hotel who happens to have links to Miami's underworld, and plans to use them to gain greater control of the operations of the hotel. For some time, Fuentes has been pressuring Elizabeth to establish a casino in the Hotel Soleil, but she constantly rebuffs him. Matt and Vincent came to South Beach to escape their dull existence. One thing's for sure: their existence is never going to be normal again. Cast ;Regulars: * Marcus Coloma as Matt Evans, the main protagonist of the show.

The Miami Herald said that, \\"Cannibalism is about the only thing missing from this delirious new trashfest of hard bodies and soft brains.\\" The Washington Posts headline for the show was \\"Bang, Bang, Bling, Bling, Blah, Blah.\\" The writer called the show \\"vacuous... preposterous and pretentious.\\" The Seattle Times said, \\"The dialogue's awful, ranging from clich√©s (\\"I don't want to work in my uncle's restaurant the rest of my life\\") to quotations (\\"First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the women\\") to product placements (\\"Anybody got a Red Bull?\\"). The show was one of the lowest-rated on television. It ranked 152nd out of the 156 original series produced for network television in the 2005-2006 season. South Beach was canceled when it was announced that the new The WB/UPN hybrid network, The CW, would not renew the show for additional seasons.

She was the daughter of Mart√≠n Bombal Videla and Blanca Anthes Precht. Her work is now highly regarded, incorporating themes of eroticism, surrealism and feminism, and she ranks among a small number of Latin American female authors whose works received worldwide acclaim. She was a recipient of the Santiago Municipal Literature Award. Biography Her first years in school were in a girl's catholic school Sagrados Corazones and after her father's death in 1919, Mar√≠a Luisa, only being an 8-year-old girl, went alongside her mother and sisters to live in Paris, where she finished her studies at college Sainte Genevi√®ve. At the University of Paris she studied literature and philosophy. She also attended the Lyc√©e La Bruy√®re and the Sorbonne at the University of Paris. There, she was part of a different cultural and artistic panorama, place where she gained interest in literature and of course, in writing novels. After finishing her university studies she came back to Chile, reuniting with her mother and sisters again. She also studied violin with the music teacher Jacques Thibaud and drama with Charles Dolan. In 1938 she published one of her most famous and most important novels in Chilean literature, La amortajada, which earned her the Premio de la Novela de la Municipalidad de Santiago (Novel prize of Santiago's Municipality). Also, when she lived in United States, with views on the American book market, she wrote a novel in English, called The House of Mist, which was a translation to English of her novel La √∫ltima niebla. Personal life Upon her return to South America she married a pioneer in civil aviation, Eulogio S√°nchez, who did not share her interest in literature. During their marriage, Bombal began to suffer from depression, and attempted suicide. In 1933 she married the homosexual painter Jorge Larco, forming with him a marriage blanche. With the help of friends, Bombal fled the country to Argentina, where in 1933 she met Jorge Luis Borges and Pablo Neruda in Buenos Aires. In 1937 she returned to Chile due to the beginning of a divorce trial. In 1941 she acquired a revolver, went to the Hotel Crill√≥n and waited for Eulogio, her lover. When he came out, she shot him three times in the arm. She went to trial; however, Eulogio exempted her from all guilt, for which the judge acquitted her. Years later, on Mar√≠a Luisa's own words, she said that he ruined her life, however, she never forgot him. Later on, she moved to United States, where she married the French count, Rafael de Saint Phall, whom she had a daughter with, called Brigitte. She lived there until 1971. She then returned to South America; living first in Argentina (helped by Pablo Neruda, who was also living there), where she met important men of letters, and then in Vi√±a del Mar, Chile. There, on 18 September 1976, Bombal again met Jorge Luis Borges.  Death  In her final days, which she spent in Chile, Bombal developed an alcohol abuse. This drinking problem forced her to repeatedly visit the hospital for a liver disease. She remained in Chile until 1980, dying the same year on May 6 in Santiago, victim of a huge gastrointestinal bleeding.  Distinction between femininity and masculinity in her works  In every novel and story written by Mar√≠a Luisa, there is a strong distinction between how women and men think and behave. We can see this clearly, when in most of her works, women and men characters are separated by a huge gender gap and the relationships between these characters are always troubled or flawed. For Bombal, femininity is a symbol of uniqueness, more related to nature, emotions and intuition, very different from how masculinity is represented, where men are described as stronger and wiser, at the moment of facing problems.

It is a metal coil which when placed into each fallopian tube induces fibrosis and blockage.Free full text Essure was designed as an alternative to tubal ligation. Although designed to remain in place for a lifetime, it was approved based on short-term safety studies. Of the 745 women with implants in the original premarket studies, 92% were followed up at one year, and 25% for two years, for safety outcomes. A 2009 review concluded that Essure appeared safe and effective based on short- term studies, that it was less invasive and could be cheaper than laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation. About 750,000 women have received the device. Initial trials found about 4% of people had tubal perforation, expulsion, or misplacement of the device at the time of the procedure. Since 2013, the product has been controversial, with thousands of women repeating severe side effects leading to surgical extraction. Rates of repeat surgery in the first year were ten times greater with Essure than with tubal ligation. Campaigner Erin Brockovich has been hosting a website where women can share their stories after having the procedure. As of 2015 many adverse events, including tubal perforations, intractable pain and bleeding leading to hysterectomies, possible device-related deaths, and hundreds of unintended pregnancies occurred, according to the US FDA adverse events database and other studies. It was developed by Conceptus Inc. and approved for use in the United States in 2002. Conceptus was acquired by Bayer AG of Germany in June 2013. In 2017, the CE marking in the European Union, and thus the commercial license for Essure was suspended for at least three months. Authorities in France and Ukraine recalled the implants, and the manufacturer withdrew the product voluntarily in Canada, the UK, Finland, and the Netherlands. In April 2018, the FDA restricted sale and use of Essure which resulted in a 70% decrease in sales.US FDA Medical Devices--FDA Activities: Essure Page Last updated 04/09/2018, accessed 16 May 2018 In July 2018 Bayer announced the halt of sales in the U.S. by the end of 2018. The device is featured in the 2018 Netflix documentary The Bleeding Edge. Use A 2015 review found the effectiveness of Essure is unclear due to the low quality of evidence. With perfect use another review found evidence of a 99.8% effective based on 5 years of follow-up. The reported insertional failure rates are \\"failure to place 2 inserts in the first procedure (5%), initial tubal patency (3.5%), expulsion (2.2%), perforation (1.8%), or other unsatisfactory device location (0.6%)\\". Upon follow-up, occlusion was observed to have occurred in 96.5% of patients at 3 months with the remainder occluded by 6 months. A 2015 study published in the BMJ concluded that Essure was as efficacious as laparoscopic sterilization at preventing pregnancy, but with a \\"10-fold higher risk of undergoing re-operation\\" when compared to patients who underwent a laparoscopic sterilization procedure.Free full text =Follow-up= For the Essure method, three months after insertion a radiologist is supposed to perform a fluoroscopic procedure called a hysterosalpingogram, to confirm that the fallopian tubes are completely blocked and that the woman can rely on the Essure inserts for birth control. A contrast agent (dye) is injected through the cervix, and an x-ray technologist takes photos of the Essure coils to ensure no contrast leaks past the Essure. Adverse effects Serious side effects may include persistent pain, perforation of the uterus and fallopian tubes, and migration of the coils into the pelvis or abdomen. Because of the stainless steel medical staff need to be notified before an MRI can be done. However, the inserts were found to be safe with MRI using a 3-Tesla magnet and is considered MR-conditional. =Risks=  Procedural complications  * Inability to place inserts (4%) * Cramping (30%) * Pain (13%) * Nausea/vomiting (11%) * Dizziness/light headed (9%) * Bleeding/spotting (7%) * Vasovagal response (fainting) (1.3%) * Perforation, expulsion, or other unsatisfactory location of the insert  Long-term complications * Abdominal pain (3.8%) * Back pain (9%) * Menstrual cramps, severe (2.9%) * Pelvic or lower abdominal pain, severe (2.5%) * Gas/bloating (1.3%) * Headache (2.5%) * Heavier menstrual bleeding (1.9%) * Vaginal discharge or infection (1.5%) * Pregnancy (0.48%) and increased risk of ectopic pregnancy * Allergic reaction to the materials * Rash * Autoimmune disease (0.99%) * Weight changes * Depression * Hair loss * Suicide attempt (0.55%) Procedure A physician places the coils into the fallopian tubes by a catheter passed from the vagina through the cervix and uterus. This occurs successfully between 63% and 100% of the time. Once in place, the ingrowth continues over a period of three months, resulting in blockage in the Fallopian tubes; the tissue barrier formed is supposed to prevent sperm from reaching an egg. During that intervening three-month period, women are advised to use an alternate contraceptive method. Unlike tubal ligation, it may not required a general anaesthetic (though is often done under general anaesthetic). Despite this, some women have reported considerable pain during the procedure. In one 2007 prospective study, the mean time for procedure was 6.8 minutes (range = 5‚Äì18 minutes). for a trained physician to perform and can be performed in a physician's office. The procedure is reported to be permanent and not reversible by the manufacturer. Nevertheless, several Essure reversals have been performed. =Device= The small, flexible inserts are made from polyester fibers, nickel-titanium, stainless steel and solder. The insert contains inner polyethylene terephthalate fibers to induce inflammation, causing a benign fibrotic ingrowth, and is held in place by flexible stainless steel inner coil and a dynamic outer nickel titanium alloy coil. Unlike temporary methods of birth control, the Essure inserts do not contain or release hormones. The inserts do not prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections. Regulatory history A Facebook group called Essure Problems which had 33,140 members (as of 04/03/2017) called the method \\"E-hell\\" and mentioned mostly pain, bleeding, bloating and other side effects from the device. Some women had coils break and perforate their internal organs, conceived and gave birth to a child, at a number well above what Bayer has been reporting. Erin Brockovich became involved in the controversy and hosts a website where women can share their stories after having the procedure. Since then Bayer provided two toll-free telephone numbers for patient complaints, has advised that women reporting adverse effects are \\"consistent with clinical trials and consistent with what the FDA is seeing\\", and further insisted that it wanted to hear from any women experiencing problems with Essure. In April 2015, a group of six delegates from the Essure Problems group, including a doctor with Essure experience, spoke before 36 members of the FDA and the Congressional HELP committee regarding a citizen's petition filed with the FDA. The FDA began investigating the claims of then over 16,000 members of the group as well as the legalities of the approval process that Essure went through. As of 2015, one postmarketing study was not published for 13 years after the device was approved, and another postmarketing study had not been published as of 2015. =FDA= The product was approved by the FDA in 2002. In 2013, the product made news in North America, with women complaining of severe side effects leading to surgical extraction. According to one article, women who have gotten pregnant are naming these children e-babies. In October 2013, the FDA stated that since the product was approved in 2002 it had received 943 reports of adverse events related to Essure, mainly for pain (606 of the complaints). An additional 1,000 more complaints have been sent to the FDA in a voluntary reporting system, but physicians are not obliged to report complaints. In June 2015, the FDA reported an investigation into Essure and its over 5000 complaints, seven reported deaths, and many additional side effects, all linked to Essure, its specific chemical composition, its improper placement and its insertion. The agency announced that its Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel would conduct an evidence-based review of Essure's safety in September 2015 due to the rise in adverse event reports from only 950 reports between 2002 through October 2013, to more than 4,150, or 81 percent of the total, from October 2013 to June 2015. In February 2016, the FDA issued a \\"black box\\" label to warn the public about the harmful complications associated with the use of this device and requested Bayer to conduct a new postmarket surveillance to follow 2,000 women for at least three years, comparing the effectiveness and safety of the device with other surgical contraceptive methods. Women and doctors were required to sign a decision checklist before Essure implantation, and to give consent to a test three months later to ensure the device was properly placed and functioning. In July 2020, Bayer published interim data from the FDA-mandated postmarket surveillance study comparing patients who received Essure to those who receiving a laparoscopic tubal ligation. The interim data reported the incidence of several side effects in each group. In Essure patients, chronic lower abdominal or pelvic pain occurred in 9% and abnormal bleeding in 16%, compared to 4.5% reporting pain and 10% with abnormal bleeding in the tubal ligation group. It also reported new allergic or hypersensitivity reactions in 22% of patients and no reports of new autoimmune disorders, although blinded independent verification was pending. Recruitment of patients receiving Essure into the postmarket surveillance study has ceased as the device is no longer available on the US market.

The three old men then go home to the mansion they share with Madame Tanya (Maria Ouspenskaya), an elderly countess dispossessed by the Russian Revolution, for a dinner with prestigious guests. When the guests cancel at the last minute, George is convinced it is because of his dark past. To relieve George's black mood, Michael comes up with an idea to obtain new guests for dinner. Each man throws out a wallet containing $10 and his business card into the street. George's is found by Arlene Terry (Helen Vinson), who merely gives the money to her driver and discards the wallet. However, the other two are returned by more considerate people: Texas cowboy James Houston (Richard Carlson) and teacher Jean Lawrence (Jean Parker). They stay for dinner and soon become good friends with the three men and Madame Tanya. James and Jean also fall in love with each other, delighting the three men. When the engineers have to travel to another city on business, Madame Tanya begs Michael to take the train rather than fly. He assures her it is perfectly safe, but Madame Tanya's premonition proves tragically correct when their aircraft crashes in a storm, killing all three. When James and Jean come to announce that they are engaged, they receive the bad news. The ghosts of the three men return home, where they are dimly sensed by Madame Tanya. It turns out that Michael had bequeathed some bonds to the young couple so they could afford to marry. The story is picked up by the press, and as a result, James is invited to be a guest on a radio show. This is the opportunity he has been waiting for to showcase his wonderful singing voice. At the studio, James bumps into Arlene Terry, an established singing star. She wishes him well and is impressed by his performance. She had been wanting to replace her aging partner; she and her manager, Phil Hubert (Rod LaRocque), offer James a starring role in her new show. He accepts. As James spends time with Arlene rehearsing, he becomes infatuated with her and neglects Jean, much to the distress of the ghosts, who are powerless to do anything. When Arlene's ex-husband bangs on her door, she has James leave by the back door, but not before persuading him to take a three-day break from work with her in the country. George is summoned to leave the world. Michael begs him to repent before it is too late, but George refuses to be a hypocrite and walks away amid thunder and lightning into the darkness. Soon it is Allan's turn. His son David (William Bakewell) comes to take him to Heaven to be reunited with his wife. When Michael is called, he refuses to leave James, although a voice tells him each person is summoned only once and that he will be doomed to roam the Earth forever if he turns it down. When Arlene leaves her apartment to meet James, her ex-husband is waiting. He needs her help to get back on his feet. However, she coldly brushes him off. When Arlene and James drive away, the jealous, estranged husband follows and shoots them when they stop for dinner. James dies on the operating table with his spirit greeted by Michael who then intercedes on his behalf, pleading with a \\"voice from above\\", for a second chance for the young man. His wish is granted and James returns to life. Michael is reunited with a now-repentant George, and both are admitted into Heaven.

Rosenbaum covered the 1970s Senate Watergate hearings, the 1980s Iran-Contra Affair, the restructuring of Medicare and Social Security, and various budget and tax debates between Congress and the White House. Rosenbaum was particularly known for distilling complex governmental issues into readily understood analyses of their effects on people's lives.

Rosenbaum's family agreed to forgo a suit against the city in exchange for the creation of a task force to investigate and improve Washington's emergency services. In cooperation with incoming Washington mayor Adrian Fenty (who had conferred with Rosenbaum's survivors before his election), the Rosenbaum family's settlement with authorities, signed in March, 2007, produced the Task Force on Emergency Medical Services (often called the \\"Rosenbaum EMS task force\\"). The task force produced numerous recommendations for emergency services reform in Washington, D.C. Reforms followed.

The Pauline privilege is drawn from the apostle Paul's instructions in the First Epistle to the Corinthians. Origin The Pauline privilege is the allowance by the Church of the dissolution of marriage of two persons not baptized at the time the marriage occurred. 1 Corinthians 7:10‚Äì15 states: > To the married I give charge, not I but the Lord, that the wife should not > separate from her husband (but if she does, let her remain single or else be > reconciled to her husband) --and that the husband should not divorce his > wife. To the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is > an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her. > If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live > with her, she should not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband is > consecrated through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is consecrated > through her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is > they are holy. 15 But if the unbelieving partner desires to separate, let it > be so; in such a case the brother or sister is not bound. For God has called > us to peace.\\"( RSV) The first section, \\"not I but the Lord\\", roughly matches Jesus' teaching on divorce, found in an antithesis (Matthew 5:32) with parallels in Matthew 19:9, Luke 16:18, and Mark 10:11. The second section, \\"I say, not the Lord\\", gives Paul's own teaching on divorce, and was initiated to address a serious pastoral problem in the Church in Corinth where problems apparently developed in marriages between believers and unbelievers. Therefore, in instances where the unbaptized spouse left the newly baptized spouse, Paul allowed the latter to enter into a new marriage. In the Catholic Church and in some Protestant denominations this is interpreted as allowing the dissolution of a marriage between two non-baptized persons in the case that one (but not both) of the partners seeks baptism and converts to Christianity and the other partner leaves the marriage. Assuming it is established that both spouses were un- baptized at the time of their marriage, and subsequently obtained a civil divorce, should the now baptized party wish to enter into a sacramental marriage, the Pauline Privilege (\\"in favor of the faith\\") takes place ipso facto at the time of that marriage. In the Latin Church, the subject is covered in canons 1143‚Äì1147 and can be handled on the diocesan level. For the Eastern Catholic Churches the applicable canons are found in the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 854‚Äì858. According to the Catholic Church's canon law, the Pauline privilege does not apply when either of the partners was a Christian at the time of marriage. It differs from annulment because it dissolves a valid natural (but not sacramental) marriage whereas an annulment declares that a marriage was invalid from the beginning.\\"Invocation of the Pauline Privilege\\", Roman Catholic Diocese of Hawaii The related Petrine privilege, which also allows remarriage after divorce, may be invoked if only one of the partners was baptized at the time of the first marriage.

A Democrat, he was elected State Treasurer in 2008. Previously, Westlund served in both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly, as a Republican from 1996 to 2006, as an independent from 2006 to 2007, and then as a Democrat. Westlund dropped his Republican party affiliation to run for Governor of Oregon in the 2006 election, but dropped out of the race in August. In December 2006 he became a Democrat. Westlund worked as a business analyst, and ran businesses in mining, ranching, and agriculture.  Early life  Westlund was born in Long Beach, California and his family moved to Oregon when he was a teenager. He graduated from Oregon Episcopal School in 1967, then received a bachelor's degree from Whitman College in education and history and pursued some graduate studies at the University of Oregon. He moved to Central Oregon in 1974 and lived near Bend, running a ranch, with his wife Libby and two children, son B.J. and daughter Taylor. Westlund was arrested for drunk driving and possession of cocaine in 1982. He credited that incident with convincing him to stop drinking. He later served in the Oregon Legislature with the arresting officer, Rep. John Minnis.Petitioners expect to suspend law recriminalizing pot  Oregon legislature  In 1996, Westlund won election to the Oregon House of Representatives as a Republican. During four terms in the House, his most notable work was done as co-chair of the budget-writing Joint Ways and Means Committee, to which he was appointed in 2001. He unsuccessfully argued for the creation of a state sales tax as a means to balance the budget during a revenue shortfall. That same year, he co-sponsored legislation to create the Oregon Cultural Trust,Oregon Cultural Trust : History of the Oregon Cultural Trust and subsequently came under fire for seeking to head the newly created organization. He served on the Cultural Trust's board until his election as State Treasurer. In what would be Westlund's last House race, he defeated Democrat Cylvia Hayes, a Bend businesswoman who later became Oregon's first lady during the third and fourth terms of Governor John Kitzhaber. In 2003, Westlund was appointed to the Oregon Senate to complete the term of retiring Sen. Bev Clarno. He won election to that same seat in 2004, also gaining the local Democratic nomination and facing only token opposition on the ballot.Deschutes County, Oregon General Election November 2, 2004 He represented District 27 in the Senate, which covers most of Deschutes County and includes the city of Bend. During the 2004 election, Westlund endorsed Ballot Measure 36, which outlawed same-sex marriage in Oregon.Measure 36 - Arguments in Favor After learning that research claims by Measure 36 proponents on which he had relied were rejected by the researcher, he personally called the researcher to apologize, expressing regret for supporting the measure. He subsequently sponsored a bill in the legislature to allow civil unions. That effort was defeated in part thanks to opposition by Speaker of the House Karen Minnis, wife of the officer who arrested Westlund in 1982.Brainstorm Nw Civil union legislation was later resurrected and passed in the 2007 legislature, becoming law in 2008. Westlund was pro-choice and supported access to the morning-after pill. During his time in the legislature, however, he had supported some restrictions on abortion. In 2003 he backed House Bill 2547Relating to information that a health care provider must provide to a female at least 24 hours before performing an abortion in order to obtain the female's informed consent to the abortion; creating new provisions; and amending ORS 435.496 and in 2005 he backed H.B. 2532.Relating to the reporting of information about abortion; creating new provisions; and amending ORS 432.333 and 435.496 Both would have created a 24-hour waiting period for women wishing to receive an abortion and required doctors to read a statement to patients about abortion. In 2005, he also supported H.B. 2605,Relating to notification to a parent prior to performing an abortion on a minor a parental notification bill, and H.B. 2020,Relating to establishing an unborn child as the legal victim of a crime that results in harm to the unborn child; creating new provisions; and amending ORS 163.005, 163.095, 163 which would have expanded Oregon's criminal homicide law, redefining \\"human beings\\" to include fetuses and embryos at any stage of development.  Statewide office  Following his switch to the Democratic Party, there was speculation that Westlund would run against Republican incumbent U.S. Senator Gordon Smith. On October 3, 2007, however, in a press conference attended by Governor Ted Kulongoski, he announced his candidacy for the office of Oregon State Treasurer.

It includes the horizontal transport of ore, coal, supplies, and waste, also called cartage or drayage. The vertical transport of the same with cranes is called hoisting. Overview Haulage fees, sometimes also simply called \\"haulage\\", include the charges made for hauling freight on carts, drays, lorries, or trucks, and is incorporated for example in the cost of loading raw ore at a mine site and transporting it to a processing plant. A railway, supplying cars, may negotiate rates with customers located on another railway's line, the road granting haulage rights.

The approaches to the old bridge, however, were left in place and converted into the longest fishing pier in the world. The most common activity on the pier is fishing. Common catches include snook, tarpon, grouper, black sea bass, Spanish mackerel, king mackerel, cobia, sheepshead, Mangrove Snapper, grunts, , sharks, Goliath Grouper, Lane Snapper, flounder, and many more. Other pier activities include site seeing and photography. Before the bridge are good flats to fish at, kite board, kayak, and wind surf Snacks, drinks, bait, and fishing supplies can be purchased on the pier, which has a fee for admission. The park is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

McNutt emigrated to America some time before 1753 by which time he had settled in the town of Staunton, Virginia. In 1756 he was an officer in the Virginia militia on Major Andrew Lewis's expedition against the Shawnees on the Ohio River. By September 1758 McNutt had relocated to Londonderry, New Hampshire, a town settled by Ulster Scots. Between April and November 1760, McNutt served as a Massachusetts captain at Fort Cumberland near the present- day border between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, five years after the Expulsion of the Acadians. It was during this time that he became involved in the colonization of Nova Scotia. He concerned himself with the Cobequid Townships of Truro and Londonderry. Through McNutt's efforts, a group of fifty families from New Hampshire arrived in the spring of 1761 in the Cobequid (Truro) area of Nova Scotia. He had several proposals for settlement of some 7,000 to 8,000 Protestant Irish in Nova Scotia accepted by the Board of Trade in London, but he was not successful in getting the support of the Privy Council who feared such an out-migration would harm British interests in Ireland. He nevertheless went to the Ulster with just the Board of Trade's approval to seek out emigrants. In the spring of 1761 he advertised throughout Ulster with an offer to \\"industrious farmers and useful mechanics\\" of of land to the head of a family and 50 to each member. His effort resulted in 300 colonists arriving in Halifax in October on the ships Hopewell and Nancy. The next autumn, 170 more settlers arrived out of Londonderry on the same two ships and settled the New Dublin area in present-day Lunenburg County and elsewhere in the province. McNutt also worked to settle a group of disbanded New England soldiers, which included Israel Perley, along the Saint John River. In 1764 he began negotiations with John Hughes of Philadelphia, an undertaking that culminated two years later with 60 Pennsylvania-German settlers establishing The Township of Monckton on the Petitcodiac River. Plans for huge settlements on some of land fell through as the land boom in Nova Scotia petered out by the mid-1760s. McNutt spent time in the later part of the decade living with his brother on McNutt Island in Rosebay Harbour (near present-day Shelburne) as well as in the Cobequid region where he appeared in the 1771 census. He seems to have supported himself at this time cutting timber. In 1767 he was elected to the General Assembly of Nova Scotia as Londonderry Township's representative. He was ordered to pay several debts and forced to sell his land at Port Roseway. Other land he held on the Minas Basin, on Beaver Harbour, and on the eastern coastal boundary of the Philadelphia grant in Pictou were escheated. He left the colony around 1780, returned around 1786, and left for good in 1794 and finally settled in Rockbridge County, Virginia in 1796. McNutt rose to the army rank of colonel. References *W. O.

G. Carter. The design was started in 1925 and the first flight took place in July 1925. The Hornbill did not achieve service in the Royal Air Force due to problems in its power plant and radiator. Only one aircraft was built. Construction The Hornbill had a mixed material construction, having a steel engine mount and front fuselage covered with duralumin sheet. The rear fuselage was made of wood structure covered with canvas. The wings also were of wood and canvas. The engine was a 698 hp (520 kW) Rolls-Royce Condor IV driving a fine pitch wooden propeller. thumb Performance The aircraft was very fast but lacking in stability and control. At 150 mph (241 km/h), steep turns could not be made without applying full rudder. Engine overheating occurred during flight tests. The single centrally mounted radiator was replaced by two radiators mounted in the lower inner wings, but the problem was not fully cured. The small size of the cockpit restricted the movement of the pilot.

It was released by Atlantic Records in November 1979, following ELP's breakup. It was later re- released and repackaged as Works Live in 1993. Some of the tracks were not from the Montreal concert, but from other concerts the 1977‚Äì1978 Tour, like \\"Peter Gunn\\" and \\"Tiger in a Spotlight\\". Content Similar to most live albums, In Concert showcased fan favourites of previously released material. However, \\"Peter Gunn\\", ELP's take on the classic TV theme song, was never released on any of their other albums (a slightly edited version of this live recording was included on the 1980 The Best of Emerson, Lake & Palmer compilation and released as a single in some countries). ELP frequently opened with this song on the Works Volume 2 tour. The band hired a 70-piece orchestra for some concerts of this tour but eventually had to dismiss the orchestra due to budget constraints that almost bankrupted the group. On the original release, the orchestra performs on \\"C'est la Vie\\", \\"Knife-Edge\\", on Keith Emerson's piano concerto, and on \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\". Works Live adds four other songs performed with the orchestra: \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\", \\"Abaddon's Bolero\\", \\"Closer to Believing\\", and \\"Tank\\". Release The original release of this album carried no producer credit; however, production and mixing of the album was largely carried out by Keith Emerson. While Emerson intended to release In Concert as a double LP, the band's imminent dissolution meant ELP's label, Atlantic Records, limited it to a single album. The 1993 re-release of the album, as the double CD Works Live, restored Emerson's original intent to some extent.Macan, Edward (2006).

Background Huffman Aviation Florida was established in 1972 as Venice Flying Service, and was reorganized in 1987 and renamed as Huffman Aviation. Huffman Aviation was purchased by Dutchman Rudi Dekkers in 1999. At the time of purchase, the school had a fleet of 12 small aircraft. Huffman offered private pilot, instrument rating, Commercial pilot, Multi- Engine Ratings, and flight instructor training, but did not offer training on larger, jet aircraft. More than 80% of the school's students were foreign nationals, following a marketing campaign designed to attract overseas students. Dekkers sold Huffman Aviation in 2003. September 11, 2001 pilots The business gained notoriety after the September 11th attacks, when it was revealed that Mohamed Atta, Ziad Jarrah, and Marwan al-Shehhi had attended the school to learn how to fly small aircraft. The three first trained at Huffman in July 2000. In August, the school filed the M-1 student visa request forms for Atta and al-Shehhi to switch from 'tourist' Visas, to 'student', in order to allow them to enroll in the school's professional pilot program that would last from September 1, 2000, until September 1 the next year.. The student visa requests were granted on July 17, 2001, for Atta, and August 9, 2001, for al-Shehhi. For a short while, during their time at the school, both Marwan and Atta lived with a company employee named Charlie Voss. Security issue In January 2002, Huffman Aviation again made headlines when the local paper sent a reporter onto its property, who managed to casually move between airplane cockpits, fuel tanks and other \\"safety concerns\\" without anybody noticing or stopping him. In March, the school was cited for having left fuel trucks unlocked, with keys in the ignition, at the Venice Municipal Airport.

It is played the same as Contract Rummy, except that if a player manages to cut the exact number of cards required to deal the hand and leave a face-up card, then the cutting player's score is reduced by 50 points.Rules of Card Games: Liverpool Rummy at Pagat.com The Game The game consists of seven deals of the cards. The objective is to be holding the lowest valued cards at the end of each deal. At the end of each deal the score for each player is written down, and the player with the lowest total score at the end of the seven deals wins the game. In each deal the players reduce the value of the cards held in their hands by laying on the table those cards that fit a specific \\"contract\\" of Sets and Runs. *A Set consists of three or more cards all of the same rank, such as 8 8‚ô£ 8‚ô†. *A Run consists of four or more cards in sequence, all of the same suit (hearts, clubs, etc), such as 3 4 5 6 7. The Deck The game is played with multiple standard 52-pack plus the jokers. 2 decks for three to five players. 3 decks for more players. The ranking from low-to-high is A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A. Aces can be low or high. Jokers are wild cards and can stand in for any other card. Dealing The dealer deals 10 cards to each player for the first 4 rounds, then 12 cards to each player for the last 3 rounds. After all the players' hands have been dealt, another card placed face-up in a central location known as the discard pile. The player to the immediate left of the dealer plays first. Gameplay On each turn, a player: *May allow any player to buy the top card from the discard pile. *Draws either the face-up top card of the discard pile or one card from the deck. *May lay down their completed round-appropriate collection of books and runs. *May play off other players who have laid down once they have laid down themselves. *May discard one card from their hand onto the discard pile. When a player discards a card that could have been played off on their own or another player's laid cards is a \\"liverpool.\\" Only players that are LAID DOWN may call liverpool. The FIRST player to call liverpool may discard one card to the discard pile, resume rotation prior caller. If the next player commences their turn by either drawing or allowing buying then the opportunity to call liverpool has passed. Play continues, in alternating turns, until one player goes out, or has no cards left in their hand. Points are tallied and recorded by a score- keeper. All of the cards are shuffled and the next round of play commences. =Laying Down= The objective in liverpool rummy is to improve one's score by laying down to reduce the number of cards in hand, and eventually going out before other players. Within each round there are two types of card groupings that are required: *SETS: Books of 3 or more cards sharing the same rank, i.e., 8 8‚ô£ 8‚ô†. *RUNS: 4 or more cards of the same suit in sequence, i.e., 3 4 5 6. Aces rank as high or low, but one cannot create a run that loops around, also known as \\"turning the corner\\". A 2 3 4 is allowed, J Q K A is allowed, but K A 2 3 is not. PENALTY: If a player begins to lay cards down and finds they cannot actually lay down, they must add fifty points to their score. Requirements for laying down The requirements for each round of play are as follows: *First - 2 sets (6 cards) *Second - 1 set & 1 run (7 cards) *Third - 2 runs (8 cards) *Fourth - 3 sets (9 cards) *Fifth - 2 sets & 1 run (10 cards) *Sixth - 1 set & 2 runs (11 cards) *Seventh - 3 runs with no remaining cards in hand, no final discard (12 cards) =Buying Cards= After each player has finished their turn by discarding, if the next player declines to pick up the new top card of the face-up discard pile, any other player may \\"buy\\" it. The \\"price\\" of picking up this extra card out of turn is drawing an additional card from the face-down pile. If more than one player desires to buy a card, the player who calls out I'll buy that first gets the card or for a calmer game whomever is nearest (clockwise) the player about to draw gets precedence. The option to buy ends when the next player picks up a card from the top of the face-down deck. =Wild Cards= Jokers are wild cards, and can represent any card (suit and number). However there are restrictions on their usage. *Sets must include at least 2 non-wildcards. **Legal Example: 7 7‚ô£ Joker. *Runs must include at least 3 non-wildcards in an original 4 card grouping. **Legal Example: 7 8 Joker 10. During their turn while playing off another player, a player may replace that other player's laid Joker from within a run with the card it is substituting, so long as that Joker is placed somewhere else before the player concludes their turn. An easy way to \\"waste\\" the extra Joker if it doesn't allow you to lay additional cards is to simply add it to a set, as this prohibits another player from performing the wild card substitution trick again. =Playing off other players= Once a player has laid down, they can then attempt to further reduce the number of cards in their hand by adding to other players' laid cards. If another player has laid down a set of 3's (3 3‚ô£ 3‚ô†) and you have a 3 in your hand, you may lay it down on his pile. If another player has laid down a run of hearts (3 4 5 6), you may add a 7 to their pile. =Calling rummy= Once a player has laid down, their discard must not fit into either their own or any other player's laid cards. If this is the case, every other player has until the commencement of the next player's turn to call rummy on the offending player, in which case that offending player picks up their discard and one additional card from the top of the deck. Once a player lays his cards down to 'go out' of a round, rummy rules no longer apply. =Evaluation of the hand= At the end of each round when a player goes out, the rest of the players total their scores by counting up the value of the cards remaining in their hands. Cards are valued as follows: *2 through 9 are 5 points each. *10, J, Q and K are 10 points each. *Aces are 15 points each. *Jokers are 20 points each. The player with the lowest point total at the end of final round wins, so players usually work to lower their scores by going down, playing off other players who have gone down and, secondarily, replacing high cards (such as face cards and aces) with lower ones. Going Out A player goes out when he successfully discards the only remaining card in hand, marking the conclusion of the step for all players. A player gets to this point by laying down and then playing off his and other players‚Äô hands. A player is floating if he exhausts his cards and is not able to discard. In this case, the hand continues until somebody successfully goes out. At no point in time is it acceptable to draw a card from the up pile and discard the same card during the same turn. It follows that a floater must draw an unplayable card from the deck (down-pile) in order to go out. It is customary to knock on the table when there is only one card left in your hand. This alerts other players of closeness to going out. =Me= Me derives its name from a player out of turn buying a card from the discard pile. The player calls \\"me\\" and then picks up the discarded (bought) card and a penalty (the price for buying the card). The difference from Liverpool Rummy is that whoever calls \\"me\\" first gets the card as opposed to the player who is nearest (clockwise) the player about to draw.

Pixley was the 8th attorney general of California. Biography Pixley was born in Westmoreland, Oneida County, New York. As a youth, he worked on the family farm and was first educated in the village academy, later at the Quaker school in Skaneateles (town), New York. He graduated from Hamilton College and studied law in Rochester, New York, he worked in the law office of Smith, Rochester and Smith. In 1847, he went to Michigan where he was admitted to practice law and qualified to appear before the state supreme court. Two years later he travelled to California during the Gold Rush, and spent two winters working mines on the Yuba River. He met and, in 1853, married Amelia Van Reynegom, daughter of Captain John and Margaret Van Reynegom, who had arrived to San Francisco in 1849 aboard her parents‚Äô ship the Linda. The Pixleys lived in the North Beach area of San Francisco. In 1858, although California was a Democratic state, Pixley was elected as a Republican to represent San Francisco in the State Assembly. In 1861, he was elected the 8th Attorney General of California. His term ended in 1863. He traveled to Washington D.C. as a Civil War correspondent. However, he could not obtain a pass from Edwin Stanton who was the Secretary of War. At that he persuaded the United States Senator from California, John Conness, to let him use his congressional pass. With that he was able to spend three months in Civil War combat areas, and at one time riding his horse to the front line with the Second Connecticut Regiment. He visited Ulysses S. Grant in his headquarters. The General commented that Pixley had seen more warfare than many of his fighting men. In 1868 he was the Republican candidate for Congress in California's First District, losing to incumbent Samuel Beach Axtell by more than 3500 votes. He briefly served as the United States Attorney for the District of California in 1869. Pixley in The Argonaut editorial office, ca. 1892 Pixley joined with Frederic Somers to found The Argonaut in April 1877. The Argonaut was considered one of the most important publications in California and it had a great deal of political influence. He was friends with former Governor of California John G. Downey, and after the death of Downey's wife, introduced him to Yda Hillis Addis, a young woman who wrote for The Argonaut. Their relationship ended when the ex-governor proposed marriage to Addis. When Downey's sisters discovered the betrothal, they shanghaied the older gentleman to his native Ireland. In 1882 Governor George Clement Perkins appointed Pixley founder and editor of The Argonaut to the board of commissioners of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. In 1888, Governor Robert Waterman appointed Pixley a trustee of the state Mining Bureau. In 1889 he was appointed to the board of the Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove Commission. He died at age 70 in 1895 in San Francisco.https://oag.ca.gov/history/8pixley ixley retired from politics in 1877 to pursue his lifelong dream - newspaper publishing - creating the weekly publication, the Argonaut. He died in San Francisco in 1895 at the age of 70. Pixley, California The town of Pixley, in Tulare County, California, is named after Frank Pixley. The town began as a real estate speculation in 1884. The investors, Darwin C. Allen and William B. Bradbury, knew their project would succeed only if the town was connected to the mainline of the Southern Pacific. They contacted Frank Pixley, a man whom they knew was a friend of Leland Stanford, president of the Southern Pacific. In 1886, Pixley joined with the original investors as a partner in the Pixley Townsite Company. The company purchased additional land in the vicinity. When The Southern Pacific extended its tracks to the Townsite, the town prospered. The terms of sale for the land was 25% down, the rest to be carried back for three years by the owners at 8 percent interest. The partners made a handsome profit. Special railroad fares were offered to people in other areas of California and as far away as Boston in order to bring potential customers to see the new lands and the investment possibilities near Pixley. The first house built in Pixley was for Emma Pixley, the widow of Frank Pixley's brother William. Her three sons and daughter lived in the home. Emma bought a quarter section of an adjoining piece of land where she farmed until they moved back to San Francisco. Frank Pixley advertised the town named after him in his biweekly journal The Argonaut.John L.

It was released at the Plaza Cinema in London on 3 September 1959. It features Ted Ray in his only Carry On role, alongside series regulars; Kenneth Connor, Charles Hawtrey, Kenneth Williams and Hattie Jacques. Leslie Phillips and Joan Sims make their second appearances in the series here, having made their debuts in the previous entry, Carry On Nurse. A young Richard O'Sullivan and Larry Dann ‚Äì making the first of his four Carry on appearances ‚Äì turn up as pupils. Plot During the current term at Maudlin Street Secondary Modern School, William Wakefield (Ted Ray) ‚Äì who has been at the school for 20 years ‚Äì is acting headmaster. He spots an advertisement for a headmaster of a brand new school near where he was born and decides to apply for the post. Because of a coinciding visit by a Ministry of Education Inspector (Miss Wheeler, played by Rosalind Knight) and the noted child psychiatrist Alistair Grigg (Leslie Phillips), he decides to enlist the help of his staff to ensure that the school routine runs smoothly during their visit. While in conference with his teaching staff (including Gregory Adams (Kenneth Connor), science master; Edwin Milton (Kenneth Williams), English master; Michael Bean (Charles Hawtrey), music teacher; Sarah Allcock (Joan Sims), gym mistress and Grace Short (Hattie Jacques), maths teacher); a senior pupil (Robin Stevens, played by Richard O'Sullivan) overhears that Wakefield is planning to leave at the end of term. The pupils are fond of the venerable teacher and Stevens immediately rushes this information to his schoolmates. They plan to sabotage every endeavour that might earn Wakefield praise, which would set him on the road to his new post. On arrival, Grigg and Miss Wheeler are escorted by Wakefield on a tour of inspection and the pupils go out of their way to misbehave in each class they visit. However Griggs' tour has not been in vain: he has taken a shine to Sarah Allcock, the gym mistress and it is obvious the feeling is mutual. Miss Wheeler is disgusted at the behaviour of the children towards the teachers, but is softened when she visits the science master's class, where she feels an instinctive maternal affection for the charm of the nervous science master, Adams. Wakefield realises his position as headmaster of the new school is in jeopardy and, on seeing Miss Wheeler's interest in Adams, enlists his help. He asks Adams to make advances to Miss Wheeler to win her over. Adams is aghast at the thought, but eventually agrees to do his best. After many unsuccessful attempts to tell Miss Wheeler of his love, Adams finds an untruth has become truth and finally finds enough courage to declare his love. The pupils meanwhile, have been doing everything in their power to make things go wrong, and on the last day of term are caught trying to sabotage the prizegiving. They are told to report to Wakefield's study and after much cross-examination he learns the reason for the week's events ‚Äì the pupils simply did not want to see him leave. Wakefield ‚Äì deeply moved ‚Äì tells the children he will not leave and will see them all next term. Miss Wheeler, softened by her newfound love, announces that she intends to tell the Ministry that staff-pupil relationships at the school are excellent.

Joan Sims, who was the first to spot the incident, yelled, \\"Charlie, Charlie, your mother's bag is on fire!\\".

Its provisions apply primarily to football matches played in England and Wales. Amendments to the Act were made through the Football (Offences and Disorder) Act 1999, the Football (Disorder) Act 2000, and the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006, the last of which repealed large sections of the Football Spectators Act 1989. The aim of the Act was to identify individuals known to cause disorder at and around football matches, whether in the UK itself or abroad. It was originally intended that fans would have to give a passport number to become part of a membership scheme and receive an identity card so as to go to away matches, but eventually this was not enacted. Football-related offences The Act and its amendments identifies a number of specific offences related to fan behaviour, including the throwing of objects onto the field or into the crowd; racist or obscene chanting at a match; violence against persons or property, including threats and endangerment of any person's life; a variety of alcohol- related offences; and the bringing or being in possession of fireworks into or at a designated sporting event. However, almost any criminal offence connected with a game that occurs within 24 hours on either end of a football match can also be designated as a football-related offence. The Act also introduced the football banning order (FBO), under which a magistrate can ban an individual from attending football matches (whether either domestic or foreign) for a period of 2‚Äì10 years and can also impose additional restrictions. FBOs are usually imposed by the court after someone has been convicted of a football- related offence, although they can be imposed even on individuals charged but acquitted of such offences, or in response to police representations that the FBO would prevent football-related violence or disorder.

The five men's conviction were overturned in February 2009, because they had improperly been interviewed by France's intelligence officials, who were not authorized to act in a law enforcement role. On February 17, 2010, the Court of Cassation, a higher court, ordered a re-trial of the five men. Mourad Benchellali's McClatchy interview On June 15, 2008, the McClatchy News Service published articles based on interviews with 66 former Guantanamo captives. McClatchy reporters interviewed Mourad Benchellali in France. In his interview Mourad described how he and Nizar were tricked into traveling to Afghanistan by his older brother Menad Benchellali. He described how they found Afghanistan nothing like what they expected. He described not speaking Pashtu, Dari or Arabic, but they met some Algerians who spoke French, who suggested they attend a religious camp. During his interview Mourad described what it was like to attend the training camp: a lot of praying; lectures on jihad; physical training; some weapons training, which did not include any weapons. He said he and Nizar realized the only way to leave the camp early was to fall ill, so they pretended to fall ill, only to be sent to the camp infirmary. But then he said Nizar really did fall ill, eventually losing 45 pounds. Mourad described reconnecting with Nizar after his time at the camp was over, and asking the Algerians for help leaving Afghanistan. They told them they would have to wait a few weeks while arrangements were made, but then the USA attacked, and it was not possible to leave. French trial Nizar Sassi, and four other French citizens, were convicted in 2007 of \\"criminal association with a terrorist enterprise.\\" They had their convictions overturned on appeal on February 24, 2009. Their convictions were overturned because they were based on interrogations conducted in Guantanamo, and the interrogations were conducted by French security officials, not law enforcement officials. Sued American officials Sassi and Mourad Benchellali sued several senior American officials, over the torture they were subjected to there. Retired General Geoffrey Miller, a former commandant of the Guantanamo camp, as well as being the architect of torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib was called upon to testify. Their lawyer, William Bourdon, characterized Miller's non-appearance as \\"a dual act of contempt against the French judiciary; he both refused to appear and to provide any explanation about his role and that of the US administration.\\" William Haynes, formerly the Pentagon's Chief Legal Counsel, was called to testify in October 2016.

The group often defends the role of the French language, and champions Quebec sovereignty. Songs such as \\"ROC Rap\\" and \\"R√©sistance\\" highlight the band's political leanings, and their strong advocacy for Quebec to be an independent country. Their song \\"Le But\\" was previously used as the goal song of the Montreal Canadiens and was played after every goal the Canadiens scored at the Bell Centre until the start of the 2017-18 NHL Season. \\"Le But\\" is now the win song for the Canadiens. Beginnings In 1999 the band adopted the name 'Locos Locass' and then changed it to 'Loco Locass', also adding new band member Chafiik (Mathieu Farhoud-Dionne). The band musicians besides the trio of Biz, Batlam and Chafiik are Jeanse, Djip, Lester G, V√∂V and Tchi Tchi Novo SolmolLoco Locass MySpace site about the participating musicians Criticism and controversy Loco Locass's self-image as a vehicle for promoting the sovereigntist option has played into existing social divisions. These divisions have played out on several occasions: St-Jean Concert: on June 24, 2005, the group took part in a show marking the government-designated Quebec National Holiday organised by Les Cowboys Fringants at Montreal's Parc Jean- Drapeau. The ten-hour politicized show's $40 entry fee was controversial, as was its sponsorship by Coca-Cola and Gillette, companies some left-wing nationalists identified as \\"Anglo-Saxon imperialists\\", leading to charges that the show constituted elitist competition with a long-established event at Parc Maisonneuve. Federal Funding: Loco Locass are not among the sovereigntist artists whose political stance leads them to boycott federal funding programmes. In particular, some of their recordings have received federal recording industry subsidies. Federalists have charged that this poses an integrity problem, since they accept funding from the very level of government whose rejection they seek to promote. Federalists Leave Home: Biz was reported during the spring of 2006 as suggesting that those who do not support the sovereignty option should leave Quebec. Some also accuse Biz's of taking part of the history of accusations of disloyalty by nationalists. Activism On 25 February 2010, Chafiik of Loco Locass signed, together with 500 other artists, a call to support the international campaign for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israeli apartheid.Tadamon!: 500 Artists Against Israeli Apartheid  Documentary  On August 19, 2005, in Rivi√®re-du-Loup, Quebec, Loco Locass played five of their songs accompanied by a young string orchestra of musicians aged 12 to 17, an initiative of Camp Musical St-Alexandre director-conductor Mathieu Rivest. The five songs were La censure pour l'√©chafaud, La bataille des murailles, L'empire du pire en pire, Antiam√©ricanisme primaire and Lib√©rez-nous des lib√©raux, to which music by Prokofiev, Berlioz, and Stravinsky was added. Partners included T√©l√©-Qu√©bec, Vid√©o Femmes and Audiogram, and a documentary entitled Symphonie Locass was released in the winter of 2006.

With readership spread among 250 newspapers in the United States alone, the comic strip acquired a highly devoted but relatively small group of fans during its 23 years of operation. The comic strip, in general, was about a blue-collar worker named Mike Motley and his wife Mabel Motley. Truman Motley (Mike and Mabel's son) eventually fell in love and married a woman named Tacoma. From that marriage came two sons. Mabel's older brother Abel was often collaborating with his wife Buffy. Her role in being the middleman in the \\"friendly rivalry\\" between her brother Abel and her husband Mike is ultimately cancelled out by his mutual respect of both Abel and Buffy; they have a desire to visit Mabel on an occasional basis. According to a 1997 comics poll conducted by the New York Daily News, Motley's Crew was elected as the 28th most favorite comic strip among readers and visitors to the official Internet site. The comic strip was considered to be more popular than B.C. (still in publication) but less popular than Broom- Hilda (still in publication). However, it also voted as the 30th least favorite comic strip in the same poll; indicating that more people liked the Motley's Crew comic strip than hated it. Templeton and Forman created the comic in 1976. It was first syndicated by what is known today as Tribune Content Agency on September 6 of that year. Templeton and Forman were working together on it until Forman's death in 1996. After Forman's death, Templeton continued alone. It continued until January 1, 2000. (Scroll to the left for this comic strip.) The final week's strips dealt with the cast trying to cope with the possible effects of the Y2K bug. Earl had the computers in the factory \\"bug proofed\\" but for the year 3000. Mike had to fix the computers so they were ready for the year 2000 instead. (Scroll down and to the right for this comic strip.) On the first day of the year 2000, the final comic strip ever to be printed presented long-time fans and casual readers with a sign with the words \\"This space for rent.\\" Since then, Motley's Crew comic strips have been sought by collectors of contemporary comic strips. Archived comic strips can be viewed on Google News Archives by simply typing in the name of the comic strip. However, not all issues of the Motley's Crew comic strip are available to view on the Google News because they stopped scanning old newspapers in May 2011. Cast of characters =Mabel Motley= In the comic strip Motley's Crew, Mabel Motley was a stay-at-home mother. Her eyes were drawn throughout the comic strip series as a simple narrow dot. Mabel's primary task in the family was to cook and clean while her husband was working and providing a paycheck for the family unit. Eventually, she became a grandmother later in the lifetime of the comic strip. Mabel revealed some of the aspects of her personality during her time as a wife and a mother. She would frequently complained about her husband spending his weekend afternoons doing nothing but watching sports on the television. With all the masculine elements that the comic strip portrayed, having Mike Motley married to her provided a feminine balance to the comic strip. Mabel jokingly described her marriage to Mike as a \\"no-huddle marriage\\" when they were receiving marriage counseling. (Scroll to the left for this comic strip.) She proudly maintains a \\"smoke-free\\" house to the chagrin of her husband's friend Cronin. Some issues of the comic strip would show Mabel having a developed bust line, particularly if she is wearing a nightgown. (Scroll down and to the left for this comic strip.) Gardening to an extremely strict daily routine was also a part of her life; even to the point of doing it in a terrible rainstorm and worrying her adult son Truman. (Scroll down and to the left for this comic strip.) Setting her husband straight was always one of Mabel's things that kept her occupied. After Mike tried to bend the rules for certain situations, she would get upset with him. Strong criticism is often a part of being around her husband Mike. For example, a situation occurred where Mike refused to wear a necktie to a wedding service. Mabel even forced her husband put on a formal outfit that wasn't exactly perfect in order to create an illusion of dignity for Mabel's side of the family. Abel and Buffy are two beloved members of her family; with Abel being her brother and Buffy being her sister-in-law. Like his brother-in- law Mike, Abel has been known to enjoy a good drink of beer. (Scroll right for this comic strip.) However, Abel and Buffy both have a \\"friendly rivalry\\" against Mike; a stereotypical trait used throughout mainstream media when depicting in-laws. =Mike Motley= In the comic strip Motley's Crew, Michael \\"Mike\\" Motley was a middle aged unskilled factory worker (later being promoted to webmaster). He is of Scottish descent; a discovery that he made while on a trip to Europe and coming home to America wearing a traditional Scottish kilt. (Scroll down and to the left for this comic strip.) Unlike his wife, Mike would have wide eyes; depicted by a large hollow ellipse surrounding a simple black dot. He worked for his employer Mister Drudge and was married to his equally middle aged wife Mabel, who occasionally got to see her husband watching the New York Yankees instead of monitoring the plant on \\"Take Your Spouse to Work Day. (Scroll up and to the left for this comic strip.)\\" Even with his busy schedule of work, family, and bar life, Mike still had time to travel the world. His drinking habits eventually got him in trouble with his doctor; causing Mabel to hide his beer until he returned to a healthy weight. (Scroll slightly down and to the left for this comic strip.) When his son Truman hit hard times at his workplace, Mike was there to lend him a hand and help him recuperate from his losses. During Abel and Buffy's visit, Mabel had to have a formal outfit in reserve for Mike in order to give off an illusion of expensive taste in apparel. This one-time gag appeared on the August 28, 1997 episode of the comic strip; the visit took place on a leisurely Thursday afternoon. Mike was chosen to wear an effeminate white tie outfit consisting of a black jacket, white bow tie, white tuxedo shirt, white vest and black formal trousers for Abel and Buffy's visit. The effeminate outfit somehow got a flaw in it from Mike struggling to get it on; making him look like a fool in front of his in-laws. After the visit is over, even his wife Mabel is glad to see her brother and his wife leave the house. She is lying down in the couch all exhausted because Abel and Buffy were acting in a hyperactive manner throughout the house. Mike's Rivalries In the comic strip, Mister Drudge was considered to be an autocratic factory manager. He personally ran the fictional corporation Drudge Industries, Inc., which was a company involved in the manufacturing industry. His signature was on every paycheck that Mike Motley and his other subordinates received after working. The coarse nature of his operations is what kept the workplace in perfect working condition. Traditional gender roles reigned supreme in his factory. In addition to all that, Mister Drudge also had an obedient female secretary that was always ready to take orders from him. His last name came from a word that means \\"labor\\" or \\"work.\\" Very rarely did anyone receive a pay raise or a promotion in his manufacturing company. It was never officially explained when a \\"friendly rivalry\\" between Mike, Abel, and Buffy began; a firm example of this rivalry was on an August 28, 1997 episode of the comic strip. The fact remained that any good intentions that Abel and Buffy had were quickly repulsed by Mike Motley at first glance. Mike always realized his hatred for Abel and Buffy when they arrived at a time when he wanted to be with his wife and not have to deal with her relatives on a social trip. Mabel always got him in the mood for all their visits because Abel and Buffy were a part of her family by birth. Mike always complains about either Abel or Buffy doing something wrong to him or his property at the end of their visits. Since Mabel has to be nice to her brother and his wife, she usually took his remarks with a grain of salt and have him look suitable for the occasion. Mabel's relatives were always a thorn according to her husband Mike; especially Abel and Buffy. He never really like any of her relatives because of their eccentric quirks. Buffy was always too obsessed with being clean while Abel was a frugal handyman. Mike was never much for cleanliness and he did not particularly wanted to be a handyman; he was a factory worker by trade and had the pride of a factory worker. Being the main character of the comic strip meant being exposed to the most gags throughout the series, and this gag would eventually become par for the course throughout the remaining two years of its run. =Abel and Buffy= Abel and Buffy provided comic relief when Mabel coerced her husband into embarrassing situations. This fact was especially revealed in a comic strip that was published on August 28, 1997. Abel is portrayed in the comic strip as wearing a business suit, white dress shirt and a necktie while Buffy is wearing a black sweater, a long skirt and an elegant white handbag on her body. As a couple, they jointly made their way to Mabel and Mike Motley's house to see their embarrassed brother-in-law Mike Motley completely dazed and confused from events that they did not see; particularly from Mabel giving her husband a pair of black eyes. (Scroll down for this comic strip.) Mike Motley would end up seeing his wife's sister and brother-in-law come into the living room in order to create an elegant experience to their visit. His bald spot was now considered to be more clearly shown because his wife lacked the proper knowledge in how to comb a man's hair (this shallow attempt at being perfect was taken by Mabel because she didn't want her brother and his wife to think that her husband is going bald). Buffy had a medium-sized nose and her eyes were constantly hidden by thick eyeglasses. Meanwhile, Abel and his sister Mabel shared a common trait for narrow eyes and blond hair. His nephew Truman would also inherit the blond hair that is a dominant feature for that side of the family. =Truman and Tacoma Motley= Truman and Tacoma Motley were second-generation characters created by Ben Templeton and Tom Forman in order to provide the main characters Mike and Mabel Motley with children of their own. They appeared in the American comic strip Motley's Crew. Truman Motley (born circa 1971) was the son of Mike and Mabel Motley and the nephew of Abel and Buffy. He shares the same blonde hair as his mother Mabel while his physical appearance resembled a younger version of his father Mike. Despite enduring economic troubles in the mid-1990s and temporarily losing his job, Truman had a secure marriage and a happy life. (Scroll slightly up and to the right for this comic strip.) Truman sometimes worries about his mother doing things that she shouldn't do; like the time where she got the crazy idea to do her daily gardening in a heavy rainstorm. Even though the rain was providing natural water to the flowers, Mabel had to use water from her garden hose in order to keep up her normal routine. Like his parents, Truman is not a fan of his Aunt Buffy's obsessive habits in the kitchen and questioned her for alphabetizing the pantry. Tacoma Motley was the wife of Mike and Mabel Motley's son in addition to being the niece-in-law of Abel and Buffy. She married the Motley's son Truman out of her love for him. Some of the comic strips show her with a slight bust line. Tacoma's willingness to have a career and to be a mother at the same time shows the contradictions between the Truman Motley family and the Mike Motley family. As the equivalent of Michael Stivic from the television show All in the Family, Tacoma shared the same liberal values as Gloria Stivic's husband in the TV show. Their children were born sometime around the year 1988 and were first introduced around August 1998 with the appearance of fraternal male twins. Eventually, they grew up to be children in the early stages of puberty that confuse their grandfather's work clothes for the baggy clothing that was popular among youth in the late 1990s. At least one of the grandsons was informally called \\"Junior\\" throughout the late 1990s running of the comic strip. =Earl and Abigail Bird= Earl Bird was the African-American next-door neighbor of Mike and Mabel Motley and a fellow worker at Drudge Industries and they were seen working side by side. Earl usually had a cigar in his mouth and was the most incompetent person in the comic strip; once confusing a microwave for a television set. When he was captured and forced to steer a ship, he took command of the ship until it collided with land in the middle of Kansas. The humor behind that scenario was that ships cannot land in Kansas; Earl was clearly an incompetent sailor and no clear explanation was given about the reason of giving him command of an entire ship. During the earlier years of the comic strip, Earl complained about the white flight from metropolitan cities into more suburban areas due to rising crime in the inner sections of North American cities. Humor was added when Earl talked about the things that suburban people had (swimming pools, shade trees, lawns) and complained about not being able to afford to move out of an inner city environment to enjoy them. Abigail Bird was Earl's wife who had suffered for a long time with him. =Mister Drudge= In the comic strip, Mister Drudge was considered to be an autocratic factory manager. He personally ran the fictional corporation Drudge Industries, Inc., which was a construction company. Very rarely did anyone receive a pay raise or a promotion in his construction company. Never on a first name basis with anyone, Mister Drudge insisted that his first name was \\"Mister.\\" Mister Drudge was considered to be a very young person, with red hair, very young skin, and a white bow tie. He also appeared content in his successful life running a major corporation at his age. Some of his clich√©d adventures involved being marooned on a desert island while hallucinating about his riches and his hired lawyers. Through some form or another, he always got rescued from the island but not before being surrounded by sharks, the golden sands of the island, and a meager palm tree. This tragic event would happen to Mister Drudge exactly four times in the course of two years. =Cronin= In the comic strip, Cronin made infrequent appearances; usually as comic relief within Mike Motley's workplace. He is usually drunk and hanging out at the same neighborhood bar as Mike Motley; occasionally drinking beer alongside him. When Cronin gets drunk, Earl usually has to drive his friend Mike home and faces the consequences for the various stunts that he fulfills while he is inebriated. Cronin became the laughing stock of the entire workplace when God claimed that \\"only people who wear their underwear on the outside can go to Heaven.\\" Even the other workers have fun at Cronin's expense at work the next day when he does crazy stuff. He usually hangs out of the bus stop; indicating that Cronin's lifestyle doesn't allow him to maintain an automobile. Cronin also carries a lunch box with him most of the time. Unlike his friend Mike Motley, Cronin was the swinging bachelor who desperately looked for girlfriends of ill repute. He used the payphone at the local bar in order to contact the \\"women of his dreams. (Scroll to the left for this comic strip.)\\" =Yuri Litnov= Yuri Litnov was Mike Motley's friend from Russia (which was part of the Soviet Union during most of the comic strip's production). He provided Cold War humor from the perspective of what Americans were conditioned to believe to be the \\"enemy\\" during the Cold War years. This character was used the most often during the Mikhail Gorbachev administration. While Yuri was visited by his friend Mike Motley in the then-current Soviet Union, Yuri rarely traveled to America. The reason for Yuri's lack of visits to the United States was that financial and security reasons prevented citizens from the Soviet Union from entering Western Bloc countries during that time. During the 1980s when the Soviets were warming relations with the United States, Mike (representing the United States of America and his capitalist employer) had fewer financial and security restrictions upon entering the Soviet Union. Yuri was fortunately enough to become a casino owner in Moscow, Russia as of March 28, 1994; effectively becoming one of the Russian oligarchs who financially dominated Russia during the 1990s. However, he would lose everything to a divorce; forcing himself to be shipped via a cargo crate to America. Ben Templeton has a strong interest in the former Soviet Union and has made a novel about the country called The Last Decathlon; which is a thriller novel that takes place in the 1980s. Politics and conservatism Despite other comic strips changing completely with the times to suit a younger audience, older fans of the comic strip wanted to keep traditional gender roles present in the comic strip as much as possible. Therefore, any changes to the main characters were seen as temporary and made to look as foolish as possible in order to create a laughter effect. Like the other suburban residents, Mike owned a car in which he used to travel to work and play. In addition to factories, houses, and office buildings, the neighborhood also had a bar, a health clinic, a church, a beach, and other fine places where Mike, his friends and family all worked and played at. Humor was found in the least expected places like a reception area in a hospital being confused for a place where footballs are caught in an American football field for a touchdown. Rarely were any of the characters were seen walking, jogging, or using any form of mass transit on Motley's Crew as the characters never saw anything else but automobile travel as a priority for the characters. Environmentalists were still seen as the \\"potential destroyers of the country\\" because Mike didn't want to fix his faucet for $30 ($ in today's money) instead of buying a new one for $10 ($ in today's money). After establishing its core audience in the 1970s and 1980s, the comic strip started to deal with issues that they deal with. Middle aged people and the elderly were considered to be the target demographic for this comic strip throughout its entire run. Home computers and microprocessors were dealt with as processors of bills and income (as opposed to electronic video games) in a comic strip back in 1982. Political issues (such as the mistakes made by the Department of Defense in the late 1980s) were dealt with in a conservative but humorous manner. Conservatism could also be seen with stereotypical images of young people graduating from college. The newly graduated student joins the real world with his philosophy degree and ends up becoming a shepherd. At the end of that comic strip, the sheep were thinking \\"How come we always get stuck with the philosophy majors?\\" References =Notes= External links * Comic Strip Fan Category:1976 comics debuts Category:2000 comics endings Category:Comic strips set in the United States Category:American comic strips Category:Comic strips syndicated by Tribune Content Agency Category:Comics about married people Category:Russia in fiction Category:American comics characters Category:Gag-a-day comics Category:Satirical comics Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976 ","title":"Motley's Crew"},{"id":"3694282","title":"Red Hat Certification Program"},{"id":"3694283","text":"Dissanthelium is a genus of plants in the grass family.

The Court held that when a person was detained for the purpose of giving a breath sample under section 235(1) of the Criminal Code, they have the right to consult counsel. Since the police did not allow the accused to do so, they violated the accused's right to retain counsel. The Court ruled that the evidence was properly excluded. Background Therens had been driving drunk and collided with a tree. At the scene of the accident a police officer made a demand for a breath sample for analysis and required Therens to accompany the office to the police station to take a breathalyzer test. As a result of the test, he was charged with driving with a blood alcohol level above 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. At trial, Therens applied to have the evidence of the breathalyzer excluded. He argued that the failure of the police to allow him to consult counsel at the police station infringed his right to be informed, upon arrest or detention, of his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, as guaranteed by under section 10(b) of the Charter. The evidence therefore should be excluded under section 24(2) of the Charter. The trial judge accepted that argument, excluded the evidence, and acquitted. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal upheld the acquittal. The Crown then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Decision The Supreme Court observed that detention can arise from a reasonable perception of the detainee, stating ‚Äúmost citizens are not aware of the precise limits of police authority‚Äú. It is reasonable that a person could ‚Äúassume lawful authority and comply with the demand‚Äú believing it to be a detention. Since Therens was detained, the police were required under s. 10(b) to permit him to consult counsel. Failing to do so was a breach of his right to counsel, warranting exclusion of the breathalyzer certificate under s. 24(2). External links R. v.

They connected into the \\"Big Ledge\\" quarry on the north side of Lithonia, half a mile from the Georgia Railroad and on a route of about a mile to the quarries at Pine Mountain on the east side of Lithonia (on tracks that were formerly Pine Mountain Granite Company railroad). On the south side of the Georgia Railroad, the ASM&L; had a 4-mile line from Lithonia to the quarries at Arabia Mountain, a former Lithonia & Arabia Mountain Railroad opened ca. 1889. At Stone Mountain, the ASM&L; had a line from the Georgia Railroad around the north side of the mountain to the granite quarries on the eastern slope. It was constructed soon after the Civil War by a predecessor company. Ownership and closing of lines Ownership of the quarries included the Venable brothers and then Davidson Mineral Properties, Inc. of Lithonia, who became the owner of the railroad. The line was dropped due to competition from other quarries, trucks, alternatives to dimension stone, and the Great Depression. The Arabia Mountain line was abandoned in 1935 and the Stone Mountain quarry was acquired by the Works Progress Administration and run for another five years. The quarry tracks were taken up in 1942. Rail use continued at the Lithonia quarries on the north side of the Georgia Railroad for several more decades before being closed. ASM&L; gave up its charter as a railroad and merged into Davidson Mineral Properties on November 19, 1997, and the Pine Mountain line was pulled up leaving only the line into the Big Ledge quarry. The ASM&L;'s locomotive was moved to another Hanson quarry before being replaced for in-plant use by a Trackmobile. It is still operated by CSX. Conversion to parkland and rail-trail DeKalb County acquired 400 acres of Arabia Mountain from Davidson Mineral Properties to create a nature park in 1972.

It is the largest Protestant denomination in Thailand and is considered to be the largest by group of Protestant members in Thailand.Accepting the Christian faith in Thailand, Christian Research Association History It was founded in 1934 as the Church in Siam with the intent of forming a single ecumenical denomination to include all Protestant churches in Thailand. Other than a small number of American Baptist and British Churches of Christ congregations, most of the original member churches were originally Presbyterian congregations, many of which were started by missionaries from the American Presbyterian Mission Board. The merger also included Lutherans from the German Marburger Mission. The C.C.T. originally had seven districts, six geographical and one ethnic Chinese. Except for a brief period during World War II, Presbyterian missionary influence remained predominant in the C.C.T. until the late 1970s. Mission The Church of Christ in Thailand (CCT) is governed by the ‚ÄúConstitution of Church of Christ in Thailand (1998)‚Äù which is the supreme governing document of the denomination. The governing structure and management is divided into three levels which are the General Assembly of the Church of Christ in Thailand, regional churches, and local churches. At present, there are more than 1000 churches, church plants and preaching points, and approximately 160,000 members (2011 statistics). The various agencies which support the mission of CCT are classified into five parts. : 1. Evangelization and Church Development ‚Äì this agency's primary responsibility is to support regional and local churches and institutions, so they can minister on their own. : 2. Christian Life ‚Äì This agency's role is to promote and develop the role of Christian women, Christian youth, and Christian families to be witnesses of Jesus Christ and to promote the development of quality and proficient personnel. : 3. Ministry of Finance and Property ‚Äì this agency is responsible for managing the administration, finance, accounting, budgeting and all assets of the CCT, and for providing benefits for personnel in the CCT : 4. Education ‚Äì This agency's role is to develop Christian youth and church members in general, both formally and informally. : 5. Medical Ministry ‚Äì This agency is responsible for providing medical treatment, and physical, mental, social and spiritual support, including rehabilitative health and illness prevention, and to share Jesus Christ with hospital patients. Demographics Since 1990, the denomination has experienced a major demographic shift. Tribal churches, mostly Baptist in origin, now account for about half of its total number of around 160,000 communicant members. CCT consists of Thai, Chinese, Karen, and English-speaking congregations.http://www.pcimissionoverseas.org/partners/item/18/church-of- christ-in-thailand-cct/ www.pcimissionoverseas.org/partners/item/18/church-of- christ-in-thailand-cct/ Theology The CCT is a member of the World Council of Churches,Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, ELCA companions in Thailand the World Communion of Reformed Churches and the Christian Conference of Asia and is often regarded as a \\"mainline\\" ecumenical denomination. The CCT maintains fraternal ties with the PCUSA and receives fraternal mission workers from that American denomination. However, despite the influence of liberal theology and ecumenical concerns at the top leadership levels in the period following World War II, such trends did not have a large impact on the majority of CCT pastors and church members.Kim, Samuel. \\"The Unfinished Mission in Thailand,\\" Seoul: East-West Center for Missions, 1980.

Sid James makes his debut in the series here, while early regulars Leslie Phillips, Eric Barker, and Shirley Eaton also turn up, although Phillips did not appear again in the series for 32 years. It was the first \\"Carry On...\\" film to include some nudity with Connor, Hawtrey, Williams, and Phillips baring their behinds during a shower scene. Plot A suburban police station is understaffed due to a flu epidemic, and Sergeant Wilkins, under pressure to maintain staffing levels, is pleased to hear that three new recruits, straight from training school, are due shortly. Before even arriving, the three policemen inadvertently assist some bank robbers into their getaway car, and are embarrassed when they learn the truth. The new constables are self-proclaimed intellectual and amateur psychologist PC Timothy Benson, former socially well-connected playboy and cad PC Tom Potter, and extremely superstitious PC Charles Constable. The arrival of WPC Gloria Passworthy, with whom Constable falls in love, and Special Constable Gorse completes the roster. Out on the beat, the new constables try hard, but are less than successful. Benson nearly arrests a plainclothes detective, and Constable believes he has heard a murder being committed, but it turns out to be a radio play. Potter investigates a report of an intruder, but finds a young woman in the bath and engages in a civil conversation with her about her recently broken relationship. Gorse, tasked to patrol with a police dog, is unable to control it. They have better luck when a wages robbery takes place. Benson and Potter locate the getaway car, and all four engage in a confrontation with the thieves, arresting them and recovering the money. Commended for his efficiency and excellent results, Inspector Mills is promoted to a training position and Wilkins is promoted to replace him. Charlie Constable gets his girl (with a little help from Sgt Moon) and stops being superstitious.

The Royal Mail Sorting Office in Manor Road and the railway footbridge over the GWR out of West Ealing is also seen as still standing today. Other scenes were filmed on and around St Mary's Road (including St Mary's Church) and the surrounding streets, Ealing W5. The store used was F.H. Rowse department store. The building was demolished in the early 1980s and was situated on the junction of Green Man Lane and Uxbridge Road in Ealing. Release The fourth film in the classic British comedy film series, Carry On Constable premiered at London's Plaza cinema on 25 February 1960. Reception Variety wrote, \\"At times it seems that the team is hard put to it to keep up the laughter pressure but, all in all, this achieves its objective of providing harmless merriment.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Carry on Constable\\". Variety. 2 March 1960. 6. Geoffrey M. Warren of the Los Angeles Times noted, \\"Most of the gags are visual in the tradition of Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Bros. and others, though no individual performer is of this caliber of comic performer.\\" He went on, though, to praise director Gerald Thomas for having \\"accomplished a remarkable amount of good cinema here. The situations are worked to perfection and always held within the limits of the possible, if just barely.\\"Warren, Geoffrey M. (3 June 1961). \\"'Carry On Constable' Carries On Slapstick\\". Los Angeles Times. Part II, p. 6. The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"The 'Carry On' series looks like becoming an anthology of all the slap-and-tickle music-hall jokes that have ever been cracked. The laughter here centres on dropped trousers, ample bosoms, innuendoes, female impersonation, lingerie and male nudity. Out of this frayed material a little comedy is coaxed by the familiar cast as they grapple with the random situations that pass for a plot.\\" Bibliography  * *Keeping the British End Up: Four Decades of Saucy Cinema by Simon Sheridan (third edition) (2007) (Reynolds & Hearn Books)  * * References External links * *Carry On Constable at The Whippit Inn *Carry On Constable at BFI Screenonline Category:1960 films Category:Carry On films Category:English- language films Category:British films Category:British crime comedy films Category:British black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Gerald Thomas Category:1960s crime comedy films Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios Category:Films produced by Peter Rogers Category:Films with screenplays by Norman Hudis Category:1960 comedy films ","title":"Carry On Constable"},{"id":"3694315","text":"Libman v Quebec (AG) [1997] 3 S.C.R. 569 is a Supreme Court of Canada ruling issued on October 9, 1997, which invalidated part of Quebec's referendum law dealing with the regulation of expenses by third parties during a referendum campaign. A former leader of the Quebec Equality Party, Robert Libman, took the case to court after the 1992 referendum on the Charlottetown Accord. The Supreme Court overturned the Court of Quebec, the Quebec Superior Court, and the Quebec Court of Appeal. The section of the Referendum Act that ruled out third party expenditure (s. 404) was considered incompatible with freedom of expression under section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Supreme Court found that the objectives of the Act \\"to permit an informed choice to be made by ensuring that some positions are not buried by others\\" and \\"to preserve the confidence of the electorate in a democratic process that it knows will not be dominated by the power of money\\" are valid and praiseworthy. However, ruling out third party expenditure altogether was too restrictive to be justified as a reasonable limit \\"prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society\\" as per section 1 of the Charter. The Supreme Court's judges suggested the Quebec legislature limit expenditure by \\"private intervenors\\" to $300 on \\"publicity expenses\\" to advertise the intervenor's views on a matter of public interest and raise the ceiling of $600 to organize a meeting to $1000. As a result, the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec was forced to drop charges on 20 people prosecuted under the Quebec Referendum Act for illegal spendings during the 1995 referendum on sovereignty.

Born in the United Kingdom in 1832, Humphrey worked as a clerk until convicted of forgery and sentenced to transportation. Erickson states that he was transported for life, but other records state fifteen years. Humphrey arrived in Western Australia on board the Stag in 1855, and received his ticket of leave two years later. For some time he was self-employed in Perth before working for William Locke Brockman until 1860, when he received a conditional pardon. In 1863 Humphrey was appointed to a teaching post at Quindalup, and the following year he married Mary (Bertha) Tapping at Fremantle. When his request for a salary increase was refused in 1868, he resigned as a teacher and spent the next five years working as a postmaster, bootmaker and agent at Quindalup. He then spent two years working as an auctioneer and agent at Fremantle. From 1875 to 1878 he was headmaster at Newcastle, then worked as an accountant in Perth for some time. In 1885 he advertised himself as a storekeeper in Perth. Ten years later he visited Melbourne before returning to live in the Canning district. He died in 1898.

This design is found quite frequently in Scotland, but is also seen in England, Ireland, Romania, Sardinia, and other locations. The evolution of its design was an expansion of the blockhouse or simple square tower from the Early Middle Ages. As building techniques improved, it became possible to construct a larger building footprint and a more complex shape than the simple blockhouse tower. A more compelling motivation for the L plan was the ability to defend the entrance door by providing covering fire from the adjacent walls. This stratagem was particularly driven by the advent of cannon used by attackers. It was common for the union of the two wings to have very thick wall construction to support a major defensive tower in the union area. For example, the stone walls of Muchalls Castle in Scotland are over 14 feet thick at the ground level. Built in the 13th century, these walls are thought to have supported a substantial defensive tower. A 17th-century reconstruction consisted of a probably equally tall structure, but one suited toward 17th century living and whose upper storey footprints mimicked the lower course. Other examples of Scottish L-plan castles are Culzean Castle built in the late 16th century in Ayrshire; Dalhousie Castle built as a 15th-century towerhouse near Dalkeith in the Lothian region; Dunnottar Castle a partially ruined castle perched on a cliff by the North Sea near Stonehaven; Erchless Castle, a 14th-century castle in Inverness-shire; Fernie Castle constructed in the 16th century in Fife; and Neidpath Castle built by Clan Fraser in the 13th century near Peebles. Irish L-plan castles include Balingarry Castle, which originated as a pre-Norman ringfort, but was modified as a high Middle Ages L-plan towerhouse; Balingarry Castle is located in the town of Balingarry. Gleninagh Castle is a 16th- century towerhouse in a state of partial preservation. The L-plan design is also present in Rathmore Castle in County Meath. As an eastern European example, one may look to Ilmov County, Romania to Herasti Castle, which includes elements of Italian Renaissance design. In Cagliari, Sardinia are two surviving structures known as the Torre dell'Elefante and Torre di San Pancrazio. Each of these towers, as well as a third structure destroyed by English and Spanish naval power, is an L-plan design. The structures date from the year 1300 and are each 30 metres in height. The towers served as important lookouts over the sea and toward the island interior.

Collection strengths include the Eugene and Clare Thaw Collection of American Indian Art, American fine and folk art, 19th and early 20th century photography, as well as rare books and manuscripts. The museum's mission is to connect its audience to American and New York State cultural heritage by organizing exhibits and public programs that \\"engage, delight and inspire.\\" The house organ was titled Heritage. The Fenimore Art Museum is closely associated with The Farmers' Museum, also in Cooperstown.  History  Fenimore Art Museum was founded in 1899 as the New York State Historical Association. In 1939, Stephen Carlton Clark, an art collector interested in history who also served on the board of the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum, helped organize a move to James Fenimore Cooper's former farmhouse in Cooperstown. In the mid-1990s, a new wing was added to the building to house the Eugene and Clare Thaw Collection. Fenimore House was subsequently renamed Fenimore Art Museum. Having operated under a dba as Fenimore Art Museum since the 1990s, and in an effort to better describe its wide-ranging activities, the organization applied to amend its charter and change its corporate name in 2017. As such, the New York State Board of Regents approved the updated charter on March 10 of 2017, formally changing the organization's name from New York State Historical Association to Fenimore Art Museum.

Clark and include works by Gilbert Stuart, Thomas Cole, William Sidney Mount, Benjamin West, Grandma Moses, Ralph Fasanella, and Lavern Kelley. = Thaw Collection of American Indian Art = Clare and Eugene Thaw donated their collection of indigenous American art to the Fenimore Art Museum in 1991. Items are continually added to the collection, which currently comprises more than 850 objects. = Photography = Fenimore Art Museum's photography collections feature a number of Cooperstown artists, the most well-known being the Smith & Telfer Collection. A portion of the firm's 60,000 piece archive has been digitized and is available online. = Research library = In 1968, a separate building was built to consolidate the library collections of both New York State Historical Association (as it was known at the time) and The Farmers' Museum. The Research Library supplements the missions and collections of both organizations by supporting research in local history, 19th century trades and agriculture, as well as art and material culture of Otsego County and surrounding areas of New York State.

The Court established a new formulation of the constructive trust as a remedy for unjust enrichment based on the ideas of Professor Donovan Waters, and in particular the requirements for such constructive trust in a common law relationship separation. The Pettkus formulation of constructive trust was subsequently adopted elsewhere in the common law world. Background Rosa Becker and Lothar Pettkus, two immigrants to Canada, met in 1955. They moved in together and lived as husband and wife, although they did not marry, and they had no children. Until 1960, Becker paid the rent and living expenses from her outside income and Pettkus deposited his income in a bank account in his name. In 1961, they bought a farm in Quebec. The money came from Pettkus' account and ownership (\\"title\\") was taken out in his name, as was the custom in those days. They shared the farm labour and both worked very hard. They turned their farm into a profitable bee-keeping operation. Becker also earned some income which was used for household expenses and to repair the farmhouse. Their savings went back into the farm or the Pettkus bank account. In 1971, with profits from the farm and more money from Pettkus' bank account, they purchased a property in Ontario and again registered it in his name. In 1972, Becker separated from Pettkus. He threw $3,000 on the floor and told her to take it, along with a car and forty beehives with bees. At his request, she moved back in with him three months later. She returned with the car, deposited $1,900 in his account, and the forty bee-hives without the bees. Shortly thereafter, with these returned assets, joint savings and proceeds from the sale of the Quebec land, they purchased another Ontario farm in Pettkus' name. They now had two valuable pieces of land, and in 1974 they moved and built a house upon one of them. They lived off their income from their thriving bee-keeping business. In the fall of that year, she left him for good, taking the car and $2,600 in cash. She also sued for a one-half interest in the properties, bee-keeping business and assets acquired through their joint efforts. Pettkus and Becker had lived together as husband and wife for almost twenty years. Under Ontario legislation at that time, a common law wife was not legally entitled to a share in any property owned by her husband. Therefore, any remedy for Becker would have to be based on the wholly equitable doctrine of constructive trust and principles of unjust enrichment. Reasons of the court Dickson J. set out three requirements for finding a constructive trust. There must be 1) an enrichment; 2) a corresponding deprivation; and 3) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment. In this case, Dickson found that the requirements were satisfied and held that Becker was entitled to half the assets. He held that: \\"where one person, in a relationship tantamount to spousal, prejudices herself in the reasonable expectation of receiving an interest in property, and the other person in the relationship freely accepts benefits conferred by the first person in circumstances where he knows or ought to have known of that reasonable expectation, it would be unjust to allow the recipient of the benefit to retain it.\\" Aftermath After the ruling in Becker's favour, Pettkus avoided paying out the money owed. When Pettkus's assets were finally liquidated, Becker's lawyer took most of the share, and left her with nothing. In a tragic turn of events, Becker committed suicide on November 5, 1986. The suicide note accused the legal system of forcing her to do it. Several provinces subsequently amended their family relations legislation to include common law relationships as to the division of family assets. (Under the Canadian Constitution divorce is governed by federal statute, property by provincial statute.) Pettkus with its new version of the constructive trust was soon adopted in Australia. The High Court of Australia enunciated a similar rule in Muschinski v Dodds (1985) 160 CLR 583 and Baumgartner v Baumgartner (1987) 164 CLR 137, albeit with the caveat that the complaining party must not have been responsible for the breakdown of the relationship.

When it was first published in 1938, Uncle Tom's Children included only four novellas: \\"Big Boy Leaves Home,\\" \\"Down by the Riverside,\\" \\"Long Black Song,\\" and \\"Fire and Cloud.\\" \\"The Ethics of Living Jim Crow\\" and \\"Bright and Morning Star,\\" which are now the first and final pieces, respectively, were added when the book was republished in 1940. The book's title is derived from Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, an anti-slavery novel published in 1852. Plot =The Ethics of Living Jim Crow= \\"The Ethics of Living Jim Crow\\" follows Richard Wright's own experiences growing up in the Jim Crow era. The essay begins with Wright's first encounter with racism as a child, when his attempt to play a war game with white children turns violent, and ends with a scolding from his mother, blaming him for the incident. The rest of the essay follows his experiences as a Black man in the South through his adolescence and adulthood. He describes his experiences with racism at his first job, at an optical company where his white coworkers increasingly bully and threaten him as punishment for wanting to learn skills that could allow him to advance, ultimately forcing him out. Wright describes the continuation of his \\"Jim Crow education\\" as he moves from place to place, witnessing violence against a Black woman that police officers punish her for, facing attacks on his own body from white youths, and working as a bell-boy in a hotel where white men have exploitative sex with Black maids, but where sex with a white prostitute means castration or death for a Black man. Wright's essay ends with a discussion of the complicated world view Black people must adopt in order to survive during Jim Crow, and asking the question \\"How do Negroes feel about the way they have to live?\\" =Big Boy Leaves Home= \\"Big Boy Leaves Home\\" is the story of Big Boy, a young black whose youthful excursion goes horribly wrong. Big Boy and his friends, Bobo, Lester, and Buck decide to go to the local swimming hole, which is owned by a white man who does not allow black people to swim there. Despite their initial reservations, they strip naked and proceed to play in the water. When a white woman comes upon the boys, they are unable to get their clothes back without being seen, and the woman panics, thinking she is being attacked. She calls for her husband Jim, who appears and shoots Lester and Buck, killing them. After a brief struggle between Big Boy and Jim, Big Boy takes control of the rifle and shoots Jim. Terrified, Big Boy and Bobo gather their clothes and flee the scene. The boys agree to run back to their homes apart, desperately trying to escape the imminent threat of lynching. Once Big Boy arrives at home, he relays the story to his mother and father, who gather members of their community in an attempt to save their son. Big Boy is sent off with some food to hide, lying in wait for an acquaintance of the family with a truck that will be able to take him away from the gathering mob. From his hiding place in the hills, he overhears white men discussing their search for himself and Bobo. Eventually, Bobo is captured by the mob, who tar and feather then burn and lynch him as Big Boy is forced to listen. In the morning, Will, the truck driver finds Big Boy and they drive off to Chicago Illinois, with Big Boy's future uncertain. =Down by the Riverside= \\"Down by the Riverside\\" takes place during a major flood. Its main character, a farmer named Mann, must get his family to safety in the hills, but he does not have a boat. In addition, his wife, Lulu, has been in labor for several days but cannot deliver the baby. Mann must get her to a hospital - the Red Cross hospital. He has sent his cousin Bob to sell a donkey and use the money to buy a boat, but Bob returns with only fifteen dollars from the donkey and a stolen boat. Mann must take the boat through town to the hospital, even though Bob advises against this since the boat is very recognizable. Rowing his family, including Lulu, Peewee, his son and Grannie, Lulu's mother, in this white boat, Mann calls for help at the first house he reaches. This house is the home of the boat's white owner, Heartfield, who immediately begins shooting. Mann, who has brought his gun, returns fire and kills the man, while the man's family witnesses the act from the windows of the house. Mann rows on to the Red Cross hospital but is too late; Lulu and the undelivered baby have died. Soldiers take away Grannie and Peewee to safety in the hills, and Mann is conscripted to work on the failing levee. However, the levee breaks, and Mann must return to the hospital, where he smashes a hole in the ceiling at the direction of a colonel - who then directs Mann to find him once everything's over saying he'll help Mann if he can - allowing the hospital to be evacuated. Mann and a young black boy, Brinkley, are told to rescue a family at the edge of town, who turn out to be the Heartfields. Inside the house, Heartfield's son recognizes Mann as his father's killer and Mann raises his axe thinking to kill the children & their mother but is stopped when the house shifts in the rising flood waters. Despite his terror that he might be recognized as Heartfield's murderer and accordingly facing the possibility of a brutal and torturous death, Mann takes the boy, the boy's sister and his mother to \\"the hills\\" and safety. There, Mann tries to blend with \\"his people\\", hoping he might find his family, until the white boy identifies Mann as the killer of his father. Armed soldiers take Mann away after tribunal with the general and then the colonel he'd helped at the Red Cross. Knowing he's doomed and vowing to \\"die fo they kill [him]\\" Mann runs and the soldiers shoot him dead by the river's edge. =Long Black Song= \\"Long Black Song\\" begins with Sarah, a young Black woman, caring for her baby as she waits for her husband Silas to return from selling cotton. Lonely, and tired by baby Ruth's needs, Sarah fantasizes about Tom, a man she knew before he was sent to war. As the sun goes down, a white salesman arrives and tries to sell her a graphophone. They make conversation, and as she gets him some water, he attempts to seduce Sarah. She protests, and runs to the bedroom where he rapes her. He leaves the graphophone, and says that he will return in the morning to convince her husband to buy it. When Silas returns, he sees the graphophone and suspects that Sarah has been unfaithful. Silas hates white people, and is livid when he figures out that Sarah slept with a white man. In a fit of rage, he drives her from the house, whipping her as she tries to escape. She eventually gets away from him, coming back to the house only to retrieve Ruth. She sleeps outside, away from Silas' grasp, and resolves to stop the white man from confronting him the next day. She is unable to head the salesman off, however, and when he arrives at the house, Silas whips and then shoots him. Sarah returns to Silas and tries to convince him to escape with her, but he relents that he can never be free in a white man's world despite all his effort. Sarah takes Ruth back into the hills, where she watches a white mob descend on Silas, attempting to kill him first with bullets and then by lighting the house on fire. The house burns down around Silas, who does not attempt to escape after having killed as many white men as he could. =Fire and Cloud= \\"Fire and Cloud\\" follows a preacher, Taylor, as he tries to save his people from a wave of starvation. Denied food aid by the white authorities, Taylor must return empty-handed to his church. There he finds a tricky problem. He has been talking about marching in a demonstration with communists, and they have come to visit him in one room. In another room, the mayor and the police chief have arrived to talk to him. Taylor has a history with the mayor, who has done him favors in exchange for his securing peace and order among the black community. However, if the mayor finds out about the communists, Taylor will be in trouble. First Taylor talks to the communists, who try to convince him to further commit to marching by adding his name to the pamphlets they distribute. Taylor gives them only vague answers. He then talks to the mayor and the sheriff, who try to convince him not to march. Again, Taylor is unsure of what to do as he feels that adding his name will threaten not only himself but his community. He successfully gets both groups out of the church without their paths crossing. Then he talks to his deacons. One among them, Deacon Smith, has been plotting to depose Taylor and take over the church. A car pulls up, and Taylor leaves the deacons to see who is in the car. Whites beat him and throw him in the back, taking him out to the woods. There, they whip him and make him recite the Lord's Prayer, in a move designed to keep him from marching. Taylor must walk back through a white neighborhood, where a policeman stops him but does not arrest him. Once home, Taylor realizes that this beating directly connects him to the suffering of his people, and he tells his son that the march must go on. Seeing that many in his congregation have also been beaten over the night, Taylor leads them in the march through town. He realizes that together, the pain of his being whipped and the strength of the assembled marchers, black and white people in one crowd, are a sign from God. The whipping is fire, and the crowd is the cloud God used to lead the Hebrews to the Promised Land. Might be a ma =Bright and Morning Star= \\"Bright and Morning Star\\" concerns an old woman, Sue, whose sons are communist party organizers. One son, Sug, has already been imprisoned for this and does not appear in the story. Sue waits for the other son, Johnny-Boy, to arrive home when the story begins. Though she is no longer a Christian, believing instead in a communist vision of the human struggle, Sue finds herself singing an old hymn as she waits. A white fellow communist, Reva, the daughter of a major organizer, Lem, stops by to tell Sue that the sheriff has discovered plans for a meeting at Lem's and that the comrades must be told or they will be caught. Someone in the group has become an informer. Reva departs, and Johnny-Boy comes home. Sue feeds him dinner, and they discuss her mistrust of white fellow-communists. Then, she sends him out to tell the comrades not to go to Lem's for the meeting. The sheriff shows up at Sue's looking for Johnny-Boy. The sheriff threatens Sue, saying that if she does not get him to talk, she had best bring a sheet to get his body. Sue speaks defiantly to the sheriff, who slaps her around but starts to leave. Then Sue shouts after him from the door, and he returns, this time beating her badly. In her weakened state, she reveals the comrades' names to Booker, a white communist who is actually the sheriff's informer. Sue realizes that she is the only one left who can save the comrades, and she dedicates herself completely to this task. Remembering the sheriff's words, she takes a white sheet and wraps a gun in it. She goes through the woods until she finds the sheriff, who has caught Johnny-Boy. The sheriff tortures Johnny-Boy before her eyes, but she does not relent or try to get Johnny-Boy to give up. Then Booker shows up, and she shoots him through the sheet. The sheriff's men shoot first Johnny-Boy and then Sue dead. As she lies on the ground, she realizes she has fulfilled her purpose in life. Literary significance and criticism One review of Uncle Tom's Children stated: \\"Uncle Tom's Children has its full share of violence and brutality; violent deaths occur in three stories and the mob goes to work in all four. Violence has long been an important element in fiction about Negroes, just as it is in their life. But where Julia Peterkin in her pastorals and Roark Bradford in his levee farces show violence to be the reaction of primitives unadjusted to modern civilization, Richard Wright shows it as the way in which civilization keeps the Negro in his place. And he knows what he is writing about.\\"Uncle Tom's Children & Native Son Reflecting on Uncle Tom's Children in his essay \\"How 'Bigger' Was Born\\" (included in the 1993 restored edition of Native Son), Wright himself named the work \\"an awfully naive mistake\\" which he did not wish to replicate.

It has a population of about 20,000. It is part of the municipality of Viersen. It received its town charter in 1364 thus being the oldest part of the municipality of Viersen. It lies in the administrative region of D√ºsseldorf. The river Nette having its source underground in the middle of the town rises near the town. The town motto is, \\"Gloria tibi Duelken\\", or \\"Glory to you, Duelken\\". History Parts of the old city fortificationMackenstein, a part of D√ºlken, is first mentioned 1135. D√ºlken itself appears in historic records 1210. The town was officially chartered as a city between 1352 and 1364. First settlements are dated to the time before the Roman Empire by tribes of Menapii and Eburones. Romans occupied the lower Rhineland and dislodged tribes that were not willing to cooperate until they finally withdrew in the second half of the 5th century. The Franks incurred the area as a County and ruled until about the 10th century. Due to different claims to power and political tensions, D√ºlken was heavily fortified since 1400 with a city wall, watchtowers and ditches. In the Thirty Years' War D√ºlken was briefly occupied by Spanish troops. During the First French Empire French troops occupied the city which officially became a French municipality of the Roer (department) between 1794 until 1814. With Napoleon\`s defeat, D√ºlken was assigned to the Prussia\`s Rhine Province. Except of a brief Belgian occupation between 1919 and 1930 (Occupation of the Rhineland), the town became first prussian, later a part of the German empire, finally of modern Germany. In 1945 towards the end of World War II, D√ºlken was conquered by the 9th US army and became part of as well Operation Grenade as of the Ghost Army in Operation Viersen, pretending a crossing over the Rhine close to D√ºsseldorf. Economy Marketsquare of D√ºlkenHaving a long history in textiles and fabrics, D√ºlken's economy has shifted since the 1920s towards engineering and since the 1970s towards various branches situated in the business park and industrial area Mackenstein. Simultaneously, a multitude of small and medium enterprises arose. With the closure of some engineering companies, the former factories were transformed into a number of smaller workshops and plants, a lot specialized in metal machining. Today (2014) the industrial area Mackenstein is going to be extended from D√ºlken to M√∂nchengladbach, reaching towards the Autobahn 52, in total a couple of a hundred acres additional to today's approximately . Big employers or important companies are Otto Fuchs Metallwerke (brass and bronze products, automotive supply), KraussMaffei (tooling technology), Mars (sweets, chocolate bars), Schwarzkopf Henkel (cosmetics), Dietermann (metal casting), Weyermann (textiles), Maxicard (credit card manufacturing), Peri (construction), Hoeren (construction), Doka (construction systems), DHL (logistics), Sturm (logistics), Knauf AMF (ceiling, windows). In addition, there is a wide range of highly specialized companies from programming of industrial robots by Eule Robotics or valves by Dresser Europe to water purification by Kurita Europe. Several small and medium IT-companies supply programming and customizing of systems and networks. Craftsmen and workshops provide component supply for different branches like automotive and / or engineering. The surroundings of D√ºlken are rural. Farmers grow the usual products of the Lower Rhine region plus a growing number of vegetables and fruits according to organic farming guidelines. Education D√ºlken has basic schools, three secondary schools (Gymnasium (Germany)) and a professional school for craftspeople, commercial tasks, healthcare and administration. A new type of school, the primus school was established 2014. Contrary to the split of pupils (after finishing primary school) into different levels of secondary schools in Germany, students can stay together until the 10th class. Traffic Old townTwo Autobahnen (motorways, interstates) touch D√ºlken, the A61 from Koblenz and the Cologne area to Venlo, Netherlands and the A52 from D√ºsseldorf to Roermond, Netherlands. 4 exits connect the area. Several bus lines connect D√ºlken to Viersen, M√∂nchengladbach and D√ºsseldorf as well as the complete back country towards the Dutch border. A train line runs from Cologne and D√ºsseldorf to Venlo with one or two passenger trains per hour in every direction from station D√ºlken. Major airports in the vicinity are D√ºsseldorf Airport DUS at about 40 kilometers, Weeze Airport NRN within 50 kilometers, Maastricht Aachen Airport MST in 70 kilometers, Cologne Bonn Airport CGN at about 80 kilometers, Eindhoven Airport EIN within 90 kilometers. In addition, the small D√ºsseldorf M√∂nchengladbach Airport MGL is suitable for business jets within 20 km.

Before that, various carnival societies celebrate sessions with humorous songs and satiric performances. The D√ºlkener Sch√∂ppenmarkt, a type of flea/junk market, which takes place on the day after the last Carnival parade on Ash Wednesday, is one of Germany's biggest. The D√ºlken Bierb√∂rse (beer fair) in July, situated on the marketplace and within the old town, offers beers from various regions and countries. M√ºhlenfest (mill festival), end of August with bands and shows on the market square. D√ºlkener Herbstmarkt (autumn market) begin of October. Here, local producers and traders offer various fruits and vegetables which are grown in the vicinity of the city ‚Äì often very rare sorts of apples or pears. In addition, small producers sell handmade mustard, jam, or oils up to mead. Various plants and flowers are available from local nurseries. Objects of interest Lifesize statue for a man emptying slurry pits before 1890The old town of D√ºlken consists of mainly houses from the period of Gr√ºnderzeit (promoterism) to about 1920 around the marketsquare, towered above by the church of St. Cornelius, one of the biggest churches in the Lower Rhine region. Some older structures close to the former city wall date around 1720. The Narrenm√ºhle \\"fools¬¥ wind mill\\" is domicile for a Carnival society: Narrenakademie \\"fools¬¥academy\\" with the moon as coat of arms. This is one of the oldest Carnival societies worldwide, dating back to 1554. The fool¬¥'s academy provides diplomas as \\"doctor humoris causa\\", e.g. for Salvador Dali, Neil Armstrong, Konrad Adenauer, current politicians or artists and local persons. A small museum shows curiosities and historic exhibits. Some parts of the old city fortifications (wall, watchtower, ditch). As curiosity, the citizens donated a lifesize bronze statue in 1980, remembering a man emptying slurry pits in the outskirts before 1890 as \\"an early example of outstanding service orientation\\". The place for this statue is more prominent than emperor Wilhelm's statue.

Mount Ithome (Greek: ·º∏Œ∏œéŒºŒ∑) or Ithomi, previously Vourkano(s) () or Voulcano(s) (), is the northernmost of twin peaks in Messenia, Greece. Mount Ithome rises to about , about over Valyra, the seat of Ithomi, the former municipality. The other peak is Mount Eva (), , connected to Mount Ithomi by a thin ridge long. Mount Ithome is north of Kalamata on the Gulf of Messenia, east of Pylos, seat of Bronze Age Messenia, and north of Messini, modern namesake of ancient Messene, nestled under the cliffs of Mount Ithome. From the top the whole valley of the Pamisos river can be viewed eastward to Mount Taygetus and southward to the Gulf of Messenia. The site is highly defensible and yet off the main road; in this case, the Kalamata-Pylos road. Etymology =Ithome= Like most ancient names the etymology of Ithome is not certain. It is also the name of a town in Thessaly, although Reece notes evidence that the one in Thessaly was originally called Thome. =Vurkano= The pre-independence name Vurcano has had many variants: Vourkano, Voulkanos, Vulcano, Voucano, Boulcano, Dorkano, Voulkani, etc. The name is not Greek. Its provenience, meaning and time of assignment are not known, like those of Morea. Ties to Vulcan or Volcano do not fit the geology. Ithome is not volcanic, evidences no volcanic deposits and its springs are not hot; in fact, they are known for their refreshing clarity and coolness. One of the earliest records of a place called Bulcano is The Domains and Fiefs of the Principality of Achaia, composed for Marie of Bourbon, 1364. The Grand Seneschal of the Kingdom of Naples, Niccolo Acciajuoli, is said to possess Lo Castello de Bulcano (Messene) as a fief. The monastery on top, which dates to no later than the reign of the Byzantine emperor, Andronikos II Paleologus, 1282-1328, was probably known as Vurkano even then. The earliest major incursion of a non-Hellenic ethnic group is the settlement of the Slavic tribes of the Melingoi and Ezerites in the 7th and 8th centuries in Messenia and Sparta around Mount Taygetus as a defensible location. In the 9th and 10th centuries they ruled Messenia. At the time many classical names were changed to Slavic, only to be restored after independence. The Archaeological Museum of Messenia dates the name Vourkano to the 10th century. It, like Morea, is probably Slavic. =Mavromati= Mavromati is segmented mavr-oma-ti, \\"place of the black eye\\" from mavros, \\"dark,\\" and omma, \\"eye,\\" or ommation, \\"small eye,\\" a common name for springs. Geography The klepsydra, or spring catchment, in Mavromati. Messene was downslope. Ithome looms in the background. The walls of Messene against a backdrop of Mount Ithome. The Homeric village of Ithome was probably on the summit, which is flat. In the Bronze Age, a temple dedicated to Zeus Ithomatas (Zeus of Ithome) existed there.Christian Habicht. Pausanias' Guide to Ancient Greece, University of California Press, 1998, p.58 It was torn down and rebuilt as a Christian church and monastery no later than the early 14th century from the same stone. In the 17th century this monastery of Panagia Voulkanou, or Moni Voulkanou, was closed, except for a caretaker, to become known as the Old Monastery. The new monastery was constructed on the lower east slope of Eva. It was a staging point in the Greek War of Independence and also houses a noted library containing ancient manuscripts. The classical town of Ithome was on the lower west flank of Mount Ithome, which forms a bowl in the side of the mountain. The location was selected as the site for the city of Messene (not the same as the modern city of Messini) when it was rebuilt by Epaminondas in 369 BC. Excavations there in recent decades have uncovered evidence of a settlement going back to the stone age. The location of Messene is marked by massive city walls that include the east side of the ridge, where they protect the ancient zig-zagging road to the summit, the top of the ridge, a wide area around the bowl and end against the mountain on the north, an approximately rectangular circuit. The mountain itself protects the east side. These defenses were probably restored, rather than constructed anew, by Epaminondas. Within the lower part of this wide circuit are the ruins of the ancient city. About up the slope is the modern village of Mavromati, occupying a small portion of the ancient city. It is a subdivision of the municipality of Messene. Mavromati is built around the key feature of the city, one which made its large size possible, a large surface spring flowing out of the mountain through a hole in the rocks. A klepsydra, or \\"spring catchment,\\" has been maintained as a village watering place. That is it is ancient is shown by the ancient system of channels constructed from it to the ancient urban area below. Mavromati is at , thus Messene was essentially at and Mount Ithome loomed at over it. As the most defensible point in the surrounding territory, Ithome was the center of Messenian resistance to Sparta during the Messenian Wars in the 7th and 6th centuries BC. Ithome was also the center of the Helot revolt in 465 BC after an earthquake in Sparta. This revolt is the Third Messenian War.

The 12th report of the Subcommittee was published in 1963, and included investigation of the Communist Party, the Constitutional Liberties Information Center, so-called Front groups and Black Muslims. The committee conducted an investigation of the John Birch Society, examining its literature, sent investigators to talk with supporters and critics, examined press accounts and worked for two years. On June 12, 1963, the subcommittee filed its 62-page report and released copies to the press.

While the committee reports stated that no inference of subversive activity should be construed by mention of a person or organization in their reports, the result was less circumspect.

History North Western Carlyle Works bodied Freight Rover Bayline Carlyle Works bodied Ford Transit In 1920, the Birmingham & Midland Motor Omnibus Company established a bus repair facility on land adjoining Rotton Park Reservoir. It initially performed repair work before chassis construction commenced in 1925. The eight acre site was redeveloped over a five-year period from 1949.Central Works MidlandRed.netBMMO celebrates Golden Jubilee Commercial Motor 3 December 1954 It derived its name from its address, Carlyle Road. The company was famous for building its own buses and coaches, under the BMMO name. These buses were typically very innovative and were the first to introduce many advanced features. When the development and production of its own vehicles became prohibitive in the late 1960s the central works continued to provide heavy engineering services for the company. On 1 January 1969, Midland Red became part of the National Bus Company, and Carlyle Works provided engineering services for other National Bus Company operators. These services included major vehicle modifications and adaptations. In the mid-1980s, minibuses became very popular for operators, allowing them to provide higher frequency service on routes that could serve areas larger vehicles could not access. Carlyle developed a range of bodywork for minibuses, notably Ford Transit conversions. On 5 September 1981, Midland Red was divided into five operating companies with the Carlyle Works retained to provide engineering support. On 5 March 1987, Carlyle Works became the 22nd National Bus Company subsidiary to be privatised.

Created by writer Dan Mishkin and visualized by artist Don Heck, she first appeared in Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #312 (February 1984), and is based on the mythological Antiope, one of the mythological Amazons. In most incarnations Antiope is depicted as the sister of Wonder Woman's mother, Queen Hippolyta. In the continuity of DC Comics' 2011 reboot, The New 52, she is also known as Alcippe, an incarnation that establishes her as Hippolyta's mother and the founding leader of the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall, who is worshiped by them as a sacred ancestor. In the 2017 DC Extended Universe live-action feature film Wonder Woman, she was portrayed by Robin Wright. Wright will return to portray the character in flashbacks in the upcoming film Wonder Woman 1984. Appearances =Pre-\\"Crisis\\"= Antiope is introduced in Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #312 in February 1984 as a high-ranking Amazon who is disillusioned with Hippolyta's rule, and plots to overthrow her. The character has no apparent familial relation to Hippolyta. She is eventually killed by Shadow Demons in Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #328, during the \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" crossover storyline. =Post-\\"Crisis\\"= Wonder Woman is devolved into nonexistence during the 1985‚Äì86 storyline \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", making way for a reboot of the character in February 1987. In the new backstory of the Amazons, the Greek Gods have taken the souls of women slain throughout time at the hands of men and sent them to the bottom of the Aegean Sea. Forming bodies from the clay on the sea bed, the souls come to the surface and become the Amazons. The first one to break surface is Hippolyta, who is elected Queen, and the second is her sister Antiope, who rules alongside her. An assortment of goddesses bestow them with various skills and powers, and give Hippolyta and Antiope each a Golden Girdle of Gaea, which enhances their strength and abilities. The Amazons eventually found the city of Themyscira in Anatolia and became known as fierce warriors of peace in Turkey, Greece and Rome. The demigod Hercules seeks to invade the Amazon city, but is subdued by Hippolyta. She invites him and his men to celebrate a potential friendship with a feast; hiding his anger and humiliation, he accepts, but then he and his men drug the Amazons and take them prisoner. Hercules steals Hippolyta's Golden Girdle, and his men abuse and rape the Amazons. The goddess Athena agrees to help the Amazons escape on the condition that they will not seek retribution against Hercules and his men, but the vengeful Amazons slaughter their captors. Athena demands that the Amazons serve penance for disobeying her, but though Hippolyta agrees, Antiope refuses and renounces all allegiance to the Olympian Gods. Leaving her Golden Girdle with Hippolyta to replace the one stolen by Hercules, Antiope leaves for Greece in search of Hercules and his general, Theseus. She is accompanied by a contingent of loyal Amazons, and her adopted daughter Phthia, the daughter of Queen Hypsipyle of Lemnos and the Argonaut Jason. In Greece, Antiope and Theseus fall in love and marry. They join their forces, but the Amazons resent serving beside the men who raped them, and the Greeks show no remorse or respect. Antiope and Theseus have a son, Hippolytus, but Theseus' jealous and vindictive former wife, Ariadne, murders Antiope and lays the blame on Phthia. Antiope's Amazons retrieve Phthia and the Golden Girdle stolen by Hercules, and leave Greece. Phthia assumes leadership of the group, who eventually become the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall. These Amazons settle in the Middle East, keeping the Golden Girdle and a bust of Antiope as sacred relics. They are mortal, but breed with outsiders and survive for centuries as coveted warriors. Hippolyta's daughter Diana, known as Wonder Woman, finds their city while searching for the villain The Cheetah in Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #29. Upon Hippolyta's death in Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #177, Antiope's ghost visits Diana, saying \\"There are other Amazons out there. Descendants of my tribe. Other offshoots‚ÄîDiana, you must seek them out, and guide them‚Äîand represent them in the world of man.\\" She and Hippolyta promise to watch and guide Diana. Abilities All Themyscirian Amazons possess various degrees of superhuman strength, speed, stamina and extraordinarily acute senses which were gifts they were blessed with by their gods. As shown by various tribe members, they have the capability to break apart steel and concrete with their bare hands,Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #59 jump over 12 feet from a standing position,Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #57 have a high durability factor,Wonder Woman: Our Worlds at War #1 (October 2001) enhanced healing,Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #30 and the ability to absorb and process a vast amount of knowledge in a short period of time.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #3 Themyscirian Amazons also possess the ability to relieve their bodies of physical injury and toxins by becoming one with the Earth's soil and then reforming their bodies whole again. The first time Diana does this she prays to her god Gaea saying: \\"Gaea, I pray to you. Grant me your strength. You are the Earth who suckled me, who nurtured and bred me. Through you all life is renewed. The circle which never ends. I pray you, mother Gaea, take me into your bosom. Please, let me be worthy.\\" During writer John Byrne's time on the comic it was stated that this is a very sacred ritual, to be used only in the most dire of circumstances.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #120 In other media Robin Wright as Antiope in Wonder Woman (2017) =Television= *In three episodes of the Justice League animated TV series in 2002 and 2003, Antiope is voiced by Maggie Wheeler. *She appears in one episode of the DC Super Hero Girls TV series.

Director Patty Jenkins said of Wright's casting, \\"For Antiope, I needed someone who seems under control and is not overly aggressive, but who is truly a badass.\\" Producer Charles Roven calls the character \\"the greatest warrior of all time\\". In the film, Diana is jointly raised by Queen Hippolyta, her sister General Antiope, and Lieutenant Menalippe; while Hippolyta wants to shield young Diana from the outside world, Antiope wants to train her as a warrior. Hippolyta and Antiope share the secret that Diana is Hippolyta's daughter with the god Zeus, and that their nemesis, the war god Ares, will someday try to destroy her as he did the other gods who opposed him. Going against Hippolyta's wishes, Antiope secretly trains Diana in combat, and ultimately convinces Hippolyta that though Diana's use of her powers will attract Ares, only learning to use them can save her. When the Germans later invade Themyscira in pursuit of Steve Trevor, Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana by taking a bullet fired from a German marine that was meant to target Diana. Hippolyta gifts Diana with Antiope's tiara when she leaves the island to accompany Steve back to Europe. * Antiope also appears in the 2017 film Justice League with Wright reprising her role.

The Berkeley Daily Planet. 17 Oct. 2003.  History  = Founding and collectivization = The Cheese Board was founded as a privately owned cheese shop in 1967 by Elizabeth and Sahag Avedisian (1930‚Äì2007). In 1971, the owners and their six employees converted their business from a conventional privately owned firm to an egalitarian worker-owned collective by distributing shares in the business equally between themselves and their employees and equalizing the wages of all of the new worker/owners.Cheese, Bread, and Thou. YES! Magazine. 16 July 2004. The semi-autonomous Pizza operation was started in 1990. The combined operation currently has over 55 workers. = Bread = When founded, the shop primarily sold cheese, but by 1975 the Cheese Board began to experiment with baking bread. Bread was originally produced in small quantities as an informal, impromptu sideline. Although bread sales were initially minor they marked a shift from a purely mercantile business model of buying and selling cheese to a mixed model that combines on-site, artisanal hand-production with domestic and import retail. The sale of baked goods grew rapidly, the baguette in particular. The Cheese Board popularized the baguette for U.S. customers. Bread now accounts for a significant portion of the store's business. As the sale of bakery products grew so did the variety of breads, pastries and other baked goods offered. The Cheese Board: Collective Works reports that, \\"The varying bread schedule is complex enough that even the workers have difficulty remembering it.\\" = Pizza = In 1990, a second semi-independent operation (which the members call an empowered committee), Cheese Board Pizza, was formed to produce pizza (originally sold as an occasional lunch and Friday night offering by the Cheese Board bakery) full-time. The pizzeria has thrived since then and often has a line out the door during lunch and dinner. Cheese Board Pizza is unusual in that only one type of pizza (always vegetarian)May, Patrick. Berkeley's renaissance: Culture, cuisine and more. San Jose Mercury News. 29 Nov. 2009. is made each day and no substitutions are allowed. Because the same product is continually being produced, customers always receive their pizza fresh from the oven without pre-ordering. Once a new pizza is ready, any remaining slices from the previous pizza are cut into slivers and given out as lagniappes. The Cheese Board staff tend to favor unconventional pizza toppings and use only fresh, seasonal produce. In 2007, Cheese Board Pizza renovated their shop and expanded into the space at 1512 Shattuck formerly occupied by University Plumbing and Hardware. The enlarged dining area seats significantly more people and allows faster service. The restaurant still has a piano and reserves floor space for the small jazz groups that often perform during peak hours. They often have special pizzas to celebrate occasions such as Bastille Day and Indian Independence Day. = The Cheese Board and the \\"Gourmet Ghetto\\" = The Cheese Board was one of the first gourmet establishments in north BerkeleyBhattacharjee, Riya.

Alice Waters, the founder of Chez Panisse‚Äîone of the most famous restaurants in the United States‚Äîstated that she chose to locate her restaurant in North Berkeley \\"so the Cheese Board would be nearby, because I knew I would be among friends\\". = Contribution to the Cooperative Movement = The Cheese Board has helped launch other cooperatives throughout its history. In 1971 it bid and won the contract to operate the Swallow Collective Cafe in the Berkeley Art Museum, an entity initially staffed by Cheese Board members but eventually became its own cooperative business with as many as 30 members. In 1975 it funded and launched the Juice Bar Collective before similarly spinning off this operation.Iravantchi, Sheirin. Cooperatives Look to More Than Just Profits. The Daily Californian. 7 Dec. 2000. In 1976 the Cheese Board helped a member begin a cheese store on Donner Pass.Collective Directory Group. The Cheeseboard. Bay Area Directory of Collectives. 1980. In the 1980s, the Cheese Board contributed money and labor to a Bay Area cooperative network known as the Intercollective, a precursor to the present-day Network of Bay Area Worker Cooperatives. Through the Intercollective it funded the printing of a directory, map, and essays about local collectives, as well as a 1981 conference. In the mid-1990s, after creating the Cheese Board Pizza, the collective continued its pattern of incubating new businesses, rather than expanding, by helping to create the Arizmendi Association of Cooperatives. This Association has replicated and refined three bakeries using the Cheese Board's recipes and organizational structure (in Oakland (1997), San Francisco (2000 and 2010), Emeryville (2003), and San Rafael (2010)). All six collectives are independently owned and operated, but share a technical support staff who provide financial, legal, and organizational services, and who are paid to continue replicating the model. All of the Arizmendi Bakeries have won \\"Best Bakery\\" award in local newspapers during their lifetime.What They Are Saying About Us. The Cheese Board is an active member of NoBAWC, San Francisco's worker collective network and the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives.

It is a combination of hydralazine (an antihypertensive) and isosorbide dinitrate (a vasodilator). It is the first race-based prescription drug in the United States. The combination preparation is marketed in the United States under the trade name BiDil by Arbor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. which purchased the rights to market the drug in December 2011 from NitroMed. Background From 1980 to 1985 Dr. Jay Cohn of the University of Minnesota led a clinical trial in collaboration with the US Veterans Administration called the Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT I) that tested whether the combination of Isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine increased survival in patients with heart failure; the results were promising and the study was followed by V-HeFT II, which tested the combination against enalapril.Jonathan Kahn. BiDil and Racialized Medicine. Chapter 7 in Race and the Genetic Revolution: Science, Myth, and Culture, Eds Sheldon Krimsky and Kathleen Sloan. Columbia University Press. In the meantime, Cohn applied for a patent on the combination treatment, which issued in 1989 as US Patent 4868179.US4868179 Cohn licensed the patent to a company called Medco, and Medco spent the early 1990s preparing a New Drug Application (NDA) to get the FDA to approve BiDil on the basis of the V-HeFT trials. However, the trials were not designed to support an NDA, and in 1997 the FDA rejected the application because it did not have enough statistical power to show whether the combination really worked. Cohn re-analyzed the data and found a signal that the drug combination appeared to work better in self-identified African- Americans in the V-HeFT trial, and published a paper on that work, and filed a new patent on the use of BiDil in black patients.Carson P, et al. Racial differences in response to therapy for heart failure: analysis of the vasodilator-heart failure trials. Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial Study Group J Card Fail. 1999 Sep;5(3):178-87.US Patent 6465463 It had already been known that African-Americans with congestive heart failure (CHF) respond less effectively to conventional CHF treatments (particularly ACE inhibitors) than caucasians. The new patent and the old patent were licensed to a company called NitroMed, which ran a clinical called the African-American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT), the results of which were published in 2004 in the New England Journal of Medicine. The clinical trial was stopped early because the drug worked so well; it reduced mortality by 43%, reduced hospitalizations by 39%, and improved quality of life markers in African-American patients with CHF. On the basis of A-HeFT, the FDA approved BiDil in June 2005.FDA approval process pageFDA approval press release In 2006, the Heart Failure Society of America included the use of the fixed dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine as the standard of care in the treatment of heart failure in blacks.Heart Failure Society of America. HFSA 2006 Comprehensive Heart Failure Practice Guideline J Card Fail. 2006 Feb;12(1):e1-e122. Though BiDil must still be taken three times daily, as must the component pills in separate ISDN-H treatment, the reduction in pill burden has been suggested to improve compliance, and thus a better medical outcome. Controversy The new drug application claiming treatment of a single, self-identified racial group raised a storm of controversy. Some hailed the development of BiDil as a breakthrough for African Americans (such groups included the Black congressional Caucus, the Association of Black Cardiologists, the National Medical Association, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and a step to addressing the unique health care needs and health disparities of the African American community.Dorothy Roberts. The Color Coded Pill. Chapter 8 in Fatal Invention: How Science, Politics, and Big Business Re-create Race in the Twenty-first Century. The New Press. Others who criticized the preliminary studies argued that the original study did not have a significant number of African-American subjects to make the BiDil's race specific claims,Roberts 2011, p. 171 and that the results of only one clinical trial where African-Americans were tested does not provide a full and comprehensive study.Roberts 2011, p. 174 Furthermore, critics argued that self-identified racial identifications from patients as an indicator for race during the trials were not a sufficient categorization method because these self-identifications were socially constructed and have no biological connection to genomic data.Roberts 2011, p. 175 They argued that the trials represented a new form of scientific racism where race, a socially constructed category, would continue to be present in research as a placeholder for genomic identification.WNYC Radiolab audio story about racial issues surrounding BidilEditors, Scientific American.

It is a relatively new dynasty, as are many of the dynasties originating in Hungary. However, the Dushinsky dynasty truly became a dynasty in Jerusalem, where it is centered today. It is not like other Hasidic groups in that it does not originate from a Hasidic background, but from the talmidim (students) of the Chasam Sofer. Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky (1865-1948), the Maharitz Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky, (1865-1948) The founder of the Dushinsky dynasty was Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky, son of Rabbi Yisroel Dushinsky. He was a disciple of Rabbi Simcha Bunim Sofer (Shevet Sofer), one of the grandchildren of the Chasam Sofer. After his marriage to the daughter of Rabbi Mordechai Winkler, author of Levushei Mordechai, Rabbi Dushinsky became the chief rabbi in Galanta, Slovakia. In an epidemic during the First World War, his first wife died childless, and he subsequently remarried Esther Neuhaus, daughter of Rabbi Yoel Tzvi Neuhaus. He relocated to the town of Chust, where he assumed the position of chief rabbi. In 1921, his only child, Yisroel Moshe, was born. In 1932, Dushinsky and his son visited Mandatory Palestine. The chief rabbi and founder of the Edah HaChareidis, Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, leader of the Haredi community of Jerusalem, died a few days later, and Dushinsky delivered one of the hespedim (eulogies) at the funeral. After his return to Chust, he was prevailed upon to succeed Sonnenfeld as Rav of Jerusalem. He and his family, together with 25 students, immigrated to Palestine on August 28, 1933. Dushinsky founded a community of Hungarian Jews in Jerusalem, affiliated with the Perushim section of the Edah HaChareidis. Dushinsky was known for his strong opposition to Zionism, and spoke to the newly formed United Nations against the creation of the Zionist State. Rabbi Dushinsky died on the eve of Sukkos, 14th of Tishrei 1948, shortly after the founding of the State of Israel. He was succeeded by Rabbi Zelig Reuven Bengis. Books written by him, or based on his work, include: * Shut Maharitz (halachic responsa) * Toras Maharitz (Chumash commentary) * Chiddushei Maharitz (Gemara commentary) Yisroel Moshe Dushinsky (1921-2003), the Maharim Rabbi Yosef Tzvi's only son, Yisroel Moshe, inherited his father's position as Grand Rabbi of the Dushinsky community, and in turn also became the Chief Rabbi of the Edah HaChareidis. Under his leadership, the Dushinsky community was steered towards Hasidut. Rabbi Yisroel Moshe died in 2003; he was succeeded as Chief Rabbi of the Edah HaChareidis by Rabbi Yitzchok Tuvia Weiss and as Grand Rabbi of Dushinsky by his son, Rabbi Yosef Tzvi. Dushinsky today A famous student of Rabbi Yisroel Moshe, Rabbi Avrohom Yitzchok Ulman is one of the members of the Rabbinical Court (Badatz), which leads the Edah HaChareidis. He also leads his own beth din, and is highly respected in Dushinsky, where he is regarded as the second most important person after the Rebbe. In 2005, a new large synagogue was inaugurated. It was built behind the old building on Shmuel HaNavi Street, and seats hundreds. The bochurim (unmarried young men) sit in a first-level balcony-like room, while only married men and their pre-bar mitzvah children sit in the main shul. Above the bochurim's balcony is another balcony for the women. The main synagogue is only used on Shabbos and holidays; on weekdays, a complex of four also brand-new smaller synagogues (shtiblach) in the basement of the building are used. The old synagogue, on the first floor of the old building, is now used for tishen. Rebbe Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky, the present leader of the movement, has appointed his younger brother, Rabbi Mordechai Yehuda Dushinsky, as rabbi of the Dushinsky community in the all-Haredi Beit Shemesh neighbourhood of Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet. Aside from the Dushinsky communities in Jerusalem and Ramat Beit Shemesh, there are also smaller communities in Elad, in New York's Boro Park district, and in London. In 2007, new Dushinsky synagogues were built in London and in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York, and building began for a new Talmud Torah in Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet, in addition to the recently completed synagogue there. There are also a number of Dushinsky Hasidim in Antwerp; however, there is no specific Dushinsky synagogue there. Dushinsky minhagim Dushinsky has several special minhagim (customs), in things such as the style of dress and the nusach used. The nusach used, called nusach Maharitz, is a mix of nusach Ashkenaz and nusach Sefard. This is not only the case with Shemoneh Esrei, but also with other elements of prayer: For example, between Kabbolos Shabbos and Maariv on Friday night, both Bameh Madlikin and Kegavno are said, and on Sukkos, the lulav is shaken both according to the nusach Ashkenaz and the nusach Sefard minhagim. Tachanun is said according to nusach Ashkenaz. No vidui is said at Mincha, as per nusach Ashkenaz. However, Kaddish and Kedushoh are said according to nusach Sefard, and Boruch she'omar is said after Hodu. Books held in high regard are the works of the Chasam Sofer, the book Shevet Sofer, and the collections of Torah commentaries by the previous rebbes: Toras Maharitz, and Toras Maharim. The study of mystical works is regarded as secondary to studying Halacha and Gemara. Regarding Zionism, the book Vayoel Moshe, written by Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum of Satmar, is regarded as authoritative, and received a praising recommendation from both the previous Rebbe (the Maharim) and Rav Avrohom Yitzchok Ulman when a new edition was printed in 2002.

The film revolves loosely around the activities of a job agency, 'Helping Hands', run by Sid James's character, Bert Handy. By now a fairly regular team was established with Sid James, Kenneth Connor, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims and Kenneth Williams all having appeared in previous entries. Hattie Jacques ‚Äì who was also a regular ‚Äì makes a cameo appearance during a hospital scene. \\"Professor\\" Stanley Unwin appears in a guest role, playing his trademark \\"gobbledegook\\" speaking act. This would be the final appearance in the series for early regular Terence Longdon. Liz Fraser makes her debut in Carry On Regardless and would appear in a further three Carry On films. Plot Down at the local labour exchange, everyone is moaning about the lack of decent jobs, unaware that nearby Bert Handy and his secretary Miss Cooling are attempting to fill vacancies, at a new enterprise called Helping Hands. When word gets round, people are quick to visit the agency, notably Sam Twist, Francis Courtenay, Delia King, Gabriel Dimple, Lily Duveen, Mike Weston and Montgomery Infield-Hopping. Bert decides to hire them all and at first business is slow. The only customer is a man who speaks gobbledygook but since Francis (who can speak 16 languages) is not present nobody can understand him and he goes on his way. Within a few days business picks up and Delia has an assignment to try on a complete women's wardrobe for Mr Delling, a gentleman who is planning a surprise for his wife. However things get complicated when the man's wife arrives home unexpectedly. Meanwhile Sam Twist is sent to a baby-sitting job, only to find that there is not a baby to be sat, instead there is Mrs Panting, a woman who needs to make her husband jealous, succeeding in the process with Sam getting a black eye. The following day, Francis is assigned to take a pet for a walk but when he gets to the owner's house, he finds out it is a chimpanzee. He takes the chimp for a walk and soon discovers that people who work in the transport industry have an aversion to apes. They eventually end up at a chimps tea party, enjoying a nice afternoon tea. Next is Lily Duveen, who has been employed at a wine tasting evening, to collect invitation cards from the attendees. After she has performed this task, she samples some of the wines and makes a bit of a spectacle of herself. Later a man from Amalgamated Scrap-Iron arrives in the Helping Hands office. He is obviously busy as he requests that someone take his place in the queue, at the hospital outpatients department. Bert says he will get someone on the case but the chap insists that the top man does the job himself, so Bert ends up queuing at the hospital where he is mistaken for an eminent diagnostician. The next job that Francis undertakes, is in the field of photography as a model. Obviously very chuffed that he has been chosen, he is crestfallen when he discovers that the job is an advertisement for a bee-keeper's helmet. His next job is between a bickering couple. The husband can not understand his wife, who continually berates him in her native German. Thanks to Francis getting a bit emotionally involved, the wife starts speaking English and the couple make up. Lefty Vincent, a boxing friend of Bert's, pops into the office. He requires four helpers to act as seconds, for his fighter Dynamite Dan. When they get to the venue, Dan is terrified by his opponent, Mickey McGee, so pretends that he has sprained his finger. The fight is off until Gabriel takes on McGee instead. Sam is excited over his next job. Due to a mix-up, he thinks he is on a top secret spying mission to the Forth Bridge (recalling Alfred Hitchcock's film of The 39 Steps), when all that is required of him is to make up a fourth in a _game_ of bridge. When Sam gets back, he learns that the whole of Helping Hands have been engaged to demonstrate exhibits at the Ideal House Exhibition (based on the real Ideal Home Exhibition). Needless to say all of the demonstrations end in calamity. Sam's next job is at an exclusive men's club, where no matter how hard he tries he can not keep silent, which is a strict rule of the establishment. Miss Cooling decides on a new filing system, for a more streamlined operation and job cards are put in cubby holes for each of the workers. Disaster strikes when the cleaner knocks the box down and puts the cards back all mixed up. Everyone gets someone else's assignment, with misunderstandings all round. Finally, the gobbledygook man turns up again and this time Francis is there to translate. He is their landlord and has been trying to inform Bert that he will have to vacate the premises, because he has had a better offer. Due to a show of unity by all the staff, the landlord agrees that they can stay, on the provision that they do something for him. His main interest is property development and he needs a house cleared and cleaned. Unfortunately the team end up demolishing the house but thankfully it turns out that the landlord has changed his mind and decided to demolish it and replace it with a luxury block of flats (or \\"flabberblob\\"), so all ends well.

The motion pattern of a system oscillating at its natural frequency is called the normal mode (if all parts of the system move sinusoidally with that same frequency). If the oscillating system is driven by an external force at the frequency at which the amplitude of its motion is greatest (close to a natural frequency of the system), this frequency is called resonant frequency. Overview Free vibrations of an elastic body are called natural vibrations and occur at a frequency called the natural frequency. Natural vibrations are different from forced vibrations which happen at the frequency of an applied force (forced frequency). If the forced frequency is equal to the natural frequency, the vibrations' amplitude increases manyfold. This phenomenon is known as resonance. In a mass-spring system, with mass m and spring stiffness k, the natural frequency can be calculated as: :\\\\omega _0 =\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{k}{m}} In electrical circuits, s1 is a natural frequency of variable x if the zero- input response of x includes the term K_1 e^{-s_1t}, where K_1 eq 0 is a constant dependent on initial state of the circuit, network topology, and element values. In a network, sk is a natural frequency of the network if it is a natural frequency of some voltage or current in the network. Natural frequencies depend only on network topology and element values but not the input. It can be shown that the set of natural frequencies in a network can be obtained by calculating the poles of all impedance and admittance functions of the network. All poles of the network transfer function are also natural frequencies of the corresponding response variable; however there may exist some natural frequencies that are not a pole of the network function. These frequencies happen at some special initial states.

It is used to add meat flavour in cooking, and to make broth for soups and other liquid-based foods. Meat extract was invented by Baron Justus von Liebig, a German 19th-century organic chemist. Liebig specialised in chemistry and the classification of food and wrote a paper on how boiling meat destroys its nutritional value. Liebig's view was that meat juices, as well as the fibres, contained much important nutritional value and that these were lost by boiling or cooking in unenclosed vessels. Fuelled by a desire to help feed the undernourished, in 1840 he developed a concentrated beef extract, Extractum carnis Liebig, to provide a nutritious meat substitute for those unable to afford the real thing. However, it took 30 kg of meat to produce 1 kg of extract, making the extract too expensive. Commercialisation =Liebig's Extract of Meat Company= Liebig went on to co-found the Liebig's Extract of Meat Company, (later Oxo), in London whose factory, opened in 1865 in Fray Bentos, a port in Uruguay, took advantage of meat from cattle being raised for their hides ‚Äî at one third the price of British meat. Before that, it was the Giebert et Compagnie (April 1863). =Bovril= In the 1870s, John Lawson Johnston invented 'Johnston's Fluid Beef', later renamed Bovril. Unlike Liebig's meat extract, Bovril also contained flavourings. It was manufactured in Argentina and Uruguay which could provide cheap cattle. =Effects= Liebig and Bovril were important contributors to the beef industry in South America. =Bonox= On the market in 1919 and created by the Fred Walker and Company Bonox is manufactured in Australia. When it was created it was often offered as an alternative hot drink with it being common to offer \\"Coffee, tea or Bonox\\". Today Meat extracts have largely been supplanted by bouillon cubes and yeast extract. Some brands of meat extract, such as Oxo and Bovril, now contain yeast extract as well as meat extract. For example, the current formulation of Bovril contains 41% beef stock, 24% yeast extract, 1% dehydrated beef and salt (3.88g sodium per 100g), spice extracts and flavour enhancers among other ingredients.

Heidegger introduced the term in 1954 in The Question Concerning Technology, a text based on the lecture \\"The Framework\\" (\\"Das Gestell\\") first presented on December 1, 1949, in Bremen. It was derived from the root word stellen, which means \\"to put\\" or \\"to place\\" and combined with the German prefix Ge-, which denotes a form of \\"gathering\\" or \\"collection\\". The term gathers together all kinds of entities and orders them in a certain way. Heidegger's notion of Gestell Heidegger applied the concept of Gestell to his exposition of the essence of technology. He concluded that technology is fundamentally Enframing (Gestell). As such, the essence of technology is Gestell. Indeed, \\"Gestell, literally 'framing', is an all- encompassing view of technology, not as a means to an end, but rather a mode of human existence\\". Heidegger further explained that in a more comprehensive sense, the concept is the final mode of the historical self-concealment of primordial œÜœçœÉŒπœÇ. In defining the essence of technology as Gestell, Heidegger indicated that all that has come to presence in the world has been enframed. Such enframing pertains to the manner reality appears or unveils itself in the period of modern technology and people born into this \\"mode of ordering\\" are always embedded into the Gestell (enframing). Thus what is revealed in the world, what has shown itself as itself (the truth of itself) required first an Enframing, literally a way to exist in the world, to be able to be seen and understood. Concerning the essence of technology and how we see things in our technological age, the world has been framed as the \\"standing-reserve.\\" Heidegger writes, > Enframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon which sets upon > man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of > ordering, as standing-reserve. Enframing means that way of revealing which > holds sway in the essence of modern technology and which is itself nothing > technological.Martin Heidegger, The Question Concerning Technology and Other > Essays (New York: Harper, 1977), p. 20. Furthermore, Heidegger uses the word in a way that is uncommon by giving Gestell an active role. In ordinary usage the word would signify simply a display apparatus of some sort, like a book rack, or picture frame; but for Heidegger, Gestell is literally a challenging forth, or performative \\"gathering together\\", for the purpose of revealing or presentation. If applied to science and modern technology, \\"standing reserve\\" is active in the case of a river once it generates electricity or the earth if revealed as a coal- mining district or the soil as a mineral deposit. For some scholars, Gestell effectively explains the violence of technology. This is attributed to Heidegger's explanation that, when Gestell holds sway, \\"it drives out every other possibility of revealing\\" and that it \\"conceals that revealing which, in the sense of poiesis, lets what presences come forth into appearance.\\" Later uses of the concept Giorgio Agamben drew heavily from Heidegger in his interpretation of Foucault's concept of dispositif (apparatus). In his work, What is an Apparatus, he described apparatus as the \\"decisive technical term in the strategy of Foucault's thought\\". Agamben maintained that Gestell is nothing more than what appears as oikonomia. Agamben cited cinema as an apparatus of Gestell since films capture and record the gestures of human beings. Albert Borgmann expanded Heidegger's concept of Gestell by offering a more practical conceptualization of the essence of technology. Heidegger's enframing became Borgmann's Device paradigm, which explains the intimate relationship between people, things, and technological devices. Claudio Ciborra developed another interpretation, which focused on the analyses of the Information System infrastructure using the concept of Gestell. He based his improvement of the original meaning of \\"structural\\" with \\"processual\\" on the etymology of Gestell so that it indicates the pervasive process of arranging, regulating, and ordering of resources that involve both human and natural resources. Ciborra has likened information infrastructure with Gestell and this association was used to philosophically ground many aspects of his works such as his description of its inherent self-feeding process.

It was based on an original story by Eric Barker. P&O; ‚Äì Orient Lines were thanked in the credits. Regulars Sid James, Kenneth Williams and Kenneth Connor appear in the movie whereas Joan Sims and Charles Hawtrey do not. Sims took ill shortly before filming began and was replaced by Dilys Laye, making her Carry On debut, at four days' notice. Hawtrey was dropped for demanding star billing, but returned for the next entry, making this the only entry during Hawtrey's 23-film run which he missed. Sims returned two years later in Carry On Cleo. Liz Fraser notches up the second of her four appearances here. Lance Percival makes his only appearance in the series in Carry On Cruising, playing the ship's chef, the role originally designated for Hawtrey. The Australian actor Vincent Ball also makes his first, of two, Carry On appearances. This film was notable for being the first in the series to be filmed in colour. Plot Captain Crowther (Sid James) has five of his crew replaced at short notice before a new cruise voyage begins. Not only does he get the five most incompetent crew men ever to sail the seven seas, but the passengers turn out to be a rather strange bunch too. The SS Happy Wanderer is the cruise ship and after this voyage, Crowther hopes to get a job as captain on a transatlantic ship, promising the crew members their jobs will be safe under the new captain. Starting off from England, the Happy Wanderer calls at unnamed ports in Spain, Italy and North Africa before going home again. Single ladies Gladys (Liz Fraser) and Flo (Dilys Laye) take the cruise, with Flo hoping to find a husband. Bridget (Esma Cannon) is her usual dotty and entertaining self, and one unnamed passenger (Ronnie Stevens) never disembarks but always goes straight to the bar to drink, to forget an unidentified woman. The crew and passengers settle in as the ship leaves port and head chef Wilfred Haines (Lance Percival) finds out he is seasick. Mario Fabrizi makes a quick appearance as one of the cooks under Haines. Ed Devereaux, best known for the part of Matt Hammond in the Australian TV series 'Skippy', appears as a Young Officer. Gladys and Flo fall for the PT instructor Mr Jenkins but nothing comes of it, especially when Flo turns out to be hopeless in the gym. Meanwhile, the new men try to impress Crowther but disaster follows disaster with him getting knocked out and covered in food at a party. Meanwhile, ship's doctor Dr. Binn (Kenneth Connor) has fallen for Flo, but she wants nothing to do with him so he serenades her with a song after leaving Italy (Bella Marie, sung by Roberto Cardinali), which she does not hear as she is asleep. Gladys, who has heard the song, realises that Flo is in love with Binn and with the help of First Officer Marjoribanks (Kenneth Williams) arranges a plot for Binn and Flo to get together. It works and the confident Binn finally confesses his feelings to a gobsmacked Flo, who returns his affections. Crowther lets the five newcomers know that they have improved since the cruise began, simply by doing their jobs and not by trying to impress him. They learn that the Captain has been in charge of the Happy Wanderer for ten years and decide to hold a surprise party for him, with the passengers. Haines bakes him a many-flavoured cake and the barman cables the former barman for the recipe of the Captain's favourite drink, the Aberdeen Angus. The party goes well and Crowther gets his telegram telling him he has the captaincy of the new ship. He turns it down as he recognises it does not have the personal touch of a cruise ship, and prefers the company of his own crew.

Whereas the natural sciences and social sciences seek to characterize physical systems and social systems, respectively, using empirical methods, the formal sciences are language tools concerned with characterizing abstract structures described by symbolic systems. The formal sciences aid the natural and social sciences by providing information about the structures the latter use to describe the world, and what inferences may be made about them. History Formal sciences began before the formulation of the scientific method, with the most ancient mathematical texts dating back to 1800 BC (Babylonian mathematics), 1600 BC (Egyptian mathematics) and 1000 BC (Indian mathematics). From then on different cultures such as the Greek, Arab and Persian made major contributions to mathematics, while the Chinese and Japanese, independently of more distant cultures, developed their own mathematical tradition. Besides mathematics, logic is another example of one of oldest subjects in the field of the formal sciences. As an explicit analysis of the methods of reasoning, logic received sustained development originally in three places: India from the , China in the , and Greece between the and the . The formally sophisticated treatment of modern logic descends from the Greek tradition, being informed from the transmission of Aristotelian logic, which was then further developed by Islamic logicians. The Indian tradition also continued into the early modern period. The native Chinese tradition did not survive beyond antiquity, though Indian logic was later adopted in medieval China. As a number of other disciplines of formal science rely heavily on mathematics, they did not exist until mathematics had developed into a relatively advanced level. Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal (1654), and Christiaan Huygens (1657) started the earliest study of probability theory. In the early 1800s, Gauss and Laplace developed the mathematical theory of statistics, which also explained the use of statistics in insurance and governmental accounting. Mathematical statistics was recognized as a mathematical discipline in the early 20th century. In the mid-20th century, mathematics was broadened and enriched by the rise of new mathematical sciences and engineering disciplines such as operations research and systems engineering. These sciences benefited from basic research in electrical engineering and then by the development of electrical computing, which also stimulated information theory, numerical analysis (scientific computing), and theoretical computer science. Theoretical computer science also benefits from the discipline of mathematical logic, which included the theory of computation. Branches Branches of formal science include computer science, mathematics, statistics, and systems science. Differences from other forms of science As opposed to empirical sciences (natural and social), the formal sciences do not involve empirical procedures. They also do not presuppose knowledge of contingent facts, or describe the real world. In this sense, formal sciences are both logically and methodologically a priori, for their content and validity are independent of any empirical procedures. Therefore, straightly speaking, formal science is not a science. It is a formal logical system with its content targeted at the real things, information and thoughts that we experienced. As Francis Bacon pointed out in the 17th century, experimental verification of the propositions must be carried out rigorously and cannot take logic itself as the way to draw conclusions in nature. Formal science is a method that is helpful to science but cannot replace science. Although formal sciences are conceptual systems, lacking empirical content, this does not mean that they have no relation to the real world. But this relation is such that their formal statements hold in all possible conceivable worlds ‚Äì whereas, statements based on empirical theories, such as, say, general relativity or evolutionary biology, do not hold in all possible worlds, and may eventually turn out not to hold in this world as well. That is why formal sciences are applicable in all domains and useful in all empirical sciences. Because of their non-empirical nature, formal sciences are construed by outlining a set of axioms and definitions from which other statements (theorems) are deduced. In other words, theories in formal sciences contain no synthetic statements; all their statements are analytic.

It has an 18-hole golf course, tennis courts, squash courts, a cricket oval, swimming pool and conference facilities. History The idea originated by Tom Field, who owned the land on which the course would be built. More than 50 enthusiastic golfers formed the Kloof and District Golf Club in 1926 and entered into a lease agreement with Field. This involved the club paying a modest rental to the owner of the , on which he had ploughed out 9 holes, and he retained the right to graze his cattle on the course. Field's Hotel served as the meeting place, watering hole and function venue of the club in the early years, and the club's membership swelled to 223 by early 1928. (134 of these members were Country members - those that lived beyond a radius of the course.) In 1929, the famous Stafford Vere Hotchkin was contracted to prepare a proposal to extend the course to 18 holes. Hotchkin, a retired colonel, had teamed up with Major Hutchinson and Sir Guy Campbell to form one of the great triumvirates of golf course architecture five years before, and their work is still held in the highest regard today. Their best-known creation is probably Woodhall Spa, home of the English Golf Union and a course that is consistently ranked in the top 10 in England and in the top 50 in the world. Hotchkin, during his visits to South Africa, also left his mark on such courses as East London, Humewood and Mowbray. During 1940, the club was told by the National Roads Board that a new road was proposed that would run through the course, lopping off at least three of the holes. The proposed plan for the road was shelved during the War years, but soon after the hostilities had ended, the construction of the road went ahead despite vehement protests from the club. The problem of losing holes was solved by more of Mr. Field's land being made available, and indeed it was soon after the \\"road issue\\" that Kloof Country Club came into being, with tennis courts, a cricket oval and squash courts. A redesign of the course was needed, and this task was entrusted to Bob Grimsdell, which he completed in 1951. We are unsure of how much of Hotchkin's work was left unchanged, but it must be assumed that Grimsdell didn't rework the holes that formed part of the original layout. Since then, Peter Matkovich was commissioned to make further improvements where necessary, which included the reconstruction of the greens and their surrounds, planting them with bent grass. This was completed in 1995. Kloof and Champagne Sports Resort are in fact the only courses in KwaZulu-Natal to have bent greens, (soon to be joined by Cotswold Downs in Hillcrest). Part of Matkovich's brief was to create space for a driving range.

This had the advantage of giving them targeted exposure to fans of similar bands, and downloaders were likely to give this free music a chance even if they'd never heard of the band. This gave My Diet Pill unexpected popularity which resulted in a raise of album sales, merchandising and the creation of fan-clubs (in Argentina and France).

It was a family festival of the Athenians, at which the newly born child was introduced into the family, and children of poorer families received their names. Wealthier families held a naming ceremony for their children on the tenth day called dekate. This ceremony, unlike the Amphidromia, was open to the public by invitation. No particular day was fixed for this solemnity; but it did not take place very soon after the birth of the child, for it was believed that most children died before the seventh day, and the solemnity was therefore generally deferred till after that period, that there might be at least some probability of the child remaining alive. According to Suidas, the festival was held on the fifth day, when the women who had lent their assistance at the birth washed their hands, but this purification preceded the real solemnity. The friends and relations of the parents were invited to the festival of the amphidromia, which was held in the evening, and they generally appeared with presents, among which are mentioned the cuttlefish and the marine polyp.Hesych. and Harpocr. s.v. The house was decorated on the outside with olive branches if the child was a boy, or with garlands of wool if the child was a girl; and a repast was prepared. The child was then carried round the fire by the nurse, and thus, as it were, presented to the gods of the house and to the family, and at the same time received its name, to which the guests were witnesses.Isaeus. De Pyrrhi Haered. p. 34. s. 30. Bekker. The carrying of the child round the hearth was the principal part of the solemnity, from which its name was derived. But the Scholiast on Aristophanes (Lysistr. 758) derives its name from the fact that the guests, whilst the name was given to the child, walked or danced around it. This festival is sometimes called from the day on which it took place.Hesych. and Aristoph. Av. 923; K. F. Hermann, Lehrb. d. gottesdienstlichen Altert√ºmer d. Griechen, ¬ß 48. n. 6.

It was founded in 1881 as the School of the Pharmaceutical Society of Victoria (now Pharmaceutical Society of Australia Victoria branch). After being housed in various places in Melbourne, it moved to its present location in 1960. The move to Parkville was largely funded by the massive private donation of ¬£25,000 by David Cossar.Did you know - (Monash Memo, 7 November 2007) At the time, this was the largest single donation to a pharmacy school in Australian history.Cossar Club launched in style - Wednesday 31 October In its early years, the College was essentially run as a private institution, with the majority of its funding coming from tuition fees and the donations of benefactors. In 1967, the College reached an agreement with the Federal and State governments for it to receive government financial assistance. In 1974, fees for tertiary education in Australia were abolished, meaning that funding for the College began to be sourced primarily from the Federal Government. After the introduction of the unified national system of higher education in 1988, known as the Dawkins reforms, it was clear that the College had to combine with a university. Negotiations were started with University of Melbourne, which was seen as the obvious partner, given their close proximity. However, these negotiations collapsed in 1990. The College then began discussions with Monash University, which were successful. The transfer was finalised on 1 July 1992 and became the Faculty of Pharmacy of Monash University. It celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2006. In August 2008, the Victorian College of Pharmacy underwent a name change to reflect its position within Monash, to the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

Route description State Route 211 crossing the Eel River State Route 211 looking north from the city limits of Ferndale, California Currently, Route 211 runs about 5 miles (8 km) from roughly the intersection of Main Street and Ocean Avenue in Ferndale north to US 101 in Fernbridge, crossing over the bridge of the same name over the Eel River. However, the highway was meant to extend south through the Lost Coast region to California State Route 1 near Rockport. This remaining 103 mi (166 km) of Highway 211 is unlikely ever to be constructed because of the steep and unstable highlands of the Lost Coast. The traversable route through Humboldt and Mendocino Counties is Chemise Mountain Road, Wilder Ridge Road, and Mattole Road, but these remain small mountain roads. SR 211 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

Professional career After being selected by the Atlanta Falcons in the second round of the 2000 draft, he started for 62 games in his first four seasons. However, a knee injury limited him to 6 games in the 2003 and the Falcons did not extend his contract. Although he signed with the Carolina Panthers as a free agent in 2004, he was cut during training camp. In 2005, Claridge played two games at the Right Tackle position with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the Canadian Football League. He played brilliantly in his debut and was voted MVP of the game. It was the first time any player in his first CFL game was voted player of the game. He was injured in his second game and did not play again. Death After being found unconscious at his home in Las Vegas, Nevada, he was transported to Saint Rose Dominican Hospital in Henderson where he later died at age 27.

The village is located two miles (3 km) east of Uckfield; the settlements of Blackboys, Palehouse and Halland form part of the parish area of 6,700 acres (2,706 ha). History It is likely that Framfield came into existence in the 9th century. Saxon invaders established many settlements along the Weald: the final -field in its name means a clearing in the forest to build such a place. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book (Framelle); part of the church has Norman stonework. John Levett died holding the manor of Framfield in 1552.Sussex Archaeological Collections, Sussex Archaeological Society, George P. Bacon, Lewes, 1875 He was succeeded by his son Laurence. By 1590 the manor of Framfield, which had been in the Levett family for centuries, came to Bromley and Branthwaite by letters patent in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Within several years it was in the hands of Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst and through marriage ultimately came to John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet. Richard Sackville, 5th Earl of Dorset subsequently purchased the manor of Framfield from the Earls Thanet.Historical Notes About Framfield, thesussexweald.org Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward had a population taken at the 2011 census of 2,741. Geography Framfield parish lies on the southern part of the Weald. An ancient trackway, probably used by the Saxons during their invasions, passes to the north of the village. Like many other such places, it was involved in the Wealden iron industry: there are many small streams (including Framfield Stream) which are tributaries of the River Ouse (Sussex) on which the mills stood.  The Framfield Show  Each year in the village, a f√™te is held involving shows such as dog, vegetable and photography competitions. It is a big event for Framfield. 2009 saw the addition of Terrier racing, which proved a success. Previous years have included other events and attractions, such as a 'Mouse Town'. The Framfield Show is usually held on the second Saturday of August. While overseen by the Framfield and Blackboys Horticultural Society, the Summer Show organisation has now passed to the local Show Committee. Blackboys Blackboys is a local village within the same parish as Framfield. There a number of theories about the source of the name ‚ÄòBlackboys‚Äô. The most interesting theory relates to the ancient industry of charcoal burning. The Blackboys Inn was founded in the 14th century as a coaching establishment. It is possible that the inn was also founded as an overnight lodge for the drivers transporting charcoal from the local woods to Lewes and other towns. In the 1960s it was owned by the comedian and actor Ronald Shiner. Located near Blackboys is Tickerage Mill, which was once the home of Vivien Leigh. After her death, her ashes were scattered on the mill pond. Religion There is a 13th-century church, dedicated to Thomas Becket,Framfield church website although it probably superseded a wooden Saxon one. In the 9th century it passed from the crown to the Archbishop of Canterbury, assuming its nomination as a peculiar. In 1509 a fire burned all the wooden parts of the church and the tower collapsed in the 17th century. In 1891 the church, including the tower, was restored and the bells were rehung.History of Framfield Church There is also a Baptist chapel, and there was a Methodist church at Blackboys. However, this has now been converted into houses. Education Education is provided by two Church of England primary schools: Framfield;Framfield CE Primary School and Blackboys.Blackboys CE Primary School Leisure and sport There are two inns in the parish: the Hare and Hounds in Framfield and the Blackboys Inn in Blackboys. Blackboys Cricket Club is based at the Blackboys Recreation Ground. Framfield and Blackboys Football Club is based at Framfield Recreation Ground. AFC Uckfield's Youth Team is based at Framfield Recreation Ground. Economy The main charcoal business of the parish stopped in the early 19th century when the iron industry moved north to the Midlands with their large deposits of coal.

Released on 7 November 1963, it was the first to have a screenplay written by Talbot Rothwell (although the first screenplay \\"Tolly\\" submitted to Peter Rogers was developed as Carry On Jack) from a story by Dick Hills and Sid Green (script writers for Morecambe and Wise). Regulars Sid James, Hattie Jacques, Kenneth Connor and Charles Hawtrey are all present. Liz Fraser makes her third appearance (and last for more than a decade) and Esma Cannon makes her fourth and final appearance. This was the first film in the series to feature Carry On regular Jim Dale, and the first not to feature Kenneth Williams in the cast. Carry On Cabby was originally planned as a non- Carry On film, called Call Me A Cab (after a stage play) but midway through development it became part of the Carry On series. The film notably from others in the series for its dramatic plotline of a troubled marriage. Plot Charlie Hawkins (Sid James) is the workaholic owner of thriving taxi company Speedee Taxis, but his wife Peggy (Hattie Jacques) feels neglected by him. When Charlie misses their fifteenth wedding anniversary, because he is out cabbing, she decides to punish him. Telling Charlie that she is going to 'get a job', she establishes a rival company, GlamCabs. The cars are brand new Ford Cortina Mk1s and driven by attractive girls in provocative uniforms. Flo, the wife of one of Charlie's drivers, is appointed to the post of office manager. Charlie continues to coach his mainly inept (and often ex-army) drivers, including the clumsy Terry \\"Pintpot\\" Tankard (Charles Hawtrey), whilst Peggy refuses to tell Charlie about her new job. Charlie feigns a lack of interest, but he is dying to know. As Charlie unsuccessfully struggles to cope with his wife's absences, and realises just what she had to endure, Peggy's company becomes a thriving success due to the large number of male taxi passengers preferring to ogle her sexy drivers during journeys. Speedee rapidly starts losing money and faces bankruptcy. Peggy feels terrible for what she has done. Charlie and his drivers attempt to sabotage the rival company, but they are chased off. In desperation, Charlie suggests a merger with his rivals, but is furious to discover who the real owner is and storms off. A month later, Peggy is living at the office and Charlie has turned to drink, allowing his company to collapse around him. Peggy and Sally (Liz Fraser) are hijacked by bank robbers. Peggy manages to use the taxi radio to subtly reveal their situation and location. Charlie intercepts the broadcast and rallies the other Speedee drivers in pursuit. The robbers are cornered and captured. Peggy and Charlie are reconciled, especially over the fact that she is expecting a baby.

He was the mainstay of the Surrey bowling attack during the 1930s and played four Tests before and after the Second World War. He also founded and ran a cricket school in Wandsworth that coached many notable players. \\"Good cricket was a crusade for one of the game's kindest men\\" wrote the cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, about Gover's long-standing coaching exploits. Playing career Alf Gover was born in Epsom, Surrey in 1908. A fast right-hand bowler with a deadly outswinger and a cleverly disguised breakback, Gover began bowling at a young age and was first taken on trial by Essex in July 1926. He bowled Johnny Douglas at the nets several times and travelled with Essex as twelfth man to The Oval in 1927. A chance conversation with Herbert Strudwick, the great Surrey wicket-keeper, led Gover to changing county because he thought his prospects would be brighter with Surrey. Gover played his first county match against Sussex in June 1928, but did not establish himself permanently until 1930. With Freddie Brown, Percy Fender and Maurice Allom available up to 1932, Gover did not play a major role, but with Brown and Allom moving into business Gover was called upon to bear a much heavier burden in the dry summer of 1933 and responded with 98 County Championship wickets. His advance was the result of curbing a tendency to overstep the crease, but his cumbersome action was still criticised even as his strong build of 188 cm (6 feet 2 inches) and 87 kg (13 stone 10 pounds), combined with vast capacity for work on the placid Oval wickets had him in contention for a Test place against such candidates as Bowes, Farnes, \\"Nobby\\" Clark and Copson. In 1935 Gover's progress was stalled by him shortening his run to conserve his energy, but when allowed his full run in 1936 Gover went from strength to strength. He took 54 wickets in May mostly on the placid Oval pitches, and carried on so well that he took 171 County Championship wickets for 15.42 each even when many pitches were too wet for him. He played for England against India at Old Trafford but the wicket was so good that even his energetic delivery could produce no venom. The following year (1937) Gover did equally well, again taking 201 wickets. He remains the only fast bowler to take that many wickets in a season, since Tom Richardson in 1897. Injury on a winter tour of India ended Gover's run of success: in 1938, apart from a week in late May and early June when he achieved his best figures of 14 for 85 against Worcestershire, Gover was clearly unfit (despite periods of rest) and had so little venom his haul of wickets fell from 201 to just 86. Though he recovered somewhat in 1939 with increased fitness, it was already evident Gover would struggle to regain the speed and venom of his two great years. However, when county cricket resumed after World War II in 1946 Gover, at 38, bowled so well under unfavourable conditions that he played in the Third Test against India. With his strong physique it was surprising he was not chosen for either the 1936/1937 or 1946/1947 Ashes tours. He decided 1947 would be his last year in county cricket, but Gover was still regarded as the best fast bowler in England, and there were calls for him to be selected for the last Test when Harold Butler withdrew and Alec Bedser was out of form. Coaching career After Gover retired from first-class cricket, he played a couple of matches in 1948 for Bedfordshire in the Minor Counties competition, taking 25 wickets at just over nine runs each. But after that he devoted his life to his cricket school in Wandsworth. He established this school in 1938 and had already trained a number of future Test players by the time of his last match for Surrey. However, in the following decades Gover gradually developed his school to such an extent that it became regarded as the most valuable school for the fine-tuning of cricketers' skills. His school, redeveloped from its humble origins as an industrial shed, was where many Test or potential Test players developed the necessary skill to rise to the highest levels in cricket. Frank Tyson, Viv Richards, Andy Roberts and Ian Bishop are some notable examples of players who benefitted from Gover's coaching. While covering the 1954‚Äì55 Ashes tour as a journalist he advised Tyson to shorten his run-up, which proved to be a turning point in the series.Frank Tyson, In the Eye of the Typhoon, The Parrs Wood Press, 2004 It was primarily for his work in cricket coaching, rather than his deeds for Surrey in the 1930s and 1940s, that Gover was awarded an MBE in 1998. Gover continued to be principal at his school until 1989, and he wrote widely on cricket right up to his death, in London, at the age of 93 in 2001. At the time of his death Gover was the oldest surviving Test cricketer, and his death left Bob Appleyard as the only living bowler who had ever taken 200 wickets in an English season. He was President of the Lord's Taverners in 1974 and President of Surrey for 1980. He was cremated at Putney Vale Crematorium.

He spent most of his career playing for Liga MX clubs Pachuca and Cruz Azul. He is known by his nickname, El Chaco because he hails from the Chaco Province. Club career =Argentina= From a very early age, Gim√©nez was playing football in a competitive environment. In 1989, he was signed by scouts working for Boca Juniors and was immediately enrolled in the team's youth squad. Almost a decade later, Gim√©nez debuted in the professional Argentine league with Boca Juniors and quickly enjoyed success, being part of the teams that won the Apertura '98, Clausura '99 and Apertura 2002 championships for the Xeneizes, as well as two international titles, the Copa Libertadores of 2000 and 2001. In 2003, Gim√©nez split time at Independiente and Uni√≥n and later returned to Independiente for the first half of the 2004 season. Then Gim√©nez migrated to Mexico, as he was transferred to Veracruz. =Mexico= At Veracruz, Gim√©nez was joined by a talented squad that included Walter Jim√©nez, Cuauht√©moc Blanco, Kl√©ber Boas, Braulio Luna and Gustavo Biscayzac√∫. In Gim√©nez's first season at Veracruz, the team led the entire league in points, with Gim√©nez scoring four goals throughout the regular season. Despite being the top-seeded team, Veracruz exited the playoffs in the first round. The following season, Veracruz lost Blanco and Boas in the transfer window, and new signing Leandro Romagnoli was not performing at top level despite his seven figure salary. As a result, the team's performance dropped and Veracruz missed the playoffs. Gim√©nez also saw a drop in production at a personal level, failing to score a goal despite increased play. Before the Apertura 2005 season, it was reported that Gim√©nez's old teammate, Cuauht√©moc Blanco, was trying to convince Am√©rica to sign Gim√©nez for the following season. The executives took Blanco's advice and Gim√©nez was signed to a contract shortly after. In his first season at Am√©rica, Gim√©nez scored three goals despite limited play (coming off the bench in eight of his nine appearances) and Am√©rica led the league in points at the end of the regular season. Strangely enough, the set of events that occurred during Blanco and Gim√©nez's (and Kl√©ber Boas, who also migrated to Am√©rica with Blanco in 2004) partnership in Veracruz repeated themselves at Am√©rica. Like at Veracruz, their team was the top-seeded club going into the playoffs, and like at Veracruz, Am√©rica failed to get past the first round of the playoffs, being defeated by UANL Tigres. Prior to the start of the Apertura 2006 season, Gim√©nez was transferred to Pachuca, who days before had won the Clausura 2006 tournament, defeating Club San Luis ‚Äì a sister club of Christian's last employer, Club Am√©rica. 2007 started promisingly to Gim√©nez, scoring 8 goals in three matches. Gim√©nez is a member of the \\"Blanco Four\\", a group of players who once played at Veracruz with Blanco and were signed by Am√©rica after being recommended by the striker. The other members are Kl√©ber Boas, Carlos Infante and Armando Navarrete. He left Pachuca on December 17, 2009 and signed for Cruz Azul. In the tornement Bicentario 2010 Gimenez was a quik starter for the team Cruz Azul, because of the coach Enrique Meza already knowing the great skills that Gimenez had from the years that Meza coached with Pachuca. Although Gimenez was one of the most important transfers of the season, he was not able to lead Cruz Azul to qualify for the quarter finals, and was only able to score two goals in 16 appearances. In the Apertura 2010 season, Gim√©nez was criticized by the media because of his bad performance in the first season, and was wanted to be kicked out of Cruz Azul. But on the fifth matchday of the season Gim√©nez scored his first hat-trick with Cruz Azul in a 3‚Äì2 win over Chiapas. In 2018, Gim√©nez returned to Pachuca on loan from Cruz Azul. International career =Argentina= Gim√©nez represented Argentina at the 2001 South American Youth Championship. Argentina finished the competition in second place but he was able to score two goals. In 2009 Diego Maradona called up Gim√©nez for Argentina's World Cup qualifiers in June against Colombia and Ecuador, but he did not play in any of the two matches. =Mexico= In July 2013, Gim√©nez became a naturalized Mexican citizen. On August 14, 2013, coach Jose Manuel de la Torre called up Gim√©nez for the Mexico national football team for a friendly against Ivory Coast, which Mexico won 4‚Äì1. Gim√©nez played in four games for Mexico as part of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, three games, those against Costa Rica, Honduras and U.S.A. resulted in losses. The other was a 2‚Äì1 victory over Panama on October 11, 2013. On October 30, the national football association of Panama requested that FIFA re-evaluate whether the player was eligible for Mexico. Gim√©nez maintains that he is eligible for Mexico and that his appearances were non-binding for Argentina as Argentina had already qualified for the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship as the host nation when he was playing for Argentina in CONMEBOL's 2001 South American Youth Championship. Gim√©nez said that Argentina were considered to be a guest in the 2001 South American Youth Championship.

In 2019 the UK affiliate of CBR targeted pregnant Labour MP and women's rights campaigner Stella Creasy by advertising on billboards and leafleting in her constituency. The advertising agency responsible for the \\"disgusting\\" billboards apologised, commenting \\"we accept that the content should have been scrutinised in greater detail and should not have been displayed\\" and removed the posters Some campaigning in the UK has been done under the banner of Abort67, a project of the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform UK, which was founded as a company in 2010. It has claimed at least ¬£29,000 in gift aid, according to its accounts, but is not a charity so is not eligible for these payments. The group's Irish offshoot campaigned against the legalization of abortion in Ireland, claiming to be exempt from laws forbidding foreign funding of political activity. Graphic images The CBR advocates displaying graphic pictures of aborted fetuses, as well as the dead bodies of Holocaust and lynching victims. The use of shocking abortion photos has resulted in the CBR being a relatively controversial organization. During their protest at Liberty University and The College of William and Mary, the group was met with condemnations by even the campus pro-life organizations, who view the group's tactics and messages to be neither helpful nor appropriate. Genocide Awareness Project The Genocide Awareness Project is a movable display which has been temporarily installed on multiple university campuses in the United States and Canada since 1997. The display includes pictures which are claimed to be of aborted fetuses or represent what an aborted fetus would look like, juxtaposed next to pictures of victims of genocide. In 2001, the display was mounted on trucks and driven round San Francisco Bay Area. This approach was also used earlier in Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Los Angeles area.\\"Abortion foes plan a convoy campaign Pictures of fetuses displayed on trucks\\", San Francisco Chronicle, November 24, 2001.

Sinfield played one Test in the twilight of his career in 1938, where he is best remembered for having Don Bradman as his first Test victim. However, he had a long career with Gloucestershire prior to achieving higher representative honours, during which his steadiness provided a contrast with the attacking style of cricket provided by batsmen like Hammond and Barnett or bowlers like Goddard.  Biography  Sinfield was born on 24 December 1900 at Benington, Hertfordshire. He played his initial first-class match for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) as early as 1921, but his potential was not noticed until 1924, when he began qualifying by residence for Gloucestershire. He was able to play for them in county championship matches in 1926, and showed an ability as a solid opening batsman for them in two innings of over a hundred. In the following years, Sinfield established himself as Gloucestershire's regular opening bat with Alf Dipper and after that player retired in a well-contrasted partnership with Barnett. He also developed as an accurate bowler of slow-medium off-cutters, much quicker and less flighty than Goddard. Though he did not accomplish anything remarkable, Sinfield was very consistent and reached a thousand runs every year from 1927 until 1935, in the process carrying his bat through an innings on five occasions ‚Äì the most significant being when he scored 161 not out in a total of 374 against Oxford University in 1931. Sinfield's skill as a bowler was slower to blossom because Charlie Parker and Goddard could do almost everything that was required until the end of 1931. Although he took ninety wickets for under twenty apiece in 1930, it was not until 1934 that Sinfield became recognised as a bowler of class. In that year, he headed the Gloucestershire averages and when the pitch helped him could be formidable indeed, as he showed with thirteen wickets against Nottinghamshire and eight for 40 against Leicestershire. The following year, despite the county's other batsmen declining, Sinfield had his best season with the bat, largely because he increased his range of scoring strokes without losing his defensive strength. In August that year he made his highest score, 209 not out against Glamorgan at Cardiff ‚Äì and followed that up with a haul of nine wickets for 103. In 1936, Sinfield developed so much as a bowler that he bowled considerably more overs than anyone else in the country. So consistent was he, until he fractured a finger in the second last match against Essex, that he took 160 first-class wickets and was considered, owing to his accuracy, a strong candidate for the winter's Ashes tour. His most notable feat was nine wickets for 111 against some extremely aggressive Middlesex batting at Lord's ‚Äì according to Wisden that record \\"fully demonstrated his steadiness\\" ‚Äì and only Goddard's return prevented Sinfield taking all ten. However, very much a natural opening bat, Sinfield was never comfortable when placed lower in the order and he fell well short of 1,000 runs. The following year, he was again tireless and recovered some form with the bat, just reaching four figures, but in 1938, his work as a bowler affected his batting so much that he was frequently as low as No. 10 and did not once reach forty in an innings. In bowling, however, Sinfield worked so well in the frequent absence of Goddard that he was chosen for the First Test at Trent Bridge. Though he was not successful apart from capturing Bradman's wicket and failed to retain his place, Sinfield did have a number of notable bowling feats, including 14 for 110 on a rain-affected wicket against Worcestershire. In 1939, Sinfield was asked to do much less bowling with Goddard fully fit and devastating on the helpful Bristol turf, but Sinfield did recapture some of his old skill with the bat. Though, since his record was only 835 runs and 66 wickets it could hardly be said he was in his best form. When first-class cricket resumed in 1946 Goddard continued his devastating form for several years, but Sinfield took immediately to coaching at Clifton College and Colston's School. During this period, he championed a number of future Test players, notably Chris Broad, and only retired in his mid-eighties, two years before his death on 17 March 1988 in Ham Green, North Somerset.

Created in 1985 by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the US Department of State, after devastating famines in East and West Africa, FEWS NET today is a valuable resource to a vast community of governments, international relief agencies, NGOs, journalists, and researchers planning for, responding to, and reporting on humanitarian crises. With support from a technical team in Washington, D.C., FEWS NET staff based in more than 20 country offices collaborate with US government agencies, national government ministries and international partners to collect data and produce objective, forward-looking analysis on the world's most food-insecure countries. Using an integrated approach that considers climate, agriculture production, prices, trade, nutrition, and other factors, together with an understanding of local livelihoods, FEWS NET forecasts most likely outcomes and anticipates change six to twelve months in advance. To help decision-makers and relief agencies plan for food emergencies, FEWS NET publishes monthly reports (available on its web site) on current and projected food insecurity, up-to-the-minute alerts on emerging or likely crises, and specialized reports on weather hazards, crops, market prices, and food assistance. In 2010, to mark its 25th anniversary, produced a video to document its work.  Methodology  FEWS NET reporting focuses on acute food insecurity‚Äîsudden and/or short-term household food deficits caused by shocks‚Äîrather than chronic food insecurity, ongoing or cyclical food deficits related to persistent poverty and a lack of assets. In general, food insecurity is rarely the result of one causal factor. The strength and reliability of FEWS NET forecasting lies in its integrated consideration of the diversity of factors that lead to risk. Along with agricultural production, climate and weather, FEWS NET places analytical importance on markets and trade, livelihoods and sociopolitical issues such as conflict and humanitarian response. Key elements of FEWS NET's methodology include: * Classifying food insecurity: FEWS NET describes the severity of food insecurity using the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification version 2.0 (IPC 2.0), an international five-level scale. FEWS NET representatives were among the international food security leaders who designed the scale. * Scenario development is at the heart of FEWS NET's analytical process. In the simplest terms, scenario development can be described as a sophisticated ‚Äúif-then‚Äù statement. In practice, this nine-step methodology relies on the creation of specific, informed assumptions about future events, their effects, and the likely responses of various actors. Considered in the context of current conditions and local livelihoods, these assumptions allow for the estimation of future food security outcomes and easy updating of the scenario as new information becomes available. * Remote monitoring: Since the 2008 global food price crisis, the risk of food insecurity has continued to rise in unexpected places. In 2010, FEWS NET responded to the demand for information on these new areas of concern by developing a lighter, scalable version of its traditional methodology. This approach, known as remote monitoring, centers on the identification and monitoring of anomalies that might lead to food insecurity. In remote monitoring, a FEWS NET coordinator covers a portfolio of countries, typically from a nearby regional office. Relying on a network of partners to collect and share data, the coordinator analyzes available information and produces monthly, two-page reports describing the current and projected food security situation.  Partners  Along with USAID, other US agencies make integral analytical contributions to FEWS NET reports. They include: * the US Geological Survey, which provides regular agroclimatology reports and technical advice on vegetation, water availability and other environmental and climate issues. Along with US-based staff, three USGS scientists in East, West and Southern Africa, offer analysis specific to those regions. * National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through the Climate Prediction Center, provides rainfall estimates (RFEs) and atmospheric monitoring of weather patterns such as El Nino and La Nina events. * NASA satellites provide imagery and raw data for USGS and NOAA analysis. * the US Department of Agriculture, through the Foreign Agricultural Service, partners with FEWS NET on crop assessments and other agriculture-related activities. Chemonics, an international development company, supports FEWS NET's home office in Washington DC, as well as some 80 field-based staff, most of whom are nationals of the countries in which they work. FEWS NET works closely with partners in the food security community, including international organizations such as the World Food Program and Food and Agriculture Organization and national ministries of agriculture and trade and national weather services. In certain countries, partnerships may involve joint reporting, joint field assessments and/or collaborative analysis. Examples of these partners include Comit√© permanent Inter-Etats de Lutte contre la S√©cheresse dans le Sahel in West Africa and the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit in Somalia.  History  FEWS NET was created in response to the 1984 - 1985 famines in Sudan and Ethiopia, which resulted in the deaths of as many as 1 million people. From the beginning, the aim of the early warning system, then called \\"FEWS\\", was to anticipate impending famines and advise policy makers on how to prevent or mitigate such famines. In July 2000, the initiative's name was changed to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, or FEWS NET, to signal the importance of collaborating with and strengthening national local food security information systems.

They are currently members of the and play at Chadfields. History The club was established in 1889 by workers from Tilbury Docks.History Tilbury F.C. They joined the Gravesend League, later becoming members of the Grays & District League and then the Romford & District League. After returning to the Grays & District League, the club were league champions in 1901‚Äì02, 1902‚Äì03, 1906‚Äì07 and 1907‚Äì08. In 1903 they had also started playing in the South Essex League; the club were Division Two champions in the South Essex League in 1921‚Äì22, and went on to win the league championship in 1922‚Äì23 and 1924‚Äì25. After finishing as runners-up in the league in 1926‚Äì27, they moved up to Division One of the Kent League.The 'original' Kent League 1922‚Äì1939 Non- League Matters In 1931 Tilbury transferred to the Premier Division of the London League.London League 1928‚Äì1950 Non-League Matters At the start of World War II, the club joined the South Essex Combination, but temporarily disbanded at the end of the 1939‚Äì40 season after their ground was commandeered by the army. Upon resuming play at the end of the war, they were Premier Division runners-up in 1946‚Äì47 and 1947‚Äì48, and again in 1949‚Äì50, a season that saw the club reach the first round proper of the FA Cup for the first time after playing nine qualifying matches. Drawn away to Third Division South club Notts County in the first round, they lost 4‚Äì0. The club then switched to the Corinthian League, in which they played for seven seasons before returning to the London League in 1957. They were London League champions and League Cup winners in 1958‚Äì59 and went on to retain the title for the next three seasons, as well as winning the League Cup again in 1960‚Äì61 and 1961‚Äì62. After their fourth title win, the club joined the Delphian League but the 1962‚Äì63 league season had to be abandoned due to extensive adverse weather conditions and the league then folded, leading to the club (and most of the rest of the Delphian League) becoming members of the new Division Two of the Athenian League. Tilbury won the Division Two title at the first attempt, earning promotion to Division One. They went on to win the Division One title in 1968‚Äì69 and were promoted to the Premier Division. Following a third-place finish in the Premier Division in 1972‚Äì73, the club joined the newly formed Division Two of the Isthmian League. They won the division in 1975‚Äì76 and were promoted to Division One, which was renamed the Premier Division in 1977. In 1977‚Äì78 the club reached the FA Cup first round again; after defeating Kettering Town 3‚Äì2 in a second replay (the first match was declared null and void as Tilbury had used an ineligible player), they went on to beat Nuneaton Borough 2‚Äì1 in the second round, before being drawn away to Second Division Stoke City in the third round, a match they lost 4‚Äì0. In 1979‚Äì80 Tilbury finished bottom of the Isthmian League's Premier Division and were relegated to Division One. At the end of the 1986‚Äì87 season they were relegated to Division Two North, where they played until being transferred to Division Three in 1991 as a result of league reorganisation. The 1991‚Äì92 season saw the club finish third in Division Three, earning promotion to Division Two. Although they were relegated back to Division Three at the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season, another third-place finish in 1999‚Äì2000 saw the club promoted to Division Two again. League reorganisation led to the club being moved in to Division One North in 2002. They were subsequently transferred to Division One East of the Southern League for the 2004‚Äì05 season, in which they finished bottom of the table, resulting in relegation to the Essex Senior League. Tilbury finished third in their first season in the Essex Senior League and were promoted back to Division One North of the Isthmian League. A third-place finish in Division One North in 2011‚Äì12 saw them qualify for the promotion play-offs, in which they lost 4‚Äì3 to Needham Market in the semi-finals. Ground The club played on several different grounds in their early years, including the Green & Siley Weir ground, Daisy Field and at Tilbury Fort, before returning to the Green & Siley Weir ground in 1900. After World War I they moved to the Orient Field, a ground owned by one of the directors of Clapton Orient.Tilbury Pyramid Passion During World War II the ground was commandeered by the Army for anti-aircraft guns being used to protect the docks. After the war, the club were told that they could only return to the Orient Field if they agreed to become a feeder club for Orient. After refusing, the club moved to an adjacent site named Chadfields in 1947, which had previously been used as a greyhound racing track.Tilbury Chadfields Greyhound Racing Times, 27 March 2019 In the first year at the new ground, a small grandstand was built on the east side and basic terracing was installed. The ground's record attendance of 5,500 was set for the FA Cup fourth qualifying round match against Gorleston that the club won to set up their first round tie with Notts County in the 1949‚Äì50 season. The money raised from the cup run, together with the sale of Tommy Scannell to Southend United, enabled the club to buy the site. A clubhouse was built in 1958 and floodlights were erected in 1966. In 1970 the original grandstand was replaced with a two-level concrete stand with dressing rooms on the ground floor and a spectator area. Another seated stand was built on the west side of the pitch in 1996, replacing three separate covered areas and five steps of terracing.Jon Weaver (2005) The Football Grounds of Rural Essex, p44 Hashtag United also played at Chadfields in 2019‚Äì20, with Brimsdown becoming tenants for 2020‚Äì21.

History The village sign refers to the village as the \\"Village of the Buckle\\" This is a reference to the buckle on the Pelham's coat of Arms. The buckle was a gift from the King to Nicholas Pelham (died 1560) in reward for leading a group of men from Seaford and local landowners to repulse a small French fleet that attempted to land in Seaford Bay in 1545. The area of the battle, at the western end of Seaford, East Sussex seafront, is, consequently, now known as The Buckle. The patronage of the church was held by the Earl of Chichester. Landmarks The Site of Special Scientific Interest Park Corner Heath lies within the parish. It is a site of biological interest consisting of grassy heath, scrub and woodland. It provides a habitat for many species of moth and butterfly.

Life and career Wood was born in Fagley, Bradford, Yorkshire, England. He appeared in 420 first-class matches from 1927 to 1949. A right-hander, he scored 8,842 runs, averaging 21.20, with one century and 43 fifties, and made 886 dismissals, including 255 stumpings. He was awarded his Yorkshire cap in 1929, and made the wicket-keeping position at Yorkshire his own through the 1930s, including making 225 consecutive appearances. His most successful season with the bat was in 1935, when he scored his only century (123 not out against Worcestershire); in this season he passed 1,000 runs for the only time, the first Yorkshire wicket-keeper to do so. In 1938, Wood made his Test debut against Australia, just days before his 40th birthday. A late selection, he travelled from Leeds to London by taxi. On arrival in London the taxi driver asked him for the fare of ¬£7 15s, Wood is believed to have informed him that he was only paying for the ride, not buying the taxi.

He played first-class cricket for Cambridge University, Yorkshire and Essex, as a right-handed opening or middle order batsman and also kept wicket in many matches. Life and career Gibb was educated at St Edward's School, Oxford, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He played first-class cricket for Cambridge University from 1935 to 1938. He was initially chosen as a batsman in his first year, 1935, and also started playing for Yorkshire. He scored 157 not out, his first first-class century and ultimately his second highest score in first-class cricket, in his first innings for Yorkshire in 1935, and toured in Jamaica in 1935‚Äì36 as captain of the Yorkshire team. Gibb kept wicket occasionally in his second year at Cambridge, 1936, deputising when Billy Griffith was unavailable (Griffith himself later kept wicket for England in two of his three Tests in 1948 and 1949). Gibb was controversially selected as Cambridge wicket-keeper in his third year at Cambridge, 1937, ahead of Griffith, and toured in India in 1937‚Äì38, scoring his third first-class century (138 not out) for Lord Tennyson's Team at Ahmedabad. He achieved his only double century in first- class cricket when he reached 204 for Cambridge University against Free Foresters in 1938, his first of four first-class centuries that year. In July 1938, the England wicket-keeper, Les Ames was injured, and Gibb was chosen to keep wicket for England in the third Ashes match against Australia at Old Trafford, ahead of candidates including Yorkshire's usual and well-regarded wicket-keeper, Arthur Wood. The Third Test was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain. Fred Price kept wicket in the Fourth Test at Headingley later in July, when Gibb was himself injured (this was to be Price's only Test match). Gibb remained out of the England team when Wood made his Test debut in the Fifth Test (and Wood completed his four-match Test career playing in the three Tests against West Indies at home in 1939). Nevertheless, Gibb was chosen to tour South Africa in 1938‚Äì39 as Ames' deputy, although he played in all five Tests as a batsman, opening the batting in all five matches with Len Hutton. Gibb made his Test debut against South Africa in the First Test, at Johannesburg on 24 December 1938, scoring 93 and 106 He scored a second Test century in the Fifth Test, at Durban, in England's second innings in the timeless Test that was abandoned as a draw after 10 days of play. During World War II Gibb was a Royal Air Force pilot on Catalina and Sunderland flying boats. He did not play again for England until the first series of England matches after the end of the war in 1946, at home against India. Gibb was selected as wicket-keeper in the first two Tests, but was replaced in the Third Test at The Oval by Godfrey Evans, making his Test debut. Gibb scored his second first-class century for Yorkshire in 1946, against Warwickshire. That winter, he kept wicket for England in the First Test at Brisbane on the MCC tour of Australia in 1946‚Äì47, but he was replaced again by Evans for the Second Test at Sydney. Thereafter, Evans remained a fixture in the side until 1959, and Gibb did not play for England again. In his eight Tests, he had scored three fifties and two centuries. Gibb did not play first-class cricket for four seasons, from 1947 to 1950, but joined Essex in 1951, becoming the first cricket blue to turn professional. This caused Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) to suspend his membership. However, he scored four first-class centuries in his first season for Essex. He remained with Essex for six years, to 1956, making 1,000 runs four times. He toured in India with a Commonwealth team in 1953‚Äì54, scoring a century (154) at Jorhat. Gibb was an umpire in first-class cricket from 1957 to 1966, later becoming a bus driver in Guildford, Surrey, where he died suddenly in December 1977. His obituary appeared in the 1979 edition of Wisden.Wisden 1979, pp. 1089‚Äì91.

He was a leg spin bowler and played first-class cricket for Lancashire County Cricket Club between 1937 and 1947, although his career was interrupted by the Second World War. After a remarkable season in 1938, in which he took 151 wickets, Wilkinson was selected for the England team. After 3 Tests, he was dropped. He was less successful on his return to county cricket and after the Second World War only played 3 more first-class matches. He continued to play in local leagues and became a newsagent. Early career Originally a seamer, Wilkinson began bowling leg spin at the age of 15. He represented Heaton Cricket Club in the Bolton Cricket League. Wilkinson joined Lancashire in 1936 after trials and give up his job at a cotton mill. Retrieved on 17 December 2008. He made his debut in 1937 against the touring New Zealanders. In his first over, Wilkinson bowled the New Zealand captain, Curly Page. He played 7 first-class matches in 1937, taking 22 wickets. Retrieved on 17 December 2008. Success and England selection In the 1938 English cricket season, his first and only full season, Wilkinson took 151 wickets in 36 games at an average of 23.28, and earned selection for England's tour of South Africa in 1938-39. In his first eight games of the season, all in May, he took only 16 wickets at an average of about 40. He improved the following month, taking his first hat-trick, a feat he managed against Sussex. He had a remarkable August in which he took 58 wickets from in the last nine games of the season. He managed 11 five wicket hauls and two ten wicket hauls in the season, gaining the notice of the national selectors. Wilkinson was awarded his cap by Lancashire in the same season. Retrieved on 18 December 2008. Wilkinson was 21 at the time, and only Yorkshire spinner Wilfred Rhodes has managed to take more wickets at a younger age (Rhodes was 20 when he took 154 wickets in 1898). On the tour, there were three more senior spinners than Wilkinson: Tom Goddard, Hedley Verity, and Doug Wright. Despite this, Wilkinson debuted in the first Test of the series, being chosen ahead of Wright to play against South Africa alongside Verity and Goddard. He was the fifth bowler England used, turned to ahead of Goddard, and finished with match figures of 2/111. Retrieved on 17 December 2008. Wilkinson did not play the second Test, but played in the third and fourth, finishing with match figures of 4/115 Retrieved on 17 December 2008. and 1/45 Retrieved on 17 December 2008. respectively on pitches that were considered perfect for batting. Although the selectors lost confidence in Wilkinson's bowling after he managed seven wickets at 38.71 in Tests, he finished the tour top of the bowling averages with 44 wickets at an average of 18.86. Decline After the tour of South Africa, Wilkinson's 1939 season was disappointing. A hand injury prevented him from playing early on in the season. He finished the year with 63 wickets at an average of 30.85, although he did manage career best figures of 8/53 against Hampshire in May 1939. Talking about why he thought he hadn't matched his success from the previous year, Wilkinson said \\"I don't know why but nothing really went right. The only thing I can think of is that I tried to be too perfect, particularly with the googly. I had an England cap and as an England player I had to be good\\". The Second World War prevented Wilkinson from playing first-class cricket until 1946, although he did play for the army. His 1946 season was curtailed after just one match when he injured the cartilage in his knee and had to undergo an operation. He returned to fitness in 1948 but only played two matches, taking a single wicket. He retired from first-class cricket, although continued to play cricket in local leagues. He became a newsagent and died on 3 September 2002. He was married and had two sons.

He was also an aggressive left-handed tail-end slogger, who frequently hit up thirty runs in twenty or so minutes, and on three occasions hit three sixes off consecutive balls. His highest first-class score of 75 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in 1938 took just thirty minutes. He does, however, hold the world record for the most ducks in a first-class career, with 156. Perks was first involved with Worcestershire as early as 1928, when he joined their ground staff. He showed considerable promise in his first season with the first team in 1930, with 59 wickets for 23 each, with 7 for 20 against Leicestershire on a rain-affected wicket his outstanding performance. It was several years before he improved upon this, but by 1935 he was clearly one of the hardest-working of several emerging pace bowlers with 119 wickets for less than 22 each and an annual output of around a thousand overs per season. The following three years saw Perks maintain his form. he took fifteen for 106 against Essex at Worcester in 1937, the best match figures of his career. Perks was chosen for the tour of South Africa in 1938-1939. He played in only the last match, the famous 'Timeless Test' taking 5 for 100 on the most docile of wickets in the first innings. Perks went on to have his best season ever in 1939, with 159 wickets for less than 20 runs each, including thirteen hauls of five or more wickets in an innings in the County Championship. He again played in one Test against the West Indies but further progress was thwarted by the war. Perks was 34 when cricket resumed in 1946 and though he never came back into representative calculations, he maintained a surprising consistency for the rest of his career: his first-class averages between 1946 and 1955 were all within the very narrow range from 23.28 in 1946 to 26.16 in 1951. Perks' tireless fast- medium bowling was considered an important part of Worcestershire's rise to third in the County Championship in 1949 and fourth in 1951. In his last season, 1955, Perks became the first professional captain of Worcestershire, taking five wickets for 79 runs against Hampshire in his last match, in so doing raising his aggregate to 100 wickets for the sixteenth consecutive season. This feat is bettered only by Derek Shackleton and Tich Freeman. Perks played more than 500 matches for Worcestershire. He was the only man to take two thousand wickets for the county: his final total of 2,143 Worcestershire wickets (out of 2,233 in all) easily a county record, being more than 500 victims clear of second-placed Norman Gifford. His father Thomas Perks had one first-class game for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1902.

AFL career The Dockers surprised many when they selected Bootsma with their only pick in the 2000 pre season draft (2nd overall). Bootsma was recruited at the late age of 27, with the club handing over the number 40 jumper previously worn by Luke Toia, Jess Sinclair and rookie list player Darren Bolton. Bootsma was a hard working type of player. After spending the first seven rounds of the 2000 season playing in the WAFL with South Fremantle, Bootsma was selected to make his debut in Round 8 against Collingwood at the Docklands Stadium in a rare (for AFL) Monday night game. A more than serviceable game saw Bootsma end up playing played 13 games in his debut season. Bootsma played the first 10 games of 2001 and had more than 20 possessions in 5 of them. However, the tumultuous round 10 match against Richmond, Ben Allan's first as caretaker coach after Damian Drum was sacked, would be Bootsma's last, due initially to a knee injury and later he was unable to break into the team eager to rebuild for the future. He would remain on the Fremantle list for the 2002 season, but did not play another senior game. He retired from AFL football at the end of 2002. WAFL career Bootsma gave great service to South Fremantle before and after his time at Fremantle. In 1997 he helped South to win the WAFL Premiership and he won the best and fairest award in 1999.

The wall was built during the Roman era and was dedicated to Saturn. Bab Kisan may have been the escape route of St Paul. According to the Bible, Paul settled in Damascus after having claimed (Acts 9:1‚Äì9) to have witnessed a vision where Jesus was on a road to the city. After staying three years in Damascus, he went to live in the Nabataean kingdom (which he called \\"Arabia\\") for an unknown period, then came back to Damascus, which by this time was under Nabatean rule. After three more years (Gal. 1:17;20), he was forced to flee the city under the cover of night (Acts 9:23;25; 2 Cor. 11:32ff) after explosive reactions from Jews who opposed his teachings. He was lowered down from a window in the wall, down into a basket, and with the help of his Christian disciples, he did make his escape at night and fled towards Jerusalem.

A total of six of the systems have been installed, two on each of the three Zumwalt-class ships. The Navy has no plans for additional Zumwalt-class ships,\\"Root Cause Analyses of Nunn-McCurdy Breaches -- Zumwalt-Class Destroyer, Joint Strike Fighter, Longbow Apache, and Wideband Global Satellite,\\" Rand Corporation (2011); see Vol. 1, Ch. 3 via http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG1171z1.html and no plans to deploy AGS on any other ship. AGS can only use ammunition designed specifically for the system. Only one ammunition type was designed, and the Navy halted its procurement in November 2016 due to cost ($800,000 to $1,000,000 per round), so the AGS has no ammunition and cannot be used.  History  The Zumwalt- class and AGS were designed and developed in the context of the United States battleship retirement debate. Battleship proponents argued that the battleships should not be decommissioned until an alternative method of providing naval gunfire support could be deployed, while others argued that such support was no longer needed in the era of missiles and aircraft. There has been research on extending the range of naval gunfire for many years. The 203 mm 8\\"/55 caliber Mark 71 gun was the US Navy's Major Caliber Lightweight Gun (MCLWG) program. The system was designed and tested in 1975 but the program was terminated in 1978. Gerald Bull and Naval Ordnance Station Indian Head tested an sub-caliber saboted long-range round, citing a letter from Major Tracy Ralphs to Senator John Warner on 1999-02-25 in a stretched 16\\"/45 caliber Mark 6 gun in 1967. The Advanced Gun Weapon System Technology Program (AGWSTP) evaluated a similar projectile with longer range in the 1980s. After the battleships were decommissioned in 1992, the AGWSTP became a 127 mm (5-inch) gun with an intended range of , which then led to the Vertical Gun for Advanced Ships (VGAS). The original DD-21 (1994 precursor to the Zumwalt- class design) was designed around this \\"vertical gun\\", but the project encountered serious technology and cost problems. Originally designed for mounting as a vertical gun adapted from the VGAS design, this AGS was then designed and produced for mounting within a more conventional turret arrangement. The AGS was designed to deliver precision munitions at a high rate of fire and at over-the-horizon ranges. As a vertical gun system it would only have been capable of firing guided munitions; the turret mounting allows the use of unguided munitions as well if any are developed for it. AGS is not designed to use the same munitions as other artillery, so each type of munition must be designed and manufactured specifically for AGS. Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP) ammunition for AGS was to be a major advance. LRLAP featured separate projectile and propellant portions and was to be highly precise, with a circular error probable (CEP) of or less. Lockheed Martin's flight test of the munition in July 2005 had a reported a flight distance of . However, LRLAP procurement was cancelled in 2016.New Warship‚Äôs Big Guns Have No Bullets - Defensenews.com, 6 November 2016Navy Planning on Not Buying More LRLAP Rounds for Zumwalt Class - News.USNI.org, 7 November 2016 As of 2018, the Navy had no plan to replace it.Navy has no plan to introduce new ammo for DDG-1000 Defense News, January 11 2018 AGS was developed and produced by BAE Systems Armaments Systems (formerly United Defense) for the Zumwalt-class destroyer of the United States Navy. The first magazine was delivered to the U.S. Navy on 25 May 2010.  Description  The AGS uses the same 155 mm caliber as most American field artillery forces, although it is unable to fire the same ammunition. The gun barrel is 62 calibers long, and is able to fire the entire magazine (300+ rounds) with an average rate of fire of ten rounds per minute using a water cooled barrel. The AGS is mounted in a turret specifically designed for the Zumwalt class destroyer with fully automated ammunition supply and operation. The turret itself is designed to be stealthy, allowing for the entire length of the barrel to be enclosed within the turret housing when not firing. A primary advantage of the AGS over the existing 127 mm Mark 45 5\\" gun which equips most major surface combatants of the US Navy was to be its increased capability for supporting ground forces and striking land targets. With a 10-round per minute capacity, it would have had the ability to deliver the firepower of a battery of six 155 mm howitzers. This was intended to increase the utility of vessels equipped with the weapon, especially in areas in which the US Navy exercises absolute sea supremacy.  Ammunition  AGS cannot use ammunition designed for existing artillery, so each type of ammunition must be designed and manufactured for AGS. The only type to be designed is the LRLAP. LRLAP procurement was cancelled and there are no plans to replace it. Other projectiles were examined to replace the LRLAP, but since it is the only munition designed to be fired from the AGS, the barrel, software, cooling system, and automated magazines would have to be modified to accommodate a different round.Navy Planning on Not Buying More LRLAP Rounds for Zumwalt Class - News.USNI.org, 7 November 2016 It could cost up to $250 million in engineering costs to modify all six guns on the three ships to accept a new round.Raytheon Excalibur Round Set to Replace LRLAP on Zumwalts - News.USNI.org, 13 December 2016 After some research had been abandoned into whether the M982 Excalibur guided munition could be adapted for use with the AGS, officials announced in January 2018 that there was now no plan for any replacement round for the AGS. Instead, Naval Sea Systems Command and the Chief of Naval Operations staff would \\"monitor new technologies\\" which might be used with the AGS system in the future. In particular he noted that the BAE Hypervelocity Projectile testing, a cross service 127 mm (5\\") Naval and 155 mm land, low drag self guided Mach 7 capable round originally intended for Railguns, was achieving range close to the original LRLAP specification while having superior rate of fire and accuracy. As of 2018, The HVP rounds were estimated to cost around $25,000 for a surface-to-surface 127 mm (5\\") or $86,000 for an anti missile variant 155 mm round.$86,000 + 5,600 MPH = Hyper Velocity Missile Defense Breaking Defense, January 26, 2018 =LRLAP= The development of new ammunition for the AGS under the name Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP) was one of the major advances offered by the AGS program. The munitions were highly precise, with a circular error probable (CEP) of or less. Lockheed Martin conducted a flight test of the munition in July 2005, reporting a flight distance of . The LRLAP ammunition features separate projectile and propellant portions. Total weight is , including a bursting charge of . The maximum length of the combined munition is , amounting to about 14 calibers. In 2004, the manufacturer stated that the goal for the LRLAP per-round cost was $35,000. Shortly after the was commissioned, the U.S. Navy moved to cancel the LRLAP due to excessive cost. With the number of ships reduced from 32 to 3 examples, the per-unit cost of each LRLAP shot increased to $800,000‚Äì1 million. This made the system untenable even though there were no significant performance issues.

His performance prompted Neville Cardus, a cricket journalist, to compare Oldfield's strokeplay to that of Johnny Tyldesley. Retrieved on 18 December 2008. Oldfield shared in a 271 run partnership with Eddie Paynter when Paynter scored 322 in five hours in 1937 (the innings is the third highest individual score for Lancashire). Retrieved on 17 October 2007. Oldfield again successfully paired up with Paynter in 1938 when they set a record of 306 for the third wicket; this record stood until 1990 when it was bettered by Michael Atherton and Neil Fairbrother. On 19 August 1939, Oldfield made his Test debut, aged 28, against the West Indies. He made scores of 80 and 19 in what was his only Test match. A few days after the match ended, the Second World War broke out and he did not play first-class cricket until 1948, and curtailing what could have been a long Test career. Retrieved on 18 December 2008. He holds the record for most runs by an England player who has played only one Test. =Northamptonshire= After the war ended and first-class cricket resumed, the 35-year-old Oldfield could not agree terms with Lancashire and left. In later years, he reflected that it had been a mistake to leave Lancashire. In the 151 first-class matches he played for Lancashire, Oldfield scored 7,002 runs at an average of 35.72 with 12 centuries. Retrieved on 18 December 2008. Oldfield played for two seasons in the Lancashire League before joining Northamptonshire for the 1948 season. He enjoyed playing against the team that had spurned him, scoring three centuries against Lancashire. In only his second season with Northamptonshire, Oldfield scored 2,192 runs, a record for the team. Oldfield was never given his cap by Lancashire, but was awarded one by Northamptonshire in 1948 for his productive summer. Retrieved on 18 December 2008. In 1949/50, Oldfield toured India with the Commonwealth XI. Northamptonshire held a benefit year for Oldfield in 1953 which raised 2,728. Despite his regret about leaving Lancashire, he was more successful for Northamptonshire, scoring 9,321 runs at 38.51 in 159 matches. After retiring from first-class cricket in 1954, Oldfield became an umpire. He umpired between 1954 and 1965 and stood in two Test matches, one in 1960 and one in 1962. He returned to Old Trafford in 1968 when he became Lancashire's coach, and held the position for five years. He died on 19 April 1996.

A \\"calm, popular left-hander who also bowled leg spin\\", Ikin played most of his cricket for Lancashire. He was a solid left-handed batsman whose statistically modest Test record underplayed his contribution to the team as a sturdy foil to such players as Bill Edrich, Len Hutton and Denis Compton. Life and career He played minor county cricket for Staffordshire from the age of sixteen, and appeared for Lancashire in four games in 1939, taking George Headley's wicket as the first of 339 in first-class matches. After losing perhaps his best years to World War II, during which he fought at Tobruk, he resumed his career for Lancashire in 1946 and became a mainstay of the team, recording 1,000 runs in a season eleven times. He toured Australia in the 1946-47 Ashes series, compiling an obdurate 60 at Sydney and featuring in a brave stand of 118 with Norman Yardley in Melbourne. He was involved in a pivotal incident in the first Test at Brisbane when he claimed to have caught Don Bradman at second slip for 28 from the bowling of Bill Voce, only for the umpire to rule the batsman not out. Bradman went on to make 187. Ikin went on MCC's disastrous 1947/48 tour of the West Indies under Gubby Allen and was understandably less successful, but he scored 625 runs at an average of 89.28 on the Commonwealth XI tour of India and Ceylon in 1950/51. In Cyril Washbrook's benefit match against the 1948 Australians, Ikin had reached 90 when Bradman instructed Keith Miller to bowl. Miller refused, noting that Ikin had been a Rat of Tobruk, but his fast bowling partner Ray Lindwall denied Ikin his century, bowling him for 99. Ikin took a hat-trick against Somerset in 1949, and recorded his highest score of 192 against Oxford University in 1951. Gradually, injury and fragile health took its toll, and Ikin retired at the end of the 1957 season, with 17,968 first-class runs to his name. He resumed his minor county career with success for Staffordshire, playing on until 1968 and served as assistant manager on the 1965/66 MCC tour of Australia. nb.

A self-made millionaire when he met Yogananda in 1932, he later left a total endowment of approximately six million dollars to Yogananda's organization, Self-Realization Fellowship(SRF)/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India(YSS), helping ensure its long-term success. Yogananda also chose Janakananda to succeed him as president of SRF/YSS. Janakananda was president of SRF/YSS from 1952 until 1955. Early life and career James Jesse Lynn was born into relative poverty to Jesse William Lynn, an itinerant farmer, and Salethia Archibald Lynn near Archibald, Louisiana, in the southern part of the United States. His early childhood was spent helping the family pick cotton, milk cows, churn butter, and doing other family chores. His simple education began in a small log schoolhouse. Leaving school at the age of fourteen, he began working for the Missouri Pacific Railroad, sweeping floors for $2 a month. He continued with various railroad jobs for a few years, quickly moving up to the position of chief clerk to the division manager in Kansas City, Missouri. In Kansas City, he took night classes to finish his high school education, at the same time that he took law and accounting classes. At 21 he began working at the Bell Telephone accounting division and, before even graduating from law school, he was admitted to the Missouri bar. In 1913, he was married to Freda Josephine Prill of Kansas City. At age 24, Lynn took and passed the Missouri certified public accountant exam, earning the highest score on that exam ever made. Soon after, he began working for the largest underwriting insurance company in the country, U.S. Epperson, and quickly worked his way up in the company. By the age of 30, Lynn had taken out a significant and risky loan to buy the U.S. Epperson Underwriting Company. That step launched a successful business career that included insurance underwriting, oil well and orchard ownership, and large investments in the railroad business.Durga Mata, Sri (1992). A Paramhansa Yogananda Trilogy of Divine Love. Copyright Joan Wight. . He would become a prominent businessman in the Kansas City area as head of vast oil interests and as president of the world's largest reciprocal fire-insurance exchange.Durga Mata, Sri (1992).

Disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda Lynn, \\"a self-made business magnate, was suffering from nervousness and dissatisfaction when he met Paramahansa Yogananda in Kansas City in 1932. Lynn later said of that meeting: 'I became aware that (for the first time in years) I was sitting very still...I had found entrance into a spiritual realm previously unknown to me.'\\" In spite of his material success Lynn was unhappy, and acknowledged that he had a short temper and nervous problems. In January, 1932, his life changed when he attended a series of classes given by Paramahansa Yogananda. Lynn felt instantly transformed in Yogananda‚Äôs presence: > On the second night of the class, I became aware that I was sitting upright, > my spine straight and I was absolutely motionless. I looked down at my > hands, which were so restlessly moving before and which were now perfectly > still‚Ä¶ I knew I had found the path that gave me inner peace and satisfaction > and that I had found that something tangible I was seeking, a guru. In Kansas City in 1932, following one of his lectures, Yogananda met Lynn privately. In January 1932 Yogananda initiated Lynn into Kriya Yoga and he became a disciple. Because of bad publicity in the Kansas City area from his friendship with a previous Hindu teacher, Lynn and Yogananda agreed to avoid publicity regarding their association. During the following twenty years, Lynn paid frequent visits to Yogananda at his Self-Realization Fellowship headquarters in Los Angeles, California. In 1935 when Yogananda was planning his trip to India, Lynn generously insisted on making a donation for his travels. While Yogananda was gone, Lynn purchased and built the large estate in Encinitas, California as a gift to Yogananda and his organization, Self- Realization Fellowship. Yogananda wrote in his Autobiography of a Yogi: > \\"During my stay in India and Europe (June 1935 - October 1936), Mr. Lynn had > lovingly plotted with my correspondents in California to prevent any word > from reaching me about the construction of the ashram in Encinitas. > Astonishment, delight!\\" Lynn eventually moved to an apartment in the Encinitas retreat/ashram center. The two spent long hours together over the years, meditating and discussing spiritual matters. Mr. Lynn said of his relationship with Yogananda: > \\"One of the blessings I have received in my friendship with Paramahansa > Yogananda has been permanent relief from a state of nervousness, a state of > strain, an inward state of uncertainty. I have gained calmness, peace, joy, > and a sense of security that cannot come to anyone until he has found the > true security of the soul.\\"Self-Realization Fellowship (1996). Rajarsi > Janakananda: A Great Western Yogi. Self-Realization Fellowship Publishers. . > and \\"How heavenly is the company of a saint! Of all the things that have > come to me in life, I treasure most the blessings that Paramahansaji has > bestowed on me.\\" Yogananda lovingly referred to Lynn as \\"Saint Lynn\\" because of his great devotion to God. Yogananda said, \\"Some people say, 'The Western man cannot meditate.' That is not true. Since Lynn first received Kriya Yoga, I have never seen him when he was not inwardly communing with God.\\" On August 25, 1951 Yogananda \\"bestowed on St. Lynn the monastic title of Rajarsi Janakananda (after the spiritually illustrious King Janaka of ancient India) and turned over to him the responsibility of guiding the SRF-YSS work.\\" \\"Rajarsi is a spiritual title meaning royal rishi; Janakananda means the bliss of Janaka. Janaka was a great king as well as a fully Self-realized master of ancient India.‚Äù The name Rajarsi combines the Sanskrit words raja, which means king, and rsi/rishi, which means saint; thus the title Saint King. Yogananda said: \\"For you, St. Lynn, I interpret this title as 'king of the saints.\\" In the book Rajarsi Janakananda, A Great Western Yogi there is further explanation and an illustration of Yogananda‚Äôs handwritten note of the word Rajarshi (Raja‚Äìrishi). Mrinialini Mata said, in her talk The Blessings of Kriya Yoga in Everday Life, \\"Guruji said that Rajarsi's role, even as Lahiri Mahasaya in India had demonstrated, was to be in the world but not of it: to show the effect that Kriya can have in those who carry worldly responsibilities as householders.\\" Yogananda said that Janakananda was his most spiritually advanced disciple.Kriyananda, Swami (1977). The Path: Autobiography of a Western Yogi. Crystal Clarity Publishers Yogananda wrote in his Autobiography of a Yogi: \\"An American businessman of endless responsibilities (as head of vast oil interests and as president of the world's largest reciprocal fire- insurance exchange), Lynn nevertheless finds time daily for long and deep Kriya Yoga meditation. Leading thus a balanced life, he has attained in samadhi the grace of unshakable peace.\\" After Yogananda‚Äôs death in March, 1952, Janakananda became president of Self-Realization Fellowship and Yogoda Satsanga Society of India. Mrinalini Mata, former President of SRF/YSS, was quoted before Sri Daya Mata's death: \\"In India there is the spiritual tradition called guru-parampara - that is, the custom wherein the guru bestows his mantle of spirituality and authority on his successor. In Self-Realization Fellowship this continuity is certainly there. We have seen its unmistakable evidence in our revered Rajarsi Janakananda and Sri Daya Mata.\\" Janakananda died on February 20, 1955 in Borrego Springs, California.

The project began providing data for analysis on August 1, 2006. From February to May 2000 and from August to December 2002, the Stardust spacecraft exposed its \\"Stardust Interstellar Dust Collector\\" (SIDC), a set of aerogel blocks about 0.1 m¬≤ (1 ft¬≤) in total size, to interstellar dust. The collector media consist of 130 blocks of 1 and 3 cm thick silica-based aerogel mounted in aluminum cells. In order to spot impacts of interstellar dust, just over 700,000 individual fields of the aerogel will have to be visually inspected using large magnification. Each field, which is composed of 40 images, will thus be termed a \\"focus movie\\". Stardust@home will try to achieve this by distributing the work among volunteers. Unlike distributed computing projects, it does not try to harness the processing power of many computers. It uses them only to distribute and present the tasks to humans. This approach is similar to the earlier Clickworkers project to find Martian craters. Participants must pass a test to qualify to register to participate. After registering and passing the test, participants have access to the web-based \\"virtual microscope\\" which allows them to search each field for interstellar dust impacts by focusing up and down with a focus control. As an incentive for volunteers, the first five phases of Stardust@home allowed the first individual to discover a particular interstellar dust particle to name it. Also, the discoverer could appear as a co-author on any scientific paper announcing the discovery of the particle. As of February 2013, twelve papers summarizing the results of the Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE) have been submitted to Meteoritics and Planetary Science and are undergoing the peer-review process. thumbright400pxThis focus movie shows what a particle track in the stardust aerogel might look like. The focus movie can be viewed in the Stardust Search Tutorial with the \\"virtual microscope\\". The tutorials use tracks of extraterrestrial particles that were captured in the ODCE collector on the Russian space station Mir and tracks of submicrometre dust particles shot into aerogel at 20 km/s using a Van de Graaff dust accelerator in Heidelberg, Germany. Real interstellar dust tracks may appear different from these. They may be deeper or shallower, wider or narrower. Phases Stardust@home has been divided into six phases. Phase I became publicly available on Aug. 1, 2006, Phase II in August 2007, Phase III in March 2010, Phase IV in July 2011, Phase V in May 2012, and Phase VI in June 2013. Phase VI includes over 30,000 new \\"movies\\" representing eight aerogel tiles. The scoring method was also upgraded and, unlike the other phases, Stardust@home can no longer guarantee first finders of particles will be listed as co-authors on any scientific papers written about the discoveries.

He was one of Yorkshire's main players in the club's outstanding years, when they won eight County Championships out of ten. Though Smailes was never a player of the class of Sutcliffe, Hutton, Bowes, Verity or Leyland, he was extremely valuable to Yorkshire because of his versatility. He could bowl either swingers as a new ball partner to Bowes, or later off-breaks when pitches were affected by rain. He was also a dangerous left-handed batsman who scored over a thousand runs in 1938, with centuries against Glamorgan and Surrey. He lost his best potential cricketing years to the cessation of competitive cricket during World War II. Life and career Born Thomas Francis Smailes in Ripley, North Yorkshire, and although he joined the Yorkshire staff in 1932, it was not until George Macaulay became unfit that Smailes had his chance of playing regularly for the first eleven. Smailes debut took place on 4 May 1932, against Oxford University. He took this chance very effectively, taking 105 wickets for around 21 runs apiece ‚Äì a good average in such a fine summer, even though his bowling at this stage lacked the accuracy that was expected from Yorkshire cricketers, and he was perhaps overawed by having to lead the attack so often. His best performance was six for 56 against Kent, where he swung the ball prodigiously. With Bowes and Verity dominating the following year, Smailes had fewer opportunities but his accuracy improved greatly. In the last match against Sussex he took ten wickets in a match for the first time, but just missed his 100 victims. At the end of the 1934 season, Smailes was awarded his county cap. 1936, however, saw Smailes capture significant attention for the first time, with an impressive all-round performance against India of 77 (including three sixes) and ten wickets for 62 runs. He shared in a partnership of 167 with Verity for the ninth wicket, against Somerset, in one of the more remarkable county matches, and his fast-medium swervers could still be valuable as he showed with seven for 72 against Middlesex at Scarborough. Nonetheless, it was Smailes' development of off-spin ‚Äì helped by the continuously soft wickets in the North ‚Äì that caused his advance. In this style he took nine for 41 in a match against Worcestershire, six for 57 against Nottinghamshire and five for 39 versus Leicestershire. 1937, with Bowes absent for half the year, saw Smailes worked harder than ever before. Though he did not accomplish anything so good as in 1936 with the ball, he was always steady whatever style he was bowling, and as a batsman he hit his maiden century against Warwickshire early in the season. Smailes said, in later life, that he considered scoring that century as his greatest day in cricket. 1938 saw Smailes remarkably effective at Sheffield, but he did little as a bowler away from Yorkshire with Bowes, Verity and Ellis Robinson all beating him in the averages. Nonetheless, ten wickets for 137 in what would, but for rain, have been the first triumph of a county side over an Australian touring team since 1912, saw Smailes seriously considered for an England place. He was chosen for the Old Trafford Test in 1938, but the game was washed out without a ball being bowled. 1939, despite an amazing performance of 14 for 58 against Derbyshire, including ten wickets for 47 after he helped dismiss that county for 20 in the first innings, was wiped out by a major injury that allowed Smailes almost no cricket in the second half of the season. His ten wicket haul made him only the third Yorkshireman to take ten wickets in a first-class game, the others being Alonzo Drake and Hedley Verity (twice). At the start of hostilities, Smailes joined the 124th Battery Light Anti Aircraft Royal Artillery, as acting Sergeant Major. By 1942, he was promoted to Captain, and served in North Africa fighting Rommel's Afrika Korps, and later in the invasions of Sicily and Italy. It was there that he learned of the death of his friend, Hedley Verity. He went to the cemetery in Caserta were Verity was buried and, along with another Yorkshire-born county cricketer, Phil King, erected a simple cross on Verity's grave. The conflict aggravated Smaile's varicose vein condition, and every day thereafter he had to have his legs bandaged. Nevertheless, with the War having decimated England's ranks, Smailes, after just six first-class matches and an appearance in the Test Trial, finally received selection for a Test match against India at Lord's in 1946. Despite not faring badly in scoring 25 batting at number 8, and taking 3 for 44 in India's second innings, he was not retained. He was part, though, of another Yorkshire Championship winning campaign. During the first few post-war years, despite occasionally captaining the side when Norman Yardley could not play, Smailes gradually dropped out of the team. He was awarded a benefit in 1948, which raised ¬£5,104. As his playing days drew to a close, Smailes took over a pub and played three seasons of league cricket with Walsall Cricket Club. Frank Smailes died in Harrogate, Yorkshire in December 1970, after a long and painful illness, at the age of 60.

A fast-medium right-arm bowler and a lower-order right-handed batsman who made useful runs on occasion, he played for Lancashire between 1933 and 1950, taking 1,122 wickets in 298 first-class matches; he is 10th highest wicket-taker for Lancashire. Retrieved on 20 October 2007. A big and heavy man, he was known as a hard worker and, according to his obituary in Wisden in 1986, \\"his reputation as a great trier commended him to the Lancashire public\\". Season after season, Wisden referred to Pollard's accuracy and reliability, and his ability to bowl long spells without apparently tiring. Early career Pollard made his first-class debut for Lancashire in August 1933 against Nottinghamshire; while batting at number 11 he scored 16 not out, and took the wicket of Nottinghamshire captain Arthur Carr. In Lancashire's County Championship-winning side of 1934, he was seen as a medium-paced reserve to the front-line bowlers, but injuries, particularly to Frank Sibbles, meant that he played 11 matches in the last two months of the season, and took 38 wickets in them at an average of 19.31. In the second innings of a match against Gloucestershire, Pollard took 6 wickets for 21 runs. Wisden reported that \\"He kept a fine length and made the ball turn quickly with great effect\\". It was his best bowling at the time, beating his previous best of 2/31. In Championship games, he made only 14 runs in total, but in the end-of-season Champion County v The Rest match at The Oval, he scored 27 not out in the first innings and 28 in the second. The Rest were made of players from counties other than the current champions. Injuries to Sibbles and to Frank Booth gave Pollard an opportunity to play 23 matches in 1935, and was awarded his county cap. Retrieved on 18 December 2008. Wisden noted how well he compensated for the loss of the senior bowlers: \\"With length, fair pace and swerve, Pollard proved so successful that, no doubt, he would have taken a hundred wickets for the County had not tonsilitis caused his retirement from the Somerset match.\\" In fact, by playing for The Rest against the new County Champions, Yorkshire and taking three wickets in the game, he reached exactly 100 wickets for the season. Earlier in the season, in the match against Kent at Dover, he had improved his best innings figures to 7/87 and taken 10 wickets in a match for the first time, finishing with 11/176. Front-line county bowler Age and injuries caused the decline of many of Lancashire's cricketers in 1936, and the county finished 11th in the County Championship, equalling its lowest ever position to that date. Pollard was exempted from the criticisms in Wisden ‚Äì he \\"improved a little\\", it said. In all games, he took 108 wickets at an average of 20.13. He improved his best bowling figures twice in different matches against Glamorgan: he took 7/57 in the away match at Cardiff and followed that with 8/42 in the return match at Old Trafford. There was also progress in batting: he hit 58 not out in the match against Surrey at Old Trafford, and followed that with 55 in the return match at The Oval. The 1936 season was the only one in which he passed 50 runs in an innings more than once. Pollard's record in the three immediate pre-war seasons, 1937‚Äì1939 indicate his reliability. In the three seasons, he took, respectively, 112, 149, and 111 wickets, with 1938 being the most prolific season in his career. For most of these three years, his new-ball partner was Eddie Phillipson, who was very similar in style and pace. They both relied on accuracy rather than speed, using the seam of the ball, and generating some swing. Phillipson was injured for part of 1938, which put more work on to Pollard and to a degree explains his high tally of wickets. In that season too, Pollard was picked for a Test trial match between England and The Rest. Playing for The Rest, he produced figures of 5/57 in England's innings of 377, but it did not lead to a Test call-up. However, he was picked for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. Post-war Test player Like many of his generation, Pollard lost significant cricket years to the Second World War. Unlike some, though, he had a relatively swift return to first-class cricket when the war ended, and he was picked for four of the five \\"Victory Tests\\" arranged between England and the Australian Services teams across the summer of 1945. Identified as \\"Sergeant R. Pollard\\" in Wisden, he was the leading wicket-taker on either side, with 25 wickets. In his first game, the second of the series after the Australians had won the first, he was upstaged in the first innings by fellow opening bowler George Pope, who took 5/58. But Wisden noted that \\"the most damaging blow was a beautiful ball by Pollard which took Hassett's middle stump\\". And in the second innings, Pollard's 5/76 outshone Pope's 3/69. His figures were even better in the next match: 6/75 in the Australians' first innings. And he took four wickets in an innings in both the fourth and fifth matches of the series. Although Pollard had played several matches in 1945, he was not yet discharged from the forces, and this limited his appearances in the first full season for first-class cricket in 1946. He managed only 12 County Championship matches for Lancashire, though he took 55 wickets in those games. He did, though, finally play his first Test match: the second match of the three-Test series against India. The previous week, he had played in the annual Gentlemen v Players match and had taken nine wickets in the game for just 53 runs. During this match, he spent a period off the ground negotiating with his Army chiefs his availability for the Old Trafford Test. In the Test itself, he had a sensational start. After the Indians had reached 124 without loss on the second day of the match, Pollard caused a collapse with a spell of four wickets for seven runs in five overs. In the innings as a whole, which ended with India all out for 170, he finished with 5/24 off 27 overs, 16 of which were maidens. In the second innings he took two further wickets for 63 runs. That performance earned Pollard selection for the 1946‚Äì47 Ashes tour, and he and Bill Voce were given special leave from the Army to make the tour. But, Wisden wrote, \\"neither had sufficient pace to be really troublesome in the clear Australian atmosphere\\". Pollard's 28 wickets on the tour as a whole cost more than 36 runs each, and he did not feature in the Tests in Australia, although he won his second cap in a rain-affected single Test in New Zealand, when he took three wickets for 73 runs. Having arrived from a country that had had seven years of rationing Australia was a 'land flowing with milk and honey' and Pollard soon put on two stone (28 lbs) in weight.p3, Clif Cary, Cricket Controversy, Test matches in Australia 1946‚Äì47, T. Werner Laurie Ltd, 1948 He was out of the reckoning for Test places in the hot summer of 1947 but responded with one of his best county seasons. For Lancashire in Championship matches, he took 131 wickets, with the next best total being 74. In all matches, he took 144 wickets at an average just below 20 runs per wicket, the second best figures of his career. The season produced both his career-best bowling performance and his highest first-class score. The two feats came in consecutive matches, both at Old Trafford. First, in the match against Derbyshire, he made 63, the only time he passed 60 in his career; he shared a seventh wicket partnership of 148 with Alan Wharton. Wisden's report puts the seventh wicket stand at 143 runs. Then in the next game against Northamptonshire, bowling unchanged in the first innings with Phillipson, he took 8/33. The 1948 tour of England by the Australian team captained by Donald Bradman, and subsequently labelled The Invincibles, provided convincing evidence of the weakness in international terms of English cricket at the time. Two heavy defeats in the first two Test matches led to a recall for Pollard, then 36 years old, for the third match, which was played at Old Trafford. The move was a success, for England were well on top until rain intervened and the match ended in a draw. Pollard's most significant contribution as a batsman in Tests was a \\"full-blooded pull\\" from the off spin of Ian Johnson, which caught the Australian opening batsman Sid Barnes, who was fielding at short leg on the edge of the pitch, under the ribs. Barnes was carried off on a stretcher, batted low in the Australian order and then had to retire hurt. He spent 10 days in hospital after the match and missed the next Test. The Australians were made uncomfortable by the accuracy of Alec Bedser and Pollard. Pollard's three wickets included Bradman, leg before wicket for just seven runs. The draw at Old Trafford encouraged the selectors to persevere with the same fast-medium combination in the fourth Test, at Leeds, but in a high scoring match on a good pitch the lack of spin bowling was decisive. Pollard's contribution was to take, in the space of three balls in the first innings, the wickets of Hassett and Bradman, the latter bowled for 33. But that was the extent of his success, and Australia made 404 for three wickets to win the match, at the time the highest total to win a Test match. For the final match of the series at The Oval, on what was seen as very definitely a pitch that was more suited to spin than quick bowling, Pollard was the bowler dropped to make way for an extra spin bowler. He did not play Test cricket again, but there was a short codicil 54 years later. In 2002, the ball used by Pollard to bowl Bradman for 33 in the fourth Test in 1948 was sold for ¬£1,700 at auction. Retrieved on 18 December 2008. Retrieved on 18 December 2008. Final cricket years Lancashire's reliance on Pollard lessened during the 1948 season, when his County Championship total of 95 wickets was only eight ahead of the slow left-arm bowler William Roberts. In all matches, he took 116 wickets at an average of 23, and he bowled more overs, close to 1,300, than in any other first-class season. The following season, though, he bowled 400 fewer overs and took only 73 wickets in all, at the relatively high cost of 28 runs per wicket. The Lancashire team regularly included several new, younger bowlers, and many of them ‚Äì Roy Tattersall, Malcolm Hilton, Bob Berry ‚Äì were spin bowlers (though Tattersall started as a swing bowler). Pollard continued to open the bowling and was as accurate as ever, but was less successful than in other seasons. He was given a benefit in August 1949 by Lancashire and picked the match against Derbyshire, which raised ¬£8,035, the third highest total at the time. In 1950, after a few matches with little bowling success, Pollard was dropped, and Lancashire started using Hilton, the fastest of three slow left-arm bowlers, to open the bowling in some matches. At the end of the season, in which Lancashire shared the County Championship title with Surrey, Pollard retired from first-class cricket to move into Lancashire League cricket. That was not quite the end of the first-class career as in 1952, Pollard played one further match for a Commonwealth XI against the Indian touring team. He took three wickets in the match, made two catches and 17 runs.

Bred by the Niarchos family, Bago is best known for winning the 2004 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe amongst his five Group One successes. Background Bago's dam Moonlight's Box, a daughter of the Champion Sire Nureyev, who also sired Miesque the dual Breeders' Cup winner. She in turn is out of Group 1 winning Coup de Genie, a full sister to Machiavellian. In 1989, Bago's sire Nashwan won the 2,000 Guineas, The Derby, the Eclipse and the King George VI in one season, a feat no other horse has yet equalled. He was trained by Chantilly-based Englishman Jonathan Pease, also renowned for being the mentor of many top-class horses including Tikkanen, Spinning World, Act One etc., Bago was ridden during his entire career by top French jockey Thierry Gillet. Racing career Bago won all four starts as a two-year-old, including the Crit√©rium International by six lengths. In 2004, Bago was hit by a virus that kept him off the track all spring and took him out of contention for the spring classics. However, his return to Chantilly saw him win the Prix Jean Prat over nine furlongs. He then went to Longchamp for the Grand Prix de Paris. Following a third-place finish to another Niarchos family-bred Prix du Jockey Club winner Sulamani at York in the Juddmonte International, he ended his three-year-old career with a win in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. In the race, Bago passed his rivals in the home straight and beat Cherry Mix on the finishing line. These performances led to Bago being voted Cartier Champion Three-year-old Colt and earning the comment from this trainer, Jonathan Pease, that he 'was the best horse that he had ever trained'. In 2005, Bago won one of his seven starts. However, all his races were at the very highest level; they included racing in Ireland, Great Britain, the United States and Japan, as well as finishing 3rd in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, 2nd in the Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh, 3rd in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Newbury, and 4th in the Breeders' Cup Turf at Belmont. In the Japan Cup, he received a severe cut and the right hind shoe was torn off during the race, which was the only time he ever finished out of the top four. Stud record Bago was retired from racing and stood his first season at stud in Japan in 2006. He had immediate success, siring the Kikuka Sho winner Big Week in his first crop of foals but his later record was disappointing. It was only in 2019 that he sired his second Grade 1 winner when Chrono Genesis won the Shuka Sho.

Common names include grugru palm, gloo gloo,maca√∫ba palm, coyol palm, and macaw palm; synonyms include A. lasiospatha, A. sclerocarpa, and A. vinifera. It turns yellow when ripe and has a hard outer shell. The pulp is slightly sweet and is extremely slimy and sticky. Description Fruit of Acrocomia aculeata Composition of fruit by layers It grows up to 15‚Äì20 m tall, with a trunk up to 50 cm in diameter, characterized by numerous slender, black, viciously sharp 10 cm long spines jutting out from the trunk. The leaves are pinnate, 3‚Äì4 m long, with numerous slender, 50‚Äì100 cm long leaflets. Petioles of the leaves are also covered with spines. The flowers are small, produced on a large branched inflorescence 1.5 m long. The fruit is a yellowish-green drupe 2.5‚Äì5 cm in diameter. The inner fruit shell, also called endocarp, is very tough to break and contains usually one single, dark brown, nut-like seed 1‚Äì2 cm in diameter. The inside of the seed, also called endosperm, is a dry white filling that has a vaguely sweet taste like coconut when eaten. Ecology The tree was noted by the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates in his 1863 book The Naturalist on the River Amazons, where he wrote that Uses The plants inhabit a wide variety of climates and situations; in Paraguay, for example, where it is ubiquitous, it is called the coco paraguayo (Paraguayan coconut), as it is much less common in the rest of the world. It has been suggested that grugru nuts, which come in mass numbers from each tree, can be used in the manufacture of biodiesel. The grugru nut, while very hard, can be sliced into thin circles to be sanded and worn as rings. The trunk of the palm can also be 'milked' to yield a fermented alcoholic beverage known as coyol wine.

He played 169 matches for Derbyshire, and as a bowler, he could move the ball sharply both ways and took 677 wickets at 19.92; as a batsman he was good enough to have a career average of 28.05. He missed most of Derbyshire's Championship season in 1936 through injury, but improved steadily as both batsman and bowler before the war and came close to a Test place (he was in the party for Trent Bridge in 1938 and was chosen for the abortive tour of India in 1939-40). He missed 1946 because he was committed to League cricket but in 1947 he received his one cap, against South Africa at Lord's. In 1948 he did the double for the second time - hitting 207 not out at Portsmouth - but promptly decided to retire to Jersey because of his wife's health. He came back to play more League cricket and stand as a first-class umpire between 1966 and 1974. He was mellower by then. The writer Michael Parkinson recalled playing a League game against Sheffield, when they were effectively Mr Pope's XI. He would rap you on the pads, look ruefully down the wicket and say to himself: \`Nice little leg-cutter that, George. Just a little bit too much, perhaps. What do you think, Mr Umpire?' And the poor besotted creature was bound to agree, as he invariably did the next time Mr Pope struck the pads and this time bellowed a demand for lbw. Life and career Pope was born at Tibshelf, Derbyshire, and followed his older brother Alf Pope into the Derbyshire side in 1933. He made his debut in an innings victory against Worcestershire and played one more first-class match that season. He became a regular player in 1934 and 1935. In 1936 a cartilage injury early in the season caused him to miss all but a handful of matches in the county's County Championship-winning side. He returned in 1937 and scored more than 1,000 runs with 92 wickets, and toured India with Lord Tennyson's XI in 1937‚Äì38. Pope was Derbyshire's leading all-rounder in both 1938 and 1939, achieving the all- rounder's double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in 1938. He played League cricket in 1946, the first season after World War II, but returned to Derbyshire for 1947, when he took 114 wickets. He was back again in 1948, when he completed the second double of his career and made his highest score, an unbeaten 207 against Hampshire at Portsmouth, sharing an unbroken seventh wicket stand of 241 with Albert Rhodes that remained the county's record until 2000. Pope's Test career had one false start. In 1938, he was picked in the party for the Trent Bridge match against Australia and then discarded from the final eleven. Finally, he played in the Lord's Test of 1947 against South Africa, but took only one tail-end wicket and was dropped. At the end of the 1948 season, Pope announced his immediate retirement to move to the Channel Islands to look after his wife, who was ill. He returned to first-class cricket on the Commonwealth XI tour of India, Pakistan and Ceylon in 1949‚Äì50, but at the end of that he retired for good. Pope was a right hand batsman and played 312 innings in 205 first-class matches, with an average of 28.05. He made eight centuries, with a top score of 207 not out. He was a right-arm fast-medium bowler, and took 677 first-class wickets at average of 19.92, and a best performance of 8 for 38, amongst his forty five wicket hauls.George Pope at Cricket Archive From 1966 to 1974, Pope stood as a first-class umpire in English county matches, returning for one last match as umpire in 1976. He died in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, at the age of 82. As well as his elder brother Alf, his younger brother, Harold Pope, also played for Derbyshire.

It was instrumental in establishing the field of bioethics and is among the most prestigious bioethics and health policy institutes in the world. Its mission is to address ethical issues in health care, science, and technology. Through its projects and publications, the Center aims to influence the ideas of health policy- makers, regulators, health care professionals, lawyers, journalists, and students. The Center is funded by grants, private donations and journal subscriptions. Founding The Hastings Center was founded in 1969 by Daniel Callahan and Willard Gaylin, originally as the Institute of Society, Ethics, and the Life Sciences. It was first located in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and is now in Garrison, N.Y., on the former Woodlawn estate designed by Richard Upjohn. In the early years, the Center identified four core issues as its domain: population control, including respect for procreative freedom; behavior control, which responded to early discoveries about the brain- behavior link and efforts to find ways to modify behaviors and prompted reassessment of what is \\"normal\\"; death and dying, including the ongoing controversy over defining death; and ethical issues in human genetics. The Hastings Center continues to work on these issues and has expanded to other areas, including the human impact on nature, governance of emerging technologies such as CRISPR gene editing, and wise and compassionate health care. Publications The Hastings Center publishes two journals, the Hastings Center Report, and Ethics & Human Research (formerly IRB: Ethics & Human Research). Each journal is published six times per year. Hastings Center Report, founded in 1970, features scholarship and commentary in bioethics. It also periodically features special reports, published as supplements, many of which grow out of the Center's research projects. Ethics & Human Research aims to foster critical analysis of issues in science and health care that have implications for human biomedical and behavioral research. Hastings Bioethics Forum blog publishes individual perspectives on current issues in bioethics. Bioethics Briefings is a free online Hastings Center resource for students, journalists, and policymakers on bioethics issues of high public interest, such as abortion, brain injury, organ transplantation, physician-assisted death, and stem cell research. The chapters are written by leading ethicists and are nonpartisan, describing topics from a range of perspectives that are grounded in scientific facts. Research The Hastings Center's projects, many of which are carried out by interdisciplinary research teams, focus on five program areas: health and health care; children and families; aging, chronic conditions and end of life; science and the self; humans and nature. Research projects consist of seminar-style meetings that bring together people with diverse views and expertise to address issues that pose dilemmas and challenges to society. Recent projects include Goals and Practices for Next- Generation Prenatal Genetic Testing; The Last Stage of Life, a planning process to determine how best to meet the new and complex needs of our aging society; Public Deliberation on Gene Editing in the Wild; Actionable Ethics Oversight of Human-Animal Chimera Research; and ongoing work on immigrant health. Hastings Center research strives to frame and explore issues that inform professional practice, public conversation, and policy. The Robert S. Morison Library, located at the center's offices in Garrison, N.Y., serves as a resource for Hastings' scholars, fellows and visitors. Influence The Hastings Center is recognized as having established bioethics as a field of study. The Hastings Center's 1987 \\"Guidelines on the Termination of Life- Sustaining Treatment and the Care of the Dying\\" was foundational in setting the ethical and legal framework for U.S. medical decision-making. It was cited in the 1990 Supreme Court ruling in Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health, which established patients' constitutional right to refuse life- sustaining treatment and affirmed that surrogates could make decisions for patients lacking that capacity. An updated, expanded edition, The Hastings Center Guidelines for Decisions on Life-Sustaining Treatment and Care Near the End of Life, was published in 2013. Recommendations from The Hastings Center's Undocumented Patients project in partnership with the New York Immigration Coalition http://undocumentedpatients.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/04/Undocumented-Immigrants-and-Access-to-Health-Care-NYC- Report-April-2015.pdf informed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's announcement in January 2019 that New York City would guarantee comprehensive health care for all New Yorkers, regardless of immigration status. Hastings Center research scholars are frequently called upon for policy advice by committees and agencies at both the federal and state levels. Recent examples include The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Gene Drives on the Horizon report, which was produced by a committee that included Hastings Center research scholar Gregory Kaebnick, and the National Academies Physician-Assisted Death workshop, whose planning committee included Hastings research scholar Nancy Berlinger.

The 1959‚Äì60 season saw the club win the league's Memorial Shield with a 2‚Äì0 win against Maidenhead United. In 1960 the club adopted its current name. When the Corinthian League was disbanded in 1963, Epsom & Ewell joined Division One of the Athenian League alongside most of the other teams from the league. They were relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1964‚Äì65 season, having finished bottom of Division One. The club subsequently struggled in Division Two, finishing bottom in 1970‚Äì71 and 1971‚Äì72. In 1973 they dropped back into the Surrey Senior League. Their first season back in the league saw them finish as runners-up and win the League Cup. The following season, 1974‚Äì75, the club won the league and the League Cup, as well as reaching the final of the FA Vase, losing 2‚Äì1 to Hoddesdon Town at Wembley Stadium.

In 1979‚Äì80 the club won the Southern Combination Challenge Cup, beating Hampton 7‚Äì2 in the final, which was played at Hampton's home ground. Epsom & Ewell remained in Division One until the end of the 1983‚Äì84 season, when they were promoted to the Premier Division after finishing as runners-up in Division Two under manager Adrian Hill. However, when Hill left the club to join Croydon in 1985, the club struggled; they finished bottom of the Premier Division in 1985‚Äì86, resulting in relegation back to Division One. The following season also ended in relegation, with the club placed in Division Two South for the 1987‚Äì88 season. League reorganisation in 1991 saw them moved to Division Three, where they remained until another round of reorganisation resulted in the club being placed in Division One South. However, they were relegated to Division Two at the end of the 2003‚Äì04 after finishing bottom of their division. In 2006 they were transferred to the Premier Division of the Combined Counties League when Division Two of the Isthmian League was scrapped. In 2012‚Äì13 the club won the Combined Counties League Premier Challenge Cup with a 3‚Äì0 win over South Park in the final at Cherrywood Road. The 2017‚Äì18 season saw Epsom & Ewell finish second-from-bottom of the Premier Division, resulting in relegation to Division One. Ground Epsom Juniors played their first matches at Alexandra Recreation Ground, before moving to the Horton Hospital Sports Ground in the early 1920s. In 1925 they moved to West Street in Ewell, the former ground of Ewell Football Club. In 1939 Epsom Town began groundsharing at West Street, but were forced to leave when Epsom reclaimed the ground after World War II.

This period was one of major decline for the county, which fell from over fifty years near the top of the table to one of the lower-ranked counties, largely because the pitches at Trent Bridge were placid in dry weather and recovered quickly after rain, so that the spin bowlers, upon whom most English counties relied in the 1940s, were practically helpless there. Cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, stated Butler was a \\"burly swing bowler... [and] had every reason to feel let down by England\\". Life and career Harold James Butler was born in March 1913 in Clifton, Nottinghamshire. Butler was expected to compensate for the loss of Harold Larwood to retirement after persistent injuries, and the decline of Bill Voce's powers, but although a fine bowler, he was not as fast as Larwood although similar in pace to Voce. Butler's chief merit lay in his accuracy and ability to move the ball off the seam, and vary his length according to the conditions, as shown when he went on his only overseas tour to the West Indies. His physical strength, however, was always doubtful and he suffered from injury. Butler first played for Nottinghamshire in 1933, and took five for 36 against Yorkshire. After that, he was in and out of the eleven until 1937, when his eight for 15 against Surrey made his place secure. In 1938, he was heading the first-class averages when illness ended his season, but the following year took 105 wickets. However, his career was interrupted by World War II, during which he served in India and played two first-class matches. In 1946, with England's formidable pre-war pace bowling gone, Butler bowled well enough, but he was judged unable to withstand the rock-hard Australian pitches and was left at home. In 1947, he was selected for the fourth Test at Old Trafford against the South Africans and bowled well, taking 7 for 66. Although injury kept him out of the fifth Test at The Oval, Butler took 106 wickets that season. He was chosen to tour the West Indies, but after bowling well in one Test, a calf injury and malaria kept him out of the others. Apart from 1950, when his bowling brought 95 wickets, the rest of Butler's career was a succession of injuries, and at the beginning of 1954 he was advised by his doctor to retire. His career wicket taking average of 24.44 was not exceptional, but Trent Bridge pitches were placid compared to other county grounds. Butler died in July 1991, in Lenton, Nottinghamshire, at the age of 78.

The geography of Norway is dominated by vast mountain ranges broken up by valleys and fjords. Less than 10% of the country's area is arable, and the rest is mountainous. Glaciers are the major cause for erosion, so the terrain in the Norwegian mountains consists of plateaus and lakes with peaks. These areas have an abundant and diverse fauna and flora. The altitude of the treeline comes slowly down going to higher latitudes; in northern Finnmark, the treeline reaches sea level. The treeline is also lower near the coast, and higher on the eastern slopes of the mountains. Mountain ranges also form the main boundaries among Norway's districts. They typically run north-south. Several of the ranges have had road and railroad passes since historical times; some are newer; and many close over the winter. Norwegian mountain ranges provide some of the most attractive recreational areas, both during summer and winter. Cabins and trails are operated by the Norwegian Mountain Touring Association at intervals that allow for weeks of uninterrupted hiking or cross-country skiing in the mountains.

Chiefly remembered as a left-arm spin bowler, Howorth also occasionally bowled medium pace and was a capable hard- hitting left-handed batsman. Ideally he would bat in the middle of the order, but so weak was Worcestershire's batting for much of his career that Howorth would often play as an aggressive opener, and it was in this role that he hit his two highest first-class scores ‚Äì curiously both being 114. Howorth was also a dependable close-to-the-wicket fielder but would field with skill further out if needed. As well as becoming one of the oldest English players to make his England debut at 38 years 112 days, Howorth took a wicket with his first ball in Test cricket, only the fifth Englishman to do so. Life and career Born Richard Howorth in Bacup, Lancashire, but not seen as good enough for an engagement after playing a few times for the Lancashire Second XI, and having played for Bacup in the Lancashire League, Howorth qualified for Worcestershire in 1933, and appeared against the West Indians that season. Seen as a promising all-rounder, he played a full season in 1934 but was disappointing. In 1935, however, Howorth suddenly jumped to the top flight of slow left-hand bowlers in county cricket, with a total of 121 wickets for Worcestershire at an average cost of less than nineteen runs each, and the following year he maintained his skill as a bowler and, called upon to open with Worcestershire's batting weakened by the absence of Cyril Walters and the Nawab of Pataudi, hit 114 out of 173 against Kent. The following year was disappointing, but in 1938 Howorth missed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets by a mere three runs ‚Äì scoring a century against Surrey at The Oval and taking a career-best 13 for 133 against Gloucestershire at Stourbridge. In 1939, he duly completed the double in the last match against Nottinghamshire, before World War II put an end to first-class cricket. Though he was then aged 37, 1946 was even more productive. Howorth hit two centuries against the Indian touring team, and in playing for H.D.G. Leveson-Gower's XI in September, he also took nine wickets for 72 runs. However, it was not until 1947 that Howorth was seen as anything more than a county player. That season, in addition to scoring a personal best 1510 runs for an average of over 26, Howorth took 118 County Championship wickets and was second to Tom Goddard in the averages in a summer unsuited to bowlers. His 7 for 52 on an extremely docile Trent Bridge pitch was the finest performance of his career, and placed Howorth into representative consideration, which he reached in the last Test match with considerable success: he took a wicket with his first ball in Test cricket. In that summer, Howorth took 164 wickets and it is noteworthy that he did not once take ten wickets in a match. Surprisingly, he was overlooked when Wisden chose its Wisden Cricketers of the Year, and was never to get another chance. Although he was the best bowler in the Tests for a weak side in the West Indies the following winter, in 1948, despite wetter weather, Howorth was disappointing with both bat and ball. In his benefit year of 1949, he was again second to Goddard in the averages, and managed a career-best 7 for 18 on a turning pitch at Northampton (only Ken Higgs and Bishen Bedi have taken more first-class wickets without once taking eight in an innings). Without achieving anything approaching his outstanding 1947 season, Howorth still headed Worcestershire's bowling averages in 1950 and 1951, but in the latter year his batting declined so much he only once reached fifty in an innings. However, it was still a surprise when early that summer he announced the 1951 season would be his last in county cricket, saying \\"I don't enjoy it as much as I used to\\" as a reason for this decision. Howorth bought and ran a newsagent's shop located outside the New Road, Worcester cricket ground, and died in Worcester in April 1980, at the age of 70.

December 1914, Rawtenstall, Lancashire ‚àí25 January 2002, Burnley, Lancashire) was an English cricketer who played in three Tests in 1948. An opening batsman for Lancashire, he shared a prolific partnership with Cyril Washbrook and was part of the county championship winning side of 1950. Place played first-class cricket until 1955, when his contract was not renewed. He became an umpire for one season, but retired to spend more time with his family. Youth and early career Winston Place was born in Rawtenstall; was orphaned at the age of 5 and was raised by his aunt. He represented Rawtenstall's cricket team in the Lancashire League. At the age of 15, Place began opening the batting for his club side. The club's professional player, Sydney Barnes, recommended Place to Lancashire County Cricket Club. Place served an apprenticeship as an engineer before serving an apprenticeship at Lancashire in 1936. Retrieved on 17 December 2008. The Lancashire batting line up of the time was a strong one, and Place had limited opportunities to break into the first team.

During the war, worked as an engineer in Accrington. He was married in 1940. Post-war career After the war, Place, who was 31 at the time, was the first choice batsman to open with Cyril Washbrook. Retrieved on 18 December 2008. The partnership was one of the most prolific for Lancashire and the best on the county circuit at the time. The 1946 and 1947 English cricket seasons were Place's most successful, producing 1,868 runs at 41.51 and 2,501 at 62.52 respectively. These were his most productive seasons and in 1947 he scored 10 centuries including his career best 266 not out which was scored against Oxford University; his second- highest total centuries for a season is four. He was 12th man for England against South Africa when they played a Test match at Headingley. Place's \\"golden summer\\" earned him selection for England's tour of the West Indies when Denis Compton, Bill Edrich, Len Hutton, and fellow Lancastrian Cyril Washbrook opted out of the tour. He made his debut on 21 January 1948 against the West Indies at Bridgetown. Place opened the batting with Jack Robertson, but was unsuccessful, scoring 12 in the first innings and 1 not out in the second when he dropped down the batting order to number six. Retrieved on 18 December 2008. Place sustained a bruised knuckle in the Test and missed the second Test due to a ruptured groin muscle that happened during a tour match against Trinidad. He was able to return for the final two matches of the series. Due to injuries to the team, Len Hutton had been called up, forcing Place to move from his accustomed place opening the batting to number three. In the third Test, he scored 1 and 15. Place's most significant Test innings came in his final match. After scoring 8 in the first innings, Place scored a battling 107, his only Test century. On his return to England, Place drifted out of England contention, and did not even feature in the Test trial as England prepared for Australia's tour in 1948. Despite being overlooked by the national selectors, he remained an integral part of Lancashire's batting line up, scoring 1,000 every season between 1946 and 1953. In 1949, Place suffered a broken hand, keeping him from playing seven matches, although he did manage a county championship best of 226 not out against Nottinghamshire. He toured with the Commonwealth XI which toured India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka in 1949/50, scoring 386 runs at 20.31 in 12 matches. Decline and after cricket Place's benefit year was in 1952 and raised ¬£6,297; at the time this figure was only bettered by the benefits of Washbrook and Dick Pollard, and demonstrated his popularity with the Lancashire fans. The last time Place passed 1,000 runs in a season was in 1953. In 1954 he averaged a disappointing 21.64 with only one century, but the 1955 season was leaner still, amassing only 179 runs from 10 matches. At the age of 40, Place was released by Lancashire, and on being told his career with Lancashire was over he broke down in tears. He became a first-class umpire, and although he enjoyed the job he disliked being separated from his family and quit after one season. Of Place's umpiring, Peter Tinniswood said \\"I am reminded here of that great and saintly Lancashire cricketer, Mr Winston Place, who on retiring from the first-class game took up umpiring. He resigned from his position, however, because such was his goodness and benevolence, he could not bear to give people out. God is rather like Winston Place\\". On retiring, he became a newsagent in his home town of Rawtenstall, even playing for the town's cricket team, living with his wife and two daughters. He died on 25 January 2002.

Life and career Dewes was a proteg√© of E. J. H. Nash, the British Evangelical Anglican clergyman (along with fellow cricketer David Sheppard). In 1945, he was one of three relative unknowns from public schools included in the England side for the third Victory Test against Australia at Lord's (it was his first-class debut). The others were Donald Carr from Repton School and the Etonian, Luke White. Dewes had left Aldenham School the previous year. In the event, the three contributed little, and did not figure again in the other Victory matches. Dewes did National Service in the Royal Navy, then went up to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1947. At Cambridge he won Blues for both cricket and hockey. His cricket Test debut came against Donald Bradman's formidable side in 1948, when he struggled to make runs against the opening attack of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller. The next season, he shared a record unbeaten stand of 429 with Hubert Doggart for Cambridge against Essex and, in 1950, added 343 for the first wicket with David Sheppard in the Cambridge total of 594-4 declared against the touring West Indians. The 1950 season was Dewes' peak, and he scored 2,432 runs in the full season at an average of 59.31, with nine centuries. He played two Test matches against the West Indies that summer and, in the first of them, made 67 in an unsuccessful rearguard action against the spin of Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine. He was also picked for the tour to Australia of 1950-51 and played two Tests there. But in all Tests he reached double figures on just three occasions, and only once passed 50. After this tour, he became a teacher and was never able to play more than a few matches each season, although as late as 1955 he made 644 runs in seven matches. His final first-class match was in 1957. He was a master at Tonbridge School and Rugby School and was headmaster of Barker College, Sydney, from 1958 to 1963. He then returned to England as a housemaster and head of careers at Dulwich College until his retirement in 1987. Among his pupils was Nigel Farage who paid tribute in his autobiography to the advice he received. His son, Anthony ('Jim'), played first-class cricket as a batsman for Cambridge University in 1978 and 1979.Anthony Dewes at Cricket Archive Dewes died on 12 May 2015 at the age of 88.

Life and career Born in Usk, Monmouthshire, Allan Watkins made his debut for Glamorgan just three weeks after his seventeenth birthday in 1939, as World War II loomed. He served in the war as a firefighter in the Royal Navy.Wisden 2012, pp. 228‚Äì29. He was an all-rounder: a left-handed batsman, a medium to fast-medium left-arm bowler and a brilliant close fielder, particularly at short leg. He was the first Glamorgan cricketer to score a century in Tests for England, and played for the county until 1961, when he was 39 years old and struggling with asthma. Watkins toured South Africa in 1948-49 and India and Pakistan in 1951-52 with the English Test team, and also participated in the 1955-56 'A' Tour to Pakistan. In 1953‚Äì54, he played with the Commonwealth team in India and Pakistan, returning home early through injury. He was voted Indian Cricket Cricketer of the Year after a successful Test series there in 1951-52. During that series Watkins battled his way to a nine-hour-long, unbeaten 137, in Delhi, his best Test score. Watkins' best Test performances were overseas, as his five home Tests did not provide a single innings above fifty. His other Test century came in the Fourth Test at Johannesburg in 1948-49, when he made 111. Watkins scored 1000 runs in an English season 13 times, and also took 100 wickets in 1954 and 1955, thus achieving the double in those two seasons. He also played football for Cardiff City and Plymouth Argyle,Plymouth Argyle : 1946/47 - 2008/09 ; at Newcastlefans.com and Rugby union for Pontypool.

Along with Doug Wright and Eric Hollies, Jenkins was a star of the last generation of English leg-spinners before a more defensive mindset, followed by the advent of one-day cricket, all but killed off home grown wrist spinners. Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted, \\"true to the leg-spinner's image, Roly Jenkins was one of the game's great characters and entertainers whose performances ebbed and flowed with how the mood took him. in an era when wrist-spinners flourished, Roly was one of the bigger spinners of the ball, if not always the most accurate\\". Life and career Roland Oliver Jenkins was born in Rainbow Hill, Worcester in 1918. He first played for Worcestershire as a teenager in 1938, and established himself as a regular member of the team almost immediately. He was carefully nursed in his first three seasons ‚Äì separated by six years with no county matches due to World War II ‚Äì but some of his performances already showed he was potentially a leg-spinner of more than ordinary ability. Although he had not reached a half century before the war, 1947 saw him come rapidly to the front as a gutsy middle-order batsman with a full range of leg-side strokes, and the following year he continued this advance as a batsman and, as a bowler, improved so much that he was chosen for the tour to South Africa. Although he did not do much in the Tests, Jenkins' vicious spin was deadly against slower-footed batsmen on hard South African pitches. Initially an orthodox leg break bowler, around this time Jenkins shifted to a grip akin to a seam bowler, which allowed him such a firm and close grip on the ball. This spin was so strong that it compensated for his lack of a top-spinner, and the fact that his googly was extremely easy to pick. Although he had neither the quick pace of Wright, or the artfulness of Hollies, Jenkins' spin and flight were so pronounced he surpassed both in the dry summer of 1949. Despite not playing a Test match, he took more wickets that season than any other bowler, and claimed a hat-trick in each innings against Surrey. This did not affect his batting: indeed, Jenkins reach 1,000 runs for the third successive year and was named one of the Cricketers of the Year by Wisden. The following year, saw Jenkins play in two Tests against the West Indies. In the first, he took nine wickets, but conceded almost 300 runs. Jenkins was probably the only English spinner who might have spun the ball appreciably on the cast-iron Australian wickets of previous years, a shift to a wetter climate meant he was not considered. His all-round work continued to be valuable for Worcestershire up to 1952, when he did the double for the second time, and played in two Tests against India with some success. In his benefit year of 1953, Jenkins began superbly as a bowler but not only lost form with the bat so much he averaged under ten an innings, but also suffered a serious injury that caused him to miss half the season, and his actual benefit match against Leicestershire. 1954's very soft pitches were unsuited to him both with bat and ball. However, after another injury in 1955, Jenkins returned to something like his best late that year, whilst in 1956 he took 101 wickets at a better average than ever before, and frequently captained his county, he was established as an enthusiastic \\"senior professional\\" even though out of the running for higher representative honours. Apart from one match where he took eleven wickets, however, Jenkins' skill deserted him in 1957, and he played only a few games in 1958 before his engagement was not renewed. Nonetheless, after retiring from first-class cricket, Jenkins played for fifteen years with West Bromwich Dartmouth in the Birmingham and District League, in the process establishing a reputation beyond that which he had as a county player. Along with Derbyshire wicket- keepers Bob Taylor and George Dawkes, Jenkins is one of only three players who have reached ten thousand career runs, while making only one century (against Nottinghamshire in 1948). Tony Lock reached that figure with a highest score of 89. Throughout his career, Jenkins was noted for his obsessive perfectionism: he would typically begin practising bowling at seven o'clock in the morning, and he was known for always bowling in his cap (though he batted without one). In later years he was a popular and much admired umpire at Ombersley Cricket Club, where he frequently offered helpful advice to bowlers from both teams. Jenkins died in July 1995, in Worcester, at the age of 76.

In his early 20s he began to research the topic. \\"At a certain moment, when I started doing my own shows, I felt it would be really interesting to know what is the history of my profession. I realized that there was no book, which was kind of a shock.\\"Neyfakh, Leon. The Man Who Made Curating an Art The New York Observer, December 15, 2009. He has since helped to rectify this gap with exhibitions on curating and a book entitled A Brief History of Curating. This volume, which is part of Obrist's Interviews project (see above) compiles interviews from some of the leading curators of the 20th century. While the history of exhibitions has started, in this last decade, to be examined more in depth, what remains largely unexplored are the ties that interconnected manifestations have created among curators, institutions, and artists. For this reason, Obrist's conversations go beyond stressing the remarkable achievements of a few individuals...Obrist's collected volume pieces together \\"a patchwork of fragments,\\" underlining a network of relationships within the art.Obrist, Hans Ulrich (2010). A Brief History of Curating, JRPRingier & Les Presses Du R√©el, Zurich. . In keeping with his desire to explore the world of art and view it as an open system, Obrist has long advocated a participatory model for his activities. One early project, 1997's \\"do it\\", is an ongoing exhibition do it. e-flux. 1997. that consists of instructions set out by artists for anyone to follow. In his introduction to the project, Obrist notes that \\"do it stems from an open exhibition model, and exhibition in progress. Individual instructions can open empty spaces for occupation and invoke possibilities for the interpretations and rephrasing of artworks in a totally free manner. do it effects interpretations based on location, and calls for a dovetailing of local structures with the artworks themselves. The diverse cities in which do it takes place actively construct the artwork context and endow it with their individual marks or distinctions.\\"(sic) Obrist curated \\"Utopia Station\\", a section of the Venice Biennale, in 2003, and is briefly interviewed about the project in Sarah Thornton's Seven Days in the Art World. In 2007, Obrist co-curated Il Tempo del Postino with Philippe Parreno for the Manchester International Festival, also presented at Art Basel, 2009, organised by Fondation Beyeler and Theater Basel. In the same year, the Van Alen Institute awarded him the New York Prize Senior Fellowship for 2007‚Äì2008. In 2008 he curated Everstill at the Lorca House in Granada. More recently, Obrist he has initiated a series of \\"marathons\\", a series of public events he conceived in Stuttgart in 2005. The first in the Serpentine series, the Interview Marathon in 2006, involved interviews with leading figures in contemporary culture over 24 hours, conducted by Obrist and architect Rem Koolhaas. This was followed by the Experiment Marathon, conceived by Obrist and artist Olafur Eliasson in 2007, which included 50 experiments by speakers across both arts and science, including Peter Cook, Neil Turok, Kim Gordon, Simone Forti, Fia Backstrom and Joseph Grigely. There was also the Manifesto Marathon in 2008 and the Poetry Marathon in 2009, which consisted of poems read aloud by artists and writers including Gilbert & George, Tracey Emin, Nick Laird, Geoffrey Hill, and James Fenton.Orr, Gillian.

Life and career Born in Sherwood, Nottingham, England, Simpson attended Nottingham High School. At the age of 13, having participated in an opening partnership of 467 with Henry Betts in a house game, Simpson was selected for the High School first team. He first gave notice of his abilities at a higher level scoring 134 not out for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club against the RAF at Trent Bridge in 1940. During the war he served as a pilot with the RAF but also took the opportunity to play cricket for the RAF alongside the likes of Wally Hammond and Bill Edrich, for the Europeans in India alongside Joe Hardstaff junior and Denis Compton and occasional games for Notts. Following the war Simpson made an immediate impression on the game, and was picked for the 1948‚Äì49 tour of South Africa on which he played his first Test, without success. He returned to the England side in the middle order against New Zealand in 1949, and scored a century, but with Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook embedded as England's first choice openers, he could not secure a regular place in the side. Simpson was named one of the Five Cricketers of the Year by Wisden in 1950. He toured Australia for the 1950-51 Ashes series and made 349 runs (38.77), second only to Hutton in the England averages. He made 156 not out on his 31st birthday in the fifth and final Test.Australia v England, Melbourne 1950‚Äì51 This innings was the finest of his career, first adding 131 with Hutton and making 64 out of a stand of 74 for the last wicket, to put England 103 runs ahead, and gave them their first victory against Australia since 1938. It was the highest score of his Test career, and he also made his highest first-class hundred of 259 against the Sheffield Shield champions, New South Wales. He returned for the 1954-55 Ashes series under Hutton, but played in only one Test. He was a fearless and effective player of fast bowling, but had a habit of getting out to spin bowlers, who he regarded with contempt. He assumed the captaincy of a frail Nottinghamshire side in 1951, and held the position for a decade despite nagging injuries. His county remained largely unsuccessful despite his efforts as skipper, and amassing over 30,000 runs in his career. Simpson scored 64 centuries in all. He topped the national batting averages in 1962, with 867 runs at 54.18,Wisden 1963, p. 289. and retired after the 1963 season. After retiring from playing cricket, Simpson served on the Nottinghamshire committee and was a director of Gunn and Moore. On the death of Alec Bedser on 4 April 2010, Simpson became the oldest surviving England Test cricketer.List of oldest living Test players References External links * Category:1920 births Category:2013 deaths Category:England Test cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1946 to 1968 Category:English cricketers Category:Nottinghamshire cricketers Category:Nottinghamshire cricket captains Category:Europeans cricketers Category:Commonwealth XI cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:Sportspeople from Nottingham Category:Sindh cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Gentlemen cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:People educated at Nottingham High School Category:British World War II pilots Category:Gentlemen of England cricketers Category:People from Sherwood, Nottingham Category:H.

A view of the carousel that was part of the original amusement park at Pleasure Beach. Pleasure Beach is the Bridgeport portion of a Connecticut barrier beach that extends westerly from Point No Point (the portion in the adjoining town of Stratford is known as Long Beach). Prior to June, 2014, when Pleasure Beach re-opened, the area was Connecticut's largest and most recent ghost townhttp://www.ghosttowns.com/states/ct/pleasurebeach.html after it was abandoned in the late 1990s due to a fire on the bridge connecting it to the mainland. It is surrounded on three sides by water (Lewis Gut to the north, Bridgeport Harbor to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south). History View of the rear hallway of the theater (2019) From 1892 until 1958, it was home to a popular amusement park of the same name. From 1904 to 1919, it was called \\"Steeplechase Island.\\" The amusement park was accessible primarily by ferry service and a wooden swing bridge built in 1927 to carry automobiles and pedestrians. Remaining structures from the amusement park are the carousel, dodge-'em car enclosure, and beer garden (the latter was substantially altered for use as a summer theater in the 1960s). After a portion of the bridge burned in 1996, Pleasure Beach was cut off and became accessible only by a lengthy trek along the shoreline, or by small private boats from the mainland. This severely limited access and allowed nature to be undisturbed. As late as December 2008, Bridgeport considered a ferry service to relink the beach with the city, but this was rejected due to parking considerations and the need for a Coast Guard registered captain. As of June, 2014, Pleasure Beach has re-opened. From the city of Bridgeport, CT's website: \\"The peninsula will be accessible seven days a week via free water taxi, which will pick beach goers up at the fishing pier located on Seaview Avenue near its intersection with Central Avenue. \\"Two water taxis -- the 23 passenger Lewis H. Latimer and the 18 passenger Gustave Whitehead -- will run frequently from the fishing pier on Seaview Avenue to the T-Pier on Pleasure Beach. \\"Upon arrival on the T-Pier on Pleasure Beach, it‚Äôs about a half-mile walk along a boardwalk to the beach area. While en route, visitors will pass an info depot where beach goers will be able to ask questions and gain more information about the park. View of the main theater hall (2019) \\"After passing the info depot, visitors will come upon a pavilion and relaxation area that includes several bathrooms, showers, picnic tables and a limited concession stand. And, after walking through the pavilion area, beach goers will walk down a boardwalk and onto the beautiful beach.\\" http://www.bridgeportct.gov/pleasurebeach The Town of Stratford owned 45 cottages on the Long Beach portion of the peninsula. For a decade, the town considered ending the leases of the seasonal homes, in part because of difficulties in protecting them. The town ended renewal of leases, and in May 2007, the remaining occupants agreed to give up their claims and moved their possessions away by barge. The cottages have since been demolished. =Recent Timeline= 266x266px * As of July 2008, three of the 45 cottages had suffered arson attacks and burned completely, and every building located on Pleasure Beach has suffered vandalism. Four vehicles have been removed, and the area is littered with trash from squatters and party-goers. The mayor of Stratford is working to clean the land and possible transactions exist to sell the Long Beach land to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. * On July 25, 2008, then- governor of Connecticut, M. Jodi Rell, endorsed spending $150,000.00 to study the feasibility of restoring access to Pleasure Beach, possibly by rebuilding the bridge. * As of March 15, 2009, five more of the cottages have fallen victim to arson. * A report on July 2, 2009 on Fox News Channel revealed that there were no longer any residents on Pleasure Beach. * As of September 3, 2009, the Connecticut Post reported that an unauthorized demolition took place on Pleasure Beach. The carousel, bumper car area, and a bandstand were all demolished without permission or permit. The remains of these areas remain on the beach. The mayors of Stratford and Bridgeport are investigating. * As of March 3, 2010, a temporary road has been built down the stretch of beach to the cottages. Workers will remove as much debris as possible before March 15, when they must halt the process due to piping plovers returning to their habitat. The work will resume September 15, 2010 and continue until all cottages and debris have been removed.Long Beach road work gets under way - Connecticut Post * As of May 2011, all of the cottages have been demolished, leaving only beach behind. The park infrastructure remains, such as the theater and other formerly public buildings. * On June 28, 2014, Pleasure Beach reopened to the public. The peninsula is accessible seven days a week via free water taxi located at the fishing pier on Seaview Ave. near Central Ave. in Bridgeport. The beach includes a pavilion and relaxation area with several bathrooms, showers, picnic tables, and a limited concession stand.http://www.bridgeportct.gov/pleasurebeach Nature Pleasure Beach is a protected refuge for endangered birds (piping plover, osprey) and plants (prickly pear cactus, southern sea lavender). Sections of the beach are roped off seasonally to protect the plover nesting areas. There is also an abundance of cotton-tailed rabbits, deer, foxes, raccoons, and other mammals. The sand spit is estimated to contain more than 25% of the remaining undeveloped beachfront in the state. Notable structures The transmitter towers for radio station WICC (AM) are located on Pleasure Beach. The station uses an amphibious landing craft when it needs to deliver cargo.

He was best known for his 1970s television soap opera roles of Reginald \\"Reg\\" P. MacDonald, often referred to as \\"Daddy\\" in Number 96, and Sir Clifford Langley in The Young Doctors Early life and career Dorsey was born in Yorkshire, England. His acting career began in the late 1940s when he started acting with the Gate Theatre, Dublin, in bit parts. After three years in the army in the early 1950s Dorsey returned to acting, with several minor stage roles on the UK provincial theatre circuit. The scarcity of acting work led to a career change to the publicity business, and Dorsey subsequently did the publicity in London for such performers as Kenny Ball, Acker Bilk and The Yardbirds. He later did two tours with The Rolling Stones, one of which brought him to Australia where he decided to settle in 1965. Television and film  In Australia Dorsey's career as an actor and performer quickly took off. Beginning in the mid-1960s he had several guest starring roles in Australian drama series including Riptide, Skippy the Bush Kangaroo, and many appearances in the various Crawford Productions police drama series. During this period he also played the ongoing role of Captain Roke in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation- Artransa Film science fiction children's series Phoenix Five (1970), was the straight man on Joe Martin's show Tonight on Channel Ten, and had a brief role as a police detective in Number 96 in 1972. Beginning in January 1974 Dorsey played the regular role of comedy character Reginald P. MacDonald, often referred to by his wife and daughter as \\"Daddy\\" in serial Number 96. An officious bureaucrat with the local council, buttoned-down Reg lived a regimented life and liked to speak in acronyms as a sort of verbal shorthand. He would frequently register his indignation with signature phrase \\"Great Scott!\\" Along with wife Edie ‚Äì otherwise known as \\"Mother\\" or \\"Mummy\\" ‚Äì (Wendy Blacklock) and daughter Marilyn (Frances Hargreaves) the character became a hit with viewers. In late 1976 there were plans to spin off the characters of Mummy and Daddy into a new situation comedy series titled Mummy and Me and starring Dorsey and Blacklock, but the proposed series was not picked up by the network and the characters remained in Number 96. Dorsey and Blacklock played in Number 96 continuously until it ended in August 1977, surviving several drastic cast purges during the show's closing months. After the series ended, Dorsey, like many of his former Number 96 co-stars, had a guest starring role in school-based drama Glenview High (1977). In the late 1970s Dorsey and his main Number 96 co-star Wendy Blacklock created a stage show based on their Number 96 characters which toured clubs in New South Wales over a period of nearly two years. In 1978‚Äì1979 Dorsey played an ongoing role on hospital-based soap opera The Young Doctors. He then took the regular role of Vic Marshall in Network Ten daily soap opera Arcade (1980), a notorious critical and popular failure cancelled after being on air only six weeks. Dorsey subsequently ran a theatrical group. Dorsey was cast in 2007 in the role of 'Pop' in the children's television series 'Lockie Leonard', filmed in Western Australia, in which he played the role of Lockie's grandfather. He portrayed the role in the first and second series as a recurring character, but not actively as a main role. Personal life Mike married his lifelong partner, Pamela Borain, at their property in Baldivis on 18 April 2010, aged 84 where they lived until he died peacefully at Rockingham General Hospital on Friday 24 October 2014.

He played in two Test matches in 1950. He played county cricket for Lancashire from 1948 to 1954, for Worcestershire from 1955 to 1958, and for Derbyshire from 1959 to 1962. He was the first cricketer to be capped by three different counties. Life and career Berry was born in Gorton, Manchester, Lancashire, the youngest of 10 children.Obituary, The Guardian, 13 February 2007] He played League cricket in both Lancashire and Cheshire before making his debut for Lancashire in 1948. Within two years and having taken barely more than 50 first-class wickets, he was in the England Test side, having taken 5 wickets in a Test trial. He was picked for the 1st Test against the West Indies at his home ground of Old Trafford in 1950, on a pitch made for spinners ‚Äì each side played three. Berry took 5-63 in the first innings and 4-53 in the second, to finish with match figures of 9-116. Eric Hollies took another 8 wickets for England (3-70 and 5-63), and West Indian debutant Alf Valentine took 11-204 (for West Indies 8-104 and 3-100). England won by 202 runs. Berry retained his place for the 2nd Test at Lord's. On a much less helpful pitch to spinners, he was unable to match his Old Trafford success. He bowled economically, but took no wickets (0-45 in 19 overs, and 0-67 in 32 overs). By contrast, the West Indian spinners Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine continued their success from Manchester, taking 18 wickets between them, and the West Indies won the match, their first Test victory in England. Berry was dropped after this match. By the end of the 1950 season, Berry was not even first-choice left-arm spinner for Lancashire, his long-time friend Malcolm Hilton being often preferred as the spin alternative to the off-spin of Roy Tattersall. Hilton was reckoned as the more devastating bowler on a turning wicket, and could also bowl flatter and faster than Berry, which meant that he was at times used to open the bowling. Berry was known for flight and spin, but was also inclined to be more expensive than Hilton. Nonetheless, it was Berry who was picked for the 1950‚Äì51 Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour to Australia and New Zealand under Freddie Brown. He had a poor tour on pitches not designed for spin and was not chosen for any of the Test matches, with Doug Wright being preferred. Hilton was picked for the 1951‚Äì52 tour to India, and Berry did not play Test cricket again. Berry stayed with Lancashire for four more seasons, but was usually considered as second choice to Hilton, except in 1953, when Hilton had the first experience of the loss of control that was eventually to end his career. In that season, Berry took 98 wickets at an average of 18.97, including all 10 in an innings for Lancashire against Worcestershire at Blackpool. He toured India successfully in the winter of 1953‚Äì54 with a Commonwealth XI, but with the return of Hilton, Lancashire picked him for only six County Championship matches in 1954, and he left at the end of the season to join Worcestershire. Berry enjoyed considerable success in his four seasons with Worcestershire, before leaving to join Derbyshire in the 1959 season He played four further seasons until the 1962 season. He was the first cricketer to receive a county cap from three different first-class counties. Berry was an orthodox slow left-arm spin bowler and took 703 first-class wickets. He was an excellent outfielder, but a tail-end left-handed batsman. In all first-class cricket, his highest first- class score was 40.Bob Berry at CricketArchive Berry became a publican after he retired from professional cricket, running pubs in Burton, Derby, Mansfield and Farnsfield. He was president of Farnsfield Cricket Club and of the Lancashire Players' Association. It is often claimed that he bred pigeons, but that misapprehension originates from an incident at a match against Derbyshire at Queen's Park, Chesterfield, when Berry rescued a pigeon from the pitch. He married twice. After his first wife, Eileen, died in 1992, Berry married Vera Hilton, the widow of his long-time friend and rival Malcolm Hilton, who had died in 1990. He finally retired to Greenfield near Oldham in 2004, and died in Manchester. He was survived by his second wife.

Except for a six-month stint at N√°utico, Kl√©ber remained at Moto Club until 1999. In the middle of the 1999 season, Kl√©ber was transferred to Atl√©tico Paranaense, where he enjoyed success, winning the goalscoring title in 2001. After his breakout season, he was courted by other teams in Brazil, as well as scouts from foreign clubs. = Mexico = Prior to the Clausura 2003 season, Kl√©ber was announced as the star signing by the UANL Tigres in Monterrey, Mexico. In his first season, he scored ten goals and helped the team reach the semifinals in the playoffs. The following season, scored eight goals while helping the team to a berth in the Apertura 2003 finals, where they lost to Pachuca. After his immediate success at Tigres, Kl√©ber' performance dropped off and he was mostly relegated to the bench for the Clausura 2004 season, scoring only one goal. Following the Clausura 2004 season, he was transferred to Veracruz, where he enjoyed limited success, scoring twice. Thanks to a recommendation by his ex-teammate Cuauht√©moc Blanco, Kl√©ber was signed by Club Am√©rica following his lone season at Veracruz. There, he regained his goalscoring prowess, scoring 14 goals in his first season at the club, helping them to a championship in the Clausura 2005 season. Kl√©ber did not actually play in the final, after being suspended for three games due to kicking Federico Lussenhoff of Cruz Azul in the groin in one of the semifinal matches. The following season, Kl√©ber won his second goalscoring title, sharing it with three other players (Vicente Mat√≠as Vuoso, Walter Gait√°n and Sebasti√°n Abreu).

It was formed in 1978 when guitarist Omar Shabani, bassist Tom Malanga and two other members left Simba Wanyika. They were joined by John Ngereza and Issa Juma. Les Wanyika made many popular recordings, but are best remembered for their 1979 classic Sina Makosa and Paulina. Vocalist Issa Juma left the band soon afterwards to concentrate on other musical projects. The group continued until Omar Shabani's death in 1998. John Ngereza died two years later. Formation and history In 1971, two brothers from the coastal region of Tanga Tanzania, Wilson and George Kinyonga formed a band they would call Simba Wanyika, Swahili for Savannah Lions. Due to unsteady economic conditions in Tanzania in the 70s which strained the music industry, most of the artists of that time migrated to Kenya and other neighbouring countries in search of greener environments. During that time, travelling between the two countries was made easy by the East African Community, a tripartite agreement of understanding among Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. After the collapse of the community in 1977, border crossings were made difficult, hence the eventual establishment of permanent base in Kenya by the group. With its development and growth, the band created several offshoots, but most notable was Les Wanyika. With Les Wanyika, new members of the group included both Tanzanians and Kenyans. The famous John Ngereza, Issa Juma and Omar Shabani were all from Tanzania, and one Tom Malanga was from Kenya. This band established a permanent base in Nairobi, playing in nightclubs and on various resorts. Most of the group members have either died or fallen victims of age toll. Les Wanyika was formed in November 1978 by Shabani, Malanga, Rashid Juma, Phoney Mkwanyule, Stanely Mtambo and others. It was later joined by John Ngeresa from Orch. Bwambe Bwambe, Issa Juma, Joseph Just, Mohammed Tika Abdallah and Victor Boniface.Daily Nation, February 19, 2010: Widow to mark 12 years since death of ‚ÄòSina Makosa‚Äô composer Issa Juma later left the band and formed Super Wanyika. In 1988 Shabani left the group to join Everest Kings Band led by Abdul Muyonga, but eventually rejoined Les Wanyika. One of their hits was \\"Pamela\\", which was written by Shabani and dedicated to his wife Pamela Omari. The song was originally recorded by Simba Wanyika and recorded later by Les Wanyika. In 2006 it was reported that the group would be reformed with a new line-up . See also *List of Wanyika bands, lists many of the offshoots of Les Wanyika and Simba Wanyika.

The gap in between segments is connected by various local roads and State Route 190 through Death Valley National Park. The western segment runs from State Route 99 in Bakersfield and over the Walker Pass in the Sierra Nevada to the turnoff for the Trona Pinnacles National Natural Landmark. The eastern segment runs from the southeasterly part of Death Valley to Nevada State Route 372 at the Nevada state line. SR 178 serves many different purposes. It connects Downtown Bakersfield with East Bakersfield and Lake Isabella. It is one of two crossings over the Sierra Nevada south of Yosemite (SR 120, Tioga Pass Road), connecting the southern San Joaquin Valley with the upper Mojave Desert and the Owens Valley. This also provides access to Death Valley National Park. If the unconstructed portion were built, it would also provide an easy route between Ridgecrest, California and Las Vegas, via Pahrump, Nevada. Route description SR 178 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and through Bakersfield and Ridgecrest is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. It is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. =Western segment= SR 178 follows the Kern River through the Kern Canyon, just northeast of Bakersfield The first segment starts at State Route 99 just west of Downtown Bakersfield. The road continues as 24th Street but then splits at B Street, utilizing 24th Street for westbound traffic and 23rd Street for eastbound traffic through Downtown Bakersfield. SR 178 becomes a freeway as it leaves Downtown and winds through East Bakersfield. The freeway then travels east as it enters Northeast Bakersfield. A mile east of the Morning Drive interchange, the freeway segment ends with the first at-grade intersection at Canteria Drive. The highway continues through the rural, but growing Rio Bravo section of Bakersfield, crossing SR 184. Turning northeast, the road narrows to a 4-lane highway and continues to the mouth of Kern Canyon (which is also the northeastern city limits of Bakersfield). For the next approximately 8 miles, the route is a narrow 2-lane road (average width of 18 ft. to 24 ft.), as it ascends the lower Sierra Nevada. Average speed is 35 mph, with sharp turns and steep dropoffs. After approximately 8 miles, the road becomes a much gentler 4-lane, 60 ft. expressway. The route continues east and reaches the town of Lake Isabella, which is just south of the Lake Isabella Reservoir. The road briefly expands to a divided freeway through Lake Isabella, before narrowing to a 2-lane conventional highway at the intersection with Lake Isabella Boulevard. The road continues to wind until it ascends to Walker Pass, an elevation of over . The highway then descends from the mountains to its junction with State Route 14. It then proceeds eastward across US 395 into the city of Ridgecrest. The constructed highway then ends east of Ridgecrest at the turnoff for the Trona Pinnacles National Natural Landmark. The right- of-way then continues north as the county-maintained routes of Trona Road, Trona-Wildrose Road, and then Panamint Valley Road, running through the community of Trona to SR 190 east of Panamint Springs. =Eastern segment= Looking west from the state line The second segment resumes four miles (6 km) west of Salisberry Pass in the southeasterly part of Death Valley National Park in Inyo County at what had been the former boundary of Death Valley National Monument until 1994. It then meets up with State Route 127. SR 178 then branches northward from SR 127 to the California-Nevada State Line. In Nevada, the roadway continues as State Route 372 ending at State Route 160 near the center of Pahrump in Nye County. The segment of State Route 178 from State Route 127 to the California-Nevada state line, as well as all of Nevada State Route 372, are both known as the Charles Brown Highway. Charles Brown, a former California State Legislator, was a major proponent for the incorporation of the segment of State Route 178 between State Route 14 and the California-Nevada state line into the California Highway System. History SR 178 was one of the routes created with the third bond act of 1919. It defined a route 202 miles long between Santa Maria and Freeman Junction through Bakersfield. Freeman does not exist today; it was originally located near (and later at) the junction of SR 178 and SR 14. The route was defined as Legislative Route 57. The 1919 bond act also created the first segment of LRN 58. The route was extended several times since 1919.Chronology of California Highways - Phase II: Early Growth. CAHighway.org. Accessed: 01-14-2010. In 1933, the final segment was added to LRN 58, which created a route from US 101 near Santa Margarita to the Nevada state line via Bakersfield.Chronology of California Highways - Phase III: A Significant System is Created. CAHighway.org. Accessed: 01-14-2010. Construction on the route between Bakersfield and Isabella through Kern Canyon started in 1922. Progress moved slowly, as sheer rock walls had to be blasted with dynamite. In 1931, 9 years after construction started, the 26-mile highway segment was completed.Draft Report of Kern Canyon Highway Corridor Study . KernCOG. September 1984. Page 5. In 1933, with the creation of signed routes, portions of LRN 57 and LRN 58 would be signed as Route 178. LRN 58 would be signed between Route 33 and US 99, and LRN 57 would be signed between US 99 and US 6.Route 177-184. CAHighway.org. Accessed: 01-14-2010. Later, in 1947, LRN 212 was created, and defined to run from LRN 23 (signed as US 6) near Inyokern, east to the Nevada state line. It was an unsigned route.Route 209-216. CAHighway.org. Accessed: 01-14-2010. From 1950 to 1953, a portion of SR 178 in Lake Isabella was rerouted around the Isabella Auxiliary Dam. The dam was built over the old route and parts of it are inundated by Isabella Lake. The new route goes over the dam's southern abutment and along the shoreline of Isabella Lake toward Onyx. In 1964, all of the California routes were renumbered. LRN 58 was dropped from Route 178 and combined with the eastern portion of the decommissioned US 466 (also defined as part of LRN 58) to create SR 58. The remaining Route 178 was combined with LRN 212 to create SR 178. It was originally defined to start at SR 99 in Bakersfield, but later that year it was changed to simply start in Bakersfield. This change was probably done to avoid a cosign with SR 58 along 23rd/24th St. After SR 58 was moved to the freeway south of Brundage Lane in 1976, SR 178 was extended west to SR 99. Construction on the initial freeway in Bakersfield was completed in 1968. It ran from M St, on the eastern edge of Downtown, through East Bakersfield to Haley Street. Eastern extensions have been constructed since 1968, one interchange at a time as the need arises. In the Kern Canyon section, which is between Bakersfield and the Kern River Valley, a bypass route was identified in 1964. By 1968, a deed from the US forestry service issued an easement to the State for the construction of the highway through National Forest lands. The first phase of construction was completed in 1974, which created a short freeway near Lake Isabella and a 60‚Äô wide expressway extending west to China Garden. Subsequent phases were not funded.Draft Report of Kern Canyon Highway Corridor Study . KernCOG. September 1984. Page 4-5. =Abandoned western freeway extension= The freeway portion of Route 178 ends as it approaches downtown Bakersfield from the east, causing a large volume of traffic congestion foreseen since the freeway's inception in the late 1950s. Weak public support and subsequent lack of funds hindered efforts to complete the freeway through downtown and Westchester to its proposed terminus at the beginning of the recently completed Westside Parkway. Although freeway alternatives through various neighborhoods have been studied several times following the existing portion's completion in 1968, the city of Bakersfield has never formally endorsed a route. Although Caltrans formally announced preference for an alignment through downtown and Westchester in 1973, fierce public opposition coupled with the historic integrity of the neighborhoods slated to be demolished greatly hindered momentum of the project. By the time then-Governor Jerry Brown issued a moratorium on all new freeway construction in 1977, any realistic hope for a completion date for a downtown freeway had completely evaporated. Formal studies on possible routes continue to be studied, however, resulting in recommendations of a more southern alignment near Truxtun Avenue executed by the Kern Council of Governors (KernCOG) in 1986, and most recently in 2001 as a part of the so-called Bakersfield System Study. Despite the studies, SR 178 as a limited-access highway through downtown is unlikely to come to pass anytime in the near future. A Westchester alignment would have extended the freeway west from its current terminus at M Street and through Downtown Bakersfield in the vicinity of 23rd street. As it continued through Westchester the freeway would turn southwest, cross under SR 99 and terminate at the newly completed Westside Parkway.Route 178 Corridor Study . Kern Council of Governments. December 1986. Pages 39-41. Retrieved on April 5, 2015. A southern alignment would start at SR 178 at Baker Street, about 0.7 miles east of its current terminus. From there, it would turn southwest and run parallel to Baker Street, through East Bakersfield, to the BNSF railroad yard. It would then turn west and run south of the railroad tracks through the southern end of Downtown Bakersfield. At Bakersfield High School, it would run north of the tracks (avoiding the high school). It would continue under SR 99 and terminate at the proposed Westside Parkway.Route 178 Corridor Study . Kern Council of Governments. December 1986. Pages 42-43. Retrieved on April 5, 2015. Future =City of Bakersfield 24th Street Improvements= Still needing to address the increasing crosstown congestion and with a freeway through downtown effectively out of the question, the City of Bakersfield approved construction in the late 2000s to increase capacity on 24th Street through Westchester and 23rd and 24th streets through Downtown using TRIP funds. The project will widen, realign and re-stripe 24th Street from west of State Route 99 to east of M Street, as well as realign and re- stripe 23rd Street from west of C Street to east of M Street, in order to add two travel lanes (one in each direction) to the roadway. The project will also encompass improvements to the 24th Street/State Route 99 interchange and widen the Oak Street/24th Street intersection. This solution required the acquisition of several properties north of 24th Street, which was completed in early 2015, as well as the closure of access to B Street all the way to City in the Hills Drive. It would loop around Elm Street, go past Oildale, and terminate in Northeast Bakersfield, which is also known as City in the Hills, California. It would then turn east, and merge back with the present day SR 178 and go through the Kern Canyon into Lake Isabella. =Kern Canyon bypass= There is a plan to realign SR 178 from its current route through Kern Canyon to a route parallel to Rancheria Road, north of the canyon. The new alignment would run from future Vineland Road, 15 miles to China Garden, where it will meet with the existing four-lane expressway (which was completed in 1974). The goal will be to have a four-lane expressway from Bakersfield to Lake Isabella.Draft Report of Kern Canyon Highway Corridor Study . Kern Council of Governments. Retrieved on August 29, 2013. This would eliminate the sharp curves and steep drop-offs that exist with the current route. No final construction date has been released, nor has much of the right-of-way been acquired. =Death Valley Segment= This segment is unconstructed from 15 miles east of Ridgecrest to 15 miles west of SR 127 (10 miles from the eastern boundary of the Death Valley National Monument). The state is considering three options: select an alignment to connect with the current eastern segment at its present location; select an alignment to avoid traversing the Death Valley Wilderness; or delete this unconstructed segment from the State Highway System. The County of Inyo has offered three alternatives: * The State of California rescinds the unconstructed portion of SR 178. * The State of California rescinds the unconstructed portion of SR 178 and adopts Trona Road, Trona-Wildrose Road, and Panamint Valley Road. * The State of California rescinds the unconstructed portion of SR 178 and adopts Trona Road, Trona- Wildrose Road, and Panamint Valley Road; Inyo County adopts portions of SR 178 and SR 190, and Death Valley National Park adopts the portion of SR 178 that connects to Badwater Road in the park.

Its initial dedication was the creation and production of original musicals, but has now taken to performing both professionally published and student-written materials. Students are welcome to write, compose, design, direct, perform in, and otherwise become involved with every aspect of each production. The organization is open to all Carnegie Mellon students from all backgrounds who are interested, and all performances are public with varying ticket prices. History Scotch'n'Soda Theatre is the nation's oldest co-ed student theater group, and is one of the oldest and largest student organizations at Carnegie Mellon University. It was founded in the fall of 1907 as The White Friars Club, providing a theatrical outlet for the students of the Carnegie Technical Schools. Their first production, in the spring of 1908, was entitled \\"All in a Dormitory\\" and gave a comical look at life on campus. The club would grow in only three years to have a membership of seventy-eight in 1910 and continued on to have its first financially successful year in 1911. The White Friars Club was short-lived, as student theater went on hiatus during World War I. It wasn't until 1932 when a student theater group called The Bacchanalians formed to produce a musical for Carnegie Tech's Spring Carnival. The organization took its current name in 1937 during a vote by the membership. Unconfirmed rumor has it that the name with the most votes was Hop'n'Scotch, but the leaders of the organization fixed the vote so that Scotch'n'Soda came out victorious. In any case, the newly named student-run theater troupe founded by three drama majors began producing original full-length musicals for Spring Carnival. With the exception of a five-year break from 1942 to 1946 for World War II, Scotch'n'Soda has been producing musicals for Carnival continuously to the present. In the 1960s, Scotch'n'Soda began expanding its season by producing shows for Homecoming. While then still heavily populated by drama majors, S'n'S provided a theatrical outlet to students of all disciplines and encouraged collaboration on original works. Certainly the most notable of these original works from the 60s was the musical \\"Pippin, Pippin\\" by drama student Stephen Schwartz, produced for Carnival 1967. This show was produced on Broadway just five years later in 1972 under the shortened title \\"Pippin\\", and was directed and choreographed by the famed Bob Fosse. Scotch'n'Soda continued to grow in the 1970s, winning a Broadcast Music, Inc. award for Outstanding Variety Show in 1970 for \\"Something Personal\\" by David Sheridan Spangler and Mark Pirolo and again in 1972 for \\"A New Day\\" by Stephen M. Fechtor. However, in a major blow to the membership the School of Drama forbade acting majors from participating in Scotch'n'Soda productions in 1976. Despite losing the core of the membership, the remaining members of the club decided to press on with completely student-run, non-major theater. Not satisfied with only doing musicals for Homecoming and Carnival, Scotch'n'Soda introduced the campus' first long-form improvisational comedy production in 1988. This began a 20-year period of growth and change for the organization. In the early 1990s, they expanded to a three-production season. In 1993, a subsidiary group that existed for one year called Club Soda formed, which taught new skills to the diverse membership. This led to more submissions of both student and professionally written plays, and in 1994 the theater company began regular theater \\"seasons\\" of three shows plus the Spring Carnival Musical. In 1996, another subsidiary troupe formed, The No Parking Players, Carnegie Mellon's first improv comedy group. In 1998, Scotch'n'Soda expanded to a permanent five-production season. Today, Scotch'n'Soda proudly produces six to seven shows each season, ranging from full-scale musicals to intimate black box plays, performing in a variety of spaces in the University Center and elsewhere on campus. With a strongly committed and talented membership spanning all six of Carnegie Mellon's undergraduate colleges and representing over 30 different majors, Scotch'n'Soda is growing still and is well poised to continue providing student-run theater to the Carnegie Mellon campus community for years to come. Board of directors Scotch'n'Soda is governed by a board of nine directors . Each position of the board is elected annually by the general membership. These positions (along with the current students who occupy them) include: *President (Emily Schneider) *Artistic Director (Katia Peppas) *Vice President (Madeline Elston) *Managing Director (Kanvi Shah) *Technical Coordinator (Gavin Grnja) *Public Relations Coordinator (Remy Goldberg) *Secretary (Cynthia Xu) *General Membership Coordinator (Gabi Augustin) *Executive Board Member (Ayda Ozdoganlar) These nine students work to contribute and act as executive producers to each production. They also hold open weekly meetings to discuss all issues related to the organization and hold responsibility for selecting material for productions. They are assisted by auxiliary board members who handle various facets of the organization and include the Webmaster, Historian, Director of Alumni Relations, Directors of Technical, Production, and Artistic Training, Music Liaison, and various liaisons to the subsidiary troupes within the organization. All auxiliary board members are represented at Board Meetings by the Vice President. Show process =Selection of material= Scotch'n'Soda welcomes scripts presented from any student on Carnegie Mellon's campus, though it does not have to be student-written. Playwrights who are not Carnegie Mellon students may submit their own material as long as it is submitted through a current CMU student. All scripts must be approved by the board, who examine each script and approve those that appeal to the community and membership, and are technically feasible. After scripts are approved, all Carnegie Mellon students are welcome to submit a Director's Proposal to the Scotch'n'Soda board. In a publicly held meeting, directors present their proposals to the board. The meeting is then closed to the public as the board selects a specific show for production. Several weeks into production, a Board Preview performance is held--which includes an open rehearsal of the show, as well as reports from all members of the technical staff on the production. It is at this Board Preview that final approval must be given to a show before it may begin performances. =Funding= Scotch'n'Soda is funded by a specific allocation of a student activities fee paid by all students and distributed by Carnegie Mellon's Joint Funding Committee. Scotch'n'Soda does not profit from its productions, nor does any member receive payment for services. =Venues= Originally, Scotch'n'Soda presented all its performances in Pittsburgh's Carnegie Music Hall, located less than one mile from the school's campus. Eventually, due to rental fees and time commitments, Scotch'n'Soda had to leave the large performance hall and was transplanted into the Carnegie Mellon gym. This was soon followed by a move into a specially constructed stage in Skibo Ballroom, part of the Skibo University Center on Carnegie Mellon's campus. In the summer of 1994, this building was torn down to make room for the school's current University Center. During the two years of construction, Scotch'n'Soda was completely homeless and performed in various lecture halls, the drill deck of the old student center and off campus at Rodef Shalom Congregation. Upon the completion of CMU's University Center, Scotch'n'Soda has been alternating performance spaces throughout the building including: The Connan Room, The McKenna/Peter/Wright Room, Rangos Ballroom, and McConomy Auditorium. This has proven difficult for the organization to this day, as access to the performance spaces is very limited, and in most cases they can only use each performance space for a maximum of seven consecutive days (Spring Carnival performances in 1997‚Äì99 were able to reserve Rangos hall for two weeks). This limited amount of time includes load-in, rehearsals, performances and strike. In fact, unable to find a suitable venue, the May 2001 production of Edward Albee's \\"The Zoo Story\\" was performed outside in the Highlander Compass. Some other venues have been used in recent years, including Porter Hall 100, Porter Hall 125C and the Helen Wayne Rauh Studio Theatre (in the Purnell Center). As of Fall 2016, most performances are held in the Cohon University Center Studio Theater, a black box theater constructed as part of the University Center expansion and opened in 2016. Subtroupes =The No Parking Players= No Parking Players Improv Founded in 1996, the No Parking Players is Scotch'n'Soda Theatre's improv troupe. NPP practices improvised theatre of all kinds, with a focus on long form comedy. At the core of the NPP experience are the weekly workshops on Thursdays and Sundays, open to the entire campus community. People of all experience levels are welcome, including those who have never tried improv before. Most workshops are composed of regulars and newcomers side by side. The No Parking Players performance group (PG) also has regular shows about twice a month, with the improvisers performing long form improv such as Harolds and Armandos. In 2009, the troupe began offering a class on comedic improv for free elective credit via Carnegie Mellon's Student College. =Tisbert Sketch Comedy= Tisbert sketch comedy Founded during the 2011‚Äì12 academic year, Tisbert is Scotch'n'Soda's sketch comedy group. Composed entirely of student-written sketches, Tisbert presents one show per semester for a total of two shows per academic calendar; the troupe is known for employing multiple forms of media, such as video, in their sketches. Acting roles for Tisbert performances are audition-only and open to any member of the Carnegie Mellon community. Writers' meetings are also open to the Carnegie Mellon community and are not subject to any audition process. The troupe does not reveal what 'Tisbert' means to non-members, and the mystery is evident by the question mark in their logo. A subsection of Tisbert is the Tistroupe, a group of writers and actors that act as their own performance troupe within Tisbert. In 2018, the troupe began offering a class on writing and performing sketch comedy for free elective credit via Carnegie Mellon's Student College. The organization's secretary, show organizer, artistic director, and head writer serve as the administrative board, known as the Tisboard. = New Works Coffeehouse = The NewWorks Coffeehouse logo Previously simply called \\"Workshopping\\", the New Works Coffeehouse embraces the ideals of the early years of Scotch'n'Soda, facilitating the creation of new original works by its members. The subtroupe provides members with the tools they need to get from idea to script, and hosts readings, stagings, and productions of work by current and former members of Scotch'n'Soda. It accepts submissions of all forms of writing for either workshopping or production services; these services are open to all students who are a part of the Carnegie Mellon Community, regardless of department. =Alumni Clan= Scotch'n'Soda is currently developing an Alumni Clan, which is devoted to keeping all past members of the organization in touch and organizing reunion events. It also presents the Buzz Blair Award for the Performing Arts, named after founding member Leonard 'Buzz' Blair, and given annually during Carnegie Mellon's homecoming festivities. Notable alumni Numerous renowned figures in the performing arts started with Scotch'n'Soda. Some of the most acclaimed are John-Michael Tebelak, author of Godspell; Roger O.

Biography Albrecht was born in Essen, the son of the musicologist Hans Albrecht (1902-1961). He studied music in Kiel and in Hamburg, where his teachers included Wilhelm Br√ºckner-R√ºggeberg. He was a first-prize winner at the International Besan√ßon Competition for Young Conductors at age 22. His first post was as a repetiteur at the Stuttgart State Opera. Later, he became Senior Kapellmeister at the Staatstheater Mainz, and Generalmusikdirektor in L√ºbeck. He also held posts at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Tonhalle-Orchester Z√ºrich and the Hamburg State Opera. His work in contemporary opera included conducting Aribert Reimann's Lear in both its world premiere and its United States premiere, as well as making the first commercial recording of the opera. His other commercial recordings include Robert Schumann's Genoveva and Manfred,Franklin, Peter, \\"CD Reviews\\" (March 1994). The Musical Times, 135 (1813): pp. 166-167. and the first commercial recording of Hans Werner Henze's Gogo no Eiko (The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea) in its revised Japanese-language version. Albrecht died at age 78 on 2 February 2014 in Berlin. =Czech Philharmonic controversy= In 1991, the musicians of the Czech Philharmonic picked Albrecht as its principal conductor, the first non- Czech conductor named to the post, for a tenure scheduled to last seven years beginning in 1994. The orchestra had played a part in protesting the Soviet domination of their country and reorganized as a self-governing entity. The musician's selection of Albrecht effectively meant the replacing of Czech conductor Ji≈ô√≠ Bƒõlohl√°vek, who then in 1992 resigned from his position early. Consequently, by the time that he took up the post, the orchestra was already somewhat riven. Albrecht proved effective in improving the Czech Philharmonic's finances and at raising its international profile with foreign tours. He is also acknowledged to have been a musical success, and his recordings with the orchestra included music of Ervin Schulhoff.Rickards, Guy, Review of recordings of music of Ervin Schulhoff (July 1995). Tempo (New Ser.), 193: pp. 53-55. However, a series of political conflicts led to his early resignation. In 1994, the Czech Philharmonic was invited to perform at the Vatican in a concert celebrating reconciliation between Roman Catholics and Jews. However, the invitation was to play under the American conductor Gilbert Levine, already known for his close relationship with the Vatican under Pope John Paul II and subsequently for the telecast, Papal Concert to Commemorate the Holocaust. Albrecht vetoed the engagement, ostensibly because the orchestra was too busy, although other speculation on the actual reason for the refusal was that the Vatican did not invite Albrecht. Czech president V√°clav Havel became involved, telling Albrecht that his actions were damaging the orchestra. The situation steadily deteriorated, with Albrecht painting himself in press interviews as a victim of racism and anti-German feeling and for being expected personally to atone for all past German misdeeds. He also claimed that his phone was bugged. Havel retaliated in the media with his own claims. Albrecht and Bƒõlohl√°vek collaborated for the 100th anniversary concert, each conducting half of it, on January 4, 1996, but Havel was conspicuously absent and members of the orchestra showed their allegiances when the time came for applause. Albrecht resigned from this post a month later asserting that his musical authority had been undermined. With the Czech Philharmonic, Albrecht conducted the first commercial recording of Dvo≈ô√°k's opera Dimitrij. =Other conducting work= From 2000-2004, he was principal conductor of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra, with which he made commercial recordings for such labels as Chandos. In 2003, he caused controversy when he spoke from the podium at one concert to protest the US invasion of Iraq. He later apologized for the incident. In Japan, he served as principal conductor of Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra from 1998 to 2007, and became its conductor laureate after 2007. =Recordings of complete operas= Berlioz, troyens, Les,

He was a leading interpreter of Czech classical music, and became chief conductor of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra in 1990, a role he would serve on two occasions during a combined span of seven years (1990‚Äì92, 2012‚Äì17). He also served a six-year tenure as the chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 2006 to 2012. He gained international renown and repute for his performances of the works of Czech composers such as Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k and Bohuslav Martin≈Ø, and was credited as \\"the most profound proponent of Czech orchestral music\\" by Czech music specialist Professor Michael Beckerman. Early career Bƒõlohl√°vek was born in Prague. His father was a barrister and judge. In his youth he studied cello with Milo≈° S√°dlo and later graduated from the Prague Conservatory and the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague. After graduation, he studied conducting for two years with Sergiu Celibidache. Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic In 1970 Bƒõlohl√°vek won the Czech Young Conductors' Competition. He later served for two years as an assistant conductor at the Czech Philharmonic. From 1972 to 1978, he was conductor of the Brno Philharmonic; he was then chief conductor of the Prague Symphony Orchestra until 1989. The Communist authorities blocked Bƒõlohl√°vek from touring in Berlin and Israel. Bƒõlohl√°vek became chief conductor of the Czech Philharmonic in 1990, after the Velvet Revolution. However, in 1991, the orchestra reorganized and controversially voted to appoint Gerd Albrecht its new principal conductor to replace Bƒõlohl√°vek. Instead of remaining until Albrecht's accession, Bƒõlohl√°vek resigned from the orchestra in 1992. He subsequently founded the Prague Philharmonia (Pra≈æsk√° komorn√≠ filharmonie) in 1993, after the Czech Ministry of Defence had offered funding for training 40 young musicians. Bƒõlohl√°vek had auditioned musicians for the orchestra, but the ministry withdrew its funding the next year. He subsequently secured private funding for the orchestra, and served as its first music director. After the orchestra's public debut in 1994, he recorded and performed with it in concerts worldwide. He conducted the Prague Philharmonia at its first BBC Proms appearance in 2004, in a televised performance.

History In its original form Creeksea Place (built by Sir Arthur Harris) probably consisted of three, or possibly, four wings surrounding a courtyard with the longest wing running from north to south. An original lead rain-water head, complete with the date ‚Äò1569‚Äô moulded on its face side, still exists today. Sadly, in about 1740, the south part of the house, together with the enclosing walls of the garden were dismantled and the materials sold, leaving standing only the outer courtyard enclosure, the North range and the West wing. The house was restored in modern times with a new range built on the foundations of the original East wing and various other additions were made by the Rome family. However a number of original features still exist such as a moulded oak door frame, original windows with brick mullions, transoms and square moulded labels and superb chimney stacks with octagonal shafts. Creeksea Place was reputed to have been the home of Anne Boleyn (however she actually died in 1536) and that her spirit was said to been seen walking from an old cottage near the Cricksea ferry. Her daughter, Queen Elizabeth, is thought to have met her soldiers here and that they were supposed to have come to meet her through a tunnel connected with Rochford. As Rochford is some ten miles or so away then the tunnel is more likely based on fantasy than fact. Great Tudor drains, full of oyster shells have been uncovered but not the tunnel itself. Sir Henry Mildmay, Keeper of the Crown Jewels for Charles I married into the Harris family and, by the laws of the day, eventually became the owner of Creeksea Place. He is reputed to have been one of the twelve State elders who subsequently signed King Charles's death warrant. Following the execution and after the accession to the throne of Charles II, Sir Henry was said to have been arrested at Creeksea and he and the other eleven elders were accused of regicide (the murder of a king or queen), later pardoned but it is said, to make sure they did not forget the enormity of their crime, all twelve were obliged to spend the anniversary date of the King's execution in the Tower of London. The Great Sword of Creeksea Place, now in safekeeping, had rested for nearly three hundred years on a platform at the head of the oak spiral staircase which led up to the attics of the old house. It a court sword of the early 17th century, its hilt and pommel being covered with chased silver in various designs, the Tudor rose being the most prominent. It is said that one man alone, with the sword in his hand, could have held the stairs against all comers, and protected the women and children of the house from assailants. Although the story of a 'Great Sword' has a certain romantic appeal it is far more likely that the sword was one of a job lot bought during the 1960s from an antique shop near Marble Arch, London, by the previous owner of Creeksea Place.Personal communication from Roy Bertorelli, onetime owner of Creeksea Place A short distance from Creeksea Place at is the parish church of All Saints, entirely rebuilt in 1878, but retaining features from the original church built on the site, such as the 14th century South doorway, cinquefoiled ogee lights on either side of the archway and various artifacts within the church. The square stone bowl of the original font, believed to date from the year 1125, was found on the Cricksea glebe being used as a step to the barn. The church stands behind the building known as Creeksea Hall (), another building of considerable vintage, and all to be found in the area of Essex known as the Dengie Hundred. Following brief occupation by Lindisfarne College, Creeksea Place was used by British military units during World War II but, since that time, the main building has been uninhabited. It is only in recent times that a concerted effort has begun to restore the house to its former elegance by creating a variety of useful purposes for the buildings. The funds deriving from these activities will, it is hoped, allow a gradual, but complete, restoration of Creeksea Place and its surroundings for the public to appreciate.

The first programmable calculators such as the IBM CPC used punched cards or other media for program storage. Hand-held electronic calculators store programs on magnetic strips, removable read-only memory cartridges, flash memory, or in battery-backed read/write memory. Since the early 1990s, most of these flexible handheld units belong to the class of graphing calculators. Before the mass-manufacture of inexpensive dot-matrix LCDs, however, programmable calculators usually featured a one-line numeric or alphanumeric display. The Big Four manufacturers of programmable calculators are Casio, Hewlett-Packard, Sharp, and Texas Instruments. All of the above have also made pocket computers in the past, especially Casio and Sharp. Many calculators of this type are monochrome LCD, some are four-color (red or orange, green, blue, and black), or, in the case of some machines at the top of the line as of February 2015 color similar to monitors displaying 8 or 16 bit graphics. As they are used for graphing functions, the screens of these machines are pixel-addressable. Some have a touch screen, buzzers or other sound producers, internal clocks, modems or other connectivity devices including IrDA transceivers, several types of ports for peripherals like printers, and ports for memory cards of a number of types. :For earlier devices, see: History of computing hardware  Calculator programming  Programmable calculators allow the user to write and store programs in the calculator in order to solve difficult problems or automate an elaborate procedure. Programming capability appears most commonly (although not exclusively) in graphing calculators, as the larger screen allows multiple lines of source code to be viewed simultaneously (i.e., without having to scroll to the next/previous display line). Originally, calculator programming had to be done in the calculator's own command language, but as calculator hackers discovered ways to bypass the main interface of the calculators and write assembly language programs, calculator companies (particularly Texas Instruments) began to support native-mode programming on their calculator hardware, first revealing the hooks used to enable such code to operate, and later explicitly building in facilities to handle such programs directly from the user interface. Many programs written for calculators can be found on the internet. Users can download the programs to a personal computer, and then upload them to the calculator using a specialized link cable, infrared wireless link or through a memory card. Sometimes these programs can also be run through emulators on the PC. Programming these machines can be done on the machine, on the PC side and uploaded as source code, or compiled on the PC side and uploaded as with Flash and some C/C++ implementations. In addition to computer-side language packages such as tigcc, hpgcc, and others, the PC link software available for TI, HP, Casio, and Sharp calculators contain program editors; there are also SDKs, emulators, and other tools for use on the computer side, and other manufacturer and third-party tools like the TI++ editor.http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/300/30032.html Programs, data, and so forth can also be exchanged among similar machines via the same ports on the calculator used for PC connectivity. On-board programming tools which use non-native language implementations include the On-Board C Compiler for fx series Casio calculators and the TI-83 BBC Basic port. One possibility arising from the above is writing interpreters, compilers, and translator programs for additional languages for programming the machines; BBC Basic has already been ported to the TI-83 and -84 series and other on-board languages and programming tools discussed by many include Fortran, awk, Pascal, Rexx, perl, Common Lisp, Python, tcl, and various Unix shells. Commonly available programs for calculators include everything from math/science related problem solvers to video games, as well as so-called demos. Much of this code is user- created freeware or even open source, though commercial software, particularly for educational and science/engineering markets, is also available. Programmable calculators have major web sites with information, documentation, message boards, tools for download, and other things useful for this pursuit; the main sites for each manufacturer's calculators are run by third parties with varying degrees of collaboration from the companies themselves: namely HPCalc.org, TICalc.org, and CasioCalc.org, (qqv.) with the SharpCalc.org domain being recently purchased by an organisation which indicated intent to produce a site similar to the other three, plus information on Sharp pocket computers. The companies themselves also have sites such as TIEducation.com with information and tools for the machines.TIEducation.com File:TI-59.jpgA TI-59 showing one card in the holder on the front of the calculator and another being inserted into the card reader in the side.

Calculators supporting such programming were Turing- complete if they supported both conditional statements and indirect addressing of memory. Notable examples of Turing complete calculators were Casio FX-602P series, the HP-41 and the TI-59. Keystroke programming is still used in mid- range calculators like the HP 35s and HP-12C. = BASIC = BASIC is a widespread programming language commonly adapted to desktop computers and pocket computers. The most common languages now used in high range calculators are proprietary BASIC-style dialects as used by CASIO and TI (TI-BASIC). These BASIC dialects are optimised for calculator use, combining the advantages of BASIC and keystroke programming. They have little in common with mainstream BASIC. The version for the Ti-89 and subsequent is more fully featured, including the full set of string and character manipulation functions and statements in standard Basic. A complete port of BBC Basic to the TI-83 subfamily of calculators is now available. It is installed via a cable or IrDA connection with a computer. = RPL = RPL is a special Forth-like programming language used by Hewlett- Packard in its high range devices. The first device with RPL calculator was the HP-28C released in 1987.Description of the HP-28C in The Museum of HP Calculators The language PPL was introduced with the HP Prime calculator and is much like Pascal = Assembly = An assembler integrated into the TI 89 and related calculators was announced and released in 2014. Machine language programming was often discouraged on early calculator models; however, dedicated platform hackers discovered ways to bypass the built-in interpreters on some models and program the calculator directly in assembly language, a technique that was first discovered and utilized on the TI-85 due to a programming flaw in a mode-switching key. By the time the TI-83 came out, TI and HP had realized the need to address the support needs of homebrew programmers, and started to make assembly language libraries and documentation available for prospective developers. Software, particularly games, could now be nearly as fast and as graphical as their Game Boy counterparts, and TI in particular would later formalize assembly programming into support for packaged applications for future calculators such as the TI-83 Plus and TI-89; HP includes some onboard support for assembler programming on the HP-50g, its current top-of-the-line calculator model. Programs and toolkits to allow on-board assembly-like programming (often Intel 80x86 even if the actual processor in the calculator is something completely different like a Zilog or Motorola chip) are in the beta stage in at least two implementations‚Äîthe native Basic variant can be enhanced by user-defined functions and procedures as well as assembly and C modules developed on a computer and uploaded to the calculator which allow for writing and running \\"pseudo assembly\\" programs just as one would the Basic type ones. Other languages like Rexx, awk, Perl, and some Unix shells can also be implemented in this fashion on many calculators of this type. =Other Languages= The GCC development suite is available for several models of Casio, HP, and TI calculators, meaning that C, C++, Fortran 77, and inline assembly language can be used to develop a program on the computer side and then upload it to the calculator. Projects in development by third parties include on-board and/or computer-side converters, interpreters, code generators, macro assemblers, or compilers for Fortran, other Basic variants, awk, C, Cobol, Rexx, Perl, Python, Tcl, Pascal Delphi, and operating system shells like DOS/Win95 batch, OS/2 batch, WinNT/2000 shell, Unix shells, and DCL. Many TI, Casio, Sharp and HP models have Lua interpreters which are part of the default configuration or can be optionally added. Some calculators run a subset of Fortran 77 called Mini-Fortran; the compiler is on the calculator so connecting to a PC to put programs onto the machine is not needed. The OnCalc C Compiler for the Casio fx-9860 series is now available. The Sharp PC G850V pocket computer has an on- board C compiler in addition to an assembler and a Basic interpreter.  Persistent memory  One important feature of programmable calculators is the availability of some form of persistent memory. Without persistent memory, programs have to be re-entered whenever power is lost, making the device cumbersome. Persistent memory can be internal or on a separate device. Some programmable calculators employ both schemes. = Magnetic card reader / writer = Magnetic card readers were among the first persistent memory options available.i.E. HP 9810A introduced 1971 The entered programs are stored on magnetic strips. Those were easy to transport, and the reader/writer was compact in size. However, the reader/writer as well as the magnetic strips were quite expensive. The last and most notable devices to use magnetic strips were the HP-41C and TI-59. = Continuous memory = Continuous memory does not lose its content when the calculator is switched off. With continuous memory the user can, for example, change batteries without losing the entered programs.Description of the HP-15C in the Museum of HP Calculators = Cassette tape = Compact Cassettes offered a simple, inexpensive alternative to magnetic cards. Usually, an interface module, such as the Casio FA-1, was used to connect the calculator to an ordinary cassette recorder and digital data were encoded as frequency-shift keyed audio signals.Description of the FX-502P and FA-1 on Voidware Sharp and Hewlett-Packard also sold dedicated micro- or mini-cassette recorders that connected directly to the calculator. These set-ups, while being more practical and reliable, were also more expensive. = Semi-continuous memory = As memory demands rose, it became more difficult to create true continuous memory and developers sought alternatives. With semi-continuous memory memory content was only preserved if specific battery-changing rules were observed. The most common rules were: # A special backup battery would ensure that the memory was not lost while the main batteries were changed. # Battery removal and replacement had to be completed in a relatively short time. For example, with the HP 35s, battery replacement had to be completed in less than 2 minutes after removal.HP-32s Users Manual Page 289ff # At least two main batteries were used and could only be changed one at a time. = PC-connection = Programs and data are transferred to a personal computer for storage. The transfer is done by the following connection methods (chronological order of appearance) RS-232, IrDA and USB. This method has the advantage of being very cost efficient and is usually faster than cassette interface. These advantages are offset by the need of a personal computer. An early example of PC connection is the Casio FX-603P in conjunction with the Casio FA-6 interface. In this set-up transfer was done in plain text so the program and data could be stored and edited with a standard text editor. = Flash memory =  Programmable calculators and pocket computers  Throughout the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, programmable calculators stood in competition with pocket computers, with high-end calculators sharing many similarities. For example, both device types were programmable in unstructured BASIC and with few exceptions featured QWERTY keyboards. However, there were also some differences: * BASIC- programmable calculators often featured an additional \\"calculator-like\\" keyboard and a special calculator mode in which the system behaved like a scientific calculator. * Pocket computers often offered additional programming languages as option. The Casio PB-2000 for example offered ANSI-C, BASIC, Assembler and Lisp.Description of the PB-2000 in Caz Pocket Computers Companies often had both device types in their product portfolio. Casio, for example, sold some BASIC-programmable calculators as part of their \\"fx-\\" calculator seriesThe picture of the FX-700P and FX-702P show the text \\"programmable calculator\\" and pocket computer the dedicated \\"pb-\\" series while Sharp marketed all BASIC-programmable devices as pocket computers. Related tools Some programmable calculators have one or more methods of connecting to a PC for interchange of data, programs, and software. These methods include IrDA, other wireless, serial ports -including USB or RS-232 via.125 inch or other size audio plugs, etc. Some of the latest programmable calculators contain cellular modems as an additional channel of connectivity. The programmable calculators can in many cases, via these connections, be used with peripherals such as data loggers and interfaces for instruments like thermometers, pH meters, weather instruments of all kinds, light meters, audio probes and microphones, dynamometers, pressure gauges, voltmeters, ammeters, ohm meters, atmospheric electricity measurement apparatus, ion counters, Geiger counters and scintillometers, altimeters, scales, accelerometers and many others. Some machines can be used with oscilloscopes and their peripherals as well. Others can be configured‚Äîfor example, collecting bio- feedback data by connecting devices for pulse, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, galvanic skin resistance, body temperature, and even EKG and EEG probes to a data logger which is then connected to the calculator and, then or later, a PC. The HP programmables and others have an IrDA interface which allows them to interface with the printers specially designed for the calculators, HP's main lines of laser printers, computers, other calculators, and other devices. Also commonly available from many companies are small printers made specifically for calculators which tend to use cash register tape paper, ports and cables for connecting the calculators to a computer and/or another calculator, cassette recorders for recording programs and data, overhead projector displays and connectors for auxiliary display devices. The earlier programmable calculators as well as the pocket computers mentioned above also had such things as video interfaces for televisions and composite monitors, 2¬Ω inch mini floppy disc drives, bar-code readers, and standard RS-232 connectivity which provided for other such things as modems, external hard drives and more. The printer selection for the pocket computers was a bit wider as well, including thermal, impact, dot matrix, daisy wheel, 4-colour pen, printers of the type used in simpler printing calculator. Some calculators and pocket computers had external 3¬Ω and 5¬º inch floppy drives, cables for connecting two cassette recorders, cradles containing a printer and/or cassette recorder into which the machine slid, and so on. It is also possible to connect some machines to certain electric typewriters for use as a printer (the typewriters are also able to be connected to PCs for this purpose, and the interface tends to be a standard RS-232 and/or DIN plug), and in some cases to access the typewriter's floppy or micro floppy drives.

Its dual purpose was to create an earth-conscious, intimate nightclub that would nurture live music, integrated with a full-time environmental and social justice activist center. It was located at 161 Hudson Street in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood. History The original concept for the Wetlands Preserve came from founder- owner Larry Bloch, who set its course for over eight years before passing the helm to Peter Shapiro in 1997. Shapiro remained faithful to the mission until September 2001, when the gentrification of TriBeCa caused the building to be sold and the club was forced to close before being converted into condominiums. Phish, Oasis, Sublime, Dave Matthews Band, Maroon 5, Pearl Jam and Widespread Panic all played early, seminal shows there. The Wetlands' independent, in-house booking strategies and the freedom to play all night nurtured a scene that helped bands develop a following. Late-night jams lasting until dawn were common. It was the intimate connection fostered between artist and audience, the continuity of a live DJ connection to the vibe of the night, and carefully balanced sound throughout the club, including the halls and bathrooms, that would bring the 7,500-square foot, two-level space to a pulsing unity that John Popper of Blues Traveler would lastingly nickname \\"Sweatglands.\\"Wetlands Preserved: The Story of an Activist Rock Club Supported by the music, Wetlands spent over one million dollars during its lifetime to fund the Activism Center at Wetlands Preserve, originally named the Eco-Saloon.

Career Popular in her home state of Queensland, MacDonald appeared on a number of local programs in the 1970s including her own show, Jacki and all that Jazz, on QTQ-9 and a daily breakfast program, The Jacki Mac Show, on TVQ-0. In 1978 she was GTV-9's replacement for Daryl Somers and puppet sidekick Ossie Ostrich when the pair moved to 0-10. After she presented The Super Saturday Show for several months, Somers returned to Nine and she was asked to join them as co-presenter of a revival of Hey Hey It's Saturday, a role which she would continue for nine years. MacDonald was frequently made the butt of jokes in the show and when she came on the tune \\"Folks Are Dumb Where I Come From\\" would often be played (a reference to MacDonald coming from Queensland). In 1984, the same year as HHIS's move from a local morning timeslot to a national primetime slot, MacDonald also hosted The Ossie Ostrich Video Show, a national weekday children's program on Nine. For a short time MacDonald was also an anchor of TVQ-0's Eyewitness News bulletins in 1983, which made her one of the few presenters to appear for two different networks at the same time (in her case, the Nine and Ten networks). During the 1970s and 1980s she won several TV Week Logie Awards for Most Popular Female Personality in Queensland. MacDonald kept out of the spotlight following her departure from Hey Hey in 1988 (returning for two episodes in Brisbane in 1990). She returned to television in 1991 to host a season of Australia's Funniest Home Video Show after Graham Kennedy left. In 1992, former Hey Hey It's Saturday producer Gavan Disney approached her to co-host his new TV program Healthy Wealthy And Wise which was being produced for Network Ten. She continued with the new program for a couple of years before leaving television altogether. MacDonald appeared on the 2005 Network Ten special Seriously 40 which commemorated 40 years of Network Ten. On 7 October 2009 she made a guest appearance on the second Hey Hey reunion special. When Hey Hey returned as a series in 2010 she did two appearances. The first one was at a museum but the second she was very ill with the flu and used Skype to communicate. This was her last appearance. MacDonald is now a regular show business commentator on Drive with Michael Smith for the Brisbane commercial talk radio station 4BC.

Joseph Keilberth (19 April 1908 ‚Äì 20 July 1968) was a German conductor who specialised in opera. He started his career in the State Theatre of his native city, Karlsruhe. In 1940 he became director of the German Philharmonic Orchestra of Prague. Near the end of World War II, he was appointed principal conductor of the venerable Saxon State Opera Orchestra in Dresden. In 1949 he became chief conductor of the Bamberg Symphony, formed mainly of German musicians expelled from postwar Czechoslovakia under the Bene≈° decrees. He died in Munich in 1968 after collapsing while conducting Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde in exactly the same place as Felix Mottl was similarly fatally stricken in 1911. His final recording, a Meistersinger, came a month before his death ‚Äî at the Bavarian State Opera on 21 June. Keilberth was a regular at Bayreuth in the early 1950s, with complete Ring cycles from 1952, 1953 and 1955, as well as a well-regarded recording of Die Walk√ºre from 1954 (the whereabouts of rest of the cycle are unclear) in which Martha M√∂dl, perhaps the greatest Wagnerian actress and tragedian of her time, sang her only recorded Sieglinde. He made the first stereo recording of Wagner's Ring Cycle in 1955, as well as a so-called \\"second cycle\\" with M√∂dl, rather than Astrid Varnay, as Br√ºnnhilde. M√∂dl's accounts of Br√ºnnhilde, from the 1953 Ring as well as the 1955 \\"second cycle,\\" are her only recordings of the role other than Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler's 1953 Rome Ring and commercial Walkuere in 1954. Among his other recordings, his outstanding interpretations of Wagner's Lohengrin at the 1953 Bayreuth Festival released on Decca-London and Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz made in 1958 for EMI, as well as a 'live' set of Richard Strauss's Arabella (featuring Lisa della Casa and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau) made in 1963 for DG are still considered among the best versions.

He is a member of the Los Angeles City Council, representing the Fifth Council District. He was previously a member of the California State Assembly and the West Hollywood City Council. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Background Councilmember Koretz's father Erich escaped Nazi Germany in late 1939, emigrating first to Argentina and then settling in Los Angeles. He became a waiter and a dedicated member of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. Councilmember Koretz often joined his father on picket lines and in other efforts aimed at improving the life of working people. His mother, Doris, grew up in Everett, Massachusetts, during the Great Depression after her family fled the pogroms in Russia and emigrated to the U.S. It was the lessons learned from his parents' experiences that shaped Councilmember Koretz's philosophy on service and social justice. Born in the San Fernando Valley, Councilmember Koretz was raised and schooled in the 5th District, attending Canfield Elementary School, Palms Middle School, and graduating from Hamilton High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in History from UCLA in 1979, where he was a founder of the \\"Bruin Democrats\\". Koretz served on the Los Angeles County Democratic Committee for more than 10 years. While he was a student at UCLA during the 1970s, he was defeated for a seat on the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education. Koretz would go on to serve as an aide to then-Los Angeles City Councilmember Zev Yaroslavsky in 1975, and after that, to then-Los Angeles City Councilmember Marvin Braude in 1984. After his marriage to Gail, the Koretz family moved less than a mile away from his parents' home to an area where his father originally lived upon moving to Los Angeles. City of West Hollywood In 1984, Koretz supported the creation of the City of West Hollywood from what was then unincorporated Los Angeles County. Koretz campaigned for the City's incorporation while managing the City Council campaign of Alan Viterbi and served as Viterbi's deputy after his election. Upon Viterbi's retirement in 1988, Koretz was elected to the West Hollywood City Council. As Councilman, Koretz appointed Kevin Norte to the City's Rent Stabilization Commission in 1992, that commission's first openly gay chair for two one-year terms. Koretz also appointed former Log Cabin Republicans member and Equality California leader attorney John Duran to replace Norte as Koretz's appointee to the Rent Stabilization Commission. Duran would go on to succeed Koretz on the West Hollywood City Council. Also during his council tenure, Koretz played a major role on many high-profile issues. In 1988, Koretz sponsored a citywide ban on semi-automatic rifles, which built momentum for a subsequent statewide \\"assault weapons\\" ban. In 1996, Koretz co-sponsored the City's ban on \\"Saturday Night Specials.\\" The city was the first to enact such a ban, which survived various legal assaults by the National Rifle Association. Koretz also sponsored an ordinance limiting handgun purchases to one gun per month in order to cut the resale of guns on the black market. Koretz served as Mayor and City Councilman for twelve years before being elected to the State Assembly. Koretz's former colleague on the West Hollywood City Council, Abbe Land, was a candidate for Koretz's seat in the California State Assembly, and faced former Los Angeles City Council member Mike Feuer in the June 6, 2006 Democratic primary. Koretz endorsed Feuer, who defeated Land, winning 52.4% of the vote to her 36.3%. State Assembly Koretz represented the 42nd district in the California State Assembly from 2000 to 2006, serving the maximum 3 terms allowed under California term limit law. The district includes West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Universal City, and the portions of the City of Los Angeles encompassing the Sunset Strip, Hollywood, Hancock Park, Los Feliz, Westwood, Brentwood, Studio City, Encino, Sherman Oaks, and North Hollywood/Valley Village. During his six years in the Assembly, Koretz served as the Chair of the Assembly Labor Committee since his first year in the Assembly. He also chaired the Assembly Select Committee on Gun Violence and the Assembly Select Committee on California's nursing shortage. Koretz was also a member of the Health, Public Safety, Business & Professions, Insurance and Natural Resources committees. As a state Assemblymember, Koretz introduced legislation in the State Assembly to increase the smoking age to 21. As a City Councilman, Koretz had authored West Hollywood's ordinance banning smoking in restaurants, and developed the strategy of making it a regional ban by having neighboring cities pass the same ban at the same time. This provided momentum to help pass then-Assemblyman Friedman's historic AB 13. Koretz was the first Southern California Director of the California League of Conservation Voters and served as Administrative Director of the Ecology Center of Southern California. In the Assembly, he introduced legislation requiring retailers profiting from the most commonly littered items to share some of the costs of removing trash from storm water runoff, and he is the joint-author of legislation to ban the use of dry cleaner solutions, which have been found to be carcinogenic . Post-legislative service In November 2006, Koretz ran for the West Basin Water District, but narrowly lost the seat by a little more than 1% of the vote.LA County Registrar of Voters In June 2007, Koretz was nominated by Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez to the California Board of Podriatic Medicine.

Nightingale Island The Nightingale Islands are a group of three islands in the South Atlantic Ocean, part of the Tristan da Cunha territory. They consist of Nightingale Island, Middle Island and Stoltenhoff Island. The islands are administered by the United Kingdom as part of the overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. The Nightingale Islands are uninhabited. Nightingale Island is the smallest of the four main islands of the Tristan da Cunha Group, measuring only , and lies away from Tristan and from Inaccessible. Stoltenhoff and Alex (also known as Middle Island), are really two large islets rather than conventional islands. Geology Nightingale Island is the heavily eroded remnant of a volcano that was once much larger. The oldest potassium‚Äìargon dating from the island is 18 ¬± 4 Ma. The youngest volcanic activity on the island is indirectly dated to 39,160 uncalibrated years BP by radiocarbon dates on peat overlain by volcanic tuff. History Originally named \\"Gebrooken (Broken) island\\" by the Dutch under Jan Jacobszoon in January 1656, they found no safe anchorage and did not make the first landing until 1696 (most likely by Willem de Vlamingh in August of that year). Frenchman D'Etchevery also visited the island in September 1767. Nightingale was renamed after British captain Gamaliel Nightingale in 1760.Faustini, Arnaldo. \\"The Annals of Tristan da Cunha: The Early History of Tristan da Cunha.\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20061126204533/http://www.btinternet.com/~sa_sa/tristan_da_cunha/images/tristan_annals.pdf Jonathan Lambert temporarily changed the name to \\"Lovel Island\\" in his 1811 proclamation in the Boston Gazette but as with his other proposed changes (i.e. Tristan da Cunha Group to \\"Isles of Refreshment\\") the name did not last. Wildlife Nightingale, a tiny island, is home to more than three million pairs of seabirds at a density of around 1.3 pairs per square metre; almost the entire vegetated island is occupied. The Wilkins's Buntings are found nowhere else in the world. =Important Bird Area= The Nightingale Islands group has been recognised internationally as part of the Tristan da Cunha Endemic Bird Area (EBA). It has also been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International as a breeding site for seabirds and its endemic landbirds. Birds for which the IBA is significant include northern rockhopper penguins (up to 125,000 breeding pairs), sooty albatrosses (up to 250 pairs), Atlantic yellow-nosed albatrosses (5000 pairs), broad-billed prions (10,000 pairs), soft-plumaged petrels (up to 1000 pairs), great shearwaters (up to 3 million pairs), white-faced storm petrels (10,000 pairs), white-bellied storm petrels (1000 pairs), Antarctic terns (up to 400 pairs), southern skuas (up to 500 pairs), Tristan thrushes, Wilkins's buntings and Nightingale buntings. The nearby islands of a Gough and Inaccessible Island have been recognised as Wetlands of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention. =Aquatic biodiversity= The islanders of Tristan da Cunha depend on the fish resource to a large extent for food and for bait for the local rock lobster industry. Approximately 61.5 tons of linefish are harvested each year for these purposes. The insular nature of the island ecosystem renders it vulnerable to over-exploitation from commercial fishing operations. Most of the fish species are bound to the islands for the completion of their life cycles; hence, the populations are more or less isolated and not supplemented by recruits from outside of the system.

The river Crna flows across the whole area of Mariovo, creating the largest canyon in North Macedonia which is around 100 km long. The region is divided into three sub- regions, *Bitolsko Mariovo (with its center Staravina), *Prilepsko Mariovo (with its center Vitoli≈°te) and *Tikve≈°ko Mariovo (consisted of the western parts of the former municipality Konopi≈°te with the villages of Ro≈æden, Majdan, R≈æanovo and Klinovo) . Nowadays, administratively it is divided among three municipalities: *Prilep, *Novaci and *Kavadarci The river Crna also divides the region into two sub-regions, *Small Mariovo (Malo Mariovo) on the left side of the river, and *Old (Large) Mariovo (Staro Mariovo) on the right side of the river. The specific position and natural condition of this geomorphological entity have contributed towards creation of a distinct local climate which differs from the other parts of the country. The mountains Dren and shield Mariovo from the continental northern winds. On the south-east the basin of the river Crna enables Mediterranean influences from Aegean Sea, while in the area of Skoƒçivir Ravine the moderate continental clime makes its way from the Pelagonian plains. The influence of three climate zones can be felt in this area. More people lived there, but due to migration there are fewer than 1,000 inhabitants left in the 28 settlements: Vitoli≈°te, Be≈°i≈°te, Veprƒçani, Vrpsko, Dunje, ≈Ωivovo, Kalen, Kokre, Kru≈°evica, Manastir, Polƒçi≈°te, Pe≈°tani, ƒåani≈°te, Brnik, Budimirci, Grade≈°nica, Gruni≈°ta, Zoviƒç, Iveni, Makovo, Orle, Rape≈°, Staravina, R≈æanovo, Ro≈æden, Gali≈°te, Klinovo and Majden().  Staravina  The village Staravina was once the center of the municipality Staravina. It is located in the southern part of Mariovo, 50 km away from Bitola. The trip starts in Bitola. From there it goes to the village Novaci, past the power plant REK Bitola and then up the mountain to the village Makovo. From there the road leads to the village Rape≈°. The asphalt road ends after that village and from there it is a bumpy ride on a dirt road until Staravina. A permit is required to go there because the region is near the southern border of the country. There is a mountain hut located in Staravina, near the church. Its owner is PD Medikus from Bitola. To stay there is free, but donations can be left.()  Pe≈°ta  The site of Pe≈°ta dates from the 4th century BC and is located between villages of Staravina and Grade≈°nica. Standing in the center of Staravina, one can notice the outlines of a fortress on the horizon. There also used to be a town in the vicinity, which the villagers consider to be the birthplace of King Philip because historical dates claim that he descended from the mountains and built Pela. The closest mountain to the north-west of Pela is exactly this one in Mariovo().  Al≈°ar  Landscape near the village Vitoli≈°te in Mariovo Al≈°ar, an ancient mine located in the southern Balkans, in North Macedonia, is said to contain minerals that are found nowhere else on the planet. The rarest of them all‚Äîthe lorandite, a crystal of thallium. The lorandite is thought to have the potential to unravel the so-called \\"neutrino puzzle\\". By serving as a geochemical detector of the neuron, the lorandite could validate or disprove the theory of the standard solar system. In simple terms‚Äîit would let us understand the work of the Sun. The Ottomans, who ruled the peninsula until the beginning of the 20th century, called it Majdan (the word for \\"mine\\" in Turkish). This was also the name given to the nearest village. They explored for gold. But they were not the first ones at the mine. According to some, the mine has existed for over 5,000 years. It has eight entrances, two of which lead through corridors that extend up to 6 kilometers and have cobblestone pathways, placed there by the Ottomans. The mine has been closed for decades. According to experts, many world scientists are very interested in exploring Al≈°ar. The lorandite from the mine can register in a chemical and physical way the so-called neutrino flux coming from the Sun and it is the only known substance that has this power. If the neutrino could be explored, science could understand the processes that go on inside the Sun. Some say with awe that it could lead to an understanding of the past but also of the future of our galaxy. Despite all the mystery, the fact is undisputed that Al≈°ar is the only known place on the planet that contains the lorandite, a mineral of potentially huge significance in physics. According to rough estimates, the mine could have reserves of up to 40 tons of lorandite. A few grams of lorandite for lab research is said to cost about 5-6 euros. You can reach there from the village Konopi≈°te.  Monasteries  = Monastery St. George, Polog = This monastery is located in south-east North Macedonia, near Kavadarci, on the border between Mariovo and Tikve≈°. It can be reached only by boat across man-made Tikve≈° Lake. One can start this unique experience from three places: * by the dam near the village of Vozarci, * from the village of Resava near Kamen Dol and * from Kamenica near the village of Begni≈°te. It is now situated in an inaccessible area, but in the past the monastery rose high above the canyon of the river Crna, on the foothills of Vi≈°e≈°nica. Nowadays it is secluded by the lake and completely isolated. The church, as a lonely representative of its time, honorably watches over the invaluable medieval art from the time of Tsar Du≈°an. According to the latest research, the building of the monastery dates before 1340 AD, and the frescoes were painted in 1343-1345. During its existence the monastery had been abandoned on several occasions, but its activity never ceased completely. In the 16th century it had an active monastic brotherhood and was a powerful spiritual center. The large gold-plated wooden cross was carved in this period (1584). At the beginning of 19th century the lodgings on the eastern and on the southern side were built, the bell tower and several other buildings of practical character. Only the monastery church of St. George has survived within the walls of the monastery until today. Only fragments of the 17th century iconostasis, the icon of St. George depicting his life, the wood-carved chandelier (17th century) and three wood carved double doors (17th century) is all that has remained from the wealth of the religious object with great artistic value which once adorned the interior of the church. = The ƒåebren Monastery = To reach the monastery you first need to go to the village Zoviƒç which can be reached from Staravina or just by following the dirt road from Rape≈°. Then from Zoviƒç just head towards the river Crna and you will reach the monastery. The ƒåebren Monastery with the Church of St. Demetrios (Sv. Dimitrija), together with the small church of Holy Saviour (Sv. Spas) located nearby, are centres of exceptional spiritual and archeological value. The Monastery belongs to the village of Zoviƒç and is situated on the eastern bank of river Crna. The church of St. Demetrios is a three-naval basilica with marble columns. Its iconostasis dates from the 15th century, but was renovated in the 19th century. Southeast from the monastery, on the hill which rises over the river is the small church of the Holy Saviour, probably built in the 14th century. It is a single-naval stone church with wooden roof structure covered with stone tiles (preserved only on the apse and eastern wall). The interior is completely fresco-painted and a great deal of the frescos can still be seen. = Grade≈°nica and church of St. Demetrios (Sv. Dimitrija) = The villag–µ of Grade≈°nica is located down the slope toward the Gradeska River and its canyon. The church of St. Demetrios, a cultural monument from the 15th century, is located in this village, situated by the road at the very entrance. This church is sometimes mentioned as the church of St. Nicholas, but also known as St. Demetrios among the local population. It is a small, single-nave church covered with a semi-cylindrical vault. The massive stone iconostasis separates the space towards the altar apse. The preserved frescoes on the central part (naos) and on the iconostasis differ from those in the altar apse. According to their style, they belong to the 14th century, while those in the altar apse indicate the style of the 15th century. Visitors can reach Grade≈°nica from Staravina; there is an asphalt road leading there.

Under British rule, the island was known as Ceylon from 1815 to 1972. Lanka The word Lanka simply means any island. It is still widely used by the aborigines of Central and Eastern India to mean an island and especially an islet in a river. The word is considered as belonging to Austro- asiatic languages. The Veddas, the aborigines of Sri Lanka who are Austro- Asiatic in origin, might have rendered the name Lanka to the island. As it is the biggest island in the South Asian context, Lanka probably became an exclusive term for it. Lak-vaesiyaa in Sinhala means an inhabitant of the island of Lanka. Lak-diva in E'lu (old Sinhala) means the island of Lanka. Another traditional Sinhala name for Sri Lanka was Lakdiva, with diva also meaning \\"island\\". A further traditional name is Lakbima. Lak in both cases is derived again from Lanka. The same name could have been adopted in Tamil as Ilankai; the Tamil language commonly adds \\"i\\" before initial \\"l\\".The Sanskrit epic Ramayana mentioned it Lanka and the abode of King Ravan. The name of Sri Lanka was introduced in the context of the Sri Lankan independence movement, pushing for the independence of British Ceylon during the first half of the 20th century. The name was used by the Marxist Lanka Sama Samaja Party, which was founded in 1935. The Sanskrit honorific Sri was introduced in the name of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (Sinhalese: ‡∑Å‡∑ä‚Äç‡∂ª‡∑ì ‡∂Ω‡∂Ç‡∂ö‡∑è ‡∂±‡∑í‡∂Ø‡∑Ñ‡∑É‡∑ä ‡∂¥‡∂ö‡∑ä‡∑Ç‡∂∫ Sri Lanka Nidahas Pakshaya), founded in 1952. The Republic of Sri Lanka was officially adopted as the country's name with the new constitution of 1972,Articles 1 and 2 of the 1972 constitution: \\"1. Sri Lanka (Ceylon) is a Free, Sovereign and Independent Republic. 2\\\\. The Republic of Sri Lanka is a Unitary State.\\" and changed to \\"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\\" in the constitution of 1978. Ceylon, Serendip and related names The name Ceylon has a complicated history going back to antiquity. Theory states that the name comes from Sielen as the island was known by the Romans as Serendivis and by Arabs as Serandib and the Persians as Serendip; the from which serendipity is derived while Greeks called the island Sielen Diva or Sieldiba. The name is said to be based on the word Sinhaladvipa which is also used in the Culavamsa as a name for the Island. From the word Sielen, many European forms were derived: Latin Seelan, Portuguese Ceil√£o, Spanish Ceil√°n, French Seilan, Ceylan, Dutch Zeilan, Ceilan and Seylon, and of course the English Ceylon. Ptolemy called the Island Salike, and the inhabitants Salai. Another theory is that the name derives from the Tamil words cheran for the Tamil dynasty of the Chera and the words theevu which means \\"island\\" in Tamil. Sri Lanka has also been known as Helabima, meaning \\"Land of Helas\\", which is a name that Sinhalese were called. Si·πÉhala is attested as a Sanskrit name of the island of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in the Bhagavata Purana and Rajatarangini. The name is sometimes glossed as \\"abode of lions\\", and attributed to a supposed former abundance of lions on the island. Eelam The Tamil name is Eelam (, ƒ´·∏ªam; also spelled Eezham, Ilam or Izham). The etymology of the name is uncertain. The most favoured explanation derives it from a word for the spurge (palm tree), via the application to a caste of toddy-drawers, i.e. workers drawing the sap from palm trees for the production of palm wine. The name of the palm tree may conversely be derived from the name of the caste of toddy drawers, known as Eelavar, cognate with the name of Kerala, from the name of the Chera dynasty, via Cheralam, Chera, Sera and Kera.M. Ramachandran, IrƒÅmanÃ≤ MativƒÅ·πáanÃ≤ (1991). The spring of the Indus civilisation. Prasanna Pathippagam, pp. 34. \\"Srilanka was known as \\"Cerantivu' (island of the Cera kings) in those days. The seal has two lines. The line above contains three signs in Indus script and the line below contains three alphabets in the ancient Tamil script known as Tamil ... The stem Eela is found in Prakrit inscriptions dated to 2nd century BC in Sri Lanka in personal names such as Eela-Barata and Eela-Naga. The meaning of Eela in these inscriptions is unknown although one could deduce that they are either from Eela a geographic location or were an ethnic group known as Eela.p. 313 From the 19th century onwards, sources appeared in South India regarding a legendary origin for caste of toddy drawers known as Eelavar in the state of Kerala. These legends stated that Eelavar were originally from Eelam. There have also been proposals of deriving Eelam from Simhala. Robert Caldwell (1875), following Hermann Gundert, cited the word as an example of the omission of initial sibilants in the adoption of Indo-Aryan words into Dravidian languages., pt. 2 p. 86. The University of Madras Tamil Lexicon, compiled between 1924 and 1936, follows this view. Peter Schalk (2004) has argued against this, showing that the application of Eelam in an ethnic sense arises only in the early modern period, and was limited to the caste of \\"toddy drawers\\" until the medieval period.. Taprobana, Tamraparni Tamraparni is according to some legends the name given by Prince Vijaya when he arrived on the island. The word can be translated as \\"copper-coloured leaf\\", from the words Thamiram (copper in Sanskrit) and Varni (colour). Another scholar states that Tamara means red and parani means tree, therefore it could mean \\"tree with red leaves\\". Tamraparni is also a name of Tirunelveli, the capital of the Pandyan kingdom in Tamil Nadu. The name was adopted in Pali as Tambaparni. The name was adopted into Greek as Taprobana, called by Megasthenes in the 4th century BC. The Greek name was adopted in medieval Irish (Lebor Gabala Erenn) as Deprofane (Recension 2) and Tibra Faine (Recension 3), off the coast of India, supposedly one of the countries where the Milesians / Gaedel, ancestors of today's Irish, had sojourned in their previous migrations.Lebor Gabala Erenn Vol. II (Macalister translation)In the early 1800s, Welsh pseudohistorian Iolo Morganwg published what he claimed was mediaeval Welsh epic material, describing how Hu Gadarn had led the ancestors of the Welsh in a migration to Britain from Taprobane or \\"Deffrobani\\", aka \\"Summerland\\", said in his text to be situated \\"where Constantinople now is.\\" However, this work is now considered to have been a forgery produced by Iolo Morganwg himself. The name remained in use in early modern Europe, alongside the Persianate Serendip, with Traprobana mentioned in the first strophe of the Portuguese national epic poem Os Lus√≠adas by Lu√≠s de Cam√µes. John Milton borrowed this for his epic poem Paradise Lost and Miguel de Cervantes mentions a fantastic Trapobana in Don Quixote.Don Quixote, Volume I, Chapter 18: the mighty emperor Alifanfaron, lord of the great isle of Trapobana.

Biography Reed was born in 1916 in Fort Ward, Washington. Following a stint as a Broadway actor, Reed broke into films in 1941. He appeared in several features for RKO Radio Pictures, including the last two Mexican Spitfire comedies (in which Reed replaced Buddy Rogers as the Spitfire's husband). Perhaps his most memorable role was as the spineless wagon driver husband of Gail Russell in the western Seven Men from Now. Reed also appeared in the very first Superman theatrical feature film Superman and the Mole Men in 1951. In 1951 Reed made two film serials for Republic Pictures; Reed strongly resembled former Republic leading man Ralph Byrd, enabling Republic to insert old action scenes of Byrd into the new Reed footage. Republic wanted to sign Reed for additional serials but Reed declined, preferring not to be typed as a serial star. After appearing in 90 films and numerous television programs, such as John Payne's The Restless Gun, Reed changed careers and became a real estate investor and broker in Santa Cruz, California in the late 1960s.

History Formed in 1992 by producers Dallas Austin and L.A. Reid, Rowdy was initially distributed through Arista Records. At the time, Austin had gained notoriety for writing and producing hits for acts like Monica, Another Bad Creation, Boyz II Men, Joi, For Real, Da King & I and TLC. Reid, meanwhile, was also running the fledgling LaFace Records. In 1993, Reid stepped down to continue focusing his energies on LaFace, leaving Dallas to run the Atlanta-based company on his own. Rowdy shot to success in 1995 with the release of the triple platinum debut album from fourteen-year-old R&B; singer Monica entitled Miss Thang. Other acts on the label included: Y'all So Stupid, Illegal, For Real, Fishbone and Caron Wheeler. The label also released the soundtrack to the motion-picture Fled. In spite of the label's strong buzz in the industry (mainly due to Austin's name being attached to it), by 1997 Rowdy began to flounder, as Monica's debut album had been its biggest release to date‚Äîand arguably the company's only success. Creative differences with Arista subsequently caused Rowdy to vacate its fold, while Monica (its most notable star) remained at Arista. Without a major distributor, Rowdy briefly went the independent route before stalling completely. Austin's career, meanwhile, continued to thrive as he remained a highly sought after producer, which led to him stepping down as CEO. In 1998, Rowdy closed its doors. He then started the short-lived record label Freeworld Entertainment after the dissolution of Rowdy. In 2005, when a fledgling Decatur, Georgia based hip-hop group called Da BackWudz caught Austin's attention, he decided to reactivate Rowdy (after seven years of dormancy) in order to sign them.

This species is believed to be the ancestor of the domestic donkey, which is usually placed within the same species. They live in the deserts and other arid areas of the Horn of Africa, in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia. It formerly had a wider range north and west into Sudan, Egypt, and Libya. About 570 individuals exist in the wild. Description Close-up of head, Denver Zoo, Colorado Close-up of hindlegs The African wild ass is long and (12 to 14 hands) tall at the shoulders, with a tail long. It weighs between . The short, smooth coat is a light grey to fawn colour, fading quickly to white on the undersides and legs. There is a slender, dark dorsal stripe in all subspecies, while in the Nubian wild ass (E. a. africanus), as well as the domestic donkey, there is a stripe across the shoulder. The legs of the Somali wild ass (E. a. somaliensis) are horizontally striped with black, resembling those of a zebra. On the nape of the neck, there is a stiff, upright mane, the hairs of which are tipped with black. The ears are large with black margins. The tail terminates with a black brush. The hooves are slender and approximately of the diameter as the legs. Evolution Skull of a giant extinct horse, Equus eisenmannae The genus Equus, which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from Dinohippus, via the intermediate form Plesippus. One of the oldest species is Equus simplicidens, described as zebra-like with a donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is ~3.5 million years old from Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged Equus livenzovensis documented from western Europe and Russia. Molecular phylogenies indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus Equus) lived ~5.6 (3.9‚Äì7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP. The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus E. (Asinus), including the kulan, onager, and kiang), followed by the African zebras (subgenera E. (Dolichohippus), and E. (Hippotigris)). All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil Pliocene and Pleistocene forms) belong to the subgenus E. (Equus) which diverged ~4.8 (3.2‚Äì6.5) million years ago. Taxonomy Different authors consider the African wild ass and the domesticated donkey one or two species; either view is technically legitimate, though the former is phylogenetically more accurate. The species name for the African wild ass is sometimes given as asinus, from the domestic donkey, whose specific name is older and usually would have priority. But this usage is erroneous since the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature has conserved the name Equus africanus in Opinion 2027. This was done to prevent the confusing situation of the phylogenetic ancestor being taxonomically included in its descendant. Thus, if one species is recognized, the correct scientific name of the donkey is E. africanus asinus. The first published name for the African wild ass, Asinus africanus, Fitzinger, 1858, is a nomen nudum. The name Equus taeniopus von Heuglin, 1861 Heuglin Th. v (1861). \\"Th. v.

Habitat African wild asses are well suited to life in a desert or semidesert environment. They have tough digestive systems, which can break down desert vegetation and extract moisture from food efficiently. They can also go without water for a fairly long time. Their large ears give them an excellent sense of hearing and help in cooling. Because of the sparse vegetation in their environment wild asses live somewhat separated from each other (except for mothers and young), unlike the tightly grouped herds of wild horses. They have very loud voices, which can be heard for over , which helps them to keep in contact with other asses over the wide spaces of the desert. Behavior The African wild ass is primarily active in the cooler hours between late afternoon and early morning, seeking shade and shelter amongst the rocky hills during the day. The Somali wild ass is also very agile and nimble-footed, capable of moving quickly across boulder fields and in the mountains. On the flat, it has been recorded reaching speeds of . In keeping with these feats, its soles are particularly hard and its hooves grow very quickly. Mature males defend large territories around 23 square kilometres in size, marking them with dung heaps ‚Äì an essential marker in the flat, monotonous terrain. Due to the size of these ranges, the dominant male cannot exclude other males. Rather, intruders are tolerated ‚Äì recognized and treated as subordinates, and kept as far away as possible from any of the resident females. In the presence of estrous females, the males bray loudly. These animals live in loose herds of up to fifty individuals. Foal of Somali wild ass (E. a. somalicus) Somali wild ass mother and foal In the wild, breeding of African wild ass occurs in wet season. Gestation period lasts for 11 to 12 months, given birth one foal from October to February. The foal weans for 6 to 8-month after birth, reaching sexual maturity 2 years after birth. Lifespan is up to 40 years in captivity. Wild asses can run swiftly, almost as fast as a horse. However, unlike most hoofed mammals, their tendency is to not flee right away from a potentially dangerous situation, but to investigate first before deciding what to do. When they need to, they can defend themselves with kicks from both their front and hind legs. Equids were used in ancient Sumer to pull wagons circa 2600 BC, and then chariots on the Standard of Ur, circa 2000 BC. These have been suggested to represent onagers, but are now thought to have been domestic asses. Diet Somali wild ass eating hay, at the Hanover Zoo, Hanover, Germany The African wild asses' diet consists of grasses, bark, and leaves. Despite being primarily adapted for living in an arid climate, they are dependent on water, and when not receiving the needed moisture from vegetation, they must drink at least once every three days. However, they can survive on a surprisingly small amount of liquid, and have been reported to drink salty or brackish water. Conservation status Somali wild ass at Zoo Basel Though the species itself is under no threat of extinction, due to abundant domestic stock (donkey and burros), the two extant wild subspecies are both listed as critically endangered. African wild asses have been captured for domestication for centuries, and this, along with interbreeding between wild and domestic animals, has caused a distinct decline in population numbers. There are now only a few hundred individuals left in the wild. These animals are also hunted for food and for traditional medicine in both Ethiopia and Somalia. Competition with domestic livestock for grazing, and restricted access to water supplies caused by agricultural developments, pose further threats to the survival of this species. The African wild ass is legally protected in the countries where it is currently found, although these measures often prove difficult to enforce. A protected population of the Somali wild ass exists in the Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve in Israel, to the north of Eilat. This reserve was established in 1968 with the view to bolster populations of endangered desert species. Populations of horses and asses are fairly resilient and, if the species is properly protected, it may well recover from its current low. In captivity There are about 150 individual Somali wild asses living in zoos around the globe, of which 36 were born at Zoo Basel, where this species' breeding program started with Basel's first Somali wild asses in 1970 and the first birth in 1972.

The only other major junction along the route is with Loop 202, which is located one half-mile south of McDowell Road and the northern terminus. The road lies directly to the east of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Along with the Sky Harbor Expressway (former SR 153), SR 143's primary purpose is to provide East Valley residents with access to Sky Harbor from westbound Interstate 10 and US 60. This removes the need to travel longer on frequently congested I-10 and avoid the junction with Interstate 17's southern terminus. Route description The Hohokam Expressway begins at an intersection with McDowell Road in Phoenix. The freeway continues southward to an ornately designed junction with the Red Mountain portion of Loop 202. Commuters are then allotted access to Sky Harbor International Airport prior to the Salt River crossing. The southern half of SR 143 begins with the original interchange with University Drive, and then one with Interstate 10 and US 60. After these two interchanges, the freeway ends by transitioning into 48th Street, a surface street. History Arizona State Route 143 (SR 143) - November 16, 2016 The Hohokam Expressway has a long history and gestation period. The road was first planned in 1957 as SR 143 as part of the 1960 Phoenix Freeway plan as a collector road for traffic from the east side of Phoenix, as well as a proposed eastern exit from Sky Harbor Airport. The present-day interchange with Interstate 10 was completed in 1967 as part of the original I-10 freeway construction through the southeast sections of the valley such as the Tempe and Chandler suburbs. The final design was released in 1974, when SR 143 was not yet a freeway, but a parkway with traffic signals and intersections. The design portrayed the new parkway leaving Interstate 10 north along 48th Street corridor, then angling across the Salt River to reach 44th Street where it was planned to end at Washington St. When it opened in 1978, it included the vital eastern access to Sky Harbor Airport, replacing the old 40th Street entrance that was eliminated when 40th Street was demolished to make way for a new airport terminal and runway expansions. The new parkway rapidly earned a reputation as a constantly congested road, despite having only three traffic signals. As an attempt at decreasing congestion, a grade-separated interchange at University Drive was built in 1985. The bridge was built to handle two lanes of traffic in each direction though without a shoulder or emergency lane. (This has been identified as a reason of the traffic backups still seen today, as the rest of the freeway is now built to three lanes on either side, thus creating a bottleneck at the University Drive overpass.) In 1985, the route was surveyed as part of the new Maricopa Association of Governments 1985 Freeway Plan, and was added to the system with a reroute and upgrade to freeway status. Business Loop I-10 was renamed to SR 143 and was realigned to meet up with the under-construction Loop 202 at 48th Street, as opposed to the old 44th Street alignment. =Construction timeline= * February 1991: University Drive to Sky Harbor Boulevard * November 1991: Sky Harbor Boulevard to Washington Street * February 1992: Washington Street to McDowell Road * January 2011: Major interchange improvements at Loop 202 Safety concerns Southern terminus of SR 143.At the southern terminus of the freeway, SR 143 begins at the intersection of 48th Street and Broadway, climbing over Interstate 10 on the original 48th Street bridge built without any shoulder lanes in 1967. Traffic heading southbound at this point is warned of a traffic signal that hides over the optical horizon of the overpass to most traffic. To combat safety issues raised by the lack of visibility of the main traffic signals, a second traffic signal was installed at a higher elevation so that it is visible to traffic on the northern approach of the overpass. At one point, the second signal included a high-intensity strobe embedded in the red signal; however, the strobe has since been removed. In addition to the strobing signal light, rumble strips have been cut into the bridge deck at several intervals, and there is a sign that turns on if the signal is red and the speed limit is reduced, further alerting traffic that the freeway is ending. Part of the bridge deck is shared with an exit-only lane leading to a cloverleaf ramp to Interstate 10/US 60 Eastbound to Tucson, which has a ramp speed limit of only to access the freeway. Traffic is frequently backed up to University Drive from this exit, and has raised additional safety concerns of the intersection and highway junction. Also, the Broadway Road intersection is less than one quarter mile south of I-10. Traffic is currently backing up from that intersection to I-10, causing further delays and potential accidents due to the visibility and design of the bridge over I-10. ADOT is currently studying the redesign of the southern section of SR 143, including the infamous bridge, to the Sky Harbor Airport exit in an attempt to fix the numerous safety issues with the addition of collector-distributor lanes when the freeway is widened in the near future. C/D lanes are also known to split a freeway into \\"local\\" and \\"express\\" lanes. Because SR 143 connects the Red Mountain Freeway (Loop 202) to Interstate 10, this route is popular with local commuters seeking to bypass a stretch of Interstate 10 and US 60 between the Mini Stack and the Broadway Curve, adding to additional traffic overload and safety issues at the interchange with SR 143/I-10/US 60. The speed limit on I-10 throughout the city of Phoenix is currently . Many other area freeways have limits of , notable exceptions being the Sky Harbor Expressway with , Arizona 51 south of Glendale Rd with 55 mph, and Interstate 17 with .

It was formerly part of the Fairfax Media and Village Roadshow networks. History 96FM began broadcasting on 96.1 MHz on 8 August 1980 as Perth's first commercial FM radio station. The first record played at the 4 pm launch was FM (No Static at All) by Steely Dan, with Gordon O'Byrne the first live disc jockey to air. Gary Roberts was its first Program Director. Throughout the 1980s, 96FM provided groundbreaking innovation for Perth radio listeners. In 1981, the highly successful Gold Pass was launched. This provided holders access to obtain discounts at retailers for goods such as CDs, clothing, concert tickets, car audio and security to name but a few. The rationale for launching the Gold Pass was so the station could raise extra revenue (minimum was a $5,000 spend) without doing outside broadcasts. In 1982, 96FM became the first radio station in Australia to play music from CD. The song was Toto's Rosanna. From then on the station's old library of vinyl records and carts was replaced with CDs. Amongst some of the most successful radio promotions in the stations history include 'Rockwords' where listeners could win $10,000 cash for correctly completing a cross-word in The West Australian newspaper. The station broadcast the clues on an hourly basis. Another hallmark promotion was the 'Top 96 Albums of alltime' and what was then the annual Skyshow. By 1985, 96FM had reached number one in the Perth radio ratings for the first time although 6PM on the AM band continued to be a strong number two for the remainder of the decade until 6PM converted to FM in 1991 as 92.9 6PMFM, then PMFM and now 92.9. 96FM was the sole commercial FM station in Perth until 1991. 6PM and 6KY successfully bid for the right to convert from the AM band to FM in the early 1990s. In 1993, Village Roadshow, owners of the Triple M network in the eastern states, took over the financially stricken FM Australia (formerly Hoyts Media). No more than six months later 96FM was relaunched as a Triple M, albeit with the Today Network Top 40 (CHR) music format, as opposed to the harder rock format of its eastern Triple M counterparts. The revamped station failed to make a major impact up against its FM rivals. In 1996 as Triple M, with flagging ratings and finances the station dropped organising the annual Skyshow. The event was subsequently handed over to both the State Government and the City of Perth. Due to copyright ownership restrictions associated with the name the event has been rebranded 'Skyworks'. The format of the event was not significantly changed. In 1997, Village Roadshow subsidiary Austereo purchased PMFM and KYFM from local entrepreneur Jack Bendat. Australian media ownership laws required the divestiture of the station, and Village Roadshow subsequently sold it to Southern Cross Broadcasting which also owned AM radio station 6PR. Southern Cross returned the station back to its original 96FM branding, with a new logo. In 2007 96FM was part of the acquisition of Southern Cross Broadcasting by Fairfax Media.Southern Cross Broadcasting Announcement of takeover by Macquarie Media In 2012 a new logo was sighted on the websites with a new positioner \\"Keep Real Music Alive\\". In June 2012, 96FM went No. 1 All People for the first time since 1992. In December 2014, it was announced that Fairfax Media would merge with the Macquarie Radio Network, and sell 96FM to the Australian Radio Network. The sale was completed on 30 January 2015 with the station becoming part of the KIIS Network. In September 2015, 96FM rebranded with a new logo aligning it with the rest of the KIIS Network. Transmission 96FM transmits on 96.1 MHz across Perth and surrounding areas. It currently transmits on the Perth Radio Services tower adjacent to the Channel 7 tower in Television Road, Bickley. Its ERP is 40KW omnidirectional, which is the standard of the commercial FM stations in Perth. As well as covering Perth, 96FM can be heard as far north as New Norcia, south to Waroona and east to Northam. The studio is located at 169 Hay Street, Perth. From 1980 until 1983 the station was based in Terrace Road, East Perth moving to 111 Wellington Street, Perth until 1988. Originally when the station first went to air in 1980 the transmitter facilities were shared with the STW9 tower. However the advent of mobile phone networks, problems associated with site crowding plus the impending launch of 6PM and 6KY onto FM led to the establishment of the Perth FM radio group site. The program is fed over a microwave link from East Perth to Bickley. Each of the FM stations on the site has an STL collection dish. The feed is picked up, decoded, and then fed into an exciter. At this point the 19 kHz sub audio pilot tone is injected. This enables FM receivers to show the 'FM Stereo' light as 'on'. Then after leaving the rack in the hut, the signal is fed into a combiner. In this way the transmission facilities are shared at the tower and the antenna array. As a standby measure the stations can feed programs over a 128k/bit ISDN link using a broadcast codec. However data charges on ISDN make this uneconomic to do full-time. 96FM is also available on DAB+ Digital Radio in Perth.

He is best known for his association with George Harrison, who produced Lomax's recordings for the Beatles' Apple record label in the late 1960s. John Richard Lomax was born in 1944 in Wallasey, Cheshire. He was a member of Dee and the Dynamites, The Undertakers, The Lomax Alliance, Heavy Jelly and Badger. He worked with The Tea Bags, George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Leon Russell and Nicky Hopkins. Career =1962‚Äì1970= In January 1962, Jackie Lomax left Dee and the Dynamites to join the Merseybeat band The Undertakers. They followed The Beatles' route through local venues before setting out for Hamburg, Germany, and securing a recording contract. They signed with Pye Records and released four singles, but they only managed one week on the UK Singles Chart with \\"Just a Little Bit\\" (#49 in 1964). In 1965 they decided to try their luck in the United States. Lomax spent two years in the US with The Undertakers and a couple of other groups. In 1967, Brian Epstein took his latest line-up, The Lomax Alliance, back to the UK to showcase them at London's Saville Theatre. He arranged for a single and an album to be recorded, and they signed to CBS before Epstein's death. During that period, CBS released two Lomax Alliance singles and one Jackie Lomax solo single. More than enough tracks for an album were recorded but it was never released. After Epstein's death, The Beatles' new record label, Apple Records, took over responsibility for Lomax's recording career, and George Harrison became involved in production. Despite having three-quarters of The Beatles on the record, plus Eric Clapton and Nicky Hopkins, Lomax's 1968 debut single on Apple, the Harrison-penned \\"Sour Milk Sea\\", backed with \\"The Eagle Laughs at You\\" written by Lomax, made little commercial impression. Lomax and Harrison recorded the remainder of the Is This What You Want? album in Los Angeles, with Hal Blaine and other members of the Wrecking Crew; but as with the concurrent single, the Lomax-produced \\"New Day\\", success remained elusive when the album was released in early 1969. A final Apple single followed, a cover version of \\"How the Web Was Woven\\" featuring Leon Russell. By 1970, The Beatles' breakup left the remaining Apple Records artists in limbo. =1970‚Äì1977= After leaving Apple, Lomax joined a band called Heavy Jelly. The band began as a hoax review in Time Out magazine. Guitarist John Morshead from The Aynsley Dunbar Retaliation and three ringers had posed for the \\"group's\\" photo in the magazine, so to cash in on the buzz Morshead and drummer Carlo Little released a single on promoter John Curd's Head Records (\\"Chewn In\\"/\\"Time Out\\", Head HDS4001, 1969). They were beaten to the punch however by the group Skip Bifferty who released their own single as Heavy Jelly, \\"I Keep Singing That Same Old Song\\" b/w \\"Blue\\", on Island Records. The A-Side became fairly well-known at the time from its inclusion on the Island sampler \\"Nice Enough To Eat.\\" Curd owned the rights to the name however, and stopped Island from releasing any other Heavy Jelly productions. Guitarist Morshead, along with his former Aynsley Dunbar mate bassist Alex Dmochowski, formed another version of Heavy Jelly with Jackie Lomax. Mike Kellie from Spooky Tooth drummed on some sessions but was later replaced by Barry Jenkins, formerly of The Animals. Also helping out were the tragic Badfinger duo of Pete Ham and Tom Evans on backing vocals and \\"horn section to the stars\\" Bobby Keys and Jim Price. The self-titled Heavy Jelly album was recorded, entirely consisting of Lomax songs, but was only issued for promotional purposes and never released commercially due to contractual issues with Apple. After the album was finished, the band began touring but was bedeviled by line-up changes. Drummer Dave Rowland and bassist Steve Thompson were with the group at one point. After a few months the band disintegrated.\\"The Strange Tale Of Heavy Jelly's Four Flavors\\" by John H. McCarthy (In December 2013, it was announced that after Lomax's untimely death his family resolved all issues with Apple amicably and the album was re-leased on Angel Air Records on 10 March 2014.) Confusing matters further, another Heavy Jelly, produced by Simon Napier-Bell, released their only single in the U.S. and France on Avco Embassy, \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" b/w \\"Throw Down A Line\\", in a nice picture sleeve. This may have been a studio group since both sides were written by producer Napier-Bell and vocalist and sometime partner Ray Singer. In 1971, Lomax returned to the USA to live and work in Woodstock, New York. He signed to Warner Bros. Records and reunited with members of the Lomax Alliance and The Undertakers. They returned to the recording studio but their albums, Home is in My Head and Three, failed to sell. Disappointed with his lack of success, Lomax returned to the UK at the end of 1973. He joined Badger, a progressive rock band originally formed by ex-Yes keyboard player Tony Kaye, and turned them into a R&B; and soul band he had used on his solo albums. The band became a vehicle for Lomax's songs and singing but was short-lived, releasing only one album, the Allen Toussaint-produced White Lady, on Epic Records. Lomax crossed the Atlantic again to resume his solo career and Capitol Records signed him in 1975. He released two Capitol albums, Livin' for Lovin' and Did You Ever Have That Feeling?, before leaving the label in 1977. The latter set was only released in the UK. =1978‚Äì2000= The 1980s were a quiet time in Lomax's career. In the mid-1980s he played guitar and sang background vocals on demos for various artists, produced by his friend Patrick Landreville. He briefly played with The Tea Bags, a Los Angeles-based group which included Ian Wallace, Kim Gardner, Mick Taylor, Brian Auger, Terry Reid, Peter Banks, Graham Bell and David Mansfield amongst others. In the 1990s, he spent time playing with other British artists on America's West Coast, and he toured as the bassist for The Drifters, The Diamonds, and The Coasters. In California, particularly Ventura County, Lomax played live with a succession of line-ups including Tom Petty, drummer Randall Marsh, Jim Calire, Patrick Landreville and Mitch Kashmar. In 1990, Lomax recorded the Tim Buckley song, \\"Devil Eyes\\" for the True Voices album. Others appearing on the album included Gene Clark, John Stewart, P. F. Sloan and Lucinda Williams. =2001‚Äì2013 and after= In 2001, Lomax completed the recording of his first solo album since 1977, The Ballad of Liverpool Slim. 2002 saw him continuing to play on the West Coast of America. In 2003, he made a return to The Cavern in Liverpool, where his career began more than 40 years earlier. In 2004, Lomax was a guest on the 'BeatlesandBeyond' Radio Show in Walsall, hosted by Pete Dicks. Dicks later wrote the sleeve notes for, and organised, the UK release of Lomax's The Ballad of Liverpool Slim...and Others album. Lomax would return to Liverpool on several occasions, playing in the Liverpool pub in James Street. Percy Sledge included Lomax's song, \\"Fall Inside Your Eyes\\", on his 2004 album Shining Through The Rain. During his last few years, Lomax was a regular visitor to Parrjazz at Studio 2, Liverpool, where his music was always warmly appreciated by an enthusiastic audience. On 13 April 2012, Lomax played on the 50th Anniversary of the Hamburg-based Star-Club in the Kaiserkeller, with the Star Club All-Star-Band plus Brian Griffiths (Big Three), Bobby Thompson (Dominoes), and Joe Fagin (Strangers), and also with The Undertakers. During his last years, Lomax resided in Ojai, California, United States, with his wife, Annie (previously Norma Richardson), mother of fashion photographer Terry Richardson. On 15 September 2013, Jackie Lomax died after a short illness, on the Wirral while staying in England for the wedding of his daughter. In 2019, one of his songs, New Day from the album Is This What You Want?, was used for a cricket commercial for UK sports channel Sky Sports. It featured a reworked version by Irish female singer Lyra. Her version was also used in a commercial for Dutch bike company VanMoof in the summer of 2020, after which it was released as a single.Officialcharts.com, 4 September 2020New Day by Lyra on YouTube Recordings * The Undertakers Unearthed 1963‚Äì65 * The Lomax Alliance and CBS Recordings 1966‚Äì1967 * Is This What You Want? 1969 No. 145 US * Heavy Jelly 1970 * Home Is in My Head 1971 - AUS #34 * Three 1972 * Livin' For Lovin' 1976 * Did You Ever Have That Feeling? 1977 * True Voices (Various Artists) 1991 * The Ballad of Liverpool Slim 2001 & 2004 * The Ballad of Liverpool Slim...and Others (Angel Air Records) * Against All Odds (Angel Air Records) 2014 Badger  * White Lady ‚Äì With Tony Kaye, ex- Yes References External links *Official site * *Jackie Lomax at artistdirect.com *Los Angeles Times Obituary Category:1944 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Apple Records artists Category:Capitol Records artists Category:People from Wallasey Category:English male singers Category:English rhythm and blues singers Category:English soul singers Category:English rock singers Category:English singer-songwriters Category:Badger (band) members ","title":"Jackie Lomax"},{"id":"3696102","text":"Equus lambei (common names include Yukon horse, and Yukon wild horse) is an extinct species of the genus Equus. Equus lambei ranged across North America until approximately 10,000 years ago. Based on recent examinations of the mtDNA of Equus lambei remains, scientists have concluded that E. lambei was probably much like the extinct Tarpan, also known as the Eurasian wild horse, and the living Przewalski's Horse.[6][8] A partial carcass of Equus lambei is on display at the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre in Whitehorse, Yukon. Description Evidence from E. lambei mtDNA has shown that Equus lambei is a close relative of the modern wild horse, including the domestic horse, Equus caballus. Controversy still surrounds E. lambei and the divergence of other similar extinct horse species. Through examinations of the bones and teeth of Equus lambei, many similarities can be seen with the modern horse Equus caballus. There is also a strong resemblance to E. lambei in the metapodials of E. caballus przewalskii and the phalanges of E. caballus lenensis. Metrical and morphological studies of horse teeth from the Bluefish Caves confirm the close similarity between Equus lambei with wild and domestic horses alive today. E. lambei is a caballus horse, not an ass. Among living horses, the Yukon horse most closely resembles the Przewalski's horse (Equus caballus przewalskii) from Mongolia (now believed to be extinct in the wild) particularly in size and proportions. However, the upper foot bones (metapodials) of Equus lambei are slender compared to Przewalski's horse. The bones of E. lambei also closely resemble the proximal phalanges of E. caballus lenensis, an extinct subspecies from the late Pleistocene of Siberia. Natural history Along with steppe bison (Bison priscus), woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus), Equus lambei was one of the most common ice-age species known to occupy the steppe-like grasslands of Eastern Beringia. E. lambei can be identified by numerous teeth and bones, and one partial carcass discovered in 1993. This E. lambei carcass yielded a radiocarbon date of 26,280 ¬± 210 years BP. The carcass consisted of a large part of the hide, a few tailbones, one lower leg, and some intestine. The hide retained some long blondish mane and tail hairs, coarse whitish upper body hairs, and dark brown hairs on the lower leg. Large numbers of E. lambei teeth have been found in archaeological sites in the Yukon. Based on the fossil records discovered in the Yukon, Equus lambei is believed to have been a small, slender, caballoid horse (about tall), with a broad skull and a relatively long protocones. In August 2018, a 40,000 year-old foal was discovered in the Batagaika crater, Yakutia in a well preserved condition. Social structure Specifically, the records indicates that E. lambei had a multi-seasonal presence in the same region as other horse species, and a social structure similar to other wild horses. Family herds included four to ten females with their young and an adult alpha stallion. Other males were gathered in less socially stable bachelor herds, and consist from groups of two to four adults. These two herds did not often share territories.  Habitat and diet  Both family and bachelor herds were non-selective grazers that forged mostly in a savannah-like regions. These horses fed mostly on grasses, sedges, poppies, mustards, and other flowers such as buttercups and roses. Equus lambei's preferred environment is believed to have been a woodland with sparse clumps of trees. Overall, E. lambei is considered to have been resistant to varying climatic conditions, although most individuals of this species seemed to have died in the winter season. It is also likely that the Equus lambei was susceptible to wolf predation.  Inferring management of modern species  Modern horses were reintroduced into North America beginning with the Spanish conquest and escaped horses subsequently spread throughout the American Great Plains. The two key elements for defining an animal as a native species are: where it originated, and whether it co-evolved with its current habitat. E. caballus can lay claim to both originating in North America, as well as evolving with the western North American landscape. Furthermore, evidence from E. lambei mtDNA now proves that modern horses are not so far removed from their ancient ancestors. Many scientists believe that a good argument can be made that E. caballus, too, should receive protection as a form of native wildlife in North America. However, this topic is still highly debated by wild horse management agencies. This debate has significant implications to wildlife management in North America, including protection and conservation for modern species.

Life and career In 1938, Sokoine was born in Monduli, Arusha Region, Tanzania. From 1948 to 1958, he had his Primary and Secondary Education in the towns of Monduli and Umbwe. In 1961, he joined the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), after he took studies in administration in the Federal Republic of Germany (1962‚Äì1963). When he returned from Germany, he became District Executive Officer of the Masai District, then he was elected to the National Assembly for the Masai Constituency. In 1967 he became Deputy Minister of Communication, Transportation and Labour. The next step in his career was the promotion to the Minister of State in 1970. In 1972, he switched to the post of the Minister of Defence and National Service of Tanzania. In 1975, he was elected to the National Assembly again, this time for Monduli. Two years later, he became a member of the Central Committee of the ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM). In the same year (1977) began his first term in office as Prime Minister of the United Republic of Tanzania. Following the outbreak of hostilities with Uganda in November 1978, Sokoine ordered Tanzania's regional commissioners to marshal all military and civilian resources for war. On 23 January 1979 he toured the Ugandan town of Mutukula following its capture by Tanzanian forces. In April 1979 Sokoine went to Nairobi and met with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi. He attempted to convince Moi to halt the flow of Libyan military aid through the country to Uganda, but was rebuffed. Tanzania eventually won the war. Sokoine joined Nyerere and other high officials on 26 July 1979 at Kaboya Military Cemetery in Muleba District to pay their respects to Tanzania's dead soldiers. Sokoine had gone many days without sleep during the conflict and was left in ill health by its end. Tanzania also entered a post-war economic recession. In 1980 Sokoine offered his resignation to Nyerere and left the premiership. Sokoine became Prime Minister again in 1983. He stayed just one year in office, till his death in April 1984, in a car accident.  Death  Sokoine died on 12 April 1984 at the age of 45 in Morogoro when his car collided with another vehicle on the road from Dodoma to Dar es Salaam. His assistant was seriously injured and his driver suffered a broken leg. Sokoine was the most likely successor to Julius Nyerere as the president of Tanzania after, Nyerere declared his intentions to retire in 1985. Sokoine's body was flown to Dar es Salaam and brought to the State House. The Nyerere family was drastically shaken by the incident and ordered to have a grand funeral. The body was on display for public viewing at Karimjee Hall for a day. This was the largest funeral Tanzania had ever hosted and the government was overwhelmed by the number of mourners present. His body was later flown to Arusha for a proper funeral. = Conspiracy theories = There were many conspiracy theories that were floated with regards to the death of Sokoine. Many people were in shock by the death of the prime minister and considered his death was foul play due to the lack of investigation into his death. The timing of the death raised many eyebrows within the community as he was destined to become the next president after Nyerere's retirement just one year after his death. People believe, that corrupt officials in the government plotted his death to avoid trial once he assumed office. Often roads are cleared for high level officials on the road and many see the fact that there was an oncoming vehicle on the road as an anomaly. Though the chance of foul play was out ruled in the case, the lack of further investigation by the authorities fueled further conspiracy theories.

Its function was to transport one or two astronauts on the lunar surface. The Pogo never went into production. The device Bell Aircraft built several versions of the Pogo under contract with NASA as a possible civil and military transport, because it was intended to be used as a means of transportation on the moon during Apollo missions, as well as an army transport over things like ravines, however NASA decided not to use the POGO because of the risk of a crash, and decided to send the Lunar Roving Vehicle. Bell demonstrated that all the versions of the POGO flew in Earth atmosphere. The first POGO was a single place model with a vertical tube with a stand for the pilot to stand with the rocket engine and peroxide tanks at the front. A second POGO was the two place POGO that was able to carry a passenger in front and it was controlled from the back, this POGO had the rockets and tanks between the two pilots. A last version of the Bell POGO was the \\"reverse\\" POGO built with the rocket engine and the peroxide tanks at the back. Bill Suitor was the only Bell pilot to fly the reverse POGO. It was known to have been tested in 1967 and reportedly in 1966 and 1968.

It shares the genus Arctocebus with the Calabar angwantibo (Arctocebus calabarensis) and together they are commonly called the golden pottos. The golden angwantibo is found in Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. Its usual habitat is rain forest, but it has also been known to live on farmland. Like the Calabar angwantibo, the golden angwantibo weighs between 266 and 465 grams and has a stumpy tail, abbreviated index fingers, a specialised grooming claw on each foot and a white line on its face. It can be distinguished from its cousin largely by its colour. The fur on its back is red-gold, with a more muted red on its belly. Unlike the Calabar angwantibo, the golden angwantibo has no nictitating membrane. The golden angwantibo is a nocturnal and arboreal species that is typically found on small branches 5‚Äì15 metres above ground. Its diet consists of around 85% insects (especially caterpillars) and 14% fruit. Its foraging, antipredator, social and reproductive behaviour are extremely similar to those of the Calabar angwantibo.

Early life Reina was born about 1520 in Montemol√≠n in the Province of Badajoz.Hermann Dechent: Reina. In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB). Band 27, Duncker & Humblot, Leipzig 1888, S. 720‚Äì723. (in German)Balderas, Eduardo. \\"How the Scriptures Came to Be Translated into Spanish\\", Ensign, September 1972. From his youth onward, he studied the Bible. In 1557, he became a monk of the Hieronymite Monastery of St. Isidore of the Fields, outside Seville (Monasterio Jer√≥nimo de San Isidoro del Campo de Sevilla). Around then, he had contact with Lutheranism and he became an adherent of the Protestant Reformation. He fled with about a dozen other monks when they came under suspicion by the Spanish Inquisition for Protestant tendencies. He first turned to John Calvin's Geneva but did not find the atmosphere of doctrinaire rigidity of the Calvinist Church to be welcoming. In 1558, Reina declared that Geneva had become \\"a new Rome\\" and left. Reina travelled in 1559 to London, where he served as a pastor to Spanish Protestant refugees. However King Philip II of Spain was exerting pressure for his extradition. =In exile on the Continent= In Seville, in April 1562, the Inquisition made an auto-da-f√© in which an effigy of him was burned. The works of Reina and his colleagues were placed in the Index of prohibited books and he was declared a \\"heresiarch\\" (leader of heretics). About 1563 Reina went on to Antwerp, where he became associated with the authors of the Polyglot Bible. In April 1564 he went to Frankfurt, where he settled with his family. Reina wrote the first great book against the Inquisition: Sanctae Inquisitionis hispanicae artes aliquot detectae, ac palam traductae (\\"Some arts of Holy Inquisition\\"). This work was printed in 1567 in Heidelberg under the pseudonym: Reginaldus Gonsalvius Montanus. He secretly translated the work of the critic of Calvin, Sebastian Castellion, De haereticis, an sint persequendi (\\"Concerning heretics, whether they should be Persecuted\\"), that condemned executions \\"for reasons of conscience\\" and documented the original Christian rejection of the practice. Biblical translation While in exile, variously in London, Antwerp, Frankfurt, Orl√©ans and Bergerac, funded by various sources (such as Juan P√©rez de Pineda) Reina began translating the Bible into Spanish by using a number of works as source texts. For the Old Testament, the work appears to have made extensive use of the Ferrara Bible in Ladino, with comparisons to the Masoretic Text and the Vetus Latina. The New Testament derives from the Textus Receptus of Erasmus, with comparisons to the Vetus Latina and Syriac manuscripts. For the New Testament, he had great aid from the translations of Francisco de Enzinas and Juan P√©rez de Pineda. It is speculated that Reina's Bible, published in Switzerland in 1569, which became the basis of the Reina-Valera Bible, was a composite work of the expatriate Isidorean community, done by several different hands, with Reina the first among them. Reina was granted citizenship by Frankfurt on 16 August 1571. He worked as a silk trader to make money for his family. Step by step, he became a true member of the Lutherans. Around 1580, he published a Catechism, in the sense of Luther's Catechism, in Latin, French and Dutch.compare Hermann Dechent: Reina. In Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB).

(August 22, 1899 ‚Äì November 24, 1975) was an American cinematographer. His credits included The Tell-Tale Heart (1941), Angels in the Outfield (1951), The Tender Trap (1955), High Society (1956), The Time Machine (1960), The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1962), Hold On!, and Return of the Seven (both 1966). Vogel began his career in the 1920s and, aside from taking a break from film to serve in World War II, worked steadily until retiring in 1967. One of his more challenging films was Robert Montgomery's Chandler film noir Lady in the Lake (1947), which was completely shot from the point of view of the protagonist. In this movie, Montgomery appears as Marlowe only in the opening sequence and briefly at intervals thereafter, being present the rest of the while as the camera is present, with the result of making the audience seem to occupy the position of detective. His brother, Joseph R. Vogel, was a vice president of Loew's, Inc. and later president of MGM.  Awards and nominations  In 1949, he won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for Battleground (1949).

It has smooth bark, sickle-shaped to curved adult leaves, characteristically large flower buds in groups of three with a bright red operculum, bright yellow to yellowish green flowers and sculptured, bell-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus erythrocorys is a small tree or a mallee, with an open spreading habit and typically grows to a height of and a width of . The bark is smooth with a creamy colour but can have a few rough brown coloured patches where it persists on the trunk instead of being shed. The smooth bark sheds in short ribbons or small polygonal flakes. Young plants and coppice regrowth have hairy stems, broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped or heart-shaped leaves long and wide. The adult leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, sickle-shaped, lance-shaped or curved, and wide on a flattened or channelled petiole long. They are thick, the same glossy green colour on both sides. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of three on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a flattened, bright red operculum that has four lobes. The flowers are bright yellow to greenish and appear between February and April and have the stamens arranged in four bundles. The fruit is a woody, broadly bell-shaped capsule long and wide. Sometimes the fruit are so numerous that they weight the tree down, giving it a weeping habit. Taxonomy Eucalyptus erythrocorys was first formally described by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1860 in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. The type specimen was collected by Augustus Frederick Oldfield in 1858 from along the Murchison River and is cited as Ad flumen Murchison et sinum squalorum versus in planitibus petraeis. The species is a member of the sub-genus Eudesmia, a group that has stamens in four bundles each at the corner of the squarish flower. It is in a sub-group that includes E. pleurocarpa. The species name erythrocorys is taken from the Greek words erythro meaning \\"red\\" and korys meaning \\"helmet\\" in reference to the bright red operculum. The common name Illyarrie, is the Noongar peoples' name for the plant. Distribution The species has a limited distribution north of Perth where it is found on undulating limestone ridges and outcrops growing in sandy alkaline soils near Dongara as well as north of Kalbarri National Park. It is also found on sandy plains, particularly the Geraldton Sandplains between Shark Bay and Jurien. Conservation status Illyarie is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Cultivation The plant is sold commercially in seed form or as tube stock and is a popular species throughout Australia. The seeds germinate readily. It can become untidy but is easily kept in shape with a light pruning. The colourful flowers make it appealing to nectar loving birds. The trees are known to shed limbs as a result of the weight of the fruit they carry. It is reasonably fast growing and both drought and smog resistant but can be frost tender. It prefers a position in full sun, in well-drained soils and can be grown in containers and in coastal locations. The flowers are used in wreaths.

Currency trading became a common form of fraud in early 2008, according to Michael Dunn of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The foreign exchange market is at best a zero-sum game, meaning that whatever one trader gains, another loses. However, brokerage commissions and other transaction costs are subtracted from the results of all traders, making foreign exchange a negative-sum game. US Government interventions In August 2008, the CFTC set up a special task force to deal with growing foreign exchange fraud. In January 2010, the CFTC proposed new rules limiting leverage to 10 to 1, based on \\"a number of improper practices\\" in the retail foreign exchange market, \\"among them solicitation fraud, a lack of transparency in the pricing and execution of transactions, unresponsiveness to customer complaints, and the targeting of unsophisticated, elderly, low net worth and other vulnerable individuals\\".The Federal Register Section E. The Commission's Proposed Rules In 2012, Christopher Ehrman, an SEC veteran, was selected to run the new SEC Office of the Whistleblower.

North American Securities Administrators Association, accessed January 12, 2008Foreign Currency Fraud Action Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) vs. Donald O‚ÄôNeill It also refers to any retail forex broker who indicates that trading foreign exchange is a low risk, high profit investment.FOREX Advisory Commodity Futures Trading Commission's FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING FRAUDS Increase in fraud The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates the foreign exchange market in the United States, has noted an increase in the amount of unscrupulous activity in the non-bank foreign exchange industry. Between 2001 and 2006, the CFTC has prosecuted more than 80 cases involving the defrauding of more than 23,000 customers who lost $350 million. From 2001 to 2007, about 26,000 people lost $460 million in forex frauds. Not beating the market The foreign exchange market is a zero-sum game in which there are many experienced, well- capitalized professional traders (e.g. working for banks) who can devote their attention full-time to trading. An inexperienced retail trader will have a significant information disadvantage compared to these traders. Retail traders are undercapitalized. Thus, they are subject to the problem of gambler's ruin: in a \\"fair game\\" (one with no information advantages) the player with the lower amount of capital has a higher probability of going bankrupt than a high-capital player. The retail trader always pays the bid/ask spread which makes their odds of winning less than those of a fair game. Additional costs may include margin interest or, if a spot position is kept open for more than one day, the trade may be \\"resettled\\" each day, each time costing the full bid/ask spread. In some variations of forex trading, the customers do not obtain normal fungible futures, but instead make a contract with some named company. Even if the company claims to act as their \\"forex dealer\\", it is financially interested in making the retail customer lose money. The contract is directly between the customer and the pseudo-dealer, so it is an off- exchange one; it cannot be normally registered and traded on futures exchanges. Although it is possible for a few experts to successfully arbitrage the market for an unusually large return, this does not mean that a larger number could earn the same returns even given the same tools, techniques, and data sources. This is because the arbitrages are essentially drawn from a pool of finite size; although information about how to capture arbitrages is a nonrival good, the arbitrages themselves are a rival good. In analogy: the total amount of buried treasure on an island is the same, regardless of how many treasure hunters have bought copies of the treasure map. High leverage By offering high leverage, some market makers encourage traders to trade extremely large positions. This increases the trading volume cleared by the market maker and increases their profit, but increases the risk that the trader will receive a margin call. While professional currency dealers such as banks and hedge funds tend to use no more than 10:1 leverage, retail clients may be offered leverage up to 1000:1.
