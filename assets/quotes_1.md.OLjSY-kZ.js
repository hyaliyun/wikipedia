It is characterised by a sudden drop in production of eggs as well as its eggshell quality in apparent healthy laying birds. Previously, this disease was commonly named as merely \\"egg drop syndrome\\", however, it is now recommended that full name; egg drop syndrome '76 (EDS '76) should be used to distinguish the name discrepancy from the recently identified disease in ducks caused by a flavivirus, which is confusingly called \\"egg drop syndrome in ducks\\" or \\"duck egg drop syndrome\\". Incidence EDS '76 was first identified in Netherlands in 1974 and the virus was first isolated in Northern Ireland in 1976. It became a problem in European countries such as Ireland, Holland, France, and the United Kingdom. Other places which have had outbreaks include India, Bangladesh, South America, Indonesia, Japan, and Africa. Since then, EDS '76 has been recognised as a global threat for the breeding and laying companies. Cause EDS '76 is caused by double stranded-DNA virus, called Duck Atadenovirus A (formerly knows as Duck Adenovirus A). The diameter of the virus is between 70 and 80 nm by negative staining. The other name of this virus may include duck adenovirus 1 (DAdV-1), EDS '76 virus (EDSV) and adenovirus 127 (AV-127). Species Affected The natural host of Duck atadenovirus A are wild and/or domestic waterfowls such as ducks and geese. However, the virus can also infect other bird species through contaminated vaccines, and contaminated drinking water by droppings. Moreover, the virus become apparent and more susceptible in chickens of all ages and breeds, especially broilers and brown egg layers. The virus also causes symptoms in Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) and turkeys. Transmission Duck atadenovirus A can be transmitted vertically (from hens to chicks). The virus is often latent until the chicks reach maturity. Thereafter, the matured chickens begin to excrete virus and transmit through the eggs and droppings. The virus is also transmitted horizontally between chickens. Mainly, it is seen in commercial egg layers whereby contaminated egg trays are often reused. The virus can survive both inside the eggs and on the eggshell. The virus can migrate from the eggshell to the tray and back to the other eggs placed in the same tray. Contaminated water supply with droppings and litters of the natural host contributes to the horizontal spread as well. Insect transmission is possible yet proven. Sign & Symptoms The first sign of EDS '76 is usually the loss of colour pigment in the eggs, followed by the production of thin-shelled, soft-shelled and even shell-less eggs. The thin-shelled and shell-less eggs are so fragile and thus may get eaten by the chickens and get disregarded as litters. The shells may also be rough or chalky. Watery egg whites and a reduction in egg size may also happen as well. The affected chicken flocks show a failure to reach a peak egg production. The fall in egg production can be up to 40%. The affected chickens may show transient diarrhoea, anaemia, and loss of appetite. Increase in mortality is not observed. thumb317x317pxGross Lesions EDS '76. A; normal hens' reproductive system B; inactive ovaries and shrunken oviducts Lesions The lesions are confined to female reproductive tracts. These may include inactive ovaries and shrunken oviducts, swelling and white exudate in the shell gland. Spleen enlargement may also be observed Diagnosis & Detection EDS '76 can largely be distinguished from other poultry diseases, such as Avian Influenza, Infectious Bronchitis and Newcastle Disease, by the clinical findings alone. However, proper laboratory testing is still needed to eliminate doubts for a definitive diagnosis. Serological testing can determine if chicken have antibodies against EDS '76, which would indicate that they have been infected. This is only possible for non-vaccinated chickens because vaccination or infection both cause antibodies to be present. The common tests of choice include Haemaglutination-Inhibition, Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay and Serum Neutralisation. The use of sentinel birds (non-vaccinated susceptible birds) in the flocks is also useful for early detection and tested for haemagglutination. It is common practice for poultry viruses' surveillance. Identification of the virus can also be detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction-based test. Treatment and Prevention There is no treatment for EDS '76, but there are ways in which chickens can be prevented form being infected by EDS '76. Hygiene: Cleaning all areas, such as breeding and laying areas, and equipment may mitigate the risk of getting EDS '76. Shared egg trays have to be cleaned and disinfected prior to use. Healthy and uninfected flocks should be kept away upon a contact with those affected birds and the virus natural host. Potential contaminated water should also be chlorinated. Vaccination: An inactivated vaccine with oil adjuvant can be administered and has proven to be reasonably successful to prevent the clinical signs of the disease. This vaccine is given before hens start to lay eggs, usually between 14 and 20 weeks of age. Several vaccine are available: Izovac EDS, Nobilis EDS, AVIVAC-EDS-76 and other EDS '76 available vaccines.

He was a patron of poets and in politics a Ghibelline.Longnon, Les compagnons, pp. 244–45. Fourth Crusade The principalities of Frankish Greece and the Greek successor states after the Fourth Crusade (1210) Born sometime before 1183, Berthold was the son of Berthold I of Katzenelnbogen and nephew of the powerful bishop of Münster, Hermann II (1173–1202). Berthold joined the court of his uncle, and is attested as being with him at Worms in February 1199, after Hermann had joined the court of King Philip of Germany. Disappointed with the political disunity and civil war in the Holy Roman Empire in the aftermath of Philip's 1198 election as king, Berthold joined the Fourth Crusade in 1202. He arrived at the Crusader camp after the Crusaders had besieged and captured Zara (Zadar) in Hungary. Like most of the German contingent, he was placed under the command of the Marquis Boniface of Montferrat, with whom he developed a close personal relationship. In 1203, when the Crusader army reached Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire, the German contingent was under the overall command of Henry of Flanders, with whom Berthold developed a good relationship.Van Tricht, Latin Renovatio, p. 170 n. 53. On 12 April 1204, after the breach of Constantinople by the Crusaders, a certain German count (quidam comes theothonicus), possibly Berthold, set fire to a section of the city in order to force the defending Byzantines to retire. After the fall of the Byzantine Empire, Count Baldwin IX of Flanders was proclaimed the new Latin Emperor. This offended Boniface, who considered himself a superior candidate, and he briefly rebelled against the new emperor. Berthold supported Boniface in his brief revolt, and after Boniface was placated with a new Kingdom of Thessalonica, Berthold accompanied Boniface in his conquest of Greece (1204–05). He was rewarded with a lordship centred on the town of Velestino in the province of Vlachia (provintia Velechative), with the title \\"Lord of Velestino\\" (dominus de Valestino).Van Tricht, Latin Renovatio, p. 161 n. 17, p. 169 n. 50. In 1205, he was sent by Pope Innocent III to a diplomatic mission in Asia Minor to mediate in a dispute between King Leo II of Armenia and Prince Bohemond IV of Antioch. After that he may have gone on to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. A certain count Berthold the German is mentioned in documents of 1206 and 1207 in the entourage of John of Ibelin, regent of the kingdom, but this may have been Count Berthold of Nimburg.Van Tricht, Latin Renovatio, p. 448 n. 53. Defence of the Kingdom of Thessalonica Berthold returned to Greece in 1207 or 1208. In the meantime, Boniface of Montferrat had been killed fighting against the Bulgarians, and had left his underage son Demetrius as his heir, with the latter's mother, Margaret of Hungary, as regent and Count Oberto II of Biandrate as guardian (baiulus) of the kingdom. In 1208–09, the kingdom's barons, rejecting the suzerainty of the emperor, now Henry of Flanders, rose against the regent in the so-called \\"Lombard Rebellion\\". Led by Oberto, the rebels intended to depose Demetrius and install his elder half-brother, William VI of Montferrat, as king. During the uprising, Berthold loyally supported the emperor and was named as castellan of Serres. After the emperor arrested Oberto, he handed him over to Berthold, who held him imprisoned in Serres.Setton, The Papacy and the Levant, pp. 27–28. Berthold supported Boniface's policy of maintaining good relations with the Byzantine aristocracy, as against the preferred policy of the rebels, which was to favour Lombards in the government. Berthold even patronised the family of Petraliphas, giving the monastery of Saint Hilarion near Halmyros to Maria Petraliphaina.Van Tricht, Latin Renovatio, pp. 246–47 and n. 338. In 1209, Berthold attended the first Parliament of Ravennika. On 2 May 1210, he signed the concordat with the church reached at the second Parliament of Ravennika.Setton, The Papacy and the Levant, p. 40. It appears that around this time the Emperor Henry appointed him imperial guardian or regent of the kingdom, balivus imperatoris, to replace Oberto. Berthold was certainly in charge of the defence of the kingdom, along with the emperor's nephew, Eustace of Flanders. He defeated an attack by Strez, nephew of the Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan, on the plains of Pelagonia, near Monastir. In 1211, he defeated Kaloyan's successor and Strez's rival, Tsar Boril of Bulgaria, and caused him heavy losses. A letter of the emperor mentioning these victories is dated 12 January 1212. In 1213, the emperor refers to Berthold as merely one of his barons in the kingdom of Thessalonica, implying that he was not at that time guardian or regent.Van Tricht, Latin Renovatio, p. 169 n. 50. Regent of the kingdom Berthold had a close relationship with Margaret of Hungary. In 1211, however, the Latin archbishop of Heraclea Perinthus complained to Pope Innocent III that Berthold forcefully kept Margaret in his possession, and that he had misappropriated lands belonging to the church of Hagia Sophia in Thessalonica. Berthold received correspondence from Innocent regarding the Latin Church in Thessalonica. In July 1210, Innocent wrote asking him to restore the possessions of the diocese of Larissa and Gardiki. On 4 August 1211, he was reproached for his occupation of lands belonging to Hagia Sophia. In 1212, the pope asked Berthold to intervene on behalf of the diocese of Gardiki in its dispute with the Knights Hospitaller. The wording of these papal letters has engendered confusion over whether Berthold was himself the \\"imperial bailiff\\" (balivus imperatoris) the pope was addressing or else merely the lord of Velestino. Berthold is explicitly mentioned as regent—baiulus regni Thessalonicensis— only once: in a letter of 21 April 1217 from Pope Honorius III, notifying him of his appointment of Giovanni Colonna as papal legate to Thessalonica. This is also the last sure reference to Berthold; he is not mentioned in any other contemporary source after this. A late source says that he visited Acre in the Kingdom of Jerusalem later that year and from there returned to Germany. Around 1220, Berthold's nephew and heir, Count Diether IV, visited Thessalonica, perhaps to see his uncle or else claim his inheritance.Van Tricht, Latin Renovatio, p. 171 n. 58.

The film, produced by Sai Korrapati and Rajani Korrapati on Vaaraahi Chalana Chitram banner, features Naga Shourya, Rashi Khanna and Srinivas Avasarala in the lead. The film is an adaption of the 1897 French play Cyrano de Bergerac by Edmond Rostand, and revolves around a young girl Prabhavati and two men Venky and Uday who love her. Kalyani Koduri composed the soundtrack and the background score for the film while Venkat C. Dileep and Kiran Ganti provided the cinematography and editing for the film. The film's principal photography commenced in October 2013 and the film was extensively shot in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam. After aggressive promotion, the film released worldwide on 20 June 2014. Upon release, the film received positive reviews and went on to become a big hit, completing 50 days in 21 centers. n pugaswararao (Naga Shourya) works at UB TV and his aim is to become a news reader like his father N. Bhanu Murthy. Bhanu Murthy discontinued his work as a news reader in Doordarshan after entry of new channels and a paralytic attack. However, Venky is unable to reach his target and he has a strong contender in the race for his dream job is Vamana Rao (Posani Krishna Murali). Meanwhile, for the past four years, Venky is stuck working as an anchor for Teleshopping advertisements at UB TV. Moreover, his overbearing boss Uday Bhaskar a.k.a. Uday (Srinivas Avasarala) is jealous of Venky as Venky can easily communicate with girls whereas Uday is extremely awkward in his interactions with the opposite sex. Therefore, he turns a roadblock in Venky's aim to become a news reader. After rejecting many marriage proposals, Uday agrees to marry a dentist Sirisha after seeing her photograph given by his marriage broker. After their first meet, Sirisha wants to meet Uday again for understanding him better. Since Uday is not good at communication with women, he takes the help of Venky and seeks his advice. Based on her preferences, Venky gives some suggestions to Uday at a bowling alley. While returning to their homes, Uday asks Venky about his comfortable approach towards girls and asks Venky if he has any past love experiences. Venky narrates his love story. In 2009, Venky went to Visakhapatnam for summer vacation and he met a Delhi- based 19 yr old girl, Prabhavathi a.k.a. Prabha (Rashi Khanna). Prabha has also come for a vacation to Vizag for peace of mind as her parents are going through a divorce in Delhi. Venky and Prabha meet in a movie theater and come to know that they reside in the same apartment complex. Venky develops a crush on her but he is advised not to take any hasty steps by his uncle (Rao Ramesh) and aunt (Hema). Venky and Prabha develop a good friendship and when Venky starts developing much stronger feelings for her, his uncle asks him to list at least 10 reasons why he loves her. He writes 100 reasons in a book and sings them all together once (Inthakante Vere - Version 1). On the birthday of Prabha, Venky takes her out to a nice dinner and proposes her. She replies that though she likes him and treats him as her best friend, she cannot accept his proposal as she is only 19 and can't take such a big decision at that age. She asks him to continue their friendship and they can take a decision later. Venky is offended and reacts telling her that he is new to \\"Delhi culture\\" with flirtatious and temporary relationships. Annoyed, she leaves the restaurant and Venky's efforts to apologize her fail completely as she leaves for Delhi the next day. After Venky narrates his story, both Venky and Uday say good bye to each other and part for the night. Next morning, Uday and Sirisha meet and all attempts by Uday to impress her fail. She decides to seek another alliance and to choose the best between the two. Then, Uday and his broker decide to send Venky's photograph as the new bridegroom. The plan is to portray him as a wastrel and Uday as a good friend, so that Sirisha accepts Uday. Venky is forced to act as per the plan under the threat that he will be dismissed from his job and his career will be ruined if he fails to do so. Uday also offers him a job as a news reader in UB TV if he obeys the former's orders. Venky obliges and visits a temple next morning where he is scheduled to meet Sirisha. Here, he realizes that Sirisha is none other than Prabha, his former muse. To avoid an uncomfortable situation, Venky enlists the help of Chinta Guru Murthy a.k.a. Guru (Harish Koyalagundla), a NRI who befriends Venky during the temple visit. Venky persuades Guru to pose as the prospective bridegroom, so that Prabha can reject him and go back to Uday. When Prabha reaches home, she comes to know that bridegroom was Venky and not Gurumurthy. She wants to meet Venky and propose to him as she grew to cherish their relationship over the past few years. Next day, Uday and Venky sit in a coffee shop where Uday gives Venky a Bluetooth device and a smart phone for communication. Using that, Uday plans to seek Venky's real-time help while conversing with Prabha. When Uday goes to bring the phone's charger, Prabha meets Venky and proposes him. Before Venky can respond, Uday reaches the location and Venky runs into washroom along with the phone's charger. Via Bluetooth, Venky helps Uday converse eloquently with Prabha. The conversation of Uday and Prabha ends with a decision to meet at 7:00 PM at a hotel the next Friday for dinner. When Uday leaves, Venky comes back and he agrees to meet her at 9:00 PM on the same Friday near Necklace road. During the dinner, Uday wants to give a love letter to Prabha and Venky pens it in the form of a poem which can be sung as a song (Em Sandeham Ledu). Uday speaks to Prabha while seeking guidance from Venky via bluetooth and when she is about to leave, he gives her the love letter. She reads it during her journey to Necklace road and is impressed. When she meets Venky at Necklace road and proposes to him, he rejects her and she leaves dejected. Next night, Uday goes to Prabha's house with a bouquet when she is about to spend a little quality alone-time. But this time, neither Venky's phone signals work, nor his phone's battery has sufficient charging. Thus, Uday can seek Venky's help only for a few moments and when the phone call ends, Uday proposes to prabha on the spur of the moment and tries to present her a ring. The plan backfires and Prabha asks Uday to leave her house. After leaving the house, Uday enlists the help of Venky again and sings a song praising her beauty (Inthakante Vere - Version 2). She is impressed and agrees to marry Uday. When Prabha wears the ring given by Uday, Venky is dejected and leaves home. At home, Venky is advised by his mother (Pragathi) that Uday is using him as a scapegoat. She advises him to resign from his job and win back Prabha. When Venky reaches the office next morning, his colleague Kalyani tells him that he is selected as the news reader for the evening news bulletin. He goes to Uday's chamber and submits his resignation. When he is about to leave Venky's office to meet Prabha, Uday beats him up and ties him to a chair and covers his mouth with a tape. Then, Uday selects Vamana Rao as the evening bulletin news reader. However, Kalyani who saw Venky entering Uday's chamber doubts Uday. Uday and Prabha meet up at a shopping mall and start to watch UB TV's first ever news bulletin. Venky at Uday's chamber causes a fire in the room with a cigarette lighter to garner attention and is rescued. Kalyani sends him to read weather telecast and when he is visible on screen, his parents and his uncle and aunt at Visakhapatnam are happy for him. He then reveals the whole truth and proposes to Prabha telling her that he visited Visakhapatnam every summer vacation since he met her though she never returned. Before Uday can stop Prabha from leaving him, he is attacked by Guru who locks him up in a restroom at the shopping mall. With the help of Guru, Prabha reaches UB TV office and after a small quarrel, Venky and Prabha unite. Before Uday can fire Venky, he is stopped by his father. Because of all these developments, the TRP's of UB TV cross TV9 and Venky becomes highly popular. Uday makes Venky the news reader of evening bulletin and he assigns Vamana Rao to Teleshopping. The film ends with Venky helping Uday in flirting with a girl using Bluetooth communication. Cast *Naga Shourya as N.

In an interview he said that he wanted to start a \\"small budget venture that can be easily executed.\\" To this end, he chose the main conflict point of the famous French play Cyrano de Bergerac and prepared a story. Srinivas made umpteen attempts to find a producer for this project. Finally, Sai Korrapati agreed to produce the film. The film was officially launched on 9 September 2013 at Hyderabad as Production No. 3 of Vaaraahi Chalana Chitram banner. While Srinivas Avasarala made his directorial debut with this film, Naga Shourya was selected to play the lead role. This film was supposed to be his debut too, though his succeeding film Chandamama Kathalu released first. He went to the audition when Vaaraahi Chalana Chitram issued a casting call to give his final try as an actor after trying for almost 4 and a half years. He was selected after portraying a comedy scene narrated by the director A Telugu NRI Venkat C. Dileep, an alumnus of Savannah College of Art and Design and a camera assistant in a few Hollywood projects, was selected as the cinematographer of the film by Srinivas Avasarala on the recommendation of a common friend Bala Rajasekhar. This project marked his debut in Telugu cinema. Kalyani Koduri was selected as the music director of the film and the recording of the songs started on 1 October 2013. After rejecting 40 - 50 titles, the title Oohalu Gusagusalade, the title of a song from the N. T. Rama Rao film Bandipotu, was selected. After the makers watched Madras Cafe, they approached Rashi Khanna who played the role of Ruby Singh, the wife of Major Vikram Singh played by John Abraham in that film for the role of the female lead. About her selection, she said \\"They called me for a narration. Initially I thought it would be more of a dancing role with little scope for acting. When I went down for the narration, I was excited to find that the film revolves around the girl who was there in practically every scene.\\" She said that her role was \\"selfish, egoistic and stubborn\\" which she claimed to be very different from what she was. She added \\"Except that she's from Delhi, my real life persona has nothing in common with the role I played in the film. Initially, when I heard the script, I kept wondering why Prabhavati behaves in a certain manner and throughout the shooting process, Srinivas Avasarala kept justifying Prabhavati's actions because she comes with a lot of emotional baggage\\". Since the character of Prabhavathi is a fan of Mohammad Rafi, Srinivas brought his own collection of old books and cassettes to fill the frame for a particular scene in the film as they were not available in the market. Srinivas Avasarala played the role of a CEO of a TV channel in the film. Though Sai Korrapati did not want him to act in this film, he later agreed to Srinivas's inclusion after seeing the rushes of the scenes shot in his absence. The filming started in October 2013 and took place in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam with the use of limited resources and low budget. Because of the same reason, lot of close up scenes were shot and the set properties in the background were changed so that each frame would look different as they did not have enough money to fill the entire frame with such properties. The cinematographer said that there were limited lights and they had to work hard to make the scenes appear natural using those lights during the shoot at Visakhapatnam. Soundtrack Kalyani Koduri was selected as the music director of the film marking his first collaboration with Srinivas Avasarala. The recording of the songs started at Hyderabad on 1 October 2013 with the first one being rendered by Sunitha even before the start of the film's production. Though Anantha Sreeram was declared as the single card lyricist of the film during the launch of the movie, the final version featured Anantha Sreeram penning 2 of the 4 songs while the remaining two being penned by Sirivennela Sitaramasastri. The audio was launched at Hyderabad in a promotional audio launch event on 28 April 2014 on Vel Records Label. The soundtrack received positive response and were praised by the critics upon the film's release on 20 June 2014. Kalyani Koduri dedicated this soundtrack to music lovers on 21 June 2014 on the occasion of World's Music Day by releasing a press note. Release In early June 2014, the makers confirmed that the film would release on 20 June 2014 worldwide in theaters after being awarded with a clean U certificate from Central Board of Film Certification.

The Hindu gave a review stating \\"The tussle between a man who, despite all the hand-holding, can make a mess of expressing his love and the man who knows to charm his woman but is restricted by circumstances makes for an engaging watch. Well-written romantic comedies are rare in Telugu cinema. Oohalu Gusagusalade is an exception and a delight.\\" The Times of India gave a review stating \\"At a run time of 143 minutes, Oohalu Gusagusalaade has just about the right proportion of romance and comedy to call it a film which has its heart at the right place. It's undoubtedly one of the better feel-good-romantic films in recent times\\" and rated the film 3.5/5. Oneindia Entertainment gave a review stating \\"Though Oohalu Gusagusalde has simple storyline, Srinivas Avasarala has created fantastic screenplay. The director has good grip on the narration of the whole show. Overall, Oohalu Gusagusalde is a good romantic comedy entertainer and it will impress audience in A centres. Go watch it this weekend\\" and rated the film 3.5/5. Deccan Chronicle gave a review stating \\"The climax scene and the comedy routines fall a bit flat, still this breezy romantic entertainer is breath of fresh air.

IndiaGlitz gave a review stating \\"Oohalu Gusa Gusa Lade is an almost flawlessly written screenplay supported by deft execution. It is a rom-com that is high on writing and imaginative in terms of presentation\\" and rated the film 3.25/5. Sify gave a review stating \\"Oohalu Gusagusalade is told in lighter manner. It has good writing and crackling romantic scenes with soothing music. The film has good scripting with some witty lines. Overall it is comedy that saves the film.\\" Apart from critics, prominent celebrities too lauded the film. National Award winning director S. S. Rajamouli and Actor cum Hindupur MLA Nandamuri Balakrishna, actor N. T. Rama Rao Jr. praised the film's director and producer for their efforts. Venkat C.

He has exhibited in international settings including the Seoul Museum of Art in South Korea, the Moscow Museum of Modern Art in Russia, the Queensland Art Gallery in Australia, and the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, France. Life and works Takahiro Iwasaki was born and raised in Hiroshima where he studied at the Hiroshima City University. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Arts in 1998, a Master of Arts in 2001 and a Doctor of Philosophy in 2003. In 2005 he received a Master of Fine Arts from the Edinburgh College of Art. His most well-known series of works is Out of Disorder, which reproduces architectural structures from rendered unusual materials such as hair, dust, threads, towels, and toothbrushes. Subjects include the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island, the Cosmoworld in Yokohama, and also shipyards and oil refineries. The series also includes topographical maps sculpted on rolls of duct tape, including a reproduction of the Victoria Peak in Hong Kong. It was exhibited at the Cornerhouse gallery in Manchester, United Kingdom in 2011, at the Asian Art Biennial in the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts in 2013, and at the Kawasaki City Museum in 2014, among others. Another series of works by Iwasaki includes temples sculpted in Japanese cypress, where an inverted version is attached underneath as if it were a reflection on water, and the whole sculpture is suspended in mid-air. His first work of this kind, Reflection Model, was exhibited at the Gallery Natsuka in Tokyo in 2001. Iwasaki completed a new and more complex model, faithfully representing the Byōdō-in near Kyoto, in 2012, and exhibited it at the Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art organized by the Queensland Art Gallery in Queensland, Australia. In September of the same year Iwasaki put several microscopic sculptures, including an incomplete Eiffel Tower, in the exhibition space at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, France.

Controversies Despite the popularity of its Clean Master Android App, it was reported in 2014 that ads promoting Clean Master manipulate Android users with deceptive tactics when browsing websites within the app's advertising framework. In April 2014, Ferenc László Nagy from Sophos Labs captured some pop-up ads that led to Clean Master, warning the device had been infected with a virus. In July 2014, Cheetah Mobile encouraged users to uninstall Google Chrome and replace it with Cheetah Mobile's own browser during Clean Master's clean up and optimization process. This practice allowed Cheetah Mobile to gain unfair position in the marketplace and led to a Google crackdown. In December 2018, Cheetah Mobile was implicated in a massive click fraud scheme, leading Google to remove two of its apps from its Play Store. Cheetah Mobile has denied the charges. In February 2020, Google banned nearly 600 apps on the Play Store including all Cheetah Mobile's apps \\"for violating our disruptive ads policy and disallowed interstitial policy.\\" As of 10 March, 2020, all apps made by Cheetah Mobile, along with the benchmarking AnTuTu apps, have been banned from the Google Play Store.

P. Roberts (1806–1871) was a noted Chartist who became known as the \\"attorney-general\\" of the coal miners in the 1840s. Family William Prowting Roberts was born in Chelmsford, Essex to Revd Thomas Roberts, who was head of the local grammar school, and to a daughter of William Prowting who was surgeon and treasurer of St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics. He married Mary Moody (d. 1837), daughter of Revd William Moody of Bathamton House, Wiltshire, and had two children, a boy and a girl. He then later married Mary Hill Hopkins who he had two sons and two daughters with. Chartism Roberts established a legal practice in Bath, Somerset, where he became involved in local politics. He became the head of the Bath Working Men's Association. His involvement with the Chartist movement subsequently meant that he became friends with Henry Vincent.John Simkin \\"Henry Vincent\\" Spartacus Educational: : First published September 1997 (updated 2014): Retrieved 25 June 2014 Roberts was a popular public speaker in the West Country where he also defended fellow Chartists in court. He himself was sentenced to two years of imprisonment in March 1840\\"W.P.Roberts\\" Looking at History: Chartist Lives Published 1 September 2007 Retrieved 25 June 2014 after a turbulent meeting in Devizes, Wiltshire. He secured an early release in July 1840 and undeterred by imprisonment he continued his Chartist associations. He was delegate to the 1842 convention and was treasurer of the Chartist Co-operative Land Company. Roberts stood as Chartist candidate for the General Election 1847 and 1857. He arranged a speaking tour for John Frost, leader of the Newport Rising, around the United States. Northumberland and Durham Miners' Union The Miners' Monthly Magazine Being one of the first solicitors to concentrate on Trade Unions, Roberts was appointed as the legal adviser for the Northumberland and Durham Miners' Union. He became popularly known as the miners' \\"attorney- general\\". His philosophy was simple: \\"We resist every individual act of oppression, even in cases we were sure of losing.\\" Roberts challenged the Bond, the oppressive terms of employment under which the miners worked. He won many legal battles against the Bond and gained notoriety for securing the release of pitmen from Thornley, Durham colliery in 1843, who had been imprisoned for breaking the Bond. He also attacked the Truck system in which miners were paid by kind rather than cash. Friedrich Engels described this as a \\"Crusade against despotic Justices of Peace and truck masters\\". Roberts held an inquest into the Haswell colliery explosion, September 1844, in which 95 miners lost their lives. His accounts led to a government inquiry into mine safety. During his time as a legal adviser to the mining union he edited the Miners' Monthly Magazine between March–July 1844. \\"In making this arrangement, Mr R's principle motive is to give an opportunity to the pitmen in that neighbourhood of consulting him without their having the trouble of coming to Newcastle.\\" He also contributed to the union journal, the Miners' Journal which later was named the Miners' Advocate. Manchester The coal owners severely weakened the Union after a prolonged dispute. The Union could no longer afford the services of Roberts. Roberts moved to Manchester in the summer of 1845 and became legal adviser to the Lancashire Miners' Association. He became friends and neighbours with Richard Marsden Pankhurst and later Annie Besant. He also notably fought cases involving trade unionists including the case involving engineers from Newton-le-Willows indicted for picketing. He also helped Karl Marx in his legal affairs. In 1854 he attacked the bill restricting trade on Sundays as a hypocritical encroachment on the liberties of the poor. Last cases Roberts was the legal adviser to the Miners' National Association from 1858 to 1863 where he was forced out by the president, Alexander MacDonald as his approach was too anachronistic and out of touch. The unions did not require a lawyer that could humiliate the employers' but a someone who could use the law to settle disagreements. The also did not like Roberts interfering with internal affairs. However, he did succeed in the case of Janet Jones of Blaenau. Janet Jones had been forced to work for two years in the colliery without payment to repay her debts incurred by their Tommy Shop when her father died. Roberts actions in court led to her getting her wages and started a large campaign against the Truck system. In October 1867 he acted for the Fenians who were tried for the murder of a policeman, he was taken into custody after the judge, Colin Blackburn, ordered that his conduct in court was unorderly. In December of the same year he secured the release of Ann Justice who was among the six Irish who were charged for the Clerkenwell explosion. Roberts helped the Irish in the battle against Irish-English racism. His last notable case was in 1869 involving the miners at Monkwearmouth Colliery where he finally managed to abolish the Bill. In 1871 he published a pamphlet highlighting the dangers of the government's Trade Union Bill. Later life Dedicating himself to the poor, Roberts realised that it was impossible for most of the poor to live out proper Christian lives. He visited the Holy Land with his wife in 1862 and again in 1863Charles William Sutton \\"Roberts, William Prowting\\" Dictionary of National Biography 1885–1900, Volume 48: Retrieved 25 June 2014 and lectured at Church of England societies. They moved to Heronsgate House in 1867 which was an old school built on O'Connorsville which was the first Chartist land settlement at Chorleywood, Hertfordshire. Roberts died there on 7 September 1871 and is buried in Chorleywood churchyard.

The partnership includes the Governments of Austria, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom; the Veneto Region of Italy; the French National Union of Health Insurance Funds (UNCAM); the World Health Organization; the European Commission; the World Bank; the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE); and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). The observatory was established in 1998 by Josep Figueras, with colleagues Martin McKee, Elias Mossialos, and Richard Saltman, when Dr Jo E. Asvall, the then WHO Regional Director for Europe, approved its foundation. The organization is dedicated to supporting evidence-based health policy-making through the analysis and dissemination of information on European health systems and by engaging directly with national policy-makers in order to promote health gain, solidarity, efficiency, quality, responsiveness, transparency, and integrity. It utilises and compares experiences from across Europe to identify and highlight health issues with the intention of encouraging debate, while assisting European powers in taking evidence-based decisions in order to tackle issues affecting public health. The Observatory is composed of a steering committee, core management team, research policy group and staff. Its secretariat is based in Brussels and has offices in London (at LSE and LSHTM) and the Technical University of Berlin, bringing together a wide range of academics, policy-makers and practitioners to analyse trends in health policies and reforms. The Observatory aims to shape the course of policy development, relying on national powers to act accordingly with the Observatory's findings, which are published in its comprehensive reviews of health systems (Health Systems in Transition or HiTs). The health system profiles, compiled by the Observatory, cover the 53 member states of WHO European Region and several member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). They are used and accessed by a wide international audience interested in comparing European and international health systems and policies. The Observatory recognises the environmental, socio-political and socio-economic influences on health systems and public health, assessing how events such as the recent economic downturn or financial crisis have affected public health across Europe. The Observatory has designed and manages the innovative Health Systems and Policy Monitor platform (HSPM). This platform is a collaborative venture which provides a detailed description of health systems and provides up to date information on reforms and changes that are particularly policy relevant. The platform allows country by country comparisons in key areas of public health. Activities =Health in Transition Series (HiT)= HiT health system reviews are reports generally focused on one country. The report is a detailed description of the country's health system, analyzing the health issues the system's ability to deal with them, often outlining reform and policy options available to the policymakers in that country. The series is regularly updated and covers the countries of the WHO European Region as well as some additional OECD countries (the full list of HiTs and their date of publication are available online. The studies are available in an English version and some reports are also available in another official language, mainly Russian. =Health Systems and Policy Monitor (HSPM)= The Health Systems and Policy Monitor is a platform allowing policy makers, practitioners, and academics to study and understand the changes in national health systems across Europe. It allows the user to extract specific information on European health systems and directly compare the results from different countries. The platform makes the Observatory's HiT series accessible online, it follows health system changes in real time, as they develop via posts from experts at the Health Systems and Policy Monitor Network. It also provides insights into ongoing health reforms so that HSPM users can identify and understand shifts in policy across the Region. The Observatory also grants access to the Elsevier Health Policy Journal's articles published by HSPM members. The HSPM platform features rolling updates by its Network members for: * Belgium (KCE - Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre) * Denmark (the University of Copenhagen and University of Southern Denmark) * France (URC Eco Île-de-France - Unité de recherche clinique en économie de la santé and IRDES- Institute for Research and Information in Health Economics) * Hungary (Semmelweis University) * Israel (Myers-JDC- Brookdale Institute's Smokler Centre for Health Policy Research) * Italy (CERGAS Bocconi University and Universita' Cattolica of Rome) * Netherlands (NIVEL- Netherlands Institute for health Services Research and University of Maastricht) * Portugal (Universidade Nova de Lisboa- Nova Business School) * Slovenia (IVZ- Institute of Public Health of the Republic of Slovenia) * Spain (SESPAS- Spanish Society of Public Health and Health Management, IACS- Aragon Institute of Health Science and University of Barcelona) * Sweden (Vårdanalys- Swedish Agency for Health and Care Services Analysis and Lund University) * United Kingdom/England (The King's Fund) =Studies= The Observatory's studies cover an extensive range of topics from children's health care to issues surrounding chronic and communicable diseases to the financial constraints on health systems across Europe. Although these studies do not ensure the implementation of new reforms and policies across Europe they are vital in highlighting, explaining and disseminating key data, from which policymakers across Europe can use to make relevant and progressive changes to national health systems. A few titles include: * European child health services and systems. Lessons without borders * Health professional mobility in a changing Europe. New dynamics, mobile individuals and diverse responses * Boosting innovation and cooperation in European cancer control * Hospitals and borders.

Reform strategies and the movement towards institutional autonomy * Migration and health in the European Union * Diagnosis-related groups in Europe A full list of the Observatory's studies are available online. =Policy Briefs and Summaries= The Observatory also publishes specific Policy briefs and summaries. These are small reports catering to the needs of health policymakers and are used to inform them and to provide relevant and available evidence surrounding specific issues. They follow a systematic way of organizing the information and tend to concentrate more on the relevance of certain policies and the implementation of the policy options. These are some examples of the most recent titles from the Observatory's set of policy briefs and summaries (a full list is available online): * What is the evidence on the economic effects of integrated care?

Despite predictions it would not appeal to a wide market and be \\"a boys' anorak paradise\\", a report in The Independent suggested that 20% of customers were women. Although the shop was popular, it was unable to cope with a 40% rise in shop rates, and it closed at the end of 2004. Body died of leukemia in April 2008. However, the name survives as a publishing company.

After working in a number of other jobs, he obtained a junior position with the Carnegie Hall Recording Company in 1950. He was soon employed as a recording engineer for Columbia Records and by the late 1950s became a producer. From the early 1970s, he operated in a freelance capacity. He engineered Bruno Walter's cycle of the nine Beethoven symphonies with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra. He also worked on over thirty recordings with Igor Stravinsky, and around 200 with Leonard Bernstein.

Under the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program, DHS collects and reviews information from chemical facilities in the United States to determine which facilities present security risks and then requires them to write and enact security plans. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS), also known as 6 CFR, Part 27, are a set of US government security regulations for high-risk chemical facilities such as chemical plants, electrical generating facilities, refineries, and universities. The US Department of Homeland Security promulgated the Final Rule on April 9, 2007.Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards; Final Rule (\\"Final Rule\\"), 72 Fed. Reg. 17687-17745 (Apr. 9, 2007). The regulations came into effect on June 8, 2007, apart from material covered in Appendix A, which took effect upon its publication in the Federal Register on November 20, 2007.Appendix to Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, 72 Fed. Reg. 65396-65435 (Nov. 29, 2007). The response from the US chemical community to the initial legislation was rather critical, but the revisions introduced in November appear to have addressed many of the concerns of both industry and academia. For example, certain routine chemicals of low toxicity, such as acetone or urea, have been removed from the list, since record-keeping for such common compounds was considered an excessive burden. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program Authorization and Accountability Act of 2014 would reestablish the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) Program, under which the United States Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) is required to: (1) establish risk-based performance standards designed to protect covered chemical facilities from acts of terrorism; (2) require such facilities to submit security vulnerability assessments and develop and implement site security plans; (3) review and approve or disapprove each such assessment and plan; (4) arrange for the audit and inspection of covered chemical facilities to determine compliance with this Act; and (5) notify, and issue an order to comply to, the owner or operator of a facility not in compliance. The bill would authorize the Secretary to: (1) issue an order assessing a civil penalty or to cease operations if an owner or operator fails to comply; and (2) approve an alternative security program established by a private sector entity or a federal, state, or local authority that meets the requirements of this Act. The bill would authorize a covered chemical facility, in order to satisfy the requirements of a risk-based performance standard that addresses personnel surety by identifying individuals with terrorist ties, to utilize any federal screening program that periodically vets individuals against the Terrorist Screening Database. The bill would require the Secretary to: (1) consult with the heads of other federal agencies, states and political subdivisions, and relevant business associations to identify all chemical facilities of interest; and (2) develop a risk assessment approach and corresponding tiering methodology that incorporates all relevant elements of risk, including threat, vulnerability, and consequence. Defines \\"covered chemical facility\\" to mean a chemical facility that the Secretary designates as a facility of interest and determines presents a high level of security risk, with specified exceptions. The bill would require: (1) information developed pursuant to this Act to be protected from public disclosure, but permits the sharing of such information with state and local government officials possessing the necessary security clearances; and (2) information submitted to or obtained by the Secretary under this Act to be treated as classified material. The bill would set forth civil penalties for violations of orders issued under this Act. The bill would terminate this Act two years after its enactment. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on April 30, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4007 would make permanent the United States Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS’s) authority to regulate security at certain chemical facilities in the United States. Under the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program, DHS collects and reviews information from chemical facilities in the United States to determine which facilities present security risks. Facilities determined to present a high level of security risk are then required to develop a Site Security Plan (SSP). DHS in turn conducts inspections to validate the adequacy of a facility’s SSP and their compliance with it. The program is set to end on October 4, 2014. Procedural history The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program Authorization and Accountability Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on February 6, 2014 by Rep. Patrick Meehan (R, PA-7). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Homeland Security, the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies, and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Environment and Economy. The DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate's Office of Infrastructure Protection Assistant Secretary Caitlin Durkovich testified in favor of the bill before the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies. On June 23, 2014, it was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-491 part 1. On July 8, 2014, the House voted in a voice vote to pass the bill. Debate and discussion Rep. Meehan, who introduced the bill, argued that \\"the fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas less than a year ago tragically demonstrated the potential for catastrophe at one of our country's thousands of chemical facilities. The Chemical Facility Anti- Terrorism Standards program is an important part of ensuring these facilities take reasonable precautions to protect against terrorist attack.\\" The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) supported the bill, arguing that \\"CFATS is making the Nation more secure by reducing the risks associated with our Nation’s chemical infrastructure.\\" The DHS also argued that the reauthorization was necessary because \\"uncertainty about the future of CFATS also has provided an incentive for potentially regulated facilities storing large quantities of dangerous chemicals to ignore their obligations under CFATS in hopes that the program will be allowed to sunset.\\" The Fertilizer Institute supported the bill, arguing that it would allow the DHS to \\"effectively establish programs and make necessary changes to existing ones without worrying about whether or not the resources to administer them will be available in the future. The legislation would allow industry to be able to plan for investments with the certainty of knowing the program will be in place.\\" The National Association of Chemical Distributors supported the bill, arguing that it was important to reauthorize the program for two years to avoid situations like the one resulting from the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, when the law lapsed.

It is also a word sometimes used to refer to yōkai or henge (\\"changed beings\\"). Summary Lady Rokujō depicted as an ikiryō in the work titled \\"Aoi no Ue\\" (葵上) from the Hokusai Manga by Katsushika Hokusai Mononoke can be often seen in literature of the Heian period. As a famous example, in the 9th volume of the Genji Monogatari, \\"Aoi\\" is the ikiryō of Lady Rokujo, who possessed Aoi no Ue. Other than that, there are also statements about mononoke in publications like Ōkagami and Masukagami. In those times, when medical knowledge has not been fully developed, people like monks and shugensha would perform incantations and prayers against diseases caused by mononoke, and by temporarily moving the mononoke into a different person called the \\"yorimashi\\" (usually servants, apprentices, etc.) they would perform exorcism on the mononoke to heal the illness. Statements on this practice can be found in detail in works like The Pillow Book and The Diary of Lady Murasaki. Also, according to the Shoku Nihon Kōki, it told of once when a monk chanted a sutra to 60 people within the imperial residence. History Japanese mononoke come from China's 物怪, and there are statements on them in ancient Chinese literature like Records of the Grand Historian and 原鬼, there are statements on this 物怪. In the latter one, there is the statement, \\"those with neither voice nor shape are 鬼神 (wrathful gods). Those who cannot have shape or voice, and also cannot be without shape or voice, are 物怪,\\" and thus the 物怪 of China at that time were considered a type of yōkai that cannot be seen or heard, and were thought to be natural phenomena that people did not understand with the knowledge of those times. \\"Mononoke Kikyo no Koto\\" (物怪帰去の事) from the \\"Totei Bukkairoku\\" (稲亭物怪録) The first appearance of the term in Japanese literature is seen to be in the Nihon Kōki, and according to a quotation of this book from the Nihon Kiryaku of the same time period, in the article of Uruu 12th month of the year Tenchō 7 (830), there is the statement: \\"Five monks were invited to recite the Diamond Sutra. With some difficulty, the Jingi-kan relieved it. It was the work of a 物恠,\\" and there are also statements about mononoke in the articles in the 8th month Jinshin of the same year, and of year 10 in the 5th month. In the old language of those times, the word \\"mono\\" was used to refer to oni, spirits, or Ara-mitama among other things, or things that were not felt to be clearly real, and in the Taihō Code, epidemic diseases were written about as \\"toki no ke\\" (時気), using the word \\"ke\\" to refer to \\"diseases\\", and so it is seen that a \\"mono no ke\\" (a \\"ke\\" of a \\"mono\\") was used to refer to diseases caused by these \\"mono\\". \\"The Pillow Book\\" as well, there are names for diseases such as \\"mune no ke\\" (\\"ke\\" of the chest), \\"ashi no ke\\" (\\"ke\\" of the feet), and \\"mono no ke\\" (\\"ke\\" of \\"mono\\"). As groundwork for how mononoke were thought of as, in Japan from the beginning of the Heian Period, various societal malaises and illnesses were thought to be due to curses (\\"tatari\\") of vengeful spirits (onryō). Starting with how the succession of emperors dying to diseases and the spread of epidemics in the Enryaku years was said to be the curse of Prince Sawara, there is a tale in the Nihonkoku Genpō Zen'aku Ryōiki in which the grudge of Prince Nagaya is said to have led many people to their deaths. In the Shoku Nihongi, there is a statement about Fujiwara no Hirotsugu's vengeful spirit (onryō). However, this kind of thought still wasn't very influential at that time, and even Emperor Saga stated in a caution, \\"in this society, some would attribute any and all mononoke to a spirit's curse. These are very baseless assertions,\\" thus strongly denying the relation between mononoke and vengeful spirits. Afterwards, in the Shoku Nihon Kōki, the author, Harusumi no Yoshitada, reflecting knowledge of onmyōdō, strongly adopted the concept of mononoke. In the Jōwa years, the aristocratic society received strong influence from onmyōdō, and the spread of onmyōdō planted in many people the general concept of vengeful spirits. Just at that time, after Sugawara no Michizane died in Engi 3 (903), the deaths one after another that followed of members of the imperial and noble families, as well as the spread of epidemic diseases, were feared as the work of a curse of Michizane, and thus the belief that mononoke were caused by vengeful spirits' curses grew even stronger. Afterwards, in the era of the Fujiwara sekke, as opposed to how noble families at that time boasted of glory, they had delicate personalities, and so due to fear of the grudges and revenges of the era's defeated ones, and due to misgivings about the future, fear of mononoke became more aroused. The locked-in lifestyle of the imperial society at that time also fostered in the nobles' minds fear of mononoke. In this way, mononoke themselves were thought to be vengeful spirits, and eventually in addition to epidemic diseases, individual deaths, illnesses, and pain were all seen to be due to mononoke, and the illnesses itself also became called mononoke. Furthermore, due to the concept of the fear of \\"mono\\", the things that were said to be the origin of the illnesses, the ikiryō and shiryō themselves, were also thought to have been called mononoke.

Life Born at Burton Agnes in the East Riding of Yorkshire about 1740, he was son of Thomas Dade, vicar of the parish, by his wife Mary Norton. He was educated under Mr. Cotes of Shipton, Mr. Bowness in Holderness, and at Newcome's School in Hackney. He went on to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted in 1759. In 1763 Dade received holy orders from Archbishop Robert Hay Drummond, and he became successively rector of St. Mary's, Castlegate in York, curate of the perpetual curacy of St. Olave's, Marygate without Bootham Bar, also in the city; and rector of Barmston, near Bridlington. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1783. Dade died at Barmston on 2 August 1790. Dade registers Dade championed parish registers that included extra personal details. His ideas on registration forms were taken up by Archbishop William Markham, who required them in the diocese of York from his visitation of 1777. These and related registers are now known as \\"Dade registers\\". Works Dade published Proposals for the History and Antiquities of Holderness (1783) with a number of copper-plates, to go to press as soon as he had obtained 240 subscribers. Portions of the work were printed at York in 1784, with engravings, and the proof-sheets of these fragments, with the author's manuscript notes and corrections, are in the British Library. Ill- health and other circumstances prevented the completion of the work. Some time after Dade's death, his manuscripts were given to George Poulson, the historian of Beverley, who rearranged and expanded them, publishing The History and Antiquities of the Seignory of Holderness.The History and Antiquities of the Seignory of Holderness, in the East Riding of the County of York, including the Abbies of Meaux and Swine, with the Priories of Nunkeeling and Burstall; compiled from authentic charters, records, and the unpublished manuscripts of the Rev. William Dade, remaining in the library of Burton Constable, 2 vols. Hull, 1840–1. There was also published A Series of seventeen Views of Churches, Monuments, and other Antiquities, originally engraved for Dade's \\"History of Holderness\\", Hull, 1835. Those plates were originally published in Poulson's Holderness when it was in part publication, but were later replaced for the complete work; the old engravings were sold separately as the Views. Dade also compiled an Alphabetical Register of Marriages, Births, and Burials of considerable Persons in the county of York, in manuscript.

History and architecture =Early history= The estate was first mentioned in the 13th century. For a period it belonged to the Crown until it came into the hands of changing noble families. =Wichfeld family= Jørgen Wichfeld Bertel Wichmand (1677–1732), a wealthy merchant from Nykøbing Falster, acquired Engestofte in 1727. His widow kept the estate after her husband's death. Upo her death in 1751, it passed to their eldest son, Jørgen Wichmand. He and his brother Thomas Frederik Wichmand were ennobled by letters patent with the name Wichfeld on 23 July 1777. Jørgen Wichfeld never married and had no children, He therefore left Engestofte and Ulriksdal to his nephew Henning Wichfeld with an obligation to turn them into a stamhus (family foundation). This happened on 8 November 1799. The two-storey Neoclassical building was built in 1807 and expanded in 1889. The facade of the simply- designed residence is adorned with four iconic pilasters and a triangular pediment. Engestofte depicted by Ferdinand Richardt in 1867 The Englishwomen, Monica Emily Wichfeld (née Massey-Beresford), who married Jørgen Adalbert Wichfeld in 1916, was impressed with the forty-roomed mansion, the surrounding buildings, the long driveway lined with limes and elms, and the terraces leading from the house down to the lake below. The estate cottage and grounds was used in co-operation with Monica Wichfeld during the Danish Resistance in the Second World War to harbour fugitives, to shelter Jewish Families hiding from the Gestapo, to train saboteurs and hide weapons, ammunition and explosives and organize the movement. It was also used as a covert landing ground for British Special Operations Executive deliveries of paratroopers, information, weapons and explosives. =Later history= Jørgen Adalbert Wichfeld died without natural heirs in 1965. The estate was two years later sold to William Erik Berntsen, owner of Frederikssund Iron Foundry and Machine Factory. His son William OleBerntsen inherited the estate in 1995 and pne year later purchased the neighboring estate Søholt. He left both estates to a foundation but the relevant authorities turned down the foundation's application for a dispensation from the Agriculture Act and demanded a sale of the estates. rederik von Lüttichau bought both estates in 2003 but sold Engestofte to Hans Peter Egeskov in 2011.

For women, the sailor became fashionable from the 1870s onwards, in a rather smaller form than its inspiration. One 1870s variation on the style was the Marin anglais bonnet, which added extra trimmings of flowers and ribbons to the sailor hat form. In most decades since the 1870s the sailor, or variations thereof, has been in fashion, or a staple form of headgear.

The Brown's Island Dam Walk, also known as the VEPCO Levee Dam is a structure across the James River in Richmond, Virginia that connects Brown's Island to the James River Parks System on the Manchester side of the river. It was originally constructed as a dam in 1901 by the Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO) (now known as Dominion Power). The original purpose for the tall structure was to divert water into the Haxall Canal where it was received by the 12th Street Power Station until its decommissioning in 1968. The bridge has been renamed the T. Tyler Potterfield Memorial bridge after a senior planner in the Richmond Department of Planning and Development Review who was the project manager for the bridge's redevelopment into a pedestrian bridge. History of dam redevelopment  There have been advocates for the creation of a dam walkway since before 2008, when city officials began to promote development initiatives along the river as part of their master planning process. In 2008, Richmond Planning Commission released a Downtown plan discussing development initiatives along the river. Ralph White, Richmond's naturalist (widely credited with the success of the James River Park system) was quoted as saying and said \\"The highest single priority is the completion of the VEPCO levee,\\" http://floricane.typepad.com/buttermilk/2008/02/the-downtown-11.html By 2011, other public advocates were meeting with City of Richmond Department of Planning and Development and the consultant team from the architecture firm Hargreaves Associates (the firm hired to execute downtown plans) to make the pedestrian walkway a reality.http://rvanews.com/syndicated/richmond- riverfront-vepco-levee-and-haxall-canal-are-key/50616 In November 2012, The City adopted the final version of the Richmond Riverfront Plan Page 25 has the picture. http://www.richmondgov.com/planninganddevelopmentreview/documents/2013-01-22FinalRichmondRiverfrontPlan_R2.pdf that showed several renderings and maps of a redeveloped Dam Walk using a pedestrian bridge feature. In January 2014, the city released additional detailed plans for the walk, which includes the fact that it will be 10 feet wide and have at least four overlooks.http://rvanews.com/news/browns-island- dam-walk/108501 Additional plans released in June 2014 were described by the Richmond Times Dispatch as: \\"The guardrails are expected to be 48 inches high -- six more than required to accommodate the expected bicycle traffic on the bridge. The deck would be placed over the existing piers and structures, but would require new augmented metal framework. The walkway would have lower, dim lights so as to not overpower the view of the river. Plans are underway for unified wayfinding markers and interpretive signage.\\" http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/latest-news/state-to-give-million-for-brown- s-island-dam-walk/article_18b5cd1a-f72c-11e3-8900-001a4bcf6878.html In June 2014, the Virginia Commonwealth Transportation Board allocated $2.5 million to the Dam project, supplementing the $9 million the city has dedicated, to ensure the Dam Walk is fully funded. The Richmond times Dispatch quoted city Planning Director Mark Olinger as saying “This money gives us clear sailing on getting all the Brown’s Island [dam walk] stuff done, which we think will be an outstanding addition to the city.” In May 2014, the Richmond Planning Commission requested that the bridge be named in honor of the late T. Tyler Potterfield, a senior planner with the city who was leading the dam walk project before his sudden death in late April. A resolution passed by the Planning Commission called the project one of the crowning achievements of Potterfield’s career. The bridge was reopened on December 2, 2016 after a $11.3 million renovation that began in October 2015. The wheelchair accessible bridge is open to pedestrians and cyclists 24 hours a day.

Biography Hamer received a business education and was employed by a Dutch export company. In 1937 the company sent him to Venezuela; and in 1938 to Guatemala, where he joined World War II. In 1942 he returned to Germany and served in the army during the Russian campaign. In 1948, at the end of the war, he returned to Guatemala and established himself in El Salvador, where he created a company to import and distribute machinery and equipment. His interest in families of orchids began in 1960 when he saw a specimen of Miltonia, of which he made a beautiful illustration. He then took to the road and began to take photographs, make illustrations, and write descriptions. But he noticed the lack of literature on orchids. In 1925 there were 63 species in 28 genera, described by Standley and S. Calderón, and nothing more. So Hamer, who had already published a number of articles about orchids in his country, prepared The Orchids of El Salvador, which was published in two volumes in 1974 by the Ministry of Education of El Salvador; 279 descriptions and illustrations spp. in 67 genera. Hamer, with no scientific training in natural sciences, received invaluable help from Leslie A. Garay, his mentor and friend. At the beginning the Salvadoran Civil War, Hamer left El Salvador and moved to Florida, where he worked as a scientist at the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens. In 1981 he published the third volume of The Orchids of El Salvador, with 362 spp. 93 Gros. Salvadoran orchids. The Missouri Botanical Garden planned to publish the Flora of Nicaragua, with the University of Managua. Hamer asked to be responsible for the study of the family Orchidaceae. Hamer visited the herbaria of Kew and the Field Museum of Chicago by Pan-American Agricultural School of Honduras, Managua, the University of Michigan. In 1982 he published the 7th installment of the 1st series of Icones Plantarum Tropicarum, edited by Dodson, with the first 100 descriptions and illustrations of the orchids of Nicaragua. Hamer published 500 additional plates for Icones. Between 1988 and 1990 they were published in Selbyana Hamer (Vols. 10 and 11) the Orchids of Central America - an Illustrated Field Guide, with all its illustrations of the spp. region, but no descriptions. Then the Flora of Nicaragua was published by the Missouri Botanical Garden in 2001, and Hamer, 89 years old, was the author of Chapter Orchidaceae, describing 587 species in 144 genera. He was married to Hedwig Pfister for 42 years, to whom he dedicated one of the species he discovered: Maxillaria hedwigae (Hamer & Dodson). He had three children, one of whom died in El Salvador in 2003. That tragedy clouded the last months of his life, and he died in Sarasota, Florida, on January 13, 2004.

It outcrops along the eastern margin of the Blue Ridge province in the southeastern United States and can be found in outcrops in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. It is also can be found in the subsurface of Kentucky, Ohio, and West Virginia. The Shady is predominantly composed of dolostone and limestone with lesser amounts of mudrock. It contains fossils of trilobites, archaeocyathids, algae, brachiopods, and echinoderms, along with the enigmatic fossil Salterella. The Shady Dolomite was first described by Arthur Keith in 1903Keith, Arthur, (1903) Description of the Cranberry quadrangle [North Carolina-Tennessee]: U. S. Geological Survey Geology Atlas, Folio 90. and was named for exposures in the Shady Valley of Johnson County in the state of Tennessee. Near Austinville, Virginia, the Shady hosts ore deposits that have been mined extensively for lead and zinc ore. Depositional Environment The Shady Dolomite was deposited on the margin of the paleocontinent of Laurentia. The rocks that make up the Shady represent sediment deposition on and around an ancient carbonate platform. The initial carbonate sedimentation of the Shady began on the southern shelf of Laurentia and formed on top of the siliciclastic sequence that now make up the rocks of the Chilhowee Group. These carbonate sediments formed a carbonate ramp that over time developed into a rimmed carbonate shelf. Economic Importance =Austinville-Ivanhoe District= The alt= Lead and zinc ore bodies of the Austinville-Ivanhoe District occur in the Shady Dolomite in the vicinity of Austinville, Virginia. They are classified as Mississippi Valley Type deposits. The main ore minerals include sphalerite, galena, and hemimorphite. Formation of the ore deposits likely occurred when warm and saline groundwater moved through the Shady in the Late Paleozoic during the Alleghanian orogeny. Mining of the deposit began in 1756 both on the surface and underground. Over 21,000 tons of lead were mined from the district through the1860s. During the American Civil War, lead from these mines was used to make ammunition for the Confederate States of America. Following the war, the Bertha Mineral Company took over the mining operations mined zinc from oxidized ores of hemimorphite. The New Jersey Zinc Company acquired the site in 1902 and mined both lead and zinc through 1981. Since the 1980s, dolostone been quarried and taken from existing tailings piles on the site for agricultural use.

Geology and Oil Possibilities of the Northern Part of Overton County, Tenn., and of Adjoining Parts of Clay, Pickett and Fentress Counties, pp. 25-26 (Williams Printing 1919). It can be found in outcrops along Pine Mountain and Cumberland Mountain in Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee, where it is the uppermost Mississippian-age formation. The name has also been applied to similar Mississippian strata in the Cumberland Escarpment of eastern Kentucky, though the rocks in that area were later renamed to the Paragon Formation.Ettensohn, Frank et al. \\"Slade and Paragon Formations — New Stratigraphic Nomenclature for Mississippian Rocks Along the Cumberland Escarpment in Kentucky\\", U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 1605-B, p. 4 (1984). According to general usage among geologists, the Pennington Formation corresponds to shales, sandstones, and thin limestone beds located above the highest massive limestone bed of the Newman Formation. Paleosols have also been preserved in a Pennington outcrop at Pound Gap, recording a series of fluctuations in climate between dry and wet conditions. The Pennington Formation has been inferred to represent a coastal environment transitioning between a Mississippian marine basin and Pennsylvanian coal swamps. Some parts of the Pennington Formation preserve fossils, including conodonts which are useful for biostratigraphic dating. Conodont dating indicates that the Pennington Formation formed near the end of the Mississippian subperiod of the Carboniferous period. The Pennington Formation is considered equivalent to the Hinton, Princeton, and Bluestone formations of the Mauch Chunk Group, which is exposed further north in West Virginia.

Early life Some sources say he was the third son of the Reverend Joseph Fuller, a Baptist minister of Harwell in Berkshire and his wife Martha Hanson. More likely he was the third surviving son of Thomas Fuller, a landowner at FitzHarris outside Abingdon, then in Berkshire, and his wife Hester Alder. This makes him the brother of the banker William Fuller and of Martha Fuller (1717-1805) who married the stationer George Flower (1715-1778), becoming the mother of Benjamin Flower and Richard Flower as well as mother-in-law of the Reverend John Clayton. Career With Frazer Honywood in 1737 he became founding partner of a private bank in Lombard Street, City of London, known initially as Atkins, Honeywood & Fuller. The firm moved to Birchin Lane about 1754 and to Cornhill about 1774. In 1746 it became Honeywood & Fuller and went through several name changes until at his death it was Richard Fuller, Sons & Vaughan. By 1891, when it was taken over, it was Fuller, Banbury, Nix & Co and has since become part of the Royal Bank of Scotland. He inherited FitzHarris from his father and, as a Berkshire landowner, was chosen High Sheriff of Berkshire in 1754. Entering politics, at a by-election in 1764 he was elected unopposed as a Member of Parliament for Steyning in Sussex, filling the vacancy caused by Honywood's death. Changing seats, at the 1768 general election he was returned unopposed for Stockbridge in Hampshire and held that seat until the 1774 general election. Family About 1755 he married Susanna Barnard (1735-1789) and together they had nine children. In 1768 he bought the estate called The Rookery at Westcott in Surrey, previously the home of the economist Thomas Robert Malthus, and he and his wife lived there for the rest of their lives. In 1778, jointly with his brother William, he was executor of the will of his brother-in-law George Flower.The National Archives; Kew, England; Prerogative Court of Canterbury and Related Probate Jurisdictions: Will Registers; Class: PROB 11; Piece:1039 Hay Quire 47-92, p103 He died on 2 January 1782 and his will of 11 October 1781 was proved on 29 January 1782.The National Archives; Kew, England; Prerogative Court of Canterbury and Related Probate Jurisdictions: Will Registers; Class: PROB 11; Piece:1086 Gostling Quire 1-48 No 376 His memorial in the Independent Chapel at Dorking reads : ::« To the Memory of Richard Fuller Esq of the Rookery in this County who departed this life 2 January 1782 aged sixty nine years » Susanna survived him, dying on 11 April 1789.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background =Social media= Social media is the social interaction among people in which they create, share or exchange information and ideas in virtual communities and networks. Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein define social media as \\"a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content.\\" Furthermore, social media depend on mobile and web-based technologies to create highly interactive platforms through which individuals and communities share, co-create, discuss, and modify user-generated content. They introduce substantial and pervasive changes to communication between organizations, communities, and individuals. Diagram depicting the many different types of social media Social media differ from traditional or industrial media in many ways, including quality, reach, frequency, usability, immediacy, and permanence. =Virtual Social Media Working Group= First responders have increasingly used social media in emergency response and recovery operations. Social media tools are used to connect with citizens after a disaster and share information.First Responder Communities of Practice. Virtual Social Media Working Group Community Engagement Guidance and Best Practices [FINAL] (U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate). 2012-09-18 (Retrieved 2014-02-24) The Virtual Social Media Working group (VSMWG) is an online platform that gives advice to first responders on how to safely and effectively use social media in emergency response operations. The working group is made up of subject matter experts from across the U.S. It was created by DHS in December 2010 and gives first responders guidance and best practices regarding the use of social media during emergencies. The DHS S&T; and the VSMWG work with local and state governments, academics and nonprofits.Tinder, Paul. “Social media plays major role in emergency response”. BioPrepWatch. 2014-02-21 (Retrieved 2014-02-24) Meetings of the VSMWG are chaired by the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Science and Technology. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Social Media Working Group Act of 2014 would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the United States Secretary of Homeland Security to establish within the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) a social media working group (the Group) to provide guidance and best practices to the emergency preparedness and response community on the use of social media technologies before, during, and after a terrorist attack. The bill would require the Group to submit an annual report that includes: (1) a review of current and emerging social media technologies being used to support preparedness and response activities related to terrorist attacks, of best practices and lessons learned on the use of social media during the response to terrorist attacks that occurred during the period covered by the report, and of available training for government officials on the use of social media in response to a terrorist attack; (2) recommendations to improve DHS's use of social media and to improve information sharing among DHS and its components and among state and local governments; and (3) a summary of coordination efforts with the private sector to discuss and resolve legal, operational, technical, privacy, and security concerns. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on June 11, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4263 would direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a working group to provide guidance and best practices on the use of social media technologies, specifically during a terrorist attack or other emergency. The group would prepare guidance for the emergency preparedness and response community. The bill would define the membership of the working group, which would include more than 20 experts from federal, state, local, and tribal governments along with nongovernmental organizations. The working group would be exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act and would be authorized to hold virtual meetings to fulfill the requirement to meet twice a year. The working group would be required to submit an annual report on emerging trends and best practices for emergency response through social media. Based on the cost of similar activities carried out under the DHS Acquisition and Accountability Efficiency Act and the Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advancement Act of 2013, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the new DHS responsibilities and the annual report required by H.R. 4263 would cost a total of less than $500,000 annually, assuming the availability of appropriated funds. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay- as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 4263 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Social Media Working Group Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 14, 2014 by Rep. Susan W. Brooks (R, IN-5). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Homeland Security and the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. On June 19, 2014, it was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-480. On July 8, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 369 to pass the bill 375-19. Debate and discussion Nate Elliott, a social media expert at Forrester Research, explains that \\"the hope is when government or another authority tweets something, people will share it for them,\\" but that this often doesn't happen. This problem, that \\"messages wash away very quickly,\\" is the reason that the federal government is trying to formulate a better social media strategy. Rep. Steven Palazzo (R-MS), who co-sponsored the bill, stated that \\"social media has played a crucial role in emergency preparedness and response in Mississippi, including during disasters like Hurricane Isaac and the tornadoes that hit the Hattiesburg area a little over a year ago.\\" He said that their goal with the bill was to \\"build upon existing public-private partnerships and use social media in a more strategic way in order to help save lives and property.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4263 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4263 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4263 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4263 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4263 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 4263 *House Report 113-480 on H.R. 4263 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Social media ","title":"Social Media Working Group Act of 2014"},{"id":"43143525","text":"Impatiens niamniamensis, common name Congo cockatoo, parrot impatiens or simply parrot plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Balsaminaceae.

Features The central tower has 15 storeys with 120 units, and surrounded by 12 four-storey low-rise units with 288 units. The scheme and layout of this public housing project was prepared by Mr David A. Aitken and Mr E. B. Carlos. It shares many features in common with the Unité d’habitation by Le Corbusier. It has a lively roof landscape that includes a giant asymmetrical overhanging dish that provides shade. Individual residential units are open to both the north and south sides and therefore benefit from cross breezes. Even the wayfinding system utilizes the Charette font that Le Corbusier favored.

Aereo, Inc., 573 U.S. 431 (2014), was a United States Supreme Court case. The Court ruled that the service provided by Aereo, allowing subscribers to view live and time-shifted streams of over-the- air television on Internet-connected devices, violated copyright laws.  Background  Cable companies are required by the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act to negotiate for retransmission consent, usually paying broadcasters for the right to carry their signals. Broadcasters argued that Aereo was a threat both to their business model, by undermining the cable retransmission fees and the size of their audience. Because the fees cable companies pay for broadcast content can comprise up to 10% of a broadcaster's revenue, broadcasters object to Aereo's re-distribution of this content without paying any fees. Broadcasters have also identified Aereo as part of the cord-cutting trend among television audiences that poses a threat to broadcasters' advertising revenue. In somewhat similar cases, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted an injunction against Aereo's rival FilmOn, a similar service. However, the district court's injunction is only legally binding in its jurisdiction (including the West Coast of the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii) and is currently being appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Other competitors have been blocked from providing service in Los Angeles and Seattle by similar injunctions. = Federal court = On March 1, 2012, two weeks before Aereo's initial launch in New York City, Aereo was sued for copyright infringement by a consortium of major broadcasters, including CBS Corporation's CBS, Comcast's NBC, Disney's ABC and 21st Century Fox's Fox. The broadcasters argued that Aereo infringed their copyrighted material because Aereo's streams constituted public performances. They sought a preliminary injunction against the company. On July 11, Federal Judge Alison Nathan denied this injunction, citing as precedent the 2008 Cablevision case, which established the legality of cloud-based streaming and DVR services. In response to the decision, Aereo Founder and CEO Chet Kanojia said \\"Today's decision shows that when you are on the right side of the law, you can stand up, fight the Goliath and win.\\" In a subsequent interview with CNET, Kanojia asserted, \\"With one step, we changed the entire TV industry. The television industry and its evolution are now starting towards the Internet and that was stopped until Aereo came along...And I think as consumers start migrating to the Internet, new programming and new content are going to come in.\\" = Second Circuit appeal = The plaintiffs appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Several other players in the industry, such as cable provider Cablevision, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the Consumer Electronics Association filed amicus briefs. On April 1, 2013, the federal appeals court upheld the lower court's ruling, finding that Aereo's streams to subscribers were not \\"public performances\\", and thus did not constitute copyright infringement. The appeals court also affirmed the earlier district court decision that denied the broadcasters a preliminary injunction against Aereo. In response, News Corporation's Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey stated that the company is contemplating taking Fox off the air and converting it to a cable-only channel: \\"We need to be able to be fairly compensated for our content ... we can't sit idly by and let an entity steal our signal. We will move to a subscription model if that's our only recourse.\\" Univision and CBS have also stated that they may also follow and convert to cable-only. = Supreme Court = In October 2013, the broadcasters filed a petition to the United States Supreme Court to take up the issue. On January 10, 2014, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.Supreme Court to Hear Aereo Case, Variety, January 10, 2014. In February 2014, in advance of the case being taken up by the Supreme Court, a judge in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals granted a preliminary injunction against Aereo, blocking the service within the 10th district, which includes Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, Wyoming and Yellowstone National Park. On November 17, 2013, the National Football League and Major League Baseball filed a joint amicus brief to the Supreme Court, warning that sports programming would likely migrate from broadcast to cable television; and that Aereo may put the U.S. in violation of several international treaties that prohibit the retransmission of broadcast signals over the Internet without their copyright holder's consent. The United States Department of Justice and United States Copyright Office also filed a joint brief in March 2014, saying that \\"[Aereo's] system is clearly infringing\\". The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on April 22, 2014.Supreme Court to hear Aereo vs. big media case April 22, VentureBeat, February 11, 2014.  Opinion of the Court  The Court decided in favor of the broadcasters on June 25 in a 6-3 decision and remanded the case. The Court's decision describes Aereo as not being \\"simply an equipment provider,\\" with an \\"overwhelming likeness to cable companies\\" that \\"performs petitioners' works 'publicly.'\\" Further, the Court adds that its decision should not discourage the emergence or use of different kinds of technologies.. Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito dissented. Writing for the dissenting minority, Scalia quoted from Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., noting that the broadcasters made similar predictions regarding the VCR. Like the final paragraph in that previous ruling, he stated that the Court should be in no position to make judgements on novel technologies, and it is instead Congress's job to determine if the copyright laws should be modified to address these issues.American Broadcasting Cos., Inc. v. Aereo, Inc., 573 U. S., (Scalia, dissenting slip op., at 12-13) The dissent continues and criticizes the majority's opinion calling it poorly reasoned because it relies on a \\"guilt by resemblance\\" standard, which states Aereo is performing because it \\"looks-like-cable-TV.\\"  Subsequent Development  Even though the United States Supreme Court held Aereo was \\"performing\\" the broadcasters copyrighted material because Aereo \\"looks-like- cable-TV\\" and was similar to community antenna television (CATV) systems, it was later held Aereo could not continue its service under a compulsory license, the way a cable provider would. On November 21, 2014, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. It was later purchased by DVR company TiVo for $1 million in March 2015.

Unveiled on June 25, 2014 at the Google I/O 2014 conference, it became available through official over-the-air (OTA) updates on November 12, 2014, for select devices that run distributions of Android serviced by Google (such as Nexus and Google Play edition devices). Its source code was made available on November 3, 2014. It is the fifth major update and the twelfth version of Android. One of the most prominent changes in the Lollipop release is a redesigned user interface built around a design language known as Material Design, which was made to retain a paper-like feel to the interface. Other changes include improvements to the notifications, which can be accessed from the lockscreen and displayed within applications as top-of-the-screen banners. Google also made internal changes to the platform, with the Android Runtime (ART) officially replacing Dalvik for improved application performance, and with changes intended to improve and optimize battery usage. Android Lollipop was succeeded by Android Marshmallow, which was released in October 2015. , 1.21% of Android devices run Lollipop 5.0 (API 21), and 4.15% run Lollipop 5.1 (API 22), with a combined 5.36% of usage share. On tablets, Lollipop 5.1 (API 22) is however the single most popular version at 16.22%, followed closely by KitKat 4.4.  Development  The release was internally codenamed \\"Lemon Meringue Pie\\". Android 5.0 was first unveiled under the codename \\"Android L\\" on June 25, 2014 during a keynote presentation at the Google I/O developers' conference. Alongside Lollipop, the presentation focused on a number of new Android- oriented platforms and technologies, including Android TV, in-car platform Android Auto, wearable computing platform Android Wear, and health tracking platform Google Fit. Part of the presentation was dedicated to a new cross- platform design language referred to as \\"material design\\". Expanding upon the \\"card\\" motifs first seen in Google Now, it is a design with increased use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows. Designer Matías Duarte explained that \\"unlike real paper, our digital material can expand and reform intelligently. Material has physical surfaces and edges. Seams and shadows provide meaning about what you can touch.\\" The material design language would not only be used on Android, but across Google's suite of web software as well, providing a consistent experience across all platforms.  Features  Android 5.0 introduces a refreshed notification system. Individual notifications are now displayed on cards to adhere to the material design language, and batches of notifications can be grouped by the app that produced them. Notifications are now displayed on the lock screen as cards, and \\"heads up\\" notifications can also be displayed as large banners across the top of the screen, along with their respective action buttons. A do-not-disturb feature is also added for notifications. The recent apps menu was redesigned to use a three-dimensional stack of cards to represent open apps. Individual apps can also display multiple cards in the recents menu, such as for a web browser's open tabs. Lollipop also contains major new platform features for developers, with over 5,000 new APIs added for use by applications. For example, there is the possibility to save photos in a raw image format. Additionally, the Dalvik virtual machine was officially replaced by Android Runtime (ART), which is a new runtime environment that was introduced as a technology preview in KitKat. ART is a cross-platform runtime which supports the x86, ARM, and MIPS architectures in both 32-bit and 64-bit environments. Unlike Dalvik, which uses just-in-time compilation (JIT), ART compiles apps upon installation, which are then run exclusively from the compiled version from then on. This technique removes the processing overhead associated with the JIT process, improving system performance. Lollipop also aimed to improve battery consumption through a series of optimizations known as \\"Project Volta\\". Among its changes are a new battery saver mode, job-scheduling APIs which can restrict certain tasks to only occur over Wi-Fi, and batching of tasks to reduce the overall amount of time that internal radios are active on. The new developer tool called \\"Battery Historian\\" can be used for tracking battery consumption by apps while in use. The Android Extension Pack APIs also provide graphics functions such as new shaders, aiming to provide PC-level graphics for 3D games on Android devices. A number of system-level, enterprise-oriented features were also introduced under the banner \\"Android for Work\\". The Samsung Knox security framework was initially planned to be used as a foundation for \\"Android for Work\\", but instead Google opted to use its own technology for segregating personal and work-oriented data on a device, along with the accompanying APIs for managing the environment. With the \\"Smart Lock\\" feature, devices can also be configured so users do not have to perform device unlocking with a PIN or pattern when being on a trusted location, or in proximity of a designated Bluetooth device or NFC tag. Lollipop was, additionally, to have device encryption enabled by default on all capable devices; however, due to performance issues, this change was held over to its successor, Android Marshmallow.  Release  A developer preview of Android L, build LPV79, was released for the Nexus 5 and 2013 Nexus 7 on June 26, 2014 in the form of flashable images. Source code for GPL-licensed components of the developer preview was released via Android Open Source Project (AOSP) in July 2014. A second developer preview build, LPV81C, was released on August 7, 2014, alongside the beta version of the Google Fit platform and SDK. As with the previous build, the second developer preview build is available only for the Nexus 5 and 2013 Nexus 7. On October 15, 2014, Google officially announced that Android L would be known as Android 5.0 \\"Lollipop\\". The company also unveiled launch devices for Android5.0including Motorola's Nexus 6 and HTC's Nexus 9for release on November 3, 2014. Google stated that Nexus (including the Nexus 4, 5, 7, and 10) and Google Play edition devices would receive updates to Lollipop \\"in the coming weeks\\"; one more developer preview build for Nexus devices and the new SDK revision for application developers would be released on October 17, 2014. Update schedules for third-party Android devices may vary by manufacturer. The full source code of Android5.0 was pushed to AOSP on November 3, 2014, allowing developers and OEMs to begin producing their own builds of the operating system. On December 2, 2014, factory images for Nexus smartphones and tablets were updated to the 5.0.1 version, which introduces a few bug fixes, and a serious bug that affected Nexus 4 devices and prevented the audio from working during phone calls. A device-specific Lollipop 5.0.2 (LRX22G) version was released for the first-generation Nexus 7 on December 19, 2014. Android5.1, an updated version of Lollipop, was unveiled in February 2015 as part of the Indonesian launch of Android One, and is preloaded on Android One devices sold in Indonesia and the Philippines. Google officially announced 5.1 by releasing updates for existing devices on March 9, 2015. In 2015, Amazon.com forked Lollipop to produce Fire OS 5 \\"Bellini\\" for Amazon's Fire HD-series devices.

It is known especially for First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev's \\"Secret Speech\\", which denounced the personality cult and dictatorship of Joseph Stalin. Delegates at this Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were given no advance warning of what to expect. Indeed, proceedings were opened by First Secretary Khruschev's call for all to stand in memory of the Communist leaders who had died since the previous Congress, in which he mentioned Stalin in the same breath as Klement Gottwald. Hints of a new direction only came out gradually over the next ten days, which had the effect of leaving those present highly perplexed. The Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut died in Moscow shortly after attending the 20th Congress. The congress elected the 20th Central Committee.  Secret speech  On 25 February, the very last day of the Congress, it was announced that an unscheduled session had been called for the Soviet delegates. First Secretary Khrushchev's morning speech began with vague references to the harmful consequences of elevating a single individual so high that he took on the \\"supernatural characteristics akin to those of a god.\\" Khrushchev went on to say that such a mistake had been made about Stalin. He himself had been guilty of what was, in essence, a distortion of the basic principles of Marxism- Leninism. The attention of the audience was then drawn to Lenin's Testament, copies of which had been distributed, criticising Stalin's \\"rudeness\\". Further accusations, and hints of accusations, followed, including the suggestion that the murder of Sergey Kirov in 1934, the event that sparked the Great Terror, could be included in the list of Stalin's crimes. While denouncing Stalin, Khrushchev carefully praised the Communist Party, which had the strength to withstand all the negative effects of imaginary crimes and false accusations. The Party, in other words, had been a victim of Stalin, not an accessory to his crimes. He finished by calling on the Party to eradicate the cult of personality and return to \\"the revolutionary fight for the transformation of society.\\" The speech shocked delegates to the Congress, as it flew in the face of years of Soviet propaganda, which had claimed that Stalin was a wise, peaceful, and fair leader. After long deliberations, in a month the speech was reported to the general public, but the full text was published only in 1989. Not everyone was ready to accept Khrushchev's new line. Communist Albanian leader Enver Hoxha, for instance, strongly condemned Khrushchev as \\"revisionist\\" and severed diplomatic relations.Reject the Revisionist Theses of the XX Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Anti- Marxist Stand of Krushchev's Group! Uphold Marxism-Leninism! The speech was also seen as a catalyst for 1956 uprisings in Poland and Hungary, and was seen as a \\"major stimulus\\" to the Sino–Soviet split.

Where Khrushchev pursued an interpretation that differed from his predecessor Joseph Stalin, the anti-revisionists within the international communist movement remained dedicated to Stalin's ideological legacy and criticized the Soviet Union under Khrushchev and his successors as state capitalist and social imperialist due to its hopes of achieving peace with the United States. The term Stalinism is also used to describe these positions, but it is often not used by its supporters who opine that Stalin simply synthesized and practiced orthodox Marxism and Leninism. Because different political trends trace the historical roots of revisionism to different eras and leaders, there is significant disagreement today as to what constitutes anti-revisionism. As a result, modern groups which describe themselves as anti-revisionist fall into several categories. Some uphold the works of Stalin and Mao Zedong and some the works of Stalin while rejecting Mao and universally tend to oppose Trotskyism. Others reject both Stalin and Mao, tracing their ideological roots back to Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. In addition, other groups uphold various less-well-known historical leaders such as Enver Hoxha, who also broke with Mao during the Sino-Albanian split.  Overview  Marxism–Leninism is a politico-economic theory developed by Joseph Stalin in the 1920s. According to its proponents, it is a synthesis of the theories of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Lenin while critics term it Stalinism. It was Stalin who succinctly defined that \\"Leninism is the Marxism of the era of imperialism and the proletarian revolution\\" in his famous pamphlet titled Foundations of Leninism, and this tenet forms the basis of Marxism–Leninism. It builds on Marx's theory that capitalism divides society into two classes, namely the bourgeoisie or property-owning class and the proletariat or labouring class. It claims that within the international proletariat emerges a section of labour aristocracy from the powerful imperialist nations, which is granted some economic and political power over the superexploited proletariat of the colonial and neo-colonial countries. Marxists–Leninists advocate the most class conscious members of the proletariat form vanguard parties based around the principle of democratic centralism which will lead revolutionary movements towards the creation of single-party states which will gradually progress to socialism and finally global communism. Anti-revisionism is a position within Marxism–Leninism based on its interpretation by Stalin, who supported the dictatorship of the proletariat, drastic and fast-paced economic transformation in the short-term, and violent confrontation with capitalist powers. The emergence of the Khrushchevist interpretation lead to a reaction from pro-Stalin Marxist–Leninists, who formed the anti-revisionist movement and opposed Khruscevists de-Stalinization policies. Anti-revisionists rejected the Soviet Union's leadership of the Marxist–Leninist movement, believing it had become state capitalist and social imperialist. Despite this, the lines between the two camps in Marxism–Leninism were often blurry. The Korean Workers' Party was pro-Soviet, but it also defended Stalin's legacy and was engaged in violent struggle against the capitalist South Korea and its American backers. Due to this, the global anti-revisionist movement tended to support it despite its ideological departure from Marxism–Leninism. The Communist Party of Cuba and the Communist Party of Vietnam also received critical support from many anti-revisionists despite being pro-Soviet due to their violent struggles against the United States. The Cuban communists also provided material support to the American anti-revisionist Black Panther Party. The Chinese Communist Party is officially anti-revisionist. However, most anti-revisionists followed the example of the Albanian Labour Party in denouncing it as revisionist following the beginning of market-based and pro- American reforms in late 1970s. The term Dengism is often used to describe this perceived revisionist tendency in Marxism–Leninism despite official claims that it is an adaptation of Marxism–Leninism to contemporary Chinese material conditions rather than a revision. Despite agreeing that he had a revisionist turn later in his life, most contemporary anti-revisionists hold particular interest in the theories of Chinese leader Mao Zedong, who claimed that socialist movements in the neo-colonial world could temporarily ally with the nationalist movements of the local petite bourgeoisie and that the implementation of a mass line policy will prevent a vanguard from becoming revisionist. Others believe in a separate ideology known as Marxism–Leninism–Maoism which views the early theories of Mao as a higher stage of Leninist ideology, just like Leninism is considered by its proponents to be a higher stage of Marxism. Among both anti-revisionist Marxist–Leninists with a tendency towards Mao's theories and Marxist–Leninist–Maoists, there exists a Maoist Third Worldist tendency which claims the labour aristocracy has no immediate revolutionary potential and may also claim it experiences no exploitation at all.  History  Αnti-revisionist caricature from 1976 by Albanian cartoonist Zef Bumçi depicting Nikita Khrushchev as a servant of the bourgeoisie Self-proclaimed anti-revisionists firmly oppose the reforms initiated in Marxist–Leninist countries by leaders like Nikita Khrushchev in the Soviet Union and Deng Xiaoping in China. They generally refer to such reforms and states as state capitalist and social imperialist. They also reject Trotskyism and its permanent revolution as hypocritical by arguing that Leon Trotsky had at one time thought it acceptable that socialism could work in a single country as long as that country was industrialized, but that Trotsky had considered Russia too backward to achieve such industrialization which is what it later in fact did achieve, mostly through his archenemy Joseph Stalin's five-year plans. In their own right, anti-revisionists also acknowledge that the Soviet Union contained a new class or red bourgeoisie, but they generally place the blame for the formation of that class on Khrushchev and his successors and not on Stalin. In anti-revisionist circles, there is very little talk of class conflict in the Soviet Union before 1956, except when talking about specific contexts such as the Russian Civil War (when some agents of the former feudal ruling class tried to retake state power from the Bolsheviks) and World War II (fought principally between communists and fascists, representing the interests of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, respectively). During the Sino-Soviet split, the governments of the People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong and the People's Republic of Albania under Enver Hoxha proclaimed themselves to be taking an anti- revisionist line and denounced Khrushchev's policies in the Soviet Union. In the United States, those who supported China or Albania at the time were expelled from the Communist Party USA under orders from Moscow and formed the Progressive Labor Movement and other new communist movement parties in 1961. A short time later, anti-revisionist groups were further divided by the Sino- Albanian split, with those following Albania being loosely described as Hoxhaist. On the whole, the original 1960s-era anti-revisionists tended to take a careful, selective approach to the Cuban Revolution and the way it soon aligned itself with Soviet ideas and practice, criticizing the latter action while simultaneously acknowledging some aspects of Cuban self-described socialism as genuinely revolutionary—in particular the writing and thinking of Che Guevara. Anti-revisionists also took a hopeful approach towards the Vietnamese communists, expressing confidence that they too were genuinely revolutionary-communist in their aspirations and supported their struggle against the United States in the Vietnam War—a side which got a lot of support from the Soviet Union, anti-revisionists' state capitalist enemy. Several present-day communist parties worldwide still see themselves as explicitly anti-revisionist, but not every such party adhering to elements of anti- revisionism necessarily adopts the label anti-revisionist. Many such organizations may call themselves Maoist, Marxist–Leninist, or simply revolutionary communist. The Workers Party of Korea still claims an anti- revisionist political line, but the communist movement as a whole and anti- revisionists from the Maoist and Hoxhaist camps in particular tend to insist North Korea is a revisionist state. However, many if not most Hoxhaists and Maoists are critically supportive of North Korea on grounds of anti- imperialism. Anti-revisionists aligned with Hoxha and the line of the Party of Labour of Albania of labor argue that Mao Zedong Thought is itself a form of revisionism. Hoxhaists insist that Mao's Three Worlds Theory contradicted Marxism–Leninism and existed only to justify his alliance with the United States that began in the early 1970s and his meeting with President Richard Nixon during the Sino-Soviet split that Hoxha and the Hoxhaists opposed. Hoxhaists also argue that the theory of New Democracy and people's war were revisionist and anti-scientific. The Hoxhaist camp came into existence during the Sino-Albanian split.

A dark humour story, Snicket returns to continue the tale of his time in Stain'd-by-the-Sea, accompanied by his chaperone, S. Theodora Markson. Plot S. Theodora Markson and Lemony Snicket are called to the Knight household: housemaids Zada and Zora are worried about the disappearance of Cleo Knight. Cleo's parents are permanently dazed and confused, which Lemony realizes is because their doctor is injecting them with laudanum. In Cleo's room, Lemony finds a failed attempt at making invisible ink. On the journey back to the Lost Arms, Lemony orders Theodora to stop the car, spotting a Dilemma (the car Cleo Knight owned). It had a flat tire with a hypodermic needle stuck into it. Lemony begins to investigate witnesses. Polly Partial claims she saw Cleo yesterday, purchasing her favorite breakfast, and then leaving in the Bellerophon taxi to run away to join the circus. Jake Hix says that Cleo had visited Hungry's and left in her Dilemma at the same time. However, Lemony proves Partial's testimony is unreliable due to her bad eyesight. Moxie and Lemony walk to the library to investigate the case; they research invisible ink and Colonel Colophon, a war hero of Stain'd by the Sea who had a clinic built for him in the town. Lemony has to abandon Moxie when he sees a woman returning library books that were in Hangfire's possession. Following the woman, he ends up finding Ellington Feint in an abandoned aquarium; she has been posing as Cleo Knight and pretending to work on invisible ink for Hangfire. Lemony causes a distraction and they both escape, although Ellington is arrested. Lemony and his friends travel to Colophon Clinic. Lemony meets a man claiming to be Colonel Colophon; when Lemony realizes it is Hangfire, the man jumps out of the window and escapes. Lemony and Jake find Cleo Knight in a basement; Dr. Flammarion is arrested by the Mitchums, along with the woman who Lemony followed earlier. Lemony soon learns that Moxie had been stabbed with a knife by the woman, Cleo starts mixing medicine for her wound. In the final chapter, Lemony talks to a young Captain Widdershins and learns that Young Kit had been arrested (Widdershins appeared in The Grim Grotto as an adult).

On January 11, 2011, Gonzalo Gutiérrez was elected by acclamation Vice president of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, ECOSOC, on behalf of the group of Latin American and Caribbean countries. On May 20, 2011, Peru was elected, with the support of 136 countries, a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council for the period 2011–2014 in recognition of Peru's democratic foreign policy and promotion of human rights either nationally and abroad through diplomatic missions, particularly representations in New York and Geneva. At the end of June 2011, Gonzalo Gutiérrez, together with Ecuadorian, Diego Morejón, as permanent representatives of their respective governments to the UN, registered the maritime boundary agreement signed between Peru and Ecuador on May 2, 2011. Gutierrez was part of the negotiating team of the Peru-United States Free Trade Agreement. In the Diplomatic Academy of Peru he was Professor of International Economic Organizations and International Politics.

From the beginning of the second government of Alan García, on July 28, 2006, Ambassador Gutierrez was the Deputy Minister and General Secretary of Foreign Affairs, a position he held until April 20, 2009. He was replaced in the aforementioned function by Ambassador Néstor Popolizio Bardales. In early 2007, the Peruvian government gave him the delicate mission of traveling to Gaza to free Jaime Rázuri, a kidnapped Peruvian photographer. Once he achieved the goal that the government had set in human rights and with the active collaboration of friendly governments, Gonzalo Gutiérrez Reinel returned to Peru accompanied by the aforementioned photographer. This was the first time in Peruvian history that the government entrusts a task of this nature to an official of such a high level, since by law, the position then held by Gonzalo Gutierrez as Deputy Minister and General Secretary of Foreign Affairs was that of the country's first public official. During 2008 he served as Chairman of the Meeting of Senior Officials (SOM) of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) As a diplomatic official, Gonzalo Gutiérrez has served in the Representation of Peru to the United Nations in New York, in the Embassy of Peru to the United States of America, in the Permanent Representation to International Organizations based in Geneva and in the Embassy of the Peru in Chile.

Cricket ball campaign against Sri Lanka at the Cricket World Cup 2007 Amnesty launched its \\"Sri Lanka, Play by the Rules\\" campaign, timed to coincide with the 2007 cricket World Cup held in the Caribbean islands, to focus on Sri Lanka's alleged human rights violations. The Sri Lankan government protested to the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Amnesty, saying the timing might undermine the morale of the Sri Lanka cricket team, which was playing in round Super 8 of the tournament. The Sri Lankan government also accused Amnesty of indirectly supporting the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka said they were assured by the ICC that all steps would be taken to prevent Amnesty from carrying out any campaign within the grounds targeting Sri Lanka or its players; however, the ICC later said it was determined to focus on the World Cup and nothing else. Amnesty stressed that the campaign was not aimed at the Sri Lanka cricket team. According to an Amnesty spokesman, \\"The campaign called on both parties as well as other militant groups in Sri Lanka to take steps to prevent civilians caught between as violence intensifies.\\" \\"The signed balls will be delivered to the government of Sri Lanka as well as the LTTE\\", Amnesty said in a statement. The Sunday Island, a prominent national newspaper in Sri Lanka, criticised Amnesty's response: > ...when the campaign is directed at 'Sri Lanka', the focus is clearly on the > country and its legitimate government rather than on the terrorists. When > such a campaign is conducted during a sporting event in which the targeted > country is also participating, it constitutes a form of punishment, whereby > the spectators are told that the participant country is doing something bad. > When that happens, they may adopt a wholly different attitude towards the > Sri Lankan cricket team even though it is not the cricket team that is > [accused of] carrying out abductions and causing disappearances or waging > war. The Sri Lankan government criticized Amnesty for selectively targeting Sri Lanka while not targeting other nations accused of human rights violations at the same sporting event, or in similar major sporting events. \\"One would like to ask Amnesty International whether it plans to take up the issue of human rights violations by the US government in Iraq or in Guantanamo Bay at the Super Bowl match or the National Basketball League championship,\\" the director of the Sri Lankan president's Media Division said.Lanka blasts Amnesty campaign at WC =Allegations of anti-Western bias= United States In 2005, Amnesty International claimed that the United States was a human rights offender.

U.S. human rights violations seem almost trifling in comparison with those committed by Cuba, North Korea, Pakistan or Saudi Arabia.\\" = Guantánamo Bay comments = Protest against human rights violation at Guantánamo Bay prison (June 2006) In the forewordAI Report 2005 — Foreword Irene Khan, Amnesty International 2005 to Amnesty International's Report 2005,AI Report 2005 Amnesty International 2005 the Secretary General, Irene Khan, referred to the Guantánamo Bay prison as \\"the gulag of our times, entrenching the practice of arbitrary and indefinite detention in violation of international law. Trials by military commissions have made a mockery of justice and due process.\\" In the subsequent press conference, she added > \\"If Guantanamo evokes images of Soviet repression, 'ghost detainees' – or > the incommunicado detention of unregistered detainees — bring back the > practice of 'disappearances' so popular with Latin American dictators in the > past.

Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld believed the comments were \\"reprehensible\\", Vice President Dick Cheney said he was \\"offended\\", and President Bush said he believed the report was \\"absurd\\". The Washington Post editorialized that \\"lately the organization has tended to save its most vitriolic condemnations not for the world's dictators but for the United States.\\"American Gulag The Washington Post, 26 May 2005 The human rights organization Human Rights Watch also criticized the Bush administration over the camp in its 2003 world report, stating: \\"Washington has ignored human rights standards in its own treatment of terrorism suspects.\\"New Survey Documents Global Repression Human Rights Watch, 14 January 2003 Edmund McWilliams, a retired senior US Foreign Service Officer who monitored Soviet and Vietnamese abuse of prisoners in their \\"gulags\\", defended Amnesty International's comparison. \\"I note that abuses that I reported on in those inhumane systems parallel abuses reported in Guantanamo, at the Bagram air base in Afghanistan and at the Abu Ghraib prison: prisoners suspended from the ceiling and beaten to death; widespread 'waterboarding'; prisoners 'disappeared' to preclude monitoring by the International Committee of the Red Cross — and all with almost no senior-level accountability.\\"A U.S. Gulag by Any Name The Washington Post, 2 June 2005 Pavel Litvinov, human rights activist and former Soviet-era \\"gulag\\" prisoner, criticized the analogy saying, \\"By any standard, Guantanamo and similar American-run prisons elsewhere do not resemble, in their conditions of detention or their scale, the concentration camp system that was at the core of a totalitarian communist system.\\" John Podhoretz writing in the New York Post on the difference between Guantanamo and a Soviet gulag said, \\"Maybe the people who work at Amnesty International really do think that the imprisonment of 600 certain or suspected terrorists is tantamount to the imprisonment of 25 million slaves. The case of Amnesty International proves that well-meaning people can make morality their life's work and still be little more than moral idiots.\\"\\"Amnesty's Idiocy\\" New York Post, 27 May 2005 William F. Schulz, Executive Director of Amnesty International USA, defended the statement, saying, \\"What is 'absurd' is President Bush's attempt to deny the deliberate policies of his administration.\\" and \\"What is 'absurd' and indeed outrageous is the Bush administration's failure to undertake a full independent investigation.\\" Secretary General Irene Khan also responded saying, \\"The administration's response has been that our report is absurd, that our allegations have no basis, and our answer is very simple: if that is so, open up these detention centres, allow us and others to visit them.\\" Since the U.S. administration originally claimed that these prisoners were not entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled against this interpretation (on 29 June 2006). Following this, on 7 July 2006, the Department of Defense issued an internal memo stating that prisoners will in the future be entitled to protection under the Geneva Conventions. In 2010, Gita Sahgal, an Amnesty senior official, publicly condemned the organization for its collaboration with former Guantanamo detainee Moazzam Begg of Cageprisoners. In a letter to Amnesty's leadership, she wrote: \\"To be appearing on platforms with Britain's most famous supporter of the Taliban, whom we treat as a human rights defender, is a gross error of judgment.\\" She warned that it \\"constitutes a threat to human rights\\". Begg has toured Europe with Amnesty officials.Guantánamo: New call for Europe to take 50 men trapped at camp, Amnesty International, 11 January 2010, ( ) In 2010, Claudio Cordone asserted that Begg's views on holding talks with the Taliban or the role of jihad in self-defence were not antithetical to human rights, even though he may disagree with them. Cordone's assertion was criticized Amrita Chhachhi, Sara Hossain, and Sunila Abeysekera who said that \\"defensive jihad\\" or \\"defence of religion\\" is often used as an excuse to violate human rights by Muslim, Christian and Hindu extremists. Amnesty International's abortion policies since 2007 and the Catholic Church In April 2007, Amnesty International changed its neutral stance on abortion to supporting access to abortion in cases of rape and incest, and when the life or the health of the mother might be threatened. Amnesty's official policy is that they \\"do not promote abortion as a universal right\\" but \\"support the decriminalisation of abortion\\". According to deputy secretary general Kate Gilmore, the debate over the change was difficult, but eventually the overwhelming majority of national Amnesty chapters supported the change. The change was opposed by several organizations, notably by senior figures in the Catholic Church, traditionally a strong supporter of Amnesty International, and a group of US legislators. Amnesty spokeswoman Suzanne Trimel estimated that a \\"handful, probably less than 200\\" of over 400,000 members had quit over the issue. The Catholic Church's Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace in June 2007 issued a statement urging Catholics not to donate to Amnesty because of its abortion stance. Cardinal Renato Martino said that abortion was murder, as was \\"to justify it selectively, in the event of rape, that is to define an innocent child in the belly of its mother as an enemy, as 'something one can destroy'\\". In an interview with the National Catholic Register, the Cardinal said he believed that \\"if in fact Amnesty International persists in this course of action, individuals and Catholic organizations must withdraw their support, because, in deciding to promote abortion rights, AI has betrayed its mission.\\"National Catholic Register 12 June 2007: No Amnesty For the Unborn Website last accessed 19 June 2007 The Church withdrew funding globally for Amnesty, and churches in various locations took other steps to sever their ties with the group.Amnesty faces ban in Northern Ireland's Catholic schools – Website last accessed 21 September 2007 Prostitution decriminalisation A summary of an Amnesty International UK meeting held in 2013 revealed the intention to support the decriminalization of prostitution before any consultation with Amnesty members or stakeholders. When a draft copy of the policy was leaked in early 2014, many feminists and prostitution survivors condemned the proposal, and Amnesty was met with considerable criticism. Members were consequently offered three weeks — from 2–21 April 2014 to provide feedback on the document, although most members did not even receive notification that this process was available to them. On 7 July 2015 an updated draft was released to Amnesty International members, which was again criticised by feminist organisations, including The Coalition Against Trafficking of Women (CATW), who published an open letter signed by over 400 advocates and organisations, condemning \\"Amnesty's proposal to adopt a policy that calls for the decriminalization of pimps, brothel owners and buyers of sex — the pillars of a $99 billion global sex industry\\". Contrary to claims that decriminalisation would make prostituted people safer, critics pointed to research from numerous countries in which deregulation of the sex industry had produced catastrophic results: \\"the German government, for example, which deregulated the industry of prostitution in 2002, has found that the sex industry was not made safer for women after the enactment of its law. Instead, the explosive growth of legal brothels in Germany has triggered an increase in sex trafficking.\\" These campaigners instead asked Amnesty to support the so- called Nordic model, in which sex buyers and pimps are criminalized, while prostituted people are decriminalized. In early August, a large number of NGOs published an open letter in support of the decriminalization proposal. The organizations supporting Amnesty International's position included the Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe (ICRSE), Sex Workers' Rights Advocacy Network in Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia (SWAN), Human Rights Watch, and the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women. On 11 August 2015, the International Council Meeting (ICM) adopted a resolution which authorized the International Board to develop and adopt the decriminalisation policy. Israel Elliott Abrams, writing about the November 2012 Operation Pillar of Defense, says that Amnesty treats \\"Hamas and other terrorist groups [...] with an 'evenhandedness' that bespeaks deep biases\\", citing NGO Monitor's detailed research. The Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticised the May 2012 report on administrative detention saying it was \\"one sided\\", and \\"not particularly serious\\", and \\"that it seemed little more than a public relations gimmick\\". Gerald Steinberg, of NGO Monitor, said that the report was tied to the recent Palestinian hunger strikes and that Amnesty \\"jumped on the bandwagon to help their Palestinian allies\\". Steinberg also said that one of the researchers, Deborah Hyams, was not a neutral party, saying that \\"Hyams has volunteered as a 'human shield' in Beit Jala (near Bethlehem) to deter Israeli military responses to gunfire and mortars targeting Jewish civilians in Jerusalem,\\" and that in 2008 she signed a letter claiming Israel is \\"a state founded on terrorism, massacres and the dispossession of another people from their land\\".'Amnesty report against Israel written by pro-Palestinian activists' The Israeli embassy in London called Amnesty \\"ridiculous\\". Amnesty said that this report \\"is not intended to address violations of detainees' rights by the Palestinian Authority, or the Hamas de facto administration. These violations have been and will continue to be addressed separately by the organisation\\".Israeli embassy attacks Amnesty over hunger strike report In May 2012, NGO Monitor criticized Amnesty's 2012 World Report in a few areas: : Amnesty criticized Israel's blockade on Gaza without mentioning that the blockade was in place \\"to stop the smuggling of weapons and rockets used to target Israeli citizens\\". NGO Monitor continued and said that \\"UN Secretary General's Palmer Committee declared in September 2011 that the blockade is legal under international law.\\" : Amnesty \\"failed to mention the thousands of tons of goods provided by Israel to Gaza each week.\\" : NGO Monitor also pointed out that Amnesty's report \\"mentions Israel 137 times, while making only 74 mentions of the Syrian regime\\", during a year in which thousands of people have been killed by the Syrian government. Amnesty allowed a speaking event to take place in London in May 2011, organized by the magazine Middle East Monitor Online (MEMO) and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Much controversy surrounded this event since one of the speakers included Abdel Bari Atwan, editor of the London-based al-Quds al-Arabi newspaper. In the past, Atwan has said that \\"he would 'dance with delight' in Trafalgar Square if Iran attacked Israel, and that the terrorist attack on the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva, in which eight students were killed, \\"was justified\\" as it was responsible for \\"hatching Israeli extremists and fundamentalists\\". Amnesty responded by saying that \\"while we did have concerns about the way the event had originally been organized, these have been resolved\\". Amnesty also allowed a speaking event to take place in January 2012, which included a speaker who is viewed as anti-Israel. The UK's Zionist Federation said that the speaker \\"goes beyond the bounds of acceptable behavior\\" and asked that the event either not take place or that a pro-Israel speaker be allowed to attend as well. In addition, NGO Monitor's Gerald Steinberg said that the speaker's \\"intense hatred directed at Israel, which is the embodiment of Jewish sovereign equality in the world, is entirely inconsistent with the universal values that Amnesty claims to promote. If Amnesty seeks to restore its tarnished moral credentials, it must end this cooperation, and join in denouncing White's anti-Israel campaigns.\\" Some people have criticized Amnesty for promoting an unbalanced and excessive focus on Israel. The American Jewish Congress asserts that Amnesty's criticism of Israel distorts the law of war by \\"read[ing] the law of war as if it was a law banning war\\", and misinterprets the Geneva Conventions with regard to the issue of proportionality in war. Yael Beck and Merav Fima of NGO Monitor, a Pro-Israel NGO, claim the Amnesty has an \\"obsession with Israel\\" and \\"persistently condemns Israel while ignoring suffering elsewhere\\". Alan Dershowitz, professor of law at Harvard University, in his book The Case for Israel, is very critical of Amnesty and their comparison of Israel to nations such as Sudan and other human rights offenders. Amnesty International has consistently called on Israel to bring any officer suspected of human rights violations to justice and to remove its settlements in the West Bank. It has also opposed \\"discrimination\\" against Arab citizens of Israel, and says that the Law of Return and Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law are discriminatory, as they grant automatic citizenship to Jews worldwide, while denying Palestinian refugees the right of return. It has also opposed the blockade of the Gaza Strip, calling it \\"collective punishment\\". In 2010 Frank Johansson, the chairman of Amnesty International- Finland called Israel a nilkkimaa, a derogatory term variously translated as \\"scum state\\", \\"creep state\\" or \\"punk state\\". Johansson stood by his statement, saying that it was based on Israel's \\"repeated flouting of international law\\", and his own personal experiences with Israelis. When asked by a journalist if any other country on earth that could be described in these terms, he said that he could not think of any, although some individual \\"Russian officials\\" could be so described. According to Israeli professor Gerald M. Steinberg of NGO Monitor: \\"Amnesty International has promoted an intense anti-Israel ideology, resulting in statements like these.\\"\\"Amnesty Int'l Finland: Israel scum state\\", Benjamin Weinthal, 14 August 2010, The Jerusalem Post. In November 2012, Amnesty UK began a disciplinary process against staffer Kristyan Benedict, Amnesty UK campaigns manager, because of a posting on his Twitter account, said to be anti-semitic, regarding three Jewish members of parliament and Operation Pillar of Defense where he wrote: \\"Louise Ellman, Robert Halfon and Luciana Berger walk into a bar ... each orders a round of B52s ... #Gaza\\". Amnesty International UK said \\"the matter has been referred to our internal and confidential processes.\\" Amnesty's campaigns director Tim Hancock said, \\"We do not believe that humour is appropriate in the current circumstances, particularly from our own members of staff.\\" An Amnesty International UK spokesperson later said the charity had decided that \\"the tweet in question was ill-advised and had the potential to be offensive and inflammatory but was not racist or antisemitic.\\" In December 2019, a 200-page report on Amnesty International arguing the NGO is strongly biased against the Jewish state. Syrian government's denial of Amnesty's findings on Sednaya Prison In February 2017, Amnesty International reported that between 5,000 and 13,000 prisoners had been tortured to death by the Syrian government at the Sednaya Prison between 2011 and 2016, describing it as a \\"Human Slaughterhouse\\", a claim that has been strenuously denied by the Syrian Government who described the allegations as \\"false\\" and part of a wider smear campaign against the Government. Iranian government's protest of Amnesty's claims about the death toll in the 2019 fuel protests in Iran On 19 November 2019, Amnesty International reported that at least 106 civilians had been \\"unlawfully killed\\" by Iranian security forces during the 2019 Iranian protests which were triggered by outrage over a sudden increase in gasoline prices. Amnesty later revised the figure upwards to 304, claiming that unarmed protesters had been deliberately massacred by the authorities who had \\"green lighted\\" a brutal crackdown to suppress dissent. The Iranian authorities, whilst acknowledging that some armed rioters had been shot by police, rejected Amnesty's figure as \\"sheer lies\\" and part of a \\"disinformation campaign waged against Iran from outside the country\\". Judiciary spokesman, Gholamhussein Esmayeeli, countered that it was armed rioters who had actually killed many people, but that Amnesty and other organizations had nonetheless, \\"named people who have died in other incidents that are different from the recent riots and many of those people claimed to be killed are alive\\". Secretary of Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani, also denied that civilian deaths were caused mostly by security forces and instead asserted that, \\"more than 85 percent of victims of the recent unrest in cities of Tehran province had not taken part in any of the protests.\\". In a thinly veiled rebuttal to Amnesty, Prosecutor-General Mohammad Montazeri retorted that, \\"people, who are outside the country, have no access to exact information and accurate figures. They provide different figures which are invalid.\\" In its December 16 press release, Amnesty's research director for MENA, Philip Luther, moreover, did not acknowledge the widespread arson, vandalism and looting apparent during the protests/riots, that led to the forceful response, or the reported killing of security officers either. He also appeared to misquote supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, as stating that all those protesting in the streets were \\"villains\\". The Iranian leader had, in fact, distinguished between those peacefully objecting to the govermmemt policy and those who destroyed property: “Some people are no doubt worried by this decision (to raise the price of gasoline) ... but sabotage and arson is done by villains, not our people.\\" Ayatollah Khamenei further elaborated that those killed in any crossfire between the security forces and armed rioters/saboteurs were to be regarded as \\"martyrs\\". On 20 May 2020, Amnesty published a final report on the protests where, for the first time, it named 232 out of the 304 alleged victims. Amnesty also acknowledged that many of those killed were bystanders who were not even protesting at the time of their death. The report was itself heavily criticized by two independent analysts who accused Amnesty of distorting many facts, making unsupported claims and ignoring key evidence. On 1 June 2020, an Iranian lawmaker, Mojtaba Zolnour, made it known that 230 persons had been killed, including 6 security officers and 40 from the Baseej volunteer force. More than a quarter were bystanders whom he alleged were killed by rioters. 2019 Report on workplace bullying within Amnesty International In February 2019, Amnesty International's management team offered to resign. The offer came after an independent report by Konterra group found what it called a \\"toxic culture\\" of workplace bullying, as well as numerous evidences of bullying, harassment, sexism and racism. The report was commissioned by Amnesty after the investigation of the suicides of 30-year Amnesty veteran Gaetan Mootoo in Paris in May 2018 (who left a note citing work pressures), and 28-year-old intern Rosalind McGregor in Geneva in July 2018. The Konterra report found that: \\"39 per cent of Amnesty International staff reported that they developed mental or physical health issues as the direct result of working at Amnesty\\". The report concluded, \\"organisational culture and management failures are the root cause of most staff wellbeing issues.\\".Radical change needed at Amnesty International after new report reveals ‘toxic’ work culture, Unite the Union, 7 February 2019 The report said that efforts by Amnesty to address its problems had been \\"ad hoc, reactive, and inconsistent,\\" and that staff described the senior leadership team as out-of-touch, incompetent and callous. Those signing a letter offering to resign were the senior directors of research, the Secretary General's office, global fundraising, global operations, people and services, law and policy and campaigns and communications. However, Amnesty International's Secretary General Kumi Naidoo did not accept resignations and instead offered generous redundancies to managers concerned, including to Mootoo's senior director Anna Neistat directly implicated in the report on Mootoo's death. Naidoo stated that his priority was \\"to rebuild trust at a dangerous time when Amnesty was needed more than ever\\". After none of the managers responsible of bullying at Amnesty were held accountable, a group of workers petitioned for Amnesty's chief to resign. On 5 December 2019 Naidoo resigned from his post of Amnesty's Secretary General, citing ill health. Julie Verhaar was appointed as interim Secretary General the same day. 2019 Budgetary crisis controversy In 2019 Amnesty International's Secretary General Kumi Naidoo admitted to a hole in the organization's budget of up to £17m in donor money to the end of 2020. In order to deal with the budgetary crisis Naidoo announced to staff that the organization's headquarters would have cut almost 100 jobs as a part of urgent restructuring. Unite the Union, the UK's biggest trade union, said the redundancies were a direct result of \\"overspending by the organisation’s senior leadership team\\" and have occurred \\"despite an increase in income\\".Amnesty International to make almost 100 staff redundant, The Guardian, 9 June 2019 Unite, which represents Amnesty's staff, feared that cuts would fall heaviest on lower income staff. It said that in the previous year the top 23 highest earners at Amnesty International were paid a total of £2.6m– an average of £113,000 per year. Unite demanded a review of whether it is necessary to have so many managers in the organisation.Amnesty International staff braced for redundancies, The Guardian, 27 April 2019  India  In 2009, Amnesty's Indian offshoot suspended its India operations as the UPA government rejected its application for receiving foreign funding. On 29 September 2020, the Indian offshoot of Amnesty International released a statement announcing suspension of its operations in the country after Enforcement Directorate which investigates financial crimes and irregularities ordered the freezing of its bank accounts. The bank accounts were frozen in view of non-compliance and circumvention of FCRA regulations by the organisation. Amnesty blamed the Government for targeting the organisation for being critical of the government and complied with the regulations.

She has been criticized for tax planning and for possible conflict of interest when transferring from public office to health business.  Career  Laura Räty worked as a physician and served in the Helsinki City Council from 2005 to 2011 and the Helsinki City Board from 2009 to 2011 representing the National Coalition Party before running for Parliament of Finland in the 2011 election. She failed to gain a seat, but was appointed as Deputy Mayor of Helsinki for Social Services and Health Care and served in the role from 2011 to 2014. In June 2014, Räty was appointed Minister of Social Affairs and Health in the cabinet of Alexander Stubb. She was set to replace resigning Lasse Männistö as Member of Parliament in 2014 until Männistö withdrew his resignation under criticism for violating the dignity of Parliament. She ran for Parliament again in the 2015 election, but 4,087 votes were not enough to get her elected. She briefly returned to her Deputy Mayor post in May 2015 before resigning and joining the Finnish private hospital corporate group Terveystalo as a business director in 2016.  Criticism  Laura Räty's questioning of Finnish wages garnered wide criticism in 2014. Räty claimed that only a very small number of parents in Finland earn under 2,600 euros per month while in actuality almost 500,000 Finn parents earned under 2,600 euros per month at the time. She later apologized for her comments. Her financial matters were the subject of public discussion when it was discovered that she had utilized tax planning during her physician tenure 2007–2011. She had transformed some of her income into tax-free dividends during 2006–2009 and her holding company had received approximately 20,000 euros of tax-free dividends during 2007–2011. Otherwise over half of the sum would have been subject to taxation. Räty later commented that she would not repeat the arrangement in the future and had discontinued it after her selection as Deputy Mayor of Helsinki in 2011. In 2016, Laura Räty was criticized for her decision to resign as Deputy Mayor of Helsinki for Social Services and Health Care and join the private hospital corporate group Terveystalo as a business director. Her move was seen by opposing politicians and the press as a conflict of interest due to possible use of insider information on public affairs concerning health reform. Similarly, her guidance for Terveystalo physicians to send patients to the physicians' own clinics with public health funding received criticism.

Dr. McGill’s pathology efforts related to Butte miners and the Butte community's ongoing battle with tuberculosis prompted her to work with Montana's antituberculosis organizations; the Montana Tuberculosis Association and an organizer of the Butte Anit-Tuberculosis Society. McGill was also an outdoor recreationalist. Not only did she treat the miners of Butte, but she also hunted and enjoyed outdoor life with them. In her diary, she wrote, “never was any older woman more differently or more kindly treated...the relaxation of this outdoor life made it possible for me to carry on my heavy practice in Butte.” https://www.lib.montana.edu/archives/finding- aids/0945.html?_ga=2.211015057.569170859.1588703875-1532162343.1567003171#1.

It was her second printed work and was published anonymously under the name 'A Young Lady'. The Sylph is an epistolary novel. It centres on Julia Grenville, a Welsh beauty and ingenue (with whom there are parallels with Cavendish herself) who leaves her idyllic rustic life to marry a rich member of the aristocracy. Over the course of time she uncovers the fact that her husband is a rake and a libertine, lavishing his wealth on gambling and mistresses. The letters are chiefly written to her sisters and provide narrative detail about Julia's life in London and her disillusionment with the mores of the inhabitants of the city as well as her miscarriage. We also discover that she has a long-term admirer, Henry Woodley, that she has growing affections for another man (the Baron Ton-hausen) and also that she has a mysterious and enigmatic protector and guardian, who is the 'sylph' of the title. The sylph helps provide advice to Julia on the way to negotiate the labyrinth of metropolitan high society, appearing in the work only in the double fictional form of a masquerade. Eventually Julia's husband commits suicide as a result of his hefty gambling debts and Julia returns to her family in Wales. The book's epigraph is taken from The Rape of the Lock by Alexander Pope and was influenced by The Sylph, a one-act play by Germain-François Poullain de Saint- Foix (1771). There has been some controversy over the authorship of the work, with some claims having been made that it was not written by Cavendish but was instead produced by Sophia Briscoe. The question of gambling debts is an interesting one, since at her death Cavendish herself left an extremely large bill behind based on her own gambling activity.

It is located on County Road 249, just off Arkansas Highway 8. The two story wood frame house was built in 1908 by Henry Atchley, who ran a general store in town. The house is basically vernacular in form, but has a number of stylish elements, including turned posts supporting a hip- roofed porch across the front, and a double-door entry with transom window. The front block of the house has a side-gable roof pierced by three gabled dormers, and there is a cross-gabled ell extended to the rear. The house was built in the economic boom associated with the arrival of the railroad and the community's subsequent economic success as a lumber town. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Once an Android device is paired with the head unit, the system mirrors qualified apps from the device to the vehicle's display, with a simple, driver-friendly user interface. Supported apps include GPS mapping/navigation, music playback, SMS, telephone, and web search. The system supports both touchscreen and button-controlled head unit displays, although hands-free operation through voice commands is encouraged to minimize driving distraction. Android Auto is part of the Open Automotive Alliance that was announced on June 25, 2014, and is a joint effort between 28 automobile manufacturers, with Nvidia as tech supplier. It's available in 36 countries. Functionality Android Auto home screen The most common way Android Auto is deployed is via an Android mobile device running the Android Auto app, acting as a master to a vehicle's dashboard head unit that supports this functionality. Once the user's Android device is connected to the vehicle, the head unit will serve as an external display for the Android device, presenting supported software in a car-specific user interface provided by the Android Auto app. In Android Auto's first iterations, the device was required to be connected via USB to the car. Alternatively, in November 2016, Google added the option to run Android Auto as a regular app on an Android device, i.e., not tethered to a car's head unit, which allows it to be used on Android-powered head units, or simply on a personal phone or tablet in the vehicle. In addition, on January 1, 2018, it was announced that JVCKenwood would be exhibiting wireless Android Auto-enabled head units at CES 2018, which would be capable of operating without the need for a wired connection. Availability Countries where Android Auto is available As of June 2020, Android Auto is available in 36 countries.: * Argentina * Australia * Austria * Bolivia * Brazil * Canada * Chile * Colombia * Costa Rica * Dominican Republic * Ecuador * Germany * Guatemala * France * India * Ireland * Italy * Japan * Mexico * New Zealand * Panama * Paraguay * Peru * Philippines * Poland * Puerto Rico * Russia * Singapore * South Africa * South Korea * Spain * Switzerland * Taiwan * United Kingdom * United States * Uruguay * Venezuela History *June 25, 2014: Android Auto debuted at Google I/O 2014 *March 19, 2015: Android Auto was released *November 2016: Google added the option to run Android Auto as a regular app on an Android device *July 2019: Android Auto received its first major UI rework, which among other changes, brought an app drawer to Android Auto for the first time. Google also announced that the app's ability of being used on a phone would be discontinued in favor of Google Assistant's drive mode. App support An Android Auto SDK has been released, allowing third parties to modify their apps to work with Android Auto; initially, only APIs for music and messaging apps would be available, but it is expected that through Android Auto, the mobile device will have access to several of the automobile's sensors and inputs, such as GPS and high-quality GPS antennae, steering-wheel mounted buttons, the sound system, directional speakers, directional microphones, wheel speed, compass, mobile antennas, etc. Also, there is partial access to car data, a feature still under development. At CES 2018, Google confirmed that the Google Assistant would be coming to Android Auto later in the year. Currently supported apps include Google Maps and Waze, popular music players such as Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Apple Music and Spotify; and messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Skype and Telegram. Head unit support In May 2015, Hyundai became the first manufacturer to offer Android Auto support, making it first available in the 2015 Hyundai Sonata. Automobile manufacturers that will offer Android Auto support in their cars include Abarth, Acura, Alfa Romeo, Audi, Bentley (will be coming soon), Buick, BMW (will be coming soon), Cadillac, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Ferrari, Fiat, Ford, GMC, Genesis, Holden, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Jaguar Land Rover, Jeep, Kia, Lamborghini, Lexus, Lincoln, Mahindra and Mahindra, Maserati, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Opel, Peugeot, RAM, Renault, SEAT, Škoda, SsangYong, Subaru, Suzuki, Tata Motors Cars, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo.https://www.android.com/auto/ Additionally, aftermarket car-audio systems supporting Android Auto add the technology into host vehicles, including Pioneer, Kenwood, Panasonic, and Sony.  Criticism  In May 2019, Italy filed an antitrust complaint targeting Android Auto, citing that a Google policy of only allowing third- party media and messaging apps on the platform prevented Enel from offering an app for locating vehicle charging stations. As of August 2020, Google hasn't enabled third parties to integrate their mapping apps with Android Auto, only its own apps, Google Maps and Waze, being available. Google announced a new SDK to be released to select partners in August 2020 and to be generally available by the end of 2020.

The book's author is Abū Jaʿfar (or Abūl-Hasan) Muḥammad ibn al- Hasan ibn Farrūkh al-ʾAʿraj (), popularly known as Sheikh aṣ-Ṣaffār al-Qummī () (d. 290 AH / 902-903 CE) Author  Abu Jaʿfar Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Farrukh al-Araj, popularly known as Sheikh as-Saffar al-Qummi (d. 290 AH / 902-903 CE), was a contemporary of the tenth and eleventh Imams. He was probably the disciple of the eleventh, and an acquaintance of his son, Imam Mahdi. He was one of the earliest systematic compilers of Hadiths about Imamat Theology, constituting the basis of early Twelver metaphysics and mystical theology. His greatest work, which is also the only one that has survived, is Baṣāʾir ad-Darajāt Fī ʿUlūm ʾĀl Muḥammad wa-Mā Khaṣṣahum ʾAllāh Bihī.

Biography Sheppard was born in South Ferriby, one of ten children of Harvey, schoolmaster and Myra (née Havercroft). His childhood included holidays spent with his uncle who was a collector of antiquities and fossils. He also accompanied William Greenwell on archaeological digs whilst still at school. Thomas was educated to elementary level in Hull. He worked as a railway clerk in Hull for 11 years, during which time he was self-educated, also attending classes in microscopy and preservation of specimens, natural history topics and geology. Sheppard's employment by the railway (North Eastern Railway) gave him free travel on the company's lines, enabling him to visit sites of interest in the East Riding. Sheppard became acquainted with John Robert Mortimer, and in 1900 produced a catalogue of Mortimer's Driffield museum.Thomas Sheppard (Hull museums) In 1901 he married Mary Isobel Osborn (b.1877), a son Harvey was born 1902. In 1904 he became the first curator of the Hull Municipal Museum at the Royal Institution in Albion Street, Hull, which was based on the collection of the Hull Literary & Philosophical Society (founded 1822) which had been acquired by Hull Corporation. Sheppard closed the museum and refurbished it, re-opening it in 1902 without admission charges. The museum was popular, with over 2000 visitors a week. Sheppard's character, coupled with the support of influential people led to the opening of further museums. Wilberforce House was opened in 1906, the Pickering Park Museum of Fisheries and Shipping (1912),See also Pickering Park, Kingston upon Hull and Christopher Pickering the Commerce and Transport Museum (1925), the Easington Tithe Barn museum (1928), the Mortimer Museum (1929), and a Railway Museum in 1933.The railway museum as located in Hull Paragon railway station. An 'Old Times Street' museum was also under development but destroyed before opening during the Second World War. Sheppard's interests also extended to other fields including amateur dramatics, literary societies and geology. Sheppard's health declined in the 1930s, and he gave up some honorary positions; he was noted as liking cigars and as having a love of whisky, possibly an alcoholic. He separated from his wife Mary Isobel in the early 1930s. He retired in 1941, and died at home, four years later. He is commemorated with a green plaque on The Avenues, Kingston upon Hull. Legacy The Wilberforce Museum, recalling the slave trade and abolitionists still exists, located at Wilberforce House; the \\"Pickering Park Museum of Fisheries and Shipping\\" collection moved to the Dock Office building in 1974, and now forms part of the Hull Maritime Museum; the \\"Museum of Commerce and Transport\\" collection now is part of the Streetlife Museum of Transport; the Mortimer Museum collection is part of the Hull and East Riding Museum. Several of the Hull museums were badly damaged during the Hull Blitz of the Second World War. The Railway museum, and the un-opened 'Old Times Street' museum were destroyed, and the Municipal Museum building was gutted by fire. Sheppard published numerous books and papers; primarily histories, catalogues, and introductory geological works; as well as many Hull museum publications. He was awarded several honorary life memberships and other honours including a Lyell Award from the London Geological Society. A partial list is given in Sheppard has been described as a humorous individual, 'portly and jovial' in later years; a workaholic; with a good sense of self publicity and unscrupulous when collecting in the interests of his museums; occasionally arrogant and opinionated. A conflict with the Morfitt family of Atwick probably led him to wrongly label bone points collected in Holderness as fakes.

Foxfire Mountain occupies an area known as Pearl Valley near Dunne's Creek. The area known as Foxfire Mountain is a 150-acre parcel of land that is rich in history. History One of the many stories about Foxfire Mountain is how the mountain got its name. According to local lore, In the days before park rangers patrolled the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, local settlers had to protect the natural beauty of the land by regulating the growth of under-brush. Dead undergrowth that amasses over the years is a potential forest fire hazard. To prevent such calamities settlers had controlled burns by burning off the under-brush in a confined area. Early settlers had an ingenious method to burn off the unwanted undergrowth. They would capture a fox and tie a rag to his tail which had been soaked in oil which was an expensive commodity in those early years. Settlers were thrifty in their use of oil. They would set the rag on fire and the frightened fox would run around frantically dragging the flaming rag behind him setting the undergrowth on fire as he ran along. Eventually he would ignite the undergrowth that needed to be burned off and the string that attached the fox to the rag would burn off. The Fox would then scurry away and the settlers would tend t the burning undergrowth.;Make a Wish Grant A wish Foxfire Mountain was originally inhabited by the Cherokee. Artifacts, such as arrow heads, found in the area date back 10,000 years. The Cherokee planted corn on the mountain and hunted bear, deer, turkey and turtles. The creation of ironworks in East Tennessee in 1809 paved the way for mining in Sevier County. Iron was discovered on Foxfire Mountain in 1820. With the help of the Cherokee the iron was mined and the Native American workers were paid with the silver byproduct of the mining operation. The Cherokee miners usually hid their silver in the mine for safe keeping. In 1838, the Cherokee were forced to relocate to Oklahoma is what is known as \\"the Trail of Tears.\\" The Cherokee were forced out of East Tennessee and Foxfire Mountain. many never recovered the silver they had stashed in the mine. After the departure of the Cherokee, Isaac Love and his sons created a partnership with the Shields Iron Co. to continue mining at Foxfire Mountain.;The Mountain Press, May 8, 2014 ''' In the 1860s, during the Civil War, the Confederate Army had a camp at the bend in the river near the base of Foxfire Mountain. The natural resources in the area and access to iron, sulfur and saltpetre made Foxfire Mountain strategic to the creation of much needed war materials. As the war encroached into Tennessee, Union soldiers were reported in the area near Foxfire. One afternoon a local man, William Thomas, was killed near his home by a Union soldier. They reportedly believed Thomas was a Confederate sympathizer providing food and supplies to Southern forces. In reality, he was a moonshiner hauling ingredients for his liquor to his still which was hidden in the crevices of the old iron mine. In the late 1800s the property was purchased by Judge Benjamin Owens who was known locally as the hanging judge. Owens was rumored to have hanged criminals from an oak tree in Richardson's Cove Road along Dunn Creek. The cemetery where Owens is buried, along with his son and 20 unnamed others is being preserved by the current owners of the property. Owens' picture hangs in the Sevier County Courthouse. In 1902, Wilson and Eva Thomas, descendants of William Thomas, acquired the property for farming as small iron mines were unprofitable and new mining technology favored larger mines. One afternoon, Wilson was hiking with his daughter around the abandoned mine when the young girl fell in. Although her injuries were minor, Wilson decided to destroy the mine by blasting it with dynamite causing it to collapse, thus forever burying the silver that had been hidden there by the Cherokee decades earlier. For seven generations the Thomas family farmed and operated a blacksmith shop at Foxfire Mountain. In 1998, Marc and Marion Postlewaite bought the Foxfire Farm from Earl Thomas to raise Hereford cattle. Their Herefords were sold as breeding stock to other ranchers who wanted to improve their gene pool. In 2007, the southeast was gripped by the worst drought since 1946, with feed prices escalating to unprecedented proportions, the Postlewaites sold the cattle and made the decision to sell the land. Then, in a serendipitous turn of events, the Postlewaites went on vacation in Alaska where Marc went zip lining for the first time in his life.The Knoxville News Sentinel, May 4, 2014 After the zip line adventure Postlewaite returned to Foxfire Mountain where he took his farm off the market and decided to open an adventure park.The History of Eastern Sevier County, Arcadia Publishing, pages 13, 81-84, June 29, 2015. Facilities Today Foxfire Mountain is a adventure park that features two zip line courses including the highest zip line in the south. This particular zip line, known as \\"Goliath\\" hangs 475 feet above the ground. The property has a 60-foot climbing wall, which is the highest in Tennessee, a rope obstacle course, a free fall, bear crawler tours, hiking trails and the longest suspension bridge in the United States. Foxfire Mountain was featured in a book entitled \\"The History of Eastern Sevier County\\" that was published by Arcadia Books on June 29, 2015. Several pictures of the park's construction as well as the history of the mountain was discussed in the book. The book was written by local journalist Michael Williams.

Starkweather studied at the Art Students' League in New York, where he studied with John Henry Twachtman, a member of the group of American Impressionists known as “the Ten”. It was most likely during this period that Starkweather developed his interest in light and color integral to his career. In November 1899, he began his studies at the Académie Colarossi in Paris. Starkweather was heavily influenced by the color and brush work of Spanish painter Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida, whose work he saw at the Exposition Universelle.\\"William Starkweather (1879-1969).\\" Spanierman Gallery LLC. Spanierman Gallery, LLC, 2012. Web. 24 June 2014. http://www.spanierman.com/Starkweather,-William/bio/thumbs/biography Maturity Upon return to New York in 1901, Starkweather supported himself by illustrating books and teaching at a private boys’ school. During this time, he was also saving for a trip to Spain. Starkweather illustrated books for four New York publishing houses: F.M. Buckles and Company, Grosset and Dunlap, The Macmillan Company, and, most prolifically, R.F. Feno and Company. Two years later, he arrived in Seville, Spain, contacted Sorolla, and asked to be taken on as a student. Starkweather spent three years with the Spanish master before embarking on a three-year independent study in Italy, then returning to New York as a practicing artist. In 1909, Sorolla came to New York to attend the opening of an exhibition of his work, organized by the Hispanic Society of America. Starkweather lectured and published extensively on Spanish art and his teacher’s work, and became an assistant curator at the Hispanic Society. Continuing to paint throughout his time with the Hispanic Society, Starkweather was able to mount his first solo exhibition in 1914 at the Folsom Galleries in New York. In 1918, he began a 28-year teaching career in the art schools of New York. By 1921, Starkweather had switched from oil painting to watercolor, a transition that garnered critical acclaim and afforded him three solo exhibitions in New York’s Fifteen Gallery. He also became a member of the American Water Color Society. As Starkweather grew older, he expressed concern over the disposal of his work after his death. Thus, in 1954, he donated eight of his paintings to the Hickory Museum of Art. Starkweather’s work ranges from interior scenes to landscapes and portraiture, and often revolves around the symbolic identity of an artist.Symbolism and Iconography of William Edward Bloomfield Starkweather, WilliamStarkweather.com.

The church was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on December 11, 1993 together with San Agustin Church in Manila; Nuestra Señora de la Asuncion Church in Santa Maria, Ilocos Sur; and San Agustin Church in Paoay, Ilocos Norte under the collective title Baroque Churches of the Philippines, a collection of four Baroque Spanish-era churches.  History  Miagao was formerly a visita (a locality served by a visiting priest) of Oton until 1580, Tigbauan until 1592, San Joaquin until 1703 and Guimbal until 1731. It became an independent parish of the Augustinians in 1731 under the advocacy of Saint Thomas of Villanova. With the establishment of the parish, a church and convent was built on land near the sea called Ubos. Father Fernando Camporredondo served as the town's first parish priest in 1734. When the town experienced frequent Moro invasion in 1741 and 1754, the town moved to a more secure place. From there, a new church was constructed in 1787 through forced labor under the supervision of Fray Francisco Gonzales, parish priest and Spanish gobernadorcillo Domingo Libo-on. It was built on the highest point of the town to guard from invaders called Tacas. After ten years, the church was completed in 1797. It was designed with thick walls to serve as protection from invaders. It was severely damaged during the Spanish revolution in 1898 but was later rebuilt, fire in 1910, the second World War and earthquake in 1948. The present day Miagao church is the third church built since its establishment in 1731. To preserve the church, it underwent restoration in 1960. This was completed in 1962. It has been declared a national shrine through Presidential Decree No. 260.  Architecture  The church's over-all architectural style falls under the Baroque Romanesque architectural style. Its ochre color is due to the materials used in constructing the church: adobe, egg, coral and limestone., The church's foundation is 6 meters deep and the massive stone walls at 1.5 meters thick are intensified through the use of 4 meter thick setback buttresses as protection to the Moro invaders as stipulated under Royal Decree 111 of 1573 (Law of the Indies). = Façade = The façade of Miagao church consists of an ornately decorated bas-relief in the middle of two huge watchtower belfries on each side. The bas-relief is a mixed influence of Medieval Spanish, Chinese, Muslim and local traditions and elements, a unique characteristic of the church façade. A prominent part of the façade is a coconut tree depicted as the tree of life where St. Christopher holds on. St. Christopher is dressed in local and traditional clothing carrying the Child Jesus on his back. The rest of the façade features the daily life of the people of Miagao during that time including native flora (like papaya, coconut and palm tree) and fauna., Above the wooden door entrance at the center of the façade just below the image of St. Christopher is a carved image of the town's patron saint, St. Thomas of Villanueva. At each side of the door is the images of St. Henry of Bavaria on the left and Pope Pius VI., Above the images of St. Henry and Pope Pius VI is their respective coat-of-arms.

It has two different designs since it was commissioned by two different priests. On the left side is the older belfry, the tallest west belfry with four levels. Originally, the east belfry was constructed only with two levels. It was in 1830 when Father Francisco Perez decided to add another story to the east belfry. Until now, the east belfry (three levels) is one level shorter that the west belfry (four levels). The original late 1790s images of St. Tomas of Villanova can also be found enclosed in a glass case in the rear side of the church.  Sanctuary  Sanctuary of Miagao Church The sanctuary of the church is composed of an altar, tabernacle, retablo and shrines on both sides. The retablo is gold-plated and consists of a crucifix (center), statue of St. Joseph (left), statue of St. Thomas (right) and a statue of Sto. Niño (top). The shrine on the left of the altar houses the Sacred Heart of Jesus while the shrine on the right of the altar houses the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

It is the largest institution of higher education in Morelos, with facilities statewide. History A mural at the UAEM College of Medicine In 1938, the Instituto de Educación Superior (Higher Education Institute) was established, offering bachillerato-level courses. Between 1943 and 1945, it absorbed the College of Nursing and Obstetrics and the College of Commerce and Administration, allowing the IES to begin offering additional and higher-level programs. In 1953, seeking to improve the quality of higher education in Morelos and in response to an increased demand, the governor and the Institute presented the 31st State Legislature with a proposal to transform the IES into a university. That year, the legislature passed a law creating and regulating the Universidad de Morelos (University of Morelos). The new university did not have a campus, offering its programs in different facilities. In 1958, under interim rector Francisco Cabrera de la Rosa, the school began to seek the construction of its own campus. In the early 1960s, land was donated for the school in Chamilpa, which had originally been slated for development as a military college. On November 22, 1967, with the university now settled in its new campus to the north of Cuernavaca, it gained autonomy and changed its name to the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos. In the 1980s, the university began to expand statewide. In 1985, the Eastern Regional Professional Institute (IPRO) opened, offering agricultural programs such as a degree in engineering for farm implements and vegetable production, and soon after, it began offering social sciences and business degrees in areas such as sociology, economics and accounting. Facing increasing demand in some of its core programs, the Southern Regional Professional Institute (IPRES) was founded in Jojutla, offering law, administration and accounting degrees. Continued expansion of the UAEM resulted in the establishment of a radio service, Radio UAEM, in 2000, with transmitters in Cuernavaca, Cuautla, and Jojutla, as well as the conversion of the professional institutes into regional campuses. Campuses The Centro de Investigación en Ingeniería y Ciencias Aplicadas (Center for Research in Engineering and Applied Sciences) on the UAEM campus in Cuernavaca The Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos has a presence in 17 municipalities in the state. Higher education facilities are located in Cuernavaca, Jojutla, Cuautla, Ayala/Xalostoc, Jonacatepec, Puente de Ixtla, and Mazatepec. There are six preparatory schools associated with the university and various regional centers.

Belonging to the Church of Sweden, it lies in the Diocese of Visby. History and architecture Fide Church dates from the 13th century. Oldest are the nave and choir, while the tower was added slightly later. The roof lantern which gives the top of the tower its distinctive shape is however considerably later, from 1826. The church lies in an unusually well-preserved medieval cemetery which is surrounded by a low wall in which three medieval lych gates still sits. The building material of the church is sandstone. The exterior of the church is rather plain, but unusually the church still has the original windows, which have never been enlarged. Inside, the church is decorated with murals from two different periods. The oldest are from the early 15th century and includes religious subjects as well as an inscription in Latin that has been interpreted as a lamentation of the Battle of Visby in 1361. In translation it reads: \\"The field is burnt and the men cry, beaten and in pain under the sword.\\" The other, somewhat later set of murals depict scenes from the Passion of Christ and has been attributed to the Master of the Passion of Christ. Among the furnishings, especially the medieval (early 15th century) altarpiece deserves mention. The church furthermore has a triumphal cross from the time of the construction of the church, and one of the oldest pulpits on Gotland, from 1587.

Career Hunt began competing in PDC events in 2011 and won his first tournament in his second month, beating Josh Jones 4–2 in the final of the opening youth tour event of the year. In 2012 he qualified for the UK Open for the first time and defeated Steve Maish 4–2, before losing 4–1 to Arron Monk in the second round. A year later he reached his first quarter-final on the Pro Tour at the first UK Open qualifier where he lost 6–1 to Michael van Gerwen. Hunt then won a Challenge Tour title with a 4–2 victory over Ricky Evans and advanced to the semi-finals of the World Youth Championship, where Michael Smith eliminated him 6–3. He went one better in the UK Open than last year as he lost in the third round 9–8 against Kevin McDine having led 4–1. Hunt's performances on the Challenge Tour saw him finish fourth on the Order of Merit to earn a two-year PDC tour card from 2014. =2014= In March, Hunt reached the third round of the UK Open for the second year in a row, but lost 9–5 to Paul Nicholson. Later in the month he beat Michael van Gerwen to reach the last 16 of the fourth Players Championship, where he was defeated 6–5 by Magnus Caris. Hunt was still competing in youth tournaments as well as the main professional tour and he won the ninth event with a 4–3 success over Rowby-John Rodriguez. He entered the 2014 PDC World Youth Championship as the number 1 seed, but lost in the last 16 to Kevin Voornhout 6-4.

It was founded in 1995 for the promotion and enjoyment of the visual and performing arts. It comprises two visual art galleries, a performance theater, and visual artist studios.  History and description  Supported by public donations, contributions from the Friends of the Narrows, and staffed solely by volunteers, the Narrows moved from its initial location in \\"the Narrows\\" section of Fall River, Massachusetts (hence the venue's name) to its current location on the third floor of the former American Printing Company mill building on Anawan Street overlooking the historic Battleship Cove complex on Mount Hope Bay. The venue began as a side project at a small art gallery and is one of several groups that have made an effort, in cooperation with the Fall River Cultural Council and the Massachusetts Cultural Council, to increase awareness of the arts in the Fall River area, making use of vacant mill and warehouse spaces for studios and performance centers. A proposal is in place to revitalize the downtown area by the creation of an Arts District,Fall River, Massachusetts#Culture and the venue was among a group of recipients of grants intended to increase awareness of local destinations and cultural events in the southeastern Massachusetts region. A music venue in an open, high-ceiling early 20th century mill with tables and donated church pews surrounds a small stage, providing the setting for everything from folk to blues to rock.  Art  The Narrows brings to the city of Fall River an accessible variety of art created by local, regional, and national artisans. = Galleries = :The venue contains two visual art galleries. Visitors enter through the Narrows’ main Gallery, a space with an impressive 210 linear feet of exhibition walls in an elegant architectural design. Morphing several times throughout the year, the main Gallery presents artwork of every medium. The Narrows Café Gallery occupies a linear wall facing Battleship Cove at the opposite end of the venue. This space is ideal for sequential unfolding of a theme and single artist shows. Having two galleries affords visitors and artists multiple opportunities to view and exhibit fine art. The Narrows presents museum quality nationally touring exhibitions in addition to the artwork of student, local, national and international artists. “The Art of the Brick” by Nathan Sawaya, “Pulp Function,” “Duende: The Art of Anthony Quinn,” “Jerry Garcia Art Tour” “Petroleum Paradox: For Better or for Worse?” and “The Artwork of Richie Havens” are examples of extraordinary past touring exhibitions the Narrows has hosted. Brian Fox (photography), in addition to many local artists, is another of many artists to present in this space. The Narrows also often exhibits artwork from local public and private high school students and works created by students from the nearby University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. Docent led tours and workshops for children are integral to visual arts programming at the Narrows. Since arts related activities are cost prohibitive to many, the Narrows provides free admission to the gallery during regular gallery hours. In doing so, the Narrows affords everyone a no-cost opportunity to view spectacular artwork. Concert-goers are also welcome to view the artwork on performance nights. = Art Community = :In addition to the art galleries, the Narrows provides studio space to several in-house local artists, ranging from painters and photographers to knitters and guitar-makers. Many of these studios are occupied during musical events. Local artwork is for sale - including jewelry, sculpture, paintings, photography, etc. The Art Community is located on the second floor of the building.  Performing Arts  The Narrows provides access to local, national, and international performing artists across several genres of music. = Music = :The venue has hosted local, national and international musical acts, including Duke Robillard, Eric Lindell, David Lindley, Johnny Winter, Eilen Jewell, Peter Wolf, Blue Oyster Cult, Susan Tedeschi, and local performers such as Roomful of Blues. = Comedy = :The Narrows occasionally hosts comedy events, with national acts such as Paula Poundstone as well as local comedians.  Education  The Narrows Center offers educational opportunities to the public and to local school students including hands-on workshops and exhibit space.

In time, this led to a period of commercial prosperity for the town and region. The Huizhou Hall was built, and it became the site of the town's annual Grand Lantern event. Huizhou wood was shipped from Nanjing to places like Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. The lively and prosperous port became the subject of scholarly and literary works. Shangxinhe novelist Ming Feng Meng was a successful Ming Dynasty novelist, with a widespread reputation for his foreboding stories. =Qing dynasty= The Shangxinhe timber trade reached its economic peak during the Qing dynasty. Markets for Qing Imperial wood had opened up in distant towns and cities along the Yangtze River, which were using it for myriad uses, e.g. construction and making furniture. Merchants operated and shipped lumber from Hunan, Dongting, and Poyang Lake. Shangxinhe wood suppliers had lucrative sales of Huizhou timber to Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and other places.

Although heavily damaged by fire in 1676, medieval mural fragments survive in the church, which also still has its medieval lychgate and preserved church stables. The church is associated with the Diocese of Visby of the Church of Sweden. History and architecture Fleringe Church is built of limestone and dates from the 13th century. The nave and choir are the oldest parts. Somewhat later during the same century the tower was added. The church has not been substantially altered since, but suffered damage in a heavy fire in 1676. The church is located in a cemetery surrounded by a low wall in which a remaining medieval lychgate still sits. Outside, the church stables still stand, which is uncommon. The façade of the church itself has decorated Gothic portals. Of these, the one in the tower is the most richly decorated. Inside, nothing remains of the medieval furnishings as they were destroyed in the 1676 fire. The main supporting pillar has a base taken from another, ruined, medieval church (in Gann, Gotland). This was probably done because the former base likewise had been damaged by fire. A few fragments of murals also survive, probably executed by the Master of the Passion of Christ (Passionsmästaren). The walls also have ornamental decoration from the late 16th century. The altarpiece is from 1701, the pulpit from 1726 and the pews also from the 18th century. The baptismal font carries the monogram of Christian IV of Denmark and originally belonged to the church of Visborg Castle.

After working his way up the ranks at a Philadelphia dry goods house, he began his own store in Burlington, Iowa in 1842. He became active in Iowa politics, serving in the Iowa Senate from 1854 to 1862. In 1855, he was the Democratic Party candidate to the United States Senate, but lost. In 1862, he moved to Chicago, Illinois to set up a banking house which became the Union National Bank of Chicago. Coolbaugh was also the father-in-law of Chief Justice of the United States Melville Fuller. Coolbaugh died of an apparent suicide in 1877. Biography William Findlay Coolbaugh was born in Pike County, Pennsylvania on July 1, 1821 to Moses and Mary Coolbaugh. He was raised on the family farm and attended school in the winter.

He took a position as an assistant porter in a dry goods house. When he was eighteen, he was promoted to confidential clerk. He continued to learn the trade and was eventually tasked with all Western operations of the dry goods house. In 1842, Coolbaugh left the house to set up his own operation in Burlington, Iowa. He sold goods for eight years, then left the business to become a banker. Co-founding Coolbaugh & Brooks, his bank was eventually merged into the Burlington Branch of the State Bank. Coolbaugh was active in early Iowa politics as a Democrat. The First General Assembly named him the state's first Loan Agent in 1847. He was a delegate to the 1852 Democratic National Convention and voted for Stephen A. Douglas in all 49 ballots. In 1854, Coolbaugh was elected to the Iowa Senate, serving until 1862.

Born in Derry, Canavan studied at St Columb's College in the city before entering business.Ted Nealon, Ireland: a Parliamentary Directory, 1973–1974, p.199 By the 1960s, he owned a chain of bookmakers, a salmon-processing factory and a pub in the city.Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson, Those are Real Bullets, Aren't They?, p.31 He was treasurer of the University for Derry Committee in 1965, and worked with John Hume to try to attract industry to the area.Paul Routledge, John Hume: a Biography, p.57 An advocate of credit unions, Canavan founded the Derry Credit Union with Hume and chaired it from 1963 to 1966, following which he spent a year as a director of the Irish League of Credit Unions. In 1968, he was elected as Chairman of the Derry Citizens' Action Committee, and was subsequently prominent in the Derry Citizens' Defence Association and chaired the Derry Citizens' Central Council. Canavan entered electoral politics as campaign manager for Hume at the 1969 Northern Ireland general election. Hume stood in Foyle as an independent and was elected.Raymond McClean, The road to Bloody Sunday, p.64 The following year, Canavan was a founder member of Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and served as its security spokesman for many years.John Potter, Testimony to Courage At the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election, he was elected for Londonderry, and he held his seat in 1975 on the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention.\\"Londonderry 1973–1982\\", Northern Ireland Elections However, he decided not to stand in the 1982 Assembly election, instead calling for the party to boycott to vote because there was no power-sharing in the proposed assembly.Sydney Elliot et al, The 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly election, p.23 He remained active in the SDLP for some time, and chaired Derry's civic committee during the mid-1980s.Northern Ireland Assembly: Official Report of Debates, vol.15 (1985), p.70 Canavan's brother Ivor was a prominent member of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland.Niall Ó Dochartaigh, From Civil Rights to Armalites, p.100 Canavan had a life long interesting the promotion of the university at Magee in Derry. He had been treasurer of John Hume's University for Derry Committee in 1965 but the university was placed in Coleraine instead. In 1985 he headed the Derry civic committee which saw the reopening of Magee with provost professor Robert Gavin and was granted an honorary degree in 1999. Today Magee has some 4,300 students and now has plans to await a government grant of 11 million pounds plus to launch a medical school which all parties support. The first students of the medical school should commence work in 2019 rising to 120 students after 5 years. Canavan was elected to Stormont parliament in 1979. In 1974-1982 he was the SDLP spokesman for law and order. After the civil rights march was beaten and brutalised on Derry streets, a meeting was called in Derry on October 5, 1968 to fight back peacefully. At the meeting he was elected as secretary of the Derry Citizens Committee, but he refused to serve until the word 'action' was inserted after the word citizens. The Derry Citizens Action Committee got 20,000 marchers to call peacefully for civil rights and were opposed by 3000 RUC. In the end the marchers found a byway which they used to get within the city walls, and thereafter myriad groups peacefully breached the Stormont ban which lay in ruins. Canavan was elected a founder member of Derry Credit Union and of Pennyburn Credit Union and served a 3 year term on the Credit Union League of Ireland. Credit unions are the people's bank, and the Derry Credit Union is one of the largest in the country. The defence association Free Derry was set up in July 1969 to protect the bogside public against the gas fired by the orange attackers and became Free Derry. From August 1969 it took control of Free Derry which was then run by Paddy 'Bogside' Doherty and Canavan. In the end the defence association consisted of 880 acres and 25,000 souls, within which only the writ of the defence association ran. The British army col Milman said of the defence committee that the citizens' association were the real peacemakers. The reforms obtained were the end of Stormont and the B Specials, and finally reform of the RUC.

The bill was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The administration of President Barack Obama delayed the sale of some oil and natural gas sales off the coasts of Virginia and South Carolina. This bill would require those sales to go forward. Louisiana and other states along the Gulf of Mexico will receive 37.5 percent of the off-shore royalty payments paid to the federal government for off-shore leases in that area beginning in 2017. The maximum royalty payout is currently $500 million, but would be increased to $1 billion in 2024 by this bill.

Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source. Title I would revise existing laws and policies regarding the development of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. Title I is similar to H.R. 2231, the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives on June 28, 2013. Differences in the estimates primarily reflect a later assumed enactment date. Title II would make certain amendments to the Mineral Leasing Act, require the United States Secretary of the Interior to conduct new activities related to oil and gas development on federal lands, and authorize the Secretary to conduct auctions for federal onshore oil and gas leases using Internet-based bidding methods. Title II contains provisions that are similar to those in H.R. 1965, the Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives on November 20, 2013, H.R. 1394; the Planning for American Energy Act of 2013, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July 24, 2013; H.R. 1964, the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska Access Act, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on June 12, 2013; and H.R. 555, the BLM Live Internet Auctions Act, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July 24, 2013. Differences in the estimates primarily reflect a later assumed enactment date. Procedural history The Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 19, 2014 by Rep. Doc Hastings (R-WA). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. The House voted in Roll Call Vote 368 on June 26, 2014 to pass the bill 229-185. Debate and discussion Rep. Hastings, who introduced the bill, argued that \\"the current turmoil in Iraq has already caused the price of gasoline to increase, and it serves as an important reminder of why we need to increase production here at home\\" because it is the \\"best way to protect ourselves from price spikes caused by international conflicts.\\" Hastings blamed President Obama for the high gas prices, saying that \\"since President Obama took office, gasoline prices have doubled and our federal energy resources have been put under tight lock-and- key.\\" Hastings also argued that the bill would \\"create over 1 million new American jobs.\\" Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-LO) supported the bill, arguing that the bill \\"would allow us to take advantage of our natural resources and expands our energy manufacturing and construction industries.\\" Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR) opposed the bill, arguing that it did not solve the true cause of high gas prices which he blamed on \\"Big Oil in the United States and speculation on Wall Street.\\" DeFazio called the bill the \\"drill everywhere\\" bill.

There are over 100 NGOs operating in the health care sector in Sierra Leone. The Ministry of Health and Sanitation is responsible for organizing health care and after the end of the civil war the ministry changed to a decentralized structure of health provision to try to increase its coverage. Infrastructure Sierra Leone is divided into 13 health districts that correspond to the districts of Sierra Leone except for the Western Area Rural and Western Area Urban districts which are combined into the Western Area Health district. Each district has a health management team and an average of 50 peripheral health units (PHU) and over 100 technical staff. The management team is responsible for planning, organizing and monitoring health provision, training personnel, working with communities and supplying equipment and drugs. The PHUs are designed to be the delivery point for primary health care in the country and there are three main types. * The community health centre carries out health prevention measures, cures and health promotion activities and is in charge of overseeing the other PHUs in the area. It is planned that each chiefdom, the unit of local government in Sierra Leone below the level of district, should have at least one community health centre. * Community health posts perform a similar function to community health centres but have fewer facilities and are used to refer patients to the health centre or the district hospital. * Maternal and Child Health posts are the first level of contact on the ground and are located in smaller towns of with populations between 500-2000. Much of the health care infrastructure was decimated during the Civil War and the health service is still in the process of being organised with hospitals and PHU being rebuilt or created and staff being trained. Free healthcare scheme In April 2010 Sierra Leone launched \\"Free Health Care Medical Insurance\\", a system of free healthcare for pregnant and breast-feeding women and children under five. A UN population Fund representative said that medical equipment had been ordered and some drugs distributed as part of the new healthcare scheme but the coverage was not yet 100%. The initial set up cost of the scheme was $19 million and it is expected to save the lives of more than a million mothers and children. Healthcare workers had gone on strike over the plans in March 2010 arguing that free healthcare would increase their workload and working hours, the government settled the dispute with pay rises of 200-500%. Observers argue that many of the women concerned do not even know they have a right for free medical care and that the law would remain a paper tiger if more earnings from the extractive sector was not invested in the countries healthcare system. The scheme is funded mainly by the United Kingdom and United Nations who have paid to refurbish hospitals, supply drugs and pay healthcare professionals' wages. The UK alone has agreed to pay for a years worth of drugs for the program and the World Health Organization has provided blood banks in each major town. The British government's funding came from the Department for International Development (DFID) and amounted to $22.6 million to fund the scheme for the next three years from a total allocation of $70.5 million for the 10-year-long \\"Reproduction and Child Health Care\\" plan. UNICEF also received $7 million from DFID to provide medicines for pregnant women. = Hospitals = Nurse at Koidu Hospital consulting with patients. * Connaught Hospital * Hatfield Archer Memorial Hospital, Rotifunk * Kerry Town Ebola clinic * Koidu Hospital * Ola During Children's Hospital * Princess Christian Maternity Hospital * Masanga Hospital * Sierra Leone Psychiatric Hospital * St John of God Hospital * Government Hospital Pujehun =Traditional medicine= Traditional medicine forms part of the primary health care system in Sierra Leone.

Members of the programme have also located and collected plants from throughout Sierra Leone used for medicine. The use of traditional medicine in Sierra Leone is common especially for the treatment of malaria and among hypertensive patients, pregnant women, infertile women lactating mothers, Ebola survivors and healthcare students.

After college he ran with the Athletics West track club, one of the first mega teams sponsored by Nike. He was United States (Amateur Athletic Union) National Champion in 1973 and 1980. Olympic athlete Brown competed for the United States in two Olympic Games, running the steeplechase at the 1972 and 1976 Olympics. He qualified for the 1980 U.S. Olympic team but did not compete due to the U.S. Olympic Committee's boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Russia. He was one of 461 athletes to receive a Congressional Gold Medal instead. He was a surprise second place at the 1972 Olympic Trials, sprinting from a battle to make the team around leading contender and hometown favorite, Steve Savage, who had been battling Mike Manley for the lead. In 1976, with 1972 winner Manley injured hitting a barrier in the first few laps of the race, Brown outsprinted Henry Marsh and picked up the win by 0.03 of a second.

Playing a racing video game on Single Large Surface (SLS) with a 5x1 portrait display group configuration at ExtravaLANza 2012 in Toronto. AMD Eyefinity is a brand name for AMD video card products that support multi-monitor setups by integrating multiple (up to six) display controllers on one GPU. AMD Eyefinity was introduced with the Radeon HD 5000 Series \\"Evergreen\\" in September 2009 and has been available on APUs and professional-grade graphics cards branded AMD FirePro as well. AMD Eyefinity supports a maximum of 2 non-DisplayPort displays (e.g., HDMI, DVI, VGA, DMS-59, VHDCI) (which AMD calls \\"legacy output\\") and up to 6 DisplayPort displays simultaneously using a single graphics card or APU. To feed more than two displays, the additional panels must have native DisplayPort support. Alternatively active DisplayPort-to- DVI/HDMI/VGA adapters can be employed. The setup of large video walls by connecting multiple computers over Gigabit Ethernet or Ethernet is also supported. The version of AMD Eyefinity (aka DCE, display controller engine) introduced with Excavator-based Carrizo APUs features a Video underlay pipe.  Overview AMD Eyefinity is implemented by multiple on-die display controllers. The 5000-series designs host two internal clocks and one external clock. Displays connected over VGA, DVI, or HDMI each require their own internal clock. But all displays connected over DisplayPort can be driven from only one external clock. This external clock is what allows Eyefinity to fuel up to six monitors from a single card. The entire HD 5000 series of products have Eyefinity capabilities supporting three outputs. The Radeon HD 5870 Eyefinity Edition, however, supports six mini DisplayPort outputs, all of which can be simultaneously active. The display controller has two RAMDACs that drive the VGA or DVI ports in analog mode. For example, when a DVI-to-VGA converter is attached to a DVI port). It also has a maximum of six digital transmitters that can output either a DisplayPort signal or a TMDS signal for either DVI or HDMI, and two clock signal generators to drive the digital outputs in TMDS mode. Dual-link DVI displays use two of the TMDS/DisplayPort transmitters and one clock signal each. Single-link DVI displays and HDMI displays use one TMDS/DisplayPort transmitter and one clock signal each. DisplayPort displays use one TMDS/DisplayPort transmitter and no clock signal. An active DisplayPort adapter can convert a DisplayPort signal to another type of signal—like VGA, single-link DVI, or dual-link DVI; or HDMI if more than two non-DisplayPort displays must be connected to a Radeon HD 5000 series graphics card. DisplayPort 1.2 added the possibility to drive multiple displays on single DisplayPort connector, called Multi-Stream Transport (MST). AMD graphics solutions equipped with DisplayPort 1.2 outputs can run multiple monitors from a single port. At High-Performance Graphics 2010 Mark Fowler presented the Evergreen and stated that e.g. 5870 (Cypress), 5770 (Juniper) and 5670 (Redwood) support max resolution of the 6 times 2560×1600 pixels, while the 5470 (Cedar) supports 4 times 2560×1600 pixels.  Availability  = Feature overview for AMD graphics cards = All AMD GPUs starting with the Evergreen series support a maximum of 2 non-DisplayPort displays and a maximum of 6 DisplayPort displays per graphics card. = Feature overview for AMD APUs = AMD Eyefinity is also available in AMD's APU branded product line. The A10-7850K is said to support up to four displays.  Software support  Support for the Eyefinity display controller is available in the Linux kernel device driver amdgpu and accessible via the DRM/KMS API. AMD Catalyst supports Eyefinity and enables the user to independently configure and run each attached displays. It facilitates the configuration of \\"cloned mode\\", i.e. to copy one desktop onto multiple screens or \\"extended mode\\", i.e. to span the workspace across multiple screens and combine the resolutions of all of those displays into one big resolution. AMD calls the extended modes Single Large Surface (SLS) and Catalyst support of certain range of display group configurations. For example, 5x1 landscape and 5x1 portrait are supported since AMD Catalyst version 11.10 from October 2011. Starting in Catalyst 14.6, AMD supports mixed resolution support, so a single Eyefinity display group can drive each monitor at a different resolution. This is provided through two new Eyefinity display modes, Fit and Expand, in addition to the existing Fill mode. In Fit or Expand mode, AMD compensates for mismatched resolutions by creating a virtual desktop of a different resolution than the monitors, and then either padding it out or cropping it as is necessary. AMD Eyefinity works with games that support non-standard aspect ratios, which is required for panning across multiple displays. SLS (\\"Single Large Surface\\") mode requires an identical display resolution on all configured displays. AMD validated some video games to support Eyefinity. The short list includes titles such as Age of Conan, ARMA 2: Operation Arrowhead, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat, Serious Sam 3: BFE, Singularity (video game), Sleeping Dogs, Assassin's Creed II, Sniper Elite V2, Soldier of Fortune Online, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed 2, Marvel Super Hero Squad Online, R.U.S.E., Supreme Commander 2 among others. However, some games not on this short list seem to work as well, e.g. Dirt 3 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. KMS driver supports AMD Eyefinity.

Description  The genus Supramontana is characterized by the presence of a cephalic retractor muscle not associated with cephalic glands. This muscle is similar to the one found in the genera Issoca and Luteostriata, but in Supramontana the organ lacks cephalic glands, which are present in the other two genera. The copulatory apparatus of Supramontana has a permanent penis papilla and a long common ovovitelloduct.  Etymology  The name Supramontana comes from the Latin words supra (on the top) and montanus (of the mountains). It is a reference to the type-locality of Supramontana irritata, the city of São Francisco de Paula, in Southern Brazil, whose previous name was São Francisco de Paula de Cima da Serra (on the top of the mountains).  Species  There are two described species in the genus Supramontana: *Supramontana argentina Negrete et al., 2014 *Supramontana irritata Carbayo & Leal-Zanchet, 2003  Phylogeny  A molecular study on the phylogeny of the subfamily Geoplaninae nested the genus Supramontana inside the genus Luteostriata. The two genera formed a monophyletic clade with the genus Issoca. The clade is supported by at least one synapomorphy, the presence of a cephalic retractor muscle derived from the longitudinal cutaneous ventral musculature that anteriorly dissipates by detaching its fibers, making them open in a fan-like fashion towards the body margins.

In anticipation she and her best friend Duncanty create a list of things that they want to accomplish this summer. The most important is to win the county fair pie eating contest. Terry hears a noise and meets a hot boy named Brett who is moving in across the street from Terry. Right when Terry is about to talk to him, Brittanica, Terry's nemesis and former friend, swoops in and tells Brett lies about Terry. Terry gets mad and goes home. As summer passes, Terry feels awkward and sick. Terry realizes she is in love with Brett, but Brittanica gets in the way so she asks her brother for help and he advises her to become a cheerleader. Terry gives up on cheerleading after an infamous failure at the tryouts. Desperate, Terry becomes a girly girl to catch Brett's eye.

It is an organization working in eleven districts of Maharashtra, organizing farmers and toilers on issues of drought, dam and project eviction, and caste oppression. The Shramik Mukti Dal (SMD) follows an ideology not simply based on Marxism but on Marx-Phule-Ambedkarism. Smdflag1 SMD has been instrumental in waging a movement for water rights for more that two decades. Much of development was uncontrolled, rapacious excavation of sand from riverbeds for the construction industry in drought- prone areas of Western Maharashtra, which had led to the drying up of the wells in the nearby farms. SMD along with local communities, socially committed ecological engineers, science-activists and other activists, progressive intellectuals, and media people led a prolonged, successful struggle to stop this unlimited excavation of this sand and built the Baliraja dam. This idea came out of detailed discussions with the people of the villages -Balawadi and Tandulwadi on the two sides of the river Yerala. The idea was that people in the villages will receive preferential right to excavate a limited amount of sand in the river in their village, sell it after paying due royalty to the government. This money financed finance the Baliraja dam, which helped eliminate the effects drought in these two villages. Some of the leading members include Bharat Patankar (President and Full-time Organizer] , Waharu Sonawane (Vice President and well-known Adivasi poet and activist), Sampat Desai (National Organizer), Indutai Patankar, Gail Omvedt, Mukti Sadhna (Shramik Muktiwadi Yuva Sanghatna), Rahul Savita (Shramik Muktiwadi Yuva Sanghatna), Shailesh Sawant (Shramik Muktiwadi Yuva Sanghatna). Smdyouth1 History Shramik Mukti Dal was founded in the 1980s by activists in Maharashtra, influenced not only by the radical Marxist movement but also by feminists and anti-caste movements. The Shramik Mukti Dal fights for alternatives in today’s inequalitarian, caste, class and gender-ridden ecologically unsustainable society. The following have been some of its accomplishments: Smd2013 * The initial effort was a peasant-built and managed small dam, the Bali Raja Dam. This came out of the movement fighting drought in Khanapur taluka of Sangli district. Farmers saw the sand being auctioned from the dried-up river bed, so much that it was depleting the water aquifers and increasing the drought. They said, “Why don’t we stop this, use the sand once for funds to build our own dam which will seal in the water and irrigate our lands” After a struggle of many years the dam was built, with careful removal of the sand and providing water according to the principles of SMD on an equalitarian basis: even the landless would get a share of water. It remains the only dam built and managed by the people. Baliraja Dam Inauguration * SMD has recognized the necessity of an autonomous cultural movement. It has been instrumental in starting such movements and is a part of the Balijan cultural movement at the national level. At present a major campaign is the “Vithal-Rukmai mukti andolan.” A state high court decision regarding the Vitthala temple at Pandharpur, the most popular in Maharashtra, turned the management over to a committee, with several obnoxious provisos: that it be made up only of “Hindus” (when the entire movement always included Muslims and others as well); that the purush sukta which was the earliest proclamation of caste-varna be recited (which is against the anti-caste and anti-Vedic principles of the movement); that priests wear silken clothes (which is against the “bahujan” nature of the deity). The SMD is fighting to have these clauses removed from the act, and to turn the temple management over to a committee chosen from the Varkaris, made up of men and women in equal numbers and with representation of all castes. SMD 2011 * In regard to the notorious SEZs, the SMD has led a movement in Alibag taluka of Raigad district against a thermal power project of the Tata and Reliance groups. It is the only movement which has succeeded in stopping such a huge project. The alternative it has offered is for a “people’s SEZ” in which farmers would keep ownership of their land and themselves install various ecologically sustainable energy-producing devices. .[“Towards a prosperous and Beautiful Konkan: An Alternative Energy Plan to the Proposed Power Projects in the Konkan” (SMD, n.d.). Smd sitin * The building of windmills has been an important recent project of the government, turning land over to huge multinational companies. These have been forcibly acquiring the land at very low rates from the farmers. With the argument that “the wind over our land is ours” and we have the right to a share in the development that windmills provide, the farmers in Sangli and Satara districts have fought for keeping ownership of the land and giving it on lease to the companies at the rate of Rs 200,000 per acre. In addition, the village panchayats get Rs 15,000 per megawatt per year from the energy generated. Its victory has been to force the government to agree to these principles. SMD Dam Affected people's resistance - Arrested members * SMD leads one of the biggest movement of dam evictees in Maharashtra and most advanced in India. The movement does not oppose dams as such but has several main principles. It has proposed and won changes that reduce the land submerged and the number of evictees. “First rehabilitation, then the dam,” is another principle. Then, farmers are given land within the command area where the irrigation will benefit them as well, and have been collected a “water allowance” until the irrigation is completed. Fights regarding several dams – Uchangi, Urmode, Wang, -- in eight districts of Maharashtra have been carried out on this basis. Finally, women among the dam evictees are recognized as independent holders of rehabilitated land. Smddrought * Through supporting its women's wing, Stree Mukti Sangharsh, Stri Mukti Sangarsh Calval (Women’s Liberation Struggle Movement; after SMS) that was founded on March 1985 worked on issues of drought and water in Khanapur taluka of Sangli district. It took up the slogan of “hirvi dharti, stri shakti, manav mukti” (green earth, women’s power, human liberation). Women in Stree Mukti Sangharsh came from general anti-drought movements and also took up issues as alcoholism, dowry deaths, atrocities against women, and discrimination on Employment Guarantee Scheme's schemes. One of the worst issues faced women in the area were by deserted women came from all castes and communities. \\"Deserted women, cast-away women, thrown away women or parityakta- taklelya striya are different terms used interchangeably for women who are thrown out of their marital homes or in some cases who have chosen to step out themselves.\\" SMS/SMD has led a long struggle with the deserted women 'parityaktas\\" to get plots of land from the government, land that was allotted to 'homeless' people. After decades of organizing they won the land. They continue to fight to keep the land.SMD Adhiveshan Smdwomen SMD open session Shramik Mukti Dal leads a movement of equitable water distribution from 1983 onwards. It was successful in forcing the government to change the plans of the command areas from inequitable basis to equitable water distribution patterns, thereby providing minimum water of sustainability by doing agriculture, etc. In 2005, the Government of Maharashtra approved Tasgaon- Atpadi Equitable Water Distribution Alternative, awarding water rights, even to the landless. SMD is a major leading constituent of the Pro-People Water Strategy Form (Loiabhimukh Pani Dhoran Sangarsh Manch). Caste annihilation movement: by organizing caste annihilation conferences, SMD has started a struggle on the basis of a practical program going towards caste annihilation. I has been taking lead in fighting against atrocities on dalits and other oppressed castes Smdblacklives Manifesto An excerpt from the SMD manifesto: > A revolution that creates a new ecologically balanced, prosperous, non- > exploitative society is not an “event” that takes place in one day. It is > necessary to start this process of revolutionary transformation from today > itself. Briefly, revolution is not a single “event” but a “process” that > makes change.

With a length of approximately , it is the third longest watercourse in Denmark, and has a catchment area of . The river flows through the municipalities of Varde and Esbjerg, forming the boundary between them along parts of its course. Course The Varde is formed by the confluence of the Grindsted and the Ansager.\\"Varde Å\\", Den Store Danske, retrieved 6 July 2014 Approximately downstream from that point, the majority of the river's flow was diverted by a weir into the Ansager Canal leading to a reservoir, Lake Karlsgårde, to be used for hydroelectric power generation at the Karlsgårde Hydroelectric Plant near Varde. Since 2006, the plant operator, Sydvest Energi, has given up its rights to dam and divert watercourses in the Varde drainage basin, and the river now flows past Hodde, bypassing the reservoir, which is now fed only by the Holme River. The plant is to be entirely closed down by the end of 2015. In its lower reaches the river winds past the estate of Nørholm, and at Sig, past Sig Fiskeri, one of the largest fish farms in Denmark. The fish farm continues to draw water from the river, because the owner believes the groundwater contains too much iron oxide. The Holme then flows into the Varde, bringing with it the water from Lake Karlsgårde. The river flows around the town of Varde and empties into the Ho Bugt bay north of Esbjerg. The Varde is the only major tidal river in Denmark whose outlet is not regulated with dykes and sluice gates. As a result, the river remains under the influence of natural forces; for example, the tides in the bay affect both water level and flow rate far upriver, often as far as the outflow from Lake Karlsgårde. =Municipal boundaries= For part of its course the Varde makes up the boundary between Varde Municipality and Esbjerg Municipality. =Parish boundaries= For parts of its course the Varde makes up the boundary between the following parishes: * Ansager and Skovlund * Hodde and Thorstrup * Thorstrup and Øse * Thorstrup and Næsbjerg * Varde and Næsbjerg * Varde Sogn and Alslev * Janderup and Alslev * Janderup and Hostrup * Billum and Hostrup History The long stretch of the Varde between the Ansager weir and the inflow from Lake Karlsgårde lost approximately 90% of its flow in 1945 when the Karlsgårde Hydroelectric Plant, originally constructed in the 1920s, was expanded with the construction of the Ansager Canal to draw water from the Varde as well as the Holme. In the 1950s, the section of the river between Hessel and Nørholm was dredged and straightened. Originally long, with 35 bends, this stretch was reduced in length to a straight channel long with four concrete sections. A large part of the straightening of the river has been reversed beginning in 2009 in a land restoration project supported by the Actions for Houting project of the European Union LIFE Programme.The Houting- project, Ministry of the Environment of Denmark, 2006.Delprojekt: Genopretning af Varde Å, Actions for Houting, Ministry of the Environment of Denmark, 22 December 2005 (pdf) The lower river valley, west of Varde, was previously under intensive cultivation, among other uses for the production of horse feed with EU support. Beginning in 1994-95, farmers have modified their practices, no longer using fertiliser and keeping vegetation cut, which it is hoped in association with the higher water table will restore habitat for birds, in particular the endangered corncrake. In 1997-2002 more than 250 voluntarily signed 20-year agreements under Operation Engsnarre (Operation Corncrake), also supported by the EU LIFE Programme. Aquatic life The Varde River is home to many species of fish, including brown trout, grayling, pike and houting, and also salmon and sea trout, which attract many sport anglers. Fishing in the river is managed by the Grindsted Sportsfiskerforening (sport fishing association), Varde Sportsfiskerforening and Sydvestjydsk (Southwest Jutland) Sportsfiskerforening. The river is also the only habitat in Denmark of the freshwater pearl mussel.\\"Sporet ved Varde Å\\", Spor i Landskabet, retrieved 6 July 2014 The Varde River together with the lower reaches of the Ansager and the Grindsted has been designated an EU Special Area of Conservation. The designation also covers the majority of the existing lowlands in the river valley. In the designation, the houting and the freshwater pearl mussel were identified as priority species; especial weight is to be given to fulfilment of provisions relating to their habitat.

Life D'Alton was born at his father's ancestral mansion, Bessville, County Westmeath, on 20 June 1792; his mother was Elizabeth Leyne. He was sent to the school of the Rev. Joseph Hutton, Summer Hill, Dublin, and passed the entrance examination of Trinity College, Dublin, in his fourteenth year, 1806. He became a student in 1808, joined the College Historical Society, and gained the prize for poetry. Having graduated, he was in 1811 admitted a law student of the Middle Temple, London, and the King's Inns. He was called to the Irish bar in 1813. D'Alton mainly confined himself to chamber practice, and attended the Connaught circuit, having married a lady of that province, Miss Phillips. He received many fees in the important Irish family causes of Malone v. O'Connor, Leamy v. Smith, Jago v. Hungerford, and others. With the exception of an appointment as commissioner of the Loan Fund Board, he held no official position, but a civil list pension of £50, granted while Lord John Russell was prime minister, was some recognition. In his last years, D'Alton's health confined him to his house, but he received guests and worked on an autobiography. He died 20 January 1867. Works D'Alton's first publication was a metrical poem, Dermid, or the Days of Brian Boru, in twelve cantos. In 1827 the Royal Irish Academy offered a prize of £80 and the Cunningham gold medal for an essay on the Irish people to the twelfth century; D'Alton obtained the top prize and medal, and his essay, which was read 24 November 1828, occupied the first part of vol. xvi. of the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy. In 1831 he also gained the prize offered by the Royal Irish Academy for an account of the reign of Henry II of England in Ireland. For illustrations of Irish topography contributed to the Irish Penny Journal, started in January 1833, D'Alton collected information on druidical stones, the raths and fortresses of the early colonists, especially of the Anglo- Normans, the castles of the Plantagenets, Elizabethan mansions, Cromwellian keeps, and the ruins of abbeys. Drawings were supplied by Samuel Lover. In 1838 D'Alton published Memoirs of the Archbishops of Dublin, and in the same year History of the County of Dublin. His next work was an illustrated book The History of Drogheda and its Environs, containing a memoir of the Dublin and Drogheda Railway. There followed the Annals of Boyle, to which Robert King, 1st Viscount Lorton, the proprietor, contributed £300 towards the publication. D'Alton published in 1855 King James II's Irish Army List, 1689, which contained the names of most of the prominent Irish families, with historical and genealogical illustrations, and subsequently enlarged in separate volumes, for cavalry and infantry. They bring the history of most families to the date of publication. Another work was legal, a treatise on the Law of Tithes. At the end of his life, in 1864, D'Alton was asked to write a History of Dundalk that was completed by James Roderick O'Flanagan.

Tana Toa consists of hamlets: # Balagana # Jannayya # Bantalang # Pangi # Sobbu # Balambina # Benteng # Luraya # Tombolo Out of the nine hamlets in Tana Toa, eight of them are in the traditional Ammatoa customs zone totally occupy area of about or more than 55% of the village total area, while Jannayya is not. Culture The village is named Tana Toa (from local language meaning the oldest land in the world according to the customary beliefs of the villagers). People of Tana Toa believe that the earth was first created by God in a forest called Tombolo. The area was believed to be the oldest area in the world, so the villagers named the area as Tana Toa. Geographically and administratively, Tana Toa is inhabited by Konjo people, a sub ethnic of Buginese. The indigenous people of Konjo divided into two sub-groups called Konjo Gunung (Mountain Konjo) and Konjo Pesisir (Coastal Konjo)., who speak the Highland and Coastal Konjo language. The Konjo Pegunungan (Mountain Konjo) primarily live in the mountainous region of Konjo, in the districts of Tinggimoncong, Gowa, Sinjai and Bone. The Konjo Pesisir people (also known as Tiro) live in the districts of Kajang, Herlang, Bonto Tiro and Bonto Bahari in the east area of the Bulukumba Regency. The Konjo Pesisir speak the Konjo language in several dialects, namely Tana Toa, Konjo Hitam and Kajang. The Konjo Hitam (Black Konjo) people, who are included among the Konjo Pesisir, occupy an area to the west of Kajang. These Konjo Hitam consider themselves the original inhabitants and regard their area as the center of traditional custom for all of the Konjo Pesisir. This Konjo Hitam tribe is also known as Kajang tribe. Kajang tribe is divided into two groups, inner Kajang and Outer Kajang tribes. The traditional Inner Kajang tribe scatters in several villages, including the village of Tana Toa, Bonto Baji, Malleleng, Pattiroang, Batu Nilamung and some parts of Tambangan village. The Inner Kajang tribe lives in the area bordered with Tuli in the north, Limba in the east, Seppa in the South, and Doro in the west. While the Outer Kajang tribe population spreads throughout much of the Kajang District and in some villages in the Bulukumba Regency, such as Jojolo, Tibona, Bonto Minasa and Batu Lohe However, only Inner Kajang tribe live in full customs of Ammatoa. The tribe are known for their motto Kamase-masea, or a simple living and reluctance to adopt many conveniences of modern technology. For them, technology objects can have negative impacts on their lives, because they undermine the sustainability of natural resources. The tribe people always wear black clothes, such as pants that almost touch knees, sarong, robe, and headband. These people also practice occultism as part of their animistic worship. They are referred to as the indigenous people of Kajang. The simplicity is also applied to their residence. All houses in Tana Toa are stilt houses constructed and made of the same material made of wood with roofs of straw. All houses even face the same direction facing the west. The bathroom is located in front of the house and without doors. Kajang people do not recognize social stratification, they assume men are all equal. They also assume that they are the oldest Konjo, and regard their territory as the Centrum of all descendants of the traditional Konjo people. The word Ammatoa or Amma Toa is a Konjo word for Old Father. It means that the Kajang tribe is led by a Ammatoa figure (Tribal chief). A successful candidate to replace previous Ammatoa is chosen through a long and complicated process. The tribe believe that the chosen Ammatoa receives instructions from Turae Ra’na (God). He must also be able to recite a series of myths and genealogies flawlessly without ever having studied them. Ammatoa society hold the Patuntung belief, a belief for sustainability of forest ecosystems. The Ammatoa position is for life, and is replaced only when the incumbent dies. The main source of life for Kajang tribe is agriculture and plantations. Most of the men working in farms or paddy fields during the day to meet the needs. When planting season arrives they flock to the fields that are located a few kilo-meters from their homes. They use horses as transportation to the rice fields and water buffaloes for plowing the fields. People who do not have farms or fields usually work for the owners of the fields. Women usually work at home weaving fabrics. They weave fabrics to be used to make black sarongs called Tope Le'leng. They also sell the woven fabrics to visitors as additional revenue. Religion Konjo people are 100% Muslims, but 75% of the people still retain animistic practice. Even the most devout Muslims fear of spirits and do whatever it takes to please these spirits. When there is a conflict between the teachings of Islam and their traditional practices, traditional practices will win. Most children learn to read the Koran and every ceremony is considered not complete without Koran recitation, even though they do not understand the meaning. Climate and ecology The forest in Tana Toa is called Borong Karama (meaning Sacred Forest) with the area of . Tana Toa is rich with Bitti wood (Vitex cofasus). The wood is the main material to make hull frames of phinisi boat, because the wood is naturally in curved shape. Animals commonly found in the forest are deer, pigs, monkeys and jungle fowls. The flora and fauna in Tana Toa are conserved by local community, not only because of the penalties as mush as tallu lasa’ (about 1.2 millions of rupiah), but also because they are afraid of a curse as the result of breaking the old tradition of the antecedents, Pasanga ri Kajang.

The average annual high temperature in Tana Toa is around and the average annual low temperature is .

He was blamed for the confusion with Olympic accreditations, particularly because his daughter Kristina received the accreditation and was sent as an interpreter with the Russian snowboarding team, while Irina Zhuk, the coach of skaters Jana Khokhlova / Sergei Novitski, was not able to get the Olympic accreditation and had to stay in Russia. In 2010 interview Irina Rodnina criticised Pissev for not doing his job and for expecting others \\"to do work for him\\". She also commented that he has \\"no authority, and no respect\\" among international colleagues. Elena Tchaikovskaia stated that Piseev only listened \\"to one adviser\\", which was his wife, and criticized him for making a \\"family business\\" out of figure skating. She also told that he \\"has hampered the work of coaches he does not like, got rid of opponents, and surrounded himself with people who agree with him\\". Piseev was criticized for holding the position of the president for too long; for being too conservative; for pushing certain skaters at the expense of others and supporting only selected skaters. Anton Sikharulidze commented on the presidential election that functions of the president were changed and \\"limited to representative\\", and the whole post turned nominal, while real power belongs to the general director. However Tatiana Tarasova approved Piseev's appointment as a general director of the Figure Skating Federation, stating he \\"is no friend of mine\\", but \\"not using his knowledge and international authority would be very wrong\\".

She is a podcaster, singer/songwriter and playwright as well as a widely read columnist with SF Weekly in San Francisco.  Personal  Siouxsie Q is based in San Francisco and is married to fellow podcaster and journalist Jesse James. They have a polyamorous relationship.  Career  After appearing on amateur sites Dare Ring and being a contributor to the sellyoursextape videos (Ashley & Dakota) in 2010, Siouxsie Q left her retail job and began dancing at The Lusty Lady Theater, a unionized peep show in North Beach, San Francisco. Shortly after, she began her career as a sex worker while living in Inner Richmond, commuting to an apartment in East Bay to conduct business. Initially using the Internet primarily as a marketing tool, Siouxsie has stated that podcasts have \\"really transformed how I do business\\". By 2012, she had settled into her career and, at the urging of her boyfriend, began a regular, biweekly podcast as a way to speak out against California's Proposition 35, Measure B. Originally called, \\"This American Whore\\", the podcast's name was eventually changed to \\"The WhoreCast\\" after a dispute with This American Life, the public radio program. After the passing of Proposition 35, the podcast was expanded to cover a broad range of topics such as transgender issues, sexuality, sex workers' rights, politics and pornography. In 2014, she began writing a regular column for SF Weekly in which she discusses the topics of pornography, feminism, sexuality and the sex work industry. She was jointly nominated for Best All-Girl Group Sex Scene at the 2015 AVN Awards.  Political views  By way of her podcast, \\"The WhoreCast\\", Siouxsie Q emerged as an outspoken opponent of California's Proposition 35, Measure B, a part of the Californians Against Sexual Exploitation Act. In her broadcasts, she stated that she considered the proposition \\"a confusing piece of legislation\\" that too broadly expanded the definition of “trafficking” to include anyone who lived with or derived support from someone who is a prostitute. In response, The WhoreCast was established as \\"a vehicle to really humanize sex work\\" and as a way to oppose Proposition 35. She also utilized the podcast to speak out against Assembly Bill 1576, a bill that would require condoms be worn in all adult films made in California. She described the bill as \\"part of a multipronged strategy ... to shut down the porn industry in California\\". In 2013, she was featured on CNN after organizing an Obamacare registration drive dubbed the \\"Healthy Ho's Party.\\" The event, designed to encourage sex workers to enroll in newly established insurance exchanges, was declared a success, with nearly 40 attendees filing enrollment paperwork.

Most of the inhabitants are Sunni Muslims, in contrast to the majority of Byblos District's population, which is largely Maronite Christian with a significant Shia Muslim minority.Laqlouq. Localiban. Localiban. 2007-04-28. History Laqlouq was founded in the 18th century by Arabs who are known today as ′Arab al-Laqlouq. Their presence dates back to the era of Emir Bashir Shihab II, who granted the village residents their lands and who vacationed there in the summer months. The original residents are generally poorer than the newer arrivals who immigrated to the village from nearby areas. Laqlouq Mountain 2016 Visitors to Laqlouq in 1957 reported having a disturbed night whilst camping near the village due to gunfire and explosions as the district celebrated the release from prison of local land owner Sheikh Georges Beg Yussef. He had been sentenced to life in prison in Cairo for drug smuggling. His release was secured by local politician Hamid Beik Frangieh who had personally lobbied Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser on Yussef's behalf.Izzard, Ralph and Molly (1959) Smelling the Breezes.

The village's main economic sector is agriculture, but its harvests are seasonally dependent, namely during the summer and fall, which is why most working residents are employed outside the village during the rest of the year. The main crops are apples, plums and vegetables. Local government Laqlouq's municipal council consisting of nine members, headed by a chairman, who was Ahmad Khodr as of 2007. It also is administered by a village council, which has three members led by a mayor, who was Hasan Salim as of 2007. The village council of Salim was elected in 1998. With the exception of a locally funded summer school, there are no educational institutions in the village, whose municipal projects have been hindered due to a lack of revenue.

Dr. Young's Ideal Rectal Dilators exhibited in the museum The Glore Psychiatric Museum is part of a complex of St. Joseph, Missouri, museums, along with the Black Archives Museum, the St. Joseph Museum, and the American Indian and History Galleries. The Glore exhibits feature the 130-year history of the adjacent state mental hospital, and illustrate the history of mental health treatment through the ages. It has been called one of the fifty most unusual museums in the United States. History The collection began in 1966 when George Glore, an employee of the Missouri Department of Mental Health, built some life-size models of primitive devices formerly used for mental health treatment, for display during a Mental Health Awareness Week. The models, together with a growing collection of other artifacts, became a museum in 1967, designed to illustrate how the treatment of mental illness has progressed through time. Glore explained, \\"We really can't have a good appreciation of the strides we've made (in mental health treatment) if we don't look at the atrocities of the past.\\" Glore continued to add to the collection throughout his 41-year career with the department. After his retirement in the 1990s he continued to serve as the museum's curator until his death in 2010, after which Scott Clark became curator. At first the museum was housed in a ward of the original \\"State Lunatic Asylum No. 2\\", renamed the \\"St. Joseph State Hospital\\" in 1899. The asylum was built in 1874 and resembled a fortress. From an initial population of 25 patients it expanded until it housed nearly 3,000 patients in the 1950s. In the 1990s it was re- purposed as a state prison, and a new 108-bed facility called Northwest Missouri Psychiatric Rehabilitation opened across the street from the original hospital. The Glore Museum moved to a 1968 building outside the prison gates that was originally a clinic for patients at the mental hospital. Exhibits The museum displays many artifacts from the mental hospital, including medical equipment, staff uniforms, photographs, and artwork and writing created by the patients. One exhibit tells the story of a man who spent 72 years as a patient in the hospital. Some of the most notable exhibits are the full-sized models, built by Glore, of treatment devices from the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. One such item is a \\"Tranquilizer Chair\\", complete with hood, hand and feet restraints and a built-in portable toilet to accommodate extended sessions. The chair was invented by Benjamin Rush, known as \\"The Father of American Psychiatry\\", who published the first American textbook about mental illness in 1812. Other items include the \\"Bath of Surprise\\", a platform designed to quickly submerse the patient into a bath of ice water; the \\"Giant Patient Treadmill,\\" which would encourage agitated patients to remain still, lest they become exhausted by causing movement of the giant wheel; the \\"Lunatic Box\\", an upright, coffin-like box in which patients who were deemed uncontrollable were confined until they calmed down; and the \\"O'Halloran's Swing\\", a hammock-like device used to calm an agitated patient or induce sleep.

The pattern on the elytra is greatly variable - in a study of 478 beetles, 29 variations on this pattern were identified. Distribution and habitat Z. bicolorata is native to Mexico, but has been introduced to parts of India and Australia. Adults and larvae are used as a form of biological pest control in India in order to control invasive Parthenium hysterophorus .  Life cycle  Eggs are generally laid on the ventral surface of both young and old leaves, and occasionally on the upper surface of leaves, stems and flowers of host plants. Eggs are yellow to orange, elongate cylindrical or oblong with fine reticulations on the surface. The eggs hatch in 4–5 days. Larvae are pale yellow, turning white as they grow, feeding for 10 to 15 days on leaves whilst growing through four instar stages. On maturity the larvae enter the soil and pupate below up to 15 cm depth. The total life cycle of the beetle is just over 100 days. =Predators= An undetermined species of fly in the genus Drino (family Tachinidae) has been recorded as parasitising Z. bicolorata in Karnataka (India). Two predatory bugs Andrallus spinidens and Eocanthecona furcellata predate the larvae of Z. bicolorata and a third species,Sycanus pyrrhomelas, predates both larvae and adults.

Since the KMC handled some of the affairs of retailing and distribution of treated water and other responsibilities which were co shared with 22 other separate agencies, there was a need to unify all of the functions under one body and hence in 1981, Karachi Water Management Board (KWMB) was created which was given both distribution and cost recovery powers. KMC was still responsible for its revenue and sewerage maintenance, hence KWMB was upgraded to KWSB in 1983 under the Mayor, Abdul Sattar Afghani on the advice of World Bank. It was placed under Government of Sindh but its board of directors was mayor of Karachi.

The mosaic theory calls for a cumulative understanding of data collection by law enforcement and analyzes searches “as a collective sequence of steps rather than individual steps.” More specifically, it requires that police action is considered “over time as a collective ‘mosaic’ of surveillance,\\" and allows that cumulative mosaic to qualify as a protected Fourth Amendment search, even if the individual steps that contribute to the full picture do not, in isolation, reach that constitutional threshold. Mosaic theory has developed in response to the drastic expansion of police surveillance in public spaces, enabled by new technologies. The theory asserts that the comprehensive collection of discrete data over time, if analyzed in the aggregate, exposes information about the lives, habits, and relationships of those surveilled that would have previously been impossible to gather and evaluate. As the Supreme Court articulated Carpenter v. United States, the judiciary is “obligated, as subtler and more far-reaching means of invading privacy have become available to the government, to ensure that the progress of science does not erode Fourth Amendment protections.” Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2208 (2018).  Overview  = Mosaic Theory's National Security Origins = Mosaic theory, as a method of judicial reasoning, emerged first in the context of national security. In United States v. Marchetti, 466 F.2d 1309, 1318 (4th Cir. 1972), the court enjoined a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee from publishing an exposé that covered their time working at the agency. In so doing, the court stated, “the significance of one item of information may frequently depend on the knowledge of many other items of information. What may seem trivial to the uninformed, may appear of great moment to one who has a broad view of the scene and may put the questioned item of information in its proper context.” United States v. Marchetti, 466 F.2d 1309, 1318 (4th Cir. 1972). Since the Marchetti decision, mosaic theory has been an enduring concept in national security law. The approach captures a foundational principle of intelligence gathering: “Disparate items of information, though individually of limited or no utility to their possessor, can take on added significance when combined with other items of information. Combining these items illuminates their interrelationships and breeds analytic synergies, so that the resulting mosaic of information is worth more than the sum of its parts.” David E. Pozen, Note, The Mosaic Theory, National Security, and the Freedom of Information Act, 115 Yale L.J. 628, 630 (2005). Mosaic theory, as it pertains to national defense, is codified in 32 CFR §701.31 – MOSAIC OR COMPILATION RESPONSE. 32 CFR §701.3’s codification of the term aligns with the descriptions forwarded by Pozen and the Marchetti court, defining mosaic theory as “[t]he concept that apparently harmless pieces of information when assembled together could reveal a damaging picture.” = The Emergence of Mosaic Theory in Judicial Opinions Regarding the Fourth Amendment = The D.C. Circuit court was the first to apply mosaic theory to a Fourth Amendment issue in United States v. Maynard, a case involving GPS surveillance of a car over a period of twenty-eight days. Using mosaic theory, the court held that warrantless GPS surveillance of a car over twenty-eight days was not permitted under the Fourth Amendment. Such prolonged and thorough surveillance amounted to an illegal Fourth Amendment search. The effect of this ruling is that singular law enforcement actions that are not “searches” in the traditional sense can be deemed a “search” when aggregated. = Continued Use and Development of Mosaic Theory = The D.C. Circuit court applied the same mosaic theory rationale they used to decide United States v. Maynard to United States v. Jones, which also dealt with extended GPS location surveillance of the defendant’s vehicle for about a month. In the Supreme Court’s review of the Jones case, the majority did not address mosaic theory, but rather handled the Fourth Amendment concern by discussing a separate legal technicality. However, concurring opinions joined by five of the justices supported some form of the mosaic theory. In their separate concurring opinions, Justices Alito and Sotomayor considered and endorsed mosaic theory as a means to protect against long-term or large-scale surveillance. Justice Alito’s concurring opinion supported the D.C. Circuit Court’s application of the mosaic theory and concerned itself primarily with the implications of long- term monitoring without setting an exact, appropriate time limit for warrantless surveillance. In contrast, Justice Sotomayor’s concurring opinion focused not on the length of time of the surveillance, but the depth and breadth of the information collected. Justice Sotomayor expressed concern over the constitutionality of the generation of a comprehensive and detailed record of a defendant’s public movements, regardless of whether that record was developed in the long or short term.

The term originated in the media following an alleged rift between players of the national team during the 1996 European Football Championship. The members of the cabal, as mentioned in the media were as follows: * Winston Bogarde * Edgar Davids * Patrick Kluivert * Michael Reiziger * Clarence Seedorf The name arose during an interview on the TV show Barend en Van Dorp, where Davids, Kluivert and Seedorf were present. This was where the term 'kabel' was first mentioned to describe the friendship between the three. During the 1996 UEFA Euro the term was then taken over to describe the aforementioned quintet. Origin The reason for the widespread attention to 'the cabal' came after the second group match of the European Championship against Switzerland. Clarence Seedorf started this game as libero in defense. But because the Swiss played in a different formation than expected, Seedorf accidentally slipped into a role as an end-marker. After several fouls were necessitated to stop his direct opponent, thus suffering a yellow card, head coach Guus Hiddink decided to substitute him off in the 26'-minute. Edgar Davids, who was on the bench at the time, reacted aggressively towards Hiddink's decision. After the match, he expressed his discontent with harsh criticism over Hiddink towards a Swiss journalist, stating that Hiddink was listening to certain players too much (referring specifically to Danny Blind and Ronald de Boer by name).Zwart tegen wit in het Nederlands Elftal VPRO Hiddink \\"must get his head out of players' asses so he can see better\\"The Dutch are past masters at self- destruction, mirror.co.uk according to Davids. After the brief interview, Hiddink decided to waive Davids, whereby he would no longer participate in the remainder of the tournament. Furthermore a photograph which was released by the NOS circulated, where the public believed the five aforementioned players were living in discord with the rest of the selection. The media reported that the picture showed the five players sitting apart from the rest of the group at a separate table during breakfast. This however was not correct. Bogarde, Kluivert and Seedorf sat together at the same table, Davids and Reiziger not. The others who were sitting at the table were John Veldman, Aron Winter and the white Rob Witschge. Patrick Kluivert indicated in his biography that the table order changed every day, and that there were no permanent seats. The media never focused on the fact that five reverse (white) Dutch players would sit together separately. After Edgar Davis was sent home from the tournament, the remaining four players remained, playing in the final group match, as well as the quarter-final match against France where the Dutch were eliminated. The developments surrounding the affair with the photograph and the media caused a disturbed relationship amongst the players in the national team, the public and the five players known as 'the cabal' whereby Seedorf to date is still widely excluded.  Background  In the beginning stages very little information surfaced regarding the matter, but years later the altercation was clarified by several of the players who were involved. The cause for the immense tension amongst the players was largely due to salary and power differences at Ajax. This was first brought to light by Bogarde in March 2006 during the airing of the TV show Profiel. It was later confirmed in May 2008 on another show Andere Tijden Sport. Maarten Oldenhof, commercial manager at Ajax at the time, confirmed that there were indeed big salary differences at the time. Danny Blind for example earned six times the amount of club top scorer Kluivert in 1996. Bogarde also expressed that the power differences amongst the team frustrated him greatly. Certain players such as Ronald and Frank de Boer and Danny Blind would consult with the Board on how much their teammates should earn, including 'the cabal' players, helping to determine their salary. Ronald de Boer admitted on Andere Tijden that they had in fact called for a higher salary for these players, and that the discontent was created when some players had control over the rest of the selection. He also indicated that a lot of the dissatisfaction was revealed during the European Championship after the match against Switzerland, when Guus Hiddink left the players to themselves in the locker room to settle their differences.  Post- Euro 1996  Guus Hiddink remained head coach of the national team for two more years. He settled his differences with Edgar Davids, and all cabal players stayed playing for the Netherlands, and were all present at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. There were no more noteworthy incidents after the European Championship surrounding the Dutch national team. Team captain Frank de Boer called the teams from '98 and 2000 a \\"very close group\\" in an episode of Voetbal International in May 2008.  Croky-affaire  Meanwhile at Ajax there was still one more incident which Kluivert dubbed as the \\"Croky affair\\". During the 1996–97 season, Blind and the De Boer twins arranged a sponsorship deal with a Dutch brand of potato chips Croky, without the knowledge of the rest of the selection. The agreement consisted of creating Pogs of the Ajax players, which yielded ƒ500,000 guilders. The proceeds would be distributed over the entire selection. Bogarde, Kluivert and Veldman (who was never identified as a member of the cabal through the media) refused to sign, so the action was threatening to be cancelled. Bogarde gave this as another example of the uneven power distribution amongst the players, since the opinion of the squad was never asked, after consultation the three remaining players signed on and the Croky deal came to fruition. Clarence Seedorf had already left the club in 1995, after which Kluivert and Bogarde departed in the Summer of '97 as the last of the cabal players at Ajax, with Davids and Reiziger having left the club a year prior.

Life  His father was a commercial decorative painter. At an early age, he began an after-school apprenticeship in the family workshop, taking advantage of a few free hours for more artistic endeavors. In 1885, after having served as an assistant on a trip to Rostock and Güstrow, his father gave him permission to go to Berlin and look for work. The Mayor of Plau had seen some of Wandschneider's artistic work and was impressed, so he attempted to arrange a scholarship. After securing recommendations from Ludwig Brunow and Martin Wolff the Mayor sent a letter to Grand Duke Frederick Francis III, who granted Wandschneider a personal gift of 150 Marks to study at the Prussian Academy of Art.Künstlerlexikon Saar: Brief biography After passing the entrance exam in 1886, he studied with Albert Wolff, Paul Friedrich Meyerheim, Fritz Schaper and Gerhard Janensch.Bildhauermuseum Plau: Chronology He also gained practical experience working in the studios of Burnow, Martin Wolff, and Ernst Herter and Martin Wolff. In 1895, he became a Master Student of Reinhold Begas but didn't remain long, having won a prize from the \\"Philip von Rohr Foundation\\" which enabled him to study in Italy for a year. While there, he met his future wife, Anna Kreß, who was working as a model. Anna Wandschneider (c.1910), by Fritz Greve =Career in Berlin= Full of confidence upon his return to Berlin, he was determined to achieve success as a free-lance sculptor, participating in several contests for monument and fountain designs. By 1898, he had won three major commissions. In 1899, through his friend , he met Duke John Albert of Mecklenburg, who liked his work and placed several orders. His career truly took off after that point and the years 1897 to 1916 proved to be his most successful. Buoyed by the positive reception he received at the St.Louis World's Fair in 1904, he entered competitions for monuments in places as diverse as Manila, Cape Town and Quito, but to no avail. He finally received an order for a monument to Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly in Riga and was proffered an invitation to compete for a monument in St.Louis that would be dedicated to the German-American journalists Carl Schurz, Emil Preetorius and Carl Daenzer. He won the contract with a figure called \\"The Naked Truth\\". =Travel to America= In 1913 Wandschneider entered a design competition sponsored by the Preetorious-Schurz-Daenzer Memorial Association of St. Louis, Missouri. The association held the competition, sponsored primarily by Anheuser-Busch cofounder Adolphus Busch, to commemorate three German-American newspapermen of the same names. Wandschneider's entry, a single nude female statue entitled \\"The Naked Truth\\" was selected as the winner by the jury, which subsequently invited Wandschneider to St. Louis to collect his winnings. Unfortunately the Memorial Association, as well as Adolphus Busch himself, were not pleased with the selection of a nude as the winner. Local residents were also upset, and sent the association over 250 letters of complaint. The association cabled Wandschneider, instructing him that they were rescinding the award and to stay in Germany. Wandschneider reportedly received the cable shortly before leaving but decided to go anyway. Upon arrival in St. Louis, Wandschneider met with the design committee and argued for the appropriateness of his design. Wandschneider's personal appeals were effective and his design, The Naked Truth, was selected for execution. \\"The Kneeling Soldier\\", a figure that may be seen at several war memorials throughout Germany. This one is in Crivitz and dates from 1922. =Later years= After Germany's defeat in World War I, many artists entered a period of financial distress as public commissions and private clients were difficult to find. At times, he had to feed his six children at the local soup kitchen.Wilhelm Wandschneider: Aus meinem Leben (Manuscript in the Bildhauermuseum Prof. Wandschneider, Plau) His only work came from military societies, seeking to memorialize their fallen comrades. In 1925, he had to sell his home and studio in Berlin, returning to his birthplace of Plau to reduce expenses. The people there greeted their famous son enthusiastically, creating a display of his plaster casts in a room at the local schoolhouse. This mini-museum was in operation until 1947. Even though he was politically conservative, he joined the National Socialist party in 1930, perhaps to ensure his employability. In 1994, the city of Plau established a new museum to house his works, the \\"Bildhauermuseum Prof. Wandschneider\\"; on the site of the original classroom. In 2014, the redesigned and enlarged collection was moved to the \\"Burgmuseum\\".Burgmuseum Plau am See, website  Selected major works A complete list of his works may be found in the corresponding article on German wikipedia. = Monuments = * 1898: Neustettin, Statue of Kaiser Wilhelm I.

It is a variation on the classic trolley problem designed to focus on the ethics of autonomous vehicles, as well as the question of who gets to decide how they react in life-and-death scenarios. Original formulation The tunnel problem is intended to draw one's attention to a specific issue in design/engineering ethics, and was first presented as follows: > Tunnel Problem: You are travelling along a single lane mountain road in an > autonomous car that is fast approaching a narrow tunnel. Just before > entering the tunnel a child attempts to run across the road but trips in the > center of the lane, effectively blocking the entrance to the tunnel. The car > has but two options: hit and kill the child, or swerve into the wall on > either side of the tunnel, thus killing you. How should the car react? Similar thought experiments have been brought forth by other philosophers focusing on the topic of autonomous cars. The premise of these thought experiments is that even with highly sophisticated self-driving-car technologies, the cars will face situations where harm cannot be avoided. Purpose The tunnel problem is meant to focus one's attention on two questions that it raises for designers and users of autonomous cars: # How should the car react? # Who should decide how the car reacts? In its original formulation, the tunnel problem is discussed as an \\"end-of-life\\" decision for the passenger of the car: depending on the way the car reacts, the passenger either lives or dies. Because of that feature, Millar argues that the tunnel problem forces us to question whether designers/engineers have the legitimate moral authority to make the decision on behalf of autonomous car users. Indeed, the second question is meant to challenge the standard notion that all design decisions are just technical in nature. Where design features provide \\"material answers to moral questions\\" in the use context, Millar argues that designers must find ways to incorporate user preferences in order to avoid unjustifiable paternalistic relationships between technology and the user. Because the tunnel problem focuses on ethical design issues in semi-autonomous technologies, it is considered a problem in roboethics. Public response Roger Crisp featured the tunnel problem on the Oxford University Practical Ethics blog. The entry contains a critique of the problem as presented by Millar. The tunnel problem was the focus of a poll conducted by the Open Roboethics Initiative (ORi). In response, 64% of participants said the car should continue straight and kill the child, while 36% said it should swerve and kill the passenger. In addition, 48% of respondents reported that the decision was \\"easy\\", while 28% and 24% claimed it was \\"moderately difficult\\" and \\"difficult\\" respectively. When asked who should make the decision, only 12% felt the designer/manufacturer should make it, 44% felt the passenger should make it, and 33% thought it should be left to lawmakers.

The species mostly inhabits the understories of humid forests in the lowlands, at altitudes of . Reproduction C. vencesi is oviparous. Conservation and threats The main threat to Vences' chameleon is habitat loss and degradation. While having a sizable range, the species is extremely intolerant of damaged habitat. Also, it has not been recorded in any protected areas, making it all the more vulnerable to logging and slash and burn agriculture. Fortunately, the illegal trade of this species seems to be virtually nonexistent. References Further reading *Andreone, Franco; Mattioli, Fabio; Jesu, Riccardo; Randrianirina, Jasmin E.

For the most part, it is restricted to intact, relatively high-altitude humid forests.Calumma andringitraense Conservation and threats Due to its small and fragmented range and ongoing habitat loss, Calumma andringitraense is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Perhaps as a result of its limited population and other factors, illegal trade in it is virtually nonexistent. The population of the species is decreasing.

McKinley's previous running mate, Vice President Garret Hobart, had died in office, so the Republicans nominated New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt as their vice presidential candidate. McKinley again won by a comfortable margin in both the popular vote and the electoral college, and he picked up a handful of states in the West and the Midwest. McKinley's win made him the first sitting President to win re-election since Ulysses S. Grant in 1872. Republicans won minor gains in the House, maintaining their majority.

Despite the infrequent collection of this presumably rare species, M. cryptomys has a relatively broad range within the spiny forest/thickets and savanna woodland habitats of Madagascar. Workers of Meranoplus cryptomys are only known from two individuals collected at Tsimanampetsotsa, while gynes have been collected at the Isalo and Andohahela National Parks and the Beza Mahafaly Reserve. Neither hand-collected workers nor nests have been collected; all known individuals are from Malaise or pitfall traps.

The strong orange and black bicolored coloration of M. cryptomys is notable for its similarity to that of M. mayri.

Distribution Meranoplus mayri is distributed throughout the drier regions of Madagascar from the Southwestern region near Andohahela National Park all the way north into the Mahajanga Province. The elevational range of M. mayri is 20–1345 m. Description This species displays subtle variation in morphometric and most sculptural characters across its range except for the sculpture of the base of abdominal tergum IV. This character varies from extremely smooth and shining in the southwest to strongly, dense-punctate and costate along the western edge of the High Plateau. Intergrades are common, however, occurring all along the western coast and into the High Plateau. Both smooth and punctate specimens may be found at the same locales, including Ampotoampoto, Ejada, Tsihombe and Ambinanitelo. The variation of this character indicates that although the two extremes are reproductively isolated by distance and geography, but are otherwise linked across their range by intermediate populations. Biology As with most of the diversity of Meranoplus, nothing is known about the behavior or ecology of M. mayri except that its ground nests may be found in urban gardens, grasslands, and deciduous and spiny forests. This is the most frequently collected Malagasy Meranoplus, with numerous specimens captured in pitfalls, malaise traps, and hand collections. Although few collections have been made of this species in the High Plateau region, it is predicted that they may be found there as well.

The election was held during the Fourth Party System. It was the lone election to take place during America's involvement in World War I. Republicans won control of both chambers of Congress for the first time since the 1908 election. The election took place during the Spanish flu pandemic. Campaigning was disrupted around the country. In Nebraska, for instance, authorities lifted a ban on public gatherings in early November 1918 and permitted politicians to campaign five days prior to polls opening. The turnout was 40%, which was unusually low for a midterm election (turnout was at 52% and 50% in the 1910 and 1914 midterm elections). The low turnout was possibly due to the disruption caused by the pandemic. In an example of the six-year itch phenomenon, Republicans took complete control of Congress from the Democrats. The Republicans won large gains in the House, taking 25 seats and ending coalition control of the chamber. In the Senate, Republicans gained 5 seats, taking control of the chamber by a slim majority. The elections were a major defeat for progressives and Wilson's foreign policy agenda, and foreshadowed the Republican victory in the 1920 election. Republicans ran against the expanded war-time government and the Fourteen Points, especially Wilson's proposal for the League of Nations. The Republican victory left them in control of both houses of Congress until the 1930 election. The election was also a turning point for women's suffrage in the United States. Ballot initiatives to extend suffrage to women (among all-male electorates) were held in the states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, South Dakota, and Michigan. Of these, all but the one in Louisiana passed. In addition, suffragists successfully campaigned against incumbent Senators who had refused to support the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. These included John W. Weeks of Massachusetts, who had been considered invincible, and Willard Saulsbury Jr. of Delaware. The suffragists' campaign was nearly derailed by the pandemic, but overcame it through extensive grassroots organizing.

Background In 1963, John Lockwood was commissioned by the Government of Northern Ireland to produce a report into university education in the province. It was widely believed that he would conclude that the single existing institution, Queen's University Belfast, did not provide sufficient capacity, and would recommend the creation of a new university in Northern Ireland. A large number of groups put forward the case for siting the new campus in their own town or city, and gradually three frontrunners emerged: Craigavon, a new town under development near Belfast; Armagh, a small city regarded as Ireland's religious capital; and Derry, the second largest city in Northern Ireland.\\"An Opportunity Missed: Northern Ireland's Second University\\", The Tablet, 4 September 1965 Lockwood was due to report early in 1965, and by the end of December 1964, its proposed recommendations had begun to leak. Basil McFarland, former UUP Mayor of Derry, stated publicly that he did not believe that the report would \\"do Derry much good\\".Gerard O'Brien, \\"'Our Magee Problem: Stormont and the New University\\", in Ed. Gerard O'Brien, Londonderry: History and Society, pp.647-696 In response, the Derry-based leaders of the Catholic, Presbyterian, Anglican and Methodist churches published a joint statement in support of a university for the city.Frank Curran, Derry: Countdown to Disaster, pp.30-31 This, together with the conviction that a university would attract new industry, inspired local teacher John Hume to create the University for Derry Committee.Gerald McSheffrey, Planning Derry: Planning and Politics in Northern Ireland, p.110 Membership Founded in late January 1965, the committee was chaired by Hume. Its other members were Desmond Sidebottom, Brian Gallagher, Michael Canavan, Arthur Jack and Gerald Black - members of both the city's Protestant and Catholic communities. Aidan Clark, Desmond McCourt and John Carmony from Magee College served in an advisory role. In the committee's founding statement, it stated that government policy appeared to be deliberately isolating the city of Derry. Activities On 8 February 1965, the committee organised a major public meeting at Derry Guildhall, attracting more than 1,500 people to hear speeches by the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Mayor of Derry Albert Anderson and leader of the Nationalist Party Eddie McAteer, both of whom remarked upon how the issue had united the two communities in the city.Marilynn J. Richtarik, Acting Between the Lines, pp.16-17 The Lockwood Report was issued on 10 February. It recommended locating a \\"New University of Ulster\\" in the small town of Coleraine, in a strongly Protestant area on the north coast, and this decision was immediately supported by the Government. A delegation from the committee was in Belfast for the announcement, and the following day, it met with Prime Minister Terence O'Neill, Minister of Education Herbert Kirk, and the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland, Edward Warburton Jones. Jones was the MP for the City of Londonderry seat, and was particularly concerned by the strength and breadth represented by the committee. The Committee organised a major day of protest on 18 February, in an attempt to sway political opinion. Anderson declared a public holiday in the city, and he and McAteer led a convoy of 2,000 vehicles to protest at the government buildings at Stormont. Back in Derry, citizens were encouraged to mark the protest with a two-minute silence, and pubs were closed for the day. Government vote The Government called a vote on the Lockwood proposals, and in order to discourage its MPs from voting against the report, it declared it to be a vote of confidence. The plans were accepted by a majority of 27 in favour to 19 against, supporters including several MPs who had previously supported Derry's bid, in particular the Attorney-General, Jones, who attempted to justify his vote to local party members by claiming that Irish nationalists would benefit from any split in government ranks. Robert Samuel Nixon, UUP MP for North Down, claimed in May that several prominent Derry- based unionists had opposed building the new university in their own city. Although he described them as \\"nameless, faceless men\\", he did name them: Gerald Stanley Glover, former Mayor of Derry; John Brown; J. S. Bond; and Sydney Buchanan. The majority of them claimed that they had simply accepted a decision which had already been made and had lobbied for Magee College to remain open, and Nixon was expelled from the UUP Parliamentary group. Following the vote, the Committee was wound down. John Hume subsequently claimed that the decision not to build the new university in Derry was the immediate cause of the Northern Ireland civil-rights movement and ended any hope of a peaceful solution to sectarian divides in the state.

Mechanical engineering as a profession was on the rise and the advent of the steam age opened up viable career alternatives for many young Englishmen who, like Joshua Routledge, grew up in an agriculture-based society. Early Life Born on 27 April 1773 and baptised on the 29th in Riccall, Yorkshire. Joshua Routledge was third of ten children. Generations of Routledges were established as yeoman farmers and weavers in Riccall, a village about 9 miles (14 km) south of the city of York. Joshua's father was a blacksmith by trade, but he seems to have been pious, curious and adventurous by nature. The Industrial Revolution allowed the advancement of all sorts of radical new ideas in tandem with mechanical innovations. Religious, political, and social reformers took to the highways and byways spreading discontent with the status quo, John Wesley being one reformer whose message took hold in Yorkshire. Wesley's brand of fervent evangelical Methodism encouraged lay preachers, which appealed very much to the working classes, William Routledge (1744-1822) for one. It is known that William with wife Sarah Bell (1746-1819), one-year- old Joshua and his two-year-old sister Dinah (1771-1791), joined a group of Methodists sailing to Nova Scotia, Canada in 1774. Records indicate that the family sailed on board the vessel Two Friends, embarking from Hull, Yorkshire the \\"week of 28th February to 7th March\\" and arriving in Halifax on the 9th of May 1774. It is certain that the family returned to Yorkshire before 1778 when Joshua's brother Joseph was born in Elvington, a village located about 7 miles southeast of York. Later on, they joined the Methodist movement as active members of the York Circuit, and according to an account by J. D. Greenhalgh published in 1882, William Routledge was among a list of \\"Wesleyan Methodist ministers admitted...in the year 1800.\\" Bolton Archives & Local Studies: B929.2 ROU Career Nothing is recorded of Joshua Routledge's early education, but supposedly he learned something about the smithing trades from his father. In 1798 Routledge was in Leeds, Yorkshire where his occupation is given as \\"whitesmith\\" (tinsmith) on a marriage certificate recorded at St Peter's Parish Church, Leeds. This was the occasion of his first marriage, on 5 November, to Mary King.Parish Registers West Yorkshire Archives: RDP68/4/712 1797–1799 A daughter, Ann, was born there in 1803. =The Round Foundry= Routledge may have apprenticed at the historic Round Foundry in Leeds. Matthew Murray (1765–1826) and David Wood (1761–1820) partnered in building the Round Foundry circa 1795 and were later joined by James Fenton (1754–1834) and silent partner William Lister. Fenton, Murray, & Wood quickly gained a reputation for innovative thinking and sound technical practices. The firm became famous as designers and builders of textile machinery and steam engines that rivalled the Soho Works in Birmingham operated by steam-age pioneers James Watt and Matthew Boulton. =Routledge Engineer's Rule= By 1800, Routledge had become Manager at the Round Foundry. Somehow, along the way, he learned the value of logarithms and thereby had the means of developing a method of measuring \\"all kinds of metals and other bodies\\" British Library, Call 717.a.18 needed for engineering purposes. Using the principles of Edmund Gunter's (1581–1626) logarithmic scales and William Oughtred's (1574–1660) sliding rule, Routledge combined a 12-inch brass slide containing the logarithmic scales with an ordinary 2-foot ruler to which he added a table of commonly used references called gauge points. This rule became known as the Routledge Engineer's Rule. According to a handwritten, unsigned document on file at Bolton Archives (Lancashire)Bolton Archives & Local Studies. Ref. B 920B ROU Routledge acquired a patent for his improved slide rule in 1813 but, to date, no record of this has been traced. It is certain that, in 1805, he published the first known Instructions for the Engineer's Improved Sliding RuleBritish Library, Call 717.a.18 and that numerous editions followed before and after his death in 1829, the most recent being in 1983. A letter from his parents, dated 1811, records that Routledge was associated, at that time, with Thompson, Swift and Co, iron founders and steam engine makers located in Little Bolton, Lancashire, and a notice published in the Manchester Mercury dated 12 November 1811 informs that his partnership with that firm had been dissolved by mutual consent. =Improved Rotary Steam Engine= In 1816 Routledge had a prosperous ironmonger (hardware) business at 26 Deansgate in Bolton.England Commercial Directory, Bolton, p 61 That business allowed him time to engage in other engineering pursuits as well as support his inventive activities. Thus, in February 1818, he acquired a patent for \\"An Improvement or Improvements Upon the Rotary Steam Engine.\\"Patent No 4,232, 7 July 1818 A newspaper account dated 8 August 1822 and quoted in Historical Gleanings Bolton & District describes him as the \\"spirited and ingenious inventor\\" of a portable, steam-powered machine that broke stones for road repair at the \\"astounding rate of 70 or 80 tons in ten hours,\\" something \\"never before contemplated.\\" About this time, his name appears among the original shareholders of Bolton Gaslight and Coke Company supplying gas to the towns of Great and Little Bolton In 1822 he entered into a short-lived partnership (dissolved 1824) with William Kay of Bury Lancashire to supply iron pillars to the specification of William Fairbairn for the \\"fireproof\\" Hudcar Mill, said to be state-of-the-art for cotton mills of the day. The Hudcar Mill, built for manufacturer Thomas Haslam, was demolished in 1977. Pigot and Dean's Directory of 1821–22 styles the partnership of Kay and Routledge as Brass and Ironfounders and Engineers. Routledge undertook another engineering project with Joseph (1765–1842) and Thomas Ridgway (1778–1839) to extend and rearrange the pioneering Wallsuches Bleach Works in Horwich, Lancashsire sometime before leaving England, in 1824, for Warsaw, Poland. Wallsuches Bleach Works is preserved as a Grade II listed complex, described as a \\"rare survival of a once large scale important industry in the Bolton area\\". In Poland, Routledge engaged with Thomas Evans & Co of Warsaw to erect a large steam corn mill.Reports of the Curator, Salford Museum: Copy of a letter, dated October 15, 1860, written by William Routledge in response to a request by John Plant, Superintendent & Curator of Salford Museum Art Gallery, for information about Joshua Routledge's career This foundry was the forerunner of Lilpop, Rau i Loewenstein, another noteworthy engineering firm distinguished by its expertise in the manufacture of railroad engines and other heavy-duty industrial machinery. Family Connections Joshua Routledge was twice married, first in 1798 to Mary King about whom nothing more has been found, except that a daughter Ann (1803–1814) came from that union.\\"Family History Library\\", Church of Latter Day Saints, Salt Lake City Utah: Film 0918376 =Hick Family= A contemporary of Routledge by the name of Benjamin Hick (1787/90–1842) also received training at the Round Foundry, and the two ambitious young men left Leeds for greener pastures sometime around 1810. Both settled in Bolton Lancashire where engineering advances in the machinery needed for large scale cotton milling would soon bring about boom times for the whole region. Joshua witnessed the marriage of his sister Elizabeth (1783–1826) to Benjamin Hick in April 1811.\\"Family History Library\\", Church of Latter Day Saints, Salt Lake City Utah: Film 6904337 Hick went on to found the highly respected Bolton engineering firm Benjamin Hick & Sons, later Hick, Hargreaves & Co. Elizabeth and Benjamin had five children: Mary born in 1813, John in 1815, Benjamin in 1818, William in 1820, and Eliza Rachel in 1821. John Hick, besides his notable engineering career while extending the family firm, distinguished himself as Bolton town councillor for 9 years before serving as a Conservative Member of Parliament from 1868 to 1880. =Abel and Bowker Families= Soon after witnessing the marriage of Elizabeth and Benjamin, Joshua followed suit, marrying Frances Abel on 14 July 1811.West Yorkshire Archives. Film 1966477, Item No 539 Frances was the widow of James Abel (1770–1801), a prominent Freemason in Bolton. She had two children from that marriage, Mary Ann who died in 1802 aged 2 years and 9 months and Samuel (1802–1842). Upon marrying Joshua she became stepmother to his daughter Ann who died on 19 August 1814 and was buried, alongside her half siblings, in the Abel family plot at St Peter's Parish Church.Gravestone Inscriptions Bolton Archives & Local Studies: L920 ROU Frances (1777–1844) came from the politically and socially active Bowker family. Her elder brothers, William Bowker (b 1768) and Jonathan (b 1770), made significant contributions to the building and running of Great and Little Bolton during the early 1800s. Bowker's Row, a small street in the heart of Bolton, is named for them. Both Jonathan and William are found on a list of \\"Bolton Politicians in 1806,\\" and William was elected Boroughreeve in 1812. During 1819, in reference to the infamous Peterloo Massacre, William Bowker, as Boroughreeve, wrote a letter advising the local Magistrate that the leading men of the town intended to protest by \\"meeting publicly to address the Prince Regent on the late proceedings at Manchester on the 16th of August last.\\" Joshua Routledge was among the signers of the letter. Bolton Archives & Local Studies: ZHE11/15/82 Last Days Tragically, Routledge contracted a cancerous tumor while in Poland where he died on 8 February 1829 in a state of near penury, having received little or no payment or support from his employers during his illness. An 1888 newspaper article quoted one of the last entries in his diary: \\"F [Fanny, his wife] been up to Evans for money, but he did not give any; did nothing but abuse me as usual; and she abused him as ill, but he is callous to everything.\\" After Joshua's death, Frances returned to Bolton with their three children: William (1812–1872), Frances (1814–1872), and Henry (1817–1884). William and Henry went into engineering along with their half- brother Samuel Abel. William and Henry both inherited the inventive spirit of their father, having, between the two, qualified for numerous mechanical patents in their day.British Library: Business and Intellectual Property Centre Their sister Frances seems to have remained unmarried and nothing more of her career is known. Legacy The Routledge Engineer's Rule proved to be the model for further slide rule improvements during the 19th and even into the 20th century, including Wilkinson's Routledge's Spinners' Rule, Armstrong's Drafting Rule, Hawthorne's Locomotive Rule, Carrett's General Engineering Rule, and Noble's Eureka Slide Rule. In 1921, James Noble, an engineer at Sheffield, published the 7th edition of his Instructions for the Use of the Eureka Slide Rule in which he acknowledges the \\"Routledge Rule,\\" stating that \\"ere long it will have to be taught in all towns throughout the Kingdom, as anyone who has the Rule well in hand will work out questions while another is committing them to paper.\\" References External links * Science Museum Working model of a Rotary Steam Engine patented by J.

She served in the United Partisan Organization (Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye) and, alongside Rozka Korczak and founder Abba Kovner, assumed a leadership role in its successor group, the Avengers (Nokmim).  Early Career  Kempner was 19 when the Germans invaded Poland, and she fled to Vilnius, Lithuania. When Lithuania fell to the Germans eight months later, Kempner and tens of thousands of other jews were forced into a ghetto, where she met Korczak and Kovner. During World War II, their United Partisan Organization, or the FPO, was one of the most famous and successful Jewish partisan groups during the war, responsible for acts of sabotage against the Nazis. Kempner played in integral leading role in the organization, and is famous for blowing up a Nazi train line with a homemade bomb. She and her compatriots smuggled weapons through the city's sewer system, Kempner eventually becoming one of Kovner's closest lieutenants.  The Avengers  After a failed ghetto revolt drove them out of Vilnius, the United Partisan Organization became the Avengers. This militia was based in Rudniki Forest, and from there, they continued to sabotage Nazi operations. They destroyed Vilnius's power and water systems, operating in secret and looting peasant homes to stay alive. They lived in the forest for nine months, until Vilnius was occupied by Soviet forces, aided by the partisans.  Post-War  After the war ended in 1945, Kempner and Kovner continued to fight against the Nazis. They helped evacuate hundreds of European Jews to British Palestine, which would later become Israel. Kovner also formed a new resistance group known as Nakam, or Revenge. Their goal was to take revenge on the Germans by poisoning the waterworks of important cities, but Kovner was arrested before they could put their plans to action. On April 13, 1946, Kempner and others infiltrated a bakery that supplied bread for Nazi POWs in Nuremberg. They coated 2,300 loaves of bread with arsenic before a guard was alerted and they were forced to flee. Many of the POWs fell ill, but none were reported dead.

Background Boko Haram is an Islamic terrorist group opposed to the Westernization of Nigeria, which they have stated is the root cause of criminal behaviour in the country. Thousands of people have been killed in attacks perpetrated by the group, and the federal government declared a state of emergency in May 2013 in Borno State in its fight against the insurgency. The resulting crackdown, however, has failed to stabilise the country. Boko Haram's attacks have intensified in 2014. In February, the group killed more than 100 Christian men in the villages of Doron Baga and Izghe. Also in February, 59 boys were killed in the Federal Government College attack in Yobe State. By mid-April, Boko Haram had been blamed for nearly 4,000 deaths in 2014. Militants then attacked a school and kidnapped 276 girls, of which 57 escaped, in Chibok. The incident brought international attention on the situation in Nigeria, and Western nations promised to help fight Boko Haram. Negotiations to trade the girls for captured militants took place, but the talks stalled and president Goodluck Jonathan announced the government would not consider a trade. As of June, the girls were still unaccounted for. The Nigerian military says they are aware of where the girls are being held, but are afraid to use force for fear that Boko Haram will kill the girls if attacked. Vigilante groups have formed throughout the North, with modest success in repelling attacks. Attacks, however, have continued. On 20 May 118 people were killed in a pair of bombings in Jos. The following day, two dozen people were killed in a raid on a village. On 1 June, around 40 people were killed in a bombing in Mubi. On June 2, 2014, in an event that has been called the Gwoza massacre, \\"No fewer than 300 villagers were reportedly killed in three communities around Gwoza local government area of Borno State\\". Kidnappings Over several days, around the weekend of 21–22 June, suspected Boko Haram militants attacked the village of Kummabza and three others in the Damboa district of Borno State, according to eyewitnesses. The attackers took 60 women and girls, and 31 boys in the attack. Some of the women were married and the children were as young as three. Vigilante leader Aji Khalil said four villagers who tried to escape the attackers were shot. An eyewitness said closer to 30 men had been killed in the attack. After the attack, elderly villagers walked to report the attack and seek help. Borno governor Kashim Shettima ordered an official probe, but when the news leaked the national government denied any abductions had taken place. A government spokesperson stated there was \\"nothing on the ground to prove any act of abduction\\" and claimed Shettima had determined the missing women had merely moved to another village. A local politician and multiple eyewitnesses, however confirmed the abduction report to Agence France-Presse. An intelligence officer with Nigeria's Department of State Security confirmed to the Associated Press that an attack had taken place on condition of anonymity. However, he reported that the abductions had taken place a week earlier, between 13 and 15 June. Bombings and shootings On 21 and 22 June, suspected Boko Haram militants attacked the villages of Chuha A, Chuha B, and Korongilim near Chibok. The attackers were met by military and vigilante resistance. The towns were destroyed and at least 40 villagers were killed in the fighting. Six vigilantes and about twenty-five militants were also killed in the attacks. A government official described the scene: \\"Corpses of affected people ... littered the three villages.\\" On 23 June, a bomb explosion at a college in Kano killed 8 people and injured about 20 others. On the night of 28 June, a bomb exploded at a brothel in Bauchi that resulted in 11 deaths and 28 injuries. Analysis Analyst Jacob Zenn suggested the new attacks showed that international efforts to launch a counterattack against Boko Haram were stalled. Security analyst Ryan Cumming said the new kidnappings may be an attack to direct attention from the Chibok kidnappings, and to intensify pressure to make a hostage exchange deal. Aftermath On 7 July 2014 it was reported that more than 60 of the kidnapped women had escaped from Boko Haram.

Echedemos (; fl. 190 BC) was a Greek statesman of ancient Athens.Pantos 1989, p. 282 Biography This fragmentary inscription from the Agora mentions the role of Echedemos in the reorganization of the Delphic Amphictyony. Echedemos, son of Mnesitheos, Kydathenaieus, was a member of an important family, part of Athenian aristocracy.Pantos 1989, p.283, p. 284, fn. 48, p. 286, text + fn. 56 He had at least two sons, Mnesitheos and Arketos, born circa 200 BC or slightly later.This can be inferred from the fact that they were still minors in 183/182 BC, see Pantos 1989, p. 287 In 190 BC, Echedemos was the head of the Athenian embassy that negotiated a truce between the Roman Republic and the Aetolian League. In 185/184 BC he played a significant role in the reorganization of the Delphic Amphictyonic League. In the year of 170/169 BC he is thought to have been the city's mint master.Pantos 1989, p. 284 Embassy Echedemos was the leader of the Athenian embassy (princeps legationis eorum) that mediated in a conflict between Aetolians and Romans in 190 BC. These negotiations are reported in detail by the Greek historian Polybius (The Histories, XXI.4–5) and Roman historian Livy (The History of Rome, XXXVII.6–7).Polybius, The Histories, book 21, chapter 4, \\"The Athenians Intercede for the Aetolians\\"Polybius, The Histories, book 21, chapter 5, \\"Truce With the Aetolians\\"Livy, The History of Rome, book 37, chapter 6Livy, The History of Rome, book 37, chapter 7 Amphictyonic League In 185/184 BC Echedemos played a significant role in the reorganization of the Delphic Amphictyonic League. This is attested by two inscriptions, one from Delphi and one from Athens.Habicht 1987 Epigrams Palatine Anthology is a 10th-century manuscript containing a collection of Greek poems and epigrams from the 7th century BC on. Two of the epigrams probably refer to Echedemos. Echedemos is probably the subject of two epigrams from the Palatine Anthology, by the Athenian poet Artemon.Pantos 1989, pp. 283–284 In one poem, in which Echedemos is still a boy \\"in his prime\\", the poet is in love and steals a kiss from him:Anthologia Palatina, XII.124, see Pantos 1989, p. 283; translated by William Roger Paton; original: The poet's dread has been interpreted as referring to the high social status and power of Echedemos's family, who could cause considerable harm to the poet if his advances were judged too bold.Pantos 1989, p. 283 In the second poem, in which Echedemos has grown up, he is given a much more elaborate set of compliments:Anthologia Palatina, XII.55, see Pantos 1989, pp. 283–284; translated by William Roger Paton; original: Here, he is called \\"a second Attic Phoebus\\", Phoebus (literally \\"radiant\\") being a common epithet of Apollo. This comparison is certainly a reference to his beauty, but could also refer to a personal device he later stamped on Athenian coins. Echedemos is also called \\"the lord of the land of Cecrops\\", i.e. lord of Athens, indicating his high social standing and wealth. Two final lines, lamenting the former glory of Athens, indicate the date for the epigram in the beginning of the 2nd century BC when ever waning power of Athens allowed Romans to increase their influence in Greece and broader Hellenistic world (conflict with Aetolians being one example).Pantos 1989, p. 284, p. 282 Coinage An example of a New Style tetradrachm, packed with additional inscriptions and symbols. Some time in the second century BC Athens have established a new iconography of coinage, with obverse featuring a head of Athena and reverse showing an owl with additional images, symbols and inscriptions identifying, among other things, the people responsible for minting the coins.Lewis 1962 Among these Athenian New Style coins there is a whole series bearing letters EXE on the reverse, possibly dating from 170–169 BC.Photos of two coins are published in Pantos 1989, pl.49:e,f; additional examples: SH26465. Silver tetradrachm, Ancients: Classic Greek Coins: Part 1 (Athens, Silver Tetradrachm), Classical Numismatic Group, XXVIII, New York Sale, December 8, 1993 (p. 18, cat.120) — all with letters EXE over a bust or head of Helios on the right of the reverse These have been cited as a proof that Echedemos was the Athenian mint master at the time.Pantos 1989, p.284Chronology of the Athenian New Style coinage remains somewhat uncertain, see Mattingly 1990; another date suggested for the coins is 137–136 BC or 135–134 BC, in this case EXE could refer to a later member of the same family, Echedemos son of Arketos, Kydathenaieus, and the head of Helios could be a family emblem, see Pantos 1989, p. 284; this Echedemos (Ἐχέδημος Ἀρκέτου) is known from an inscription of circa 155–154 BC as a victor at the festival of Theseia, see: Pantos 1989, pp. 284–285, fn. 49; Inscriptiones Graecae IG II² 958 The office of the mint master was given almost exclusively to members of the Athenian aristocracy, conferring the almost royal honour to place one's name and emblem on the city's coins.Pantos 1989, p. 284, fn. 48 Below the monogram, the coins bear a small device of a head or bust of Helios, with a crown of rays above seemingly rich curly voluminous hair. This emblem could be an allusion to the fair looks of Echedemos, paralleling the comparison to Apollo in an epigram by Artemon.Pantos 1989, pp. 284–285 Portrait The portrait is signed by Apollonios. A portrait on a ring from the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore was tentatively identified as that of Echemedos.Pantos 1989 The portrait is a garnet intaglio of circa 220 BC.Ring with Portrait of a Courtier at the Walters Art Museum; ca. 220 BC; gold, garnet; 2.8 x 2.3 x 2.5 cm; inscription \\"of Apollonios\\" (translation); museum purchase, 1942; accession number 57.1698The stone is specifically a pyrope, 2.6 x 2.3 cm, see: Vollenweider 1980, p. 153; Pantos 1989, p. 278, fn. 8; Gross 2008 p. 57, fn. 47Photo of the intaglio's impression is published in: Furtwängler 1900, I, pl.

His two sons were born circa 200 BC, so twenty years earlier he must have been fairly young.Pantos 1989, p. 287 Remarkably, two ancient partial impressions of this (or a very similar) ring have been excavated in Aetolian Kallipolis,Pantos 1989, p. 278The sealings are preserved in the Delphi Museum: inv. no. 14524, 1.7 x 1.35 cm, and inv. no. 14525, 1.3 x 1.4 cm, see Pantos 1989, p. 278, fn. 5, 8; for photographs, see Pantos 1989, p. 279, fig. 1, and pl. 49:a,b near modern Lidoriki in Greece. They were found, among many other portraits, in the clay sealings from the \\"House of the Archives\\" that was burnt down, along with the whole city, shortly after the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC.Pantos 1989, p. 278, p. 280, fn. 17 They come from the correspondence between two prominent Aetolian generals (Agetas Lochagou and Lochagos Ageta) and important people of the time,Pantos 1989, p. 281 including Roman general Scipio Africanus.Portrait on a sealing in the archive has been identified with the man engraved on a gold signet ring in National Museum, Naples, who in turn has been identified as Scipio via numismatic parallels, see: Pantos 1989, p. 281; Ruebel 1991, p. 18; this identification is widely accepted, but has been doubted, see Ruebel 1991, p. 19; a portrait ring of Scopio is mentioned by Valerius Maximus, who writes about Scopio's son Lucius: \\"and they pulled his ring from his hand, on which the head of Africanus had been molded\\", see Ruebel 1991, p. 29, fn. 38; the ring in Naples is 3.0 x 3.5 cm, see Richter 1955, pl.

Athens partly depended in its grain supply on the colonies of the Black Sea, and Echedemos could have sent the ring as a present to a king, a dignitary or even a merchant in the area during trade negotiations.Pantos 1989, pp. 286–287 Alternatively, it could travel back home with mercenaries of the northern Black Sea coast, who are known to have served all over Hellenistic world, even as far as Ptolemaic Egypt.Pantos 1989, p. 287; many rings with the portraits of the Ptolemies found on northern shores of the Black Sea could have gotten there this way, see Pantos 1989, p. 287, fn. 60 Identification is by no means concrete. Other suggestions include: an uncertain, perhaps Bosporan, king;Spier 1989, p. 29, cat. A, p. 34, fig. 51 a royal courtier,If \\"Apollonios\\" refers to the owner and not the engraver, which is also a possibility, literary and epigraphic sources provide dozens of Seleucid philoi or courtiers of this name, see Messina 2012, p.125 possibly Hermeias, the chief minister of Seleucus III;Vollenweider 1980, p. 152; Pantos 1989, p. 280 and, given the absence of any insignia, a private individual.Gross 2008, p. 39 Older identification as Bosporan king AsanderFurtwängler 1900, II, p. 285; Hill 1943, p. 62 (110–17 BC, ruled 44–17 BC) has since been disproven.Pantos 1989, pp. 279–280; Messina 2012, p. 122 Notes References * Adolf Furtwängler (1900).

She is known internationally as both a prominent virtuoso violinist and child prodigy, and in 2012 was chosen as one of the one hundred \\"Most inspiring and influential people of Korea\\" by a leading Korean newsletter, the Dong-A Times.  Childhood and education  Clara-Jumi Kang was born in a very musically-centered household to two Korean opera singers. Her father, a famous Wagnerian bassist, Philp Kang, and her mother, equal in significance, the soprano vocalist, Han Min-hee. Clara had first held and played a violin at the young age of three. It was but a year later that she had become the youngest student to ever enter the Mannheim Musikhochschule, and had there studied under Valery Gradov, also a teacher of famous violinist Frank Peter Zimmermann. When Kang had turned to be five years of age, she had moved to Lübeck to study under Professor Zakhar Bronchiole. At this same age, Clara-Jumi Kang had made her concerto debut with the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra. When Clara had aged to be six, she had appeared on the cover of German magazine Die Zeit, in which she had written a main article featuring herself, depicting her as 'Wunderkind'. Kang's parents had sent recordings of her playing the violin to the famed Dorothy DeLay, teacher of legendary virtuosos such as Itzhak Perlman and Sarah Chang. DeLay claimed to be impressed, and so, at the age of seven, Clara was given a full scholarship to the Juilliard School. Two years after, Clara-Jumi had recorded Ludwig van Beethoven's Triple Concerto in C Major, Op. 56 and a solo recital for the CD label Teldec Classics. When Clara turned to be eleven years of age, she had succumbed to a serious injury to her hand and was not able to play her violin for many years. At age sixteen, Clara-Jumi had later taken both her Bachelor and Master's degrees at the Korean National University of Arts under Nam-Yun Kim. While a student at the Korean National University of Arts, she had competed and placed highly in multiple prominent international violin competitions. This was previous to the completion of her studies at the Munich Musikhochschule with Christoph Poppen from 2011 to 2013. Lee Kang-sook, former president of the Korea National University of Arts, had told The Korea Herald, “Kang rules her musical world, and I am sure that she will make people around the world proud.”  Performing and recording career  Clara-Jumi Kang had made her first ever official performance with the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra when aged five. And later had performed with numerous leading orchestras across the world, such as Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, Hamburg Symphony, Kiel Philharmonie, Nice Philharmonie, Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra, KBS Symphony Orchestra, and the Korean Chamber Ensemble before she had gone to the Juilliard School with Dorothy DeLay. When aged nine, Clara recorded Beethoven's Triple Concerto in C Major, Op. 56 for CD label Teldec Classics. From 2007 to 2015, Clara-Jumi Kang either won or placed in high positions at many international violin competitions. When competing for the International Violin Competition of Indianapolis during the year 2010, Clara had been using a different violin from which she currently uses. This had troubled her greatly, as it seemed to her as if this could be the cause of her to loose the competition. “The day before the competition, I had another violin. The sound was too bright,” as Kang had explained to the Bangkok Post. “I couldn’t control it. I was looking for a darker sound, and nothing seemed to work. I cried for forty minutes the day before I played the Beethoven’s Violin Concerto. And then I realised something. I found myself thinking that Beethoven is much too great for me to control, and I should just play it, just worship it as something from above. That is what I focused on all evening. Music like this is simply above this Earth.” Kang had later placed first in the competition, and was as well awarded five special prizes. In 2011, she had released her first solo album, which was entitled \\"Modern Solo\\", for the record label Decca. Her second album, released 2016 and for the same record label, was a chamber duet performed with the famous South Korean classical pianist, Yeol-Eum Son, which is titled \\"Schumann Brahms Sonatas · Romances\\". “I always wished, from when I was young, to be able to perform and do music making as long as possible,” Clara-Jumi Kang told a Korean TV outlet during an interview. Clara-Jumi Kang had gone to perform with many of the world's leading conductors and orchestras. These orchestras including Cologne Chamber Orchestra, Kremerata Baltica, Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, Orchestre National de Belgique, The Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, Santa Fe Symphony Orchestra, Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra, NHK Symphony Orchestra, Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, New Japan Philharmonic, Hong Kong Sinfonietta, NCPA Orchestra, Beijing, Macao Orchestra and the Taipei Symphony Orchestra. Such conductors being Valery Gergiev, Lionel Bringuier, Vladimir Fedoseyev, Andrey Boreyko, Christoph Poppen, who was her teacher at the Munich Musikhochschule, Vladimir Spivakov, Yuri Temirkanov, Gidon Kremer, Gilbert Varga, Lü Jia, Myung-whun Chung, Heinz Holliger and Kazuki Yamada. Kim Young- wook, a very honorable professor of the Seoul National University had said, “Kang has everything ― she has the right technique, the right moves, understands and interprets each piece with depth… And above all, she really enjoys being on stage, which is something that you cannot teach. She is confident and knows what she is doing.” Kim Young-wook, and as well a few others, had named Clara-Jumi the Kumho Musician of the Year.

Biography Bartels was born July 25, 1945, in Honolulu. He was educated at Punahou School. Graduating from the University of Hawaii in 1967, Bartels received a bachelor's degree in fine arts and a graduate degree in Asian and Pacific art. He served in the Navy from 1967 to 1970 and was based in Saigon during the Vietnam War. From 1975 to 1998, Bartels served as the curator and later managing director of ʻIolani Palace. During his twenty- year career, he headed the final phase of the palace restoration and saw the return of many priceless artifacts. He resigned after a dispute with Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike Kawānanakoa, the President of the Friends of ʻIolani Palace, who is said to have sat on one of the two thrones in the museum for a photograph in Life magazine. He later served as the director of Washington Place, the former private residence of Hawaii's last monarch Queen Liliʻuokalani, helping to convert it from the Governor's mansion to a historic museum. Bartels also appeared on the documentaries The American Experience: Hawaii's Last Queen (1994) and Conquest of Hawaii (2003). In November 1980, Bartels married his childhood friend Regina Kawānanakoa (1947–2016), who was a cousin of Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike Kawānanakoa. The marriage ended in divorce but the two remained close friends for the remainder of Bartels's life. She was at his bedside before his death. On April 20, 2003, Bartels died of infection, despite having been successfully treated for multiple myeloma, in the Hoag Presbyterian Hospital, Newport Beach, California. He was buried at St. Andrew's Cathedral, next to Washington Place.

He is particularly known for his ōkubi-e (lit. \\"large head\\") portraits of leading Osaka actors such as this print. Hirosada used a number of gō art names throughout his career, including , and . He apparently began his career as , switching to Hirosada in mid-1847.Fiorillo \\"Konishi Hirosada\\" Some have suggested that Hirosada and his contemporary (fl. 1830-1847) were the same person; however, this remains unproven.Keyes 1973,210 Subject =Ichikawa Shikō III= As with Hirosada, little is known about the personal life of . He was born the son of a carpenter, but became the student then adopted son of kabuki actor .

The play was originally written for the bunraku puppet theatre by Takeda Izumo II, Miyoshi Shōraku and Namiki Senryū I in 1748, and adapted for kabuki later that year.Shōriya \\"Kanadehon Chūshingura\\" It remains one of the most famous and popular plays in the kabuki repertoire.Smith 2003, 21 A jidaimono historical drama, the play tells the ostensibly true and pervasively enduring story of a 1702 incident known as the Akō Affair, in which 47 loyal retainers of a wronged lord avenged his death then committed ritual seppuku suicide.Blomberg 2006, 167 The story of the 47 ronin has long been repeated and romanticized as an idealization of the bushido ethos, and held particular appeal during the latter half of the Tokugawa era Bell 2001, 2 despite, or perhaps in part due to, strict censorship imposed on re-tellings of the incident by the shogunate.Smith 2003, 23 Series The print belongs to a series of six known prints translated as Tales of Retainers of Unswerving Loyalty or The Exemplary Loyalty of the Faithful Samurai. Like the characters from the play depicted in each image from the series, Katō Yomoshichi is one of the loyal retainers of the provincial lord Enya Hangan.Bell 2001, 148 The others are as follows:  * * Hirosada produced multiple albums of this type portraying popular actors of the day as heroic warriors, including 忠孝武勇伝 (Chūka buyūden) (\\"Tales of Loyalty and Filial Devotion\\") and 高名武勇伝 (Kōmei buyūden) (\\"Tales of Brave Warriors of Renown\\" or \\"Tales of Renowned Heroes\\"), both issued in 1848. Doesburg has argued that such collections are attempts to circumvent censorship of kabuki- themed ukiyo-e under the Tenpō Reforms by cloaking the dramatic content within titles suggesting the promotion of moral values and \\"suggesting that the portraits were actually representations of famous men and women from history and legend\\".

Hirosada's print bears many of the typical marks of this genre including the plain background, the dramatic posing of the hands and arms, and the emphasis on facial features and make- up.JAANUS \\"ookubi-e\\" Hirosada is particularly associated with this genre of print due to both the number and quality of works of this type that he produced.

The company has been Italy's largest glass manufacturer and one of the world's leading suppliers of tableware and glassware. Founded in 1825 in Fidenza (Province of Parma, Italy), Bormioli Rocco produces glassware and plastic containers as well as containers focused on pharmaceutical use. Bormioli Rocco operates nine plants, two decorative ateliers, nine stores and one flagship store, with a presence in over 100 countries and with over 2,500 employees.  History  Rocco Bormioli (1830-1883), one of the founders along with his brothers Domenico, Carlo and his father Luigi. Parma, Bormioli Rocco headquarters (1854) The Bormioli family was originally from Altare, in the hinterland of Savona, where the family name was already known in the art of glass-making since the Middle-Age. The family name \\"Bormioli di Altare\\" can be tracked back to AD 1300, in the archives of Savona, for the purchase of soda (sodium carbonate). In 1825, Luigi Bormioli left Altare (Province of Savona) and moved to Borgo San Donnino (renamed Fidenza in 1927) in the province of Parma. With the money inherited from his father, Luigi started a glassware company. In 1832, after his death, the business was continued by his wife Petronilla, a mother of six children and a seventh coming. Together with her sons Dominic, Rocco and Charles, she led the company for 22 years. In 1854 they purchase the Royal Factory of Ceramics and Glasses Strada Farnese in Parma immediately changing its name to Brothers Bormioli Glassware. Soon the brothers split: Dominic remained in Fidenza, Carlo and Rocco in the capital. In the following years the company from Parma began to mechanize the production and moved into a larger facility near San Leonardo. In 1880 the company name changed to Bormioli Rocco Glass and Son. At the death Rocco, in 1893, succeeded his son Luigi. Joined in the period of the First World War by two sons, Alberto and Rocco. At the time the company was one of the major industrial company of the region. A position also confirmed in the next two decades. In the first post-war period and with more than 1,600 employees, the company was able to rely on a sales network worldwide. Bormioli Rocco worked with his son Pier Luigi, destined to lead the company after having become general manager in 1966. During the '80s, with the acquisition of other companies in Italy and abroad, was born the Bormioli Group in its now active core business (glass products for the household sector and industrial packaging for the pharmaceutical, perfumery / cosmetics and food). In the '90s, after the death of Pier Luigi Bormioli Rocco's son was forced by a strong financial crisis to cede a majority stake to Banca Popolare di Lodi. In the following years the company became part of Gruppo Banca Popolare (through its subsidiaries and participations Spa Efibanca Italian) that in 2011 was sold to the private equity firm Vision Capital, owning 53% of the group. Additionally, Giovanni Bellavite, an Italian entrepreneur from Milan, which now owns 17 % of the company (~ 90 million).

Jenkins in 2003 to lower blood cholesterol. This diet emphasizes using a portfolio of foods or food components that have found to associate with cholesterol lowering to enhance this effect. Viscous fiber, soy protein, plant sterols, and nuts are the four essential components of Portfolio diet. This diet is low in saturated fat, high in fibre. Researches have found it has comparable blood cholesterol effect to statin treatment. Background Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Several risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, overweight or obese, smoking, have been identified to promote the cardiovascular diseases. American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) have suggested life style management to control risk factors in order to reduce cardiovascular risk. One of the strategies is reducing dietary saturated fat intake to reduce blood low-density lipoprotein (LDL) which is considered as “bad” blood cholesterol. If dietary and life style management is ineffective, medication such as statin will be used to in conjunction to reduce blood cholesterol levels. Soy protein, nuts, viscous fibre, and plant sterols have been found to have cholesterol lowering effect. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved health claim for these foods. David Jenkins believes including all of these foods in the diet is able to achieve better cholesterol lowering results. Diet Typical portfolio diet includes about 50 grams nuts, such as walnuts, peanuts, almond, 2 grams plant sterols, 10-25 grams viscous fibre, coming from oats, barleys, psyllium, and 50 grams soy protein per day. Studies The first Portfolio diet study was conducted in 2002. The study compared the effect of cholesterol lowering effect using the portfolio diet versus Lovastatin. This is a randomized control trial. 46 healthy individuals with high blood cholesterol levels were randomly assigned into one of three study groups: 1. Diet low in saturated fat (Control group) 2. Same diet as 1 plus statin 3. A diet high in plant sterols, soy protein, viscous fibre, almond (diet portfolio) for a month. LDL level was reduced significantly in both the statin group and the diet portfolio group. There is no significant difference in the efficacy between these two groups. It concluded that diet portfolio has comparable cholesterol-lowering effect to statin treatment. The second study occurred between 2007 and 2009. It examined the effect of adding monounsaturated fatty acid to dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods in hyperlipidemia. 24 hyperlipidemic females followed diet low in saturated fat for a month, then they were randomly placed into a dietary portfolio low or high in monounsaturated fatty for another month. They found patients who consumed the dietary portfolio high in monounsaturated fatty acid had lower LDL level and higher high- density lipoprotein (HDL) level. Patients who consumed the dietary portfolio low in monounsaturated fatty had no change in HDL level. It concluded that using dietary portfolio high in monounsaturated fatty acid is able to further reduce cardiovascular risk by increasing. The third study was a parallel-design study of 351 hyperlipidemic patients across Canada between 2007 and 2009 to 1 to 3 treatments lasting for 6 months. Patients received dietary advice on either a low saturated fat diet or a dietary portfolio including soy protein, nuts, viscous fibre, and plant sterols. Routine dietary portfolio group received 2 clinic visits and intense dietary portfolio group received 7 clinic visits in 6 months. They found LDL in two dietary portfolio groups were significantly lower than the control group (diet low in saturated fat) and there is no difference between the regular dietary portfolio group and intense group.

He was called 'The Swart Captain' because of his mixed race, and he was mourned by both black and white people at his death. Early life He was the son of Police Inspector Alexander Darnley Nairne (1805–1880) and his wife Anna Sarah both of Kingston Jamaica. Alexander Darnley Nairne was the son of Scotsman Daniel Nairne (born about 1750 Nairnshire, Scotland; died 1816 in Clarendon Parish, Jamaica) and Sarah Williams, a Free Negress who was born in Jamaica. The terms Free Negro or Free Negress are obsolete terms indicating that a slave of African descent (or their descendant) was formally freed from the condition of slavery.Slaves were freed by their owners and this was regulated by official manumission laws: \\"...In the British island colonies, manumission laws were largely formulated according to the indemnification model. Indemnification amounts ranged from a fairly reasonable £50 (Bermuda, 1806), to £100 (Grenada, 1796), to a prohibitive £300 (Leeward Islands, 1798) and an even more prohibitive £500 for native and £l,000 for imported slaves (St. Kitts, 1802). Jamaica was the most liberal of the island colonies. There, waiver of the manumission bond was permitted if the vestry of the parish could be convinced that the manumission was not intended to defraud the parish or to place the burden for care of an aged or infirm slave upon the public charge. Similar proof of a slave's ability to support himself or herself was required in Dominica, Tobago, and the Bahamas, but those areas did not allow a waiver of the manumission bond.....” (quoted from The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery, Volume 1; Volume 7 edited by Junius P. Rodriguez pp 426-7, article written by Louise Heite.) With reference to the above statement “Jamaica was the most liberal of the island colonies. There, waiver of the manumission bond was permitted...” there are extensive 'Manumission of Slaves' records in the Jamaica Archives giving the name of the slave, the person who freed them and the cost. These hand-written records consist of 70 bound volumes and date from 1747 until 1838. http://www.jard.gov.jm/component/content/article/7.html Career Stanford Nairne was commissioned as Ensign in the 94th Regiment of Foot in 1862.Published in the London Gazette dated 19 December 1862, pg 6417: \\"Stanford, Norman McLeod Nairne, Gent., to be Ensign, by purchase, vice Farrer.\\"] He was promoted to Lieutenant in 1869.published in The Edinburgh Gazette of 5th Jan 1869 pg 19: \\"94th Foot—Lieutenant Stanford Norman McLeod Nairne to be Adjutant, vice Lieutenant H.

She is the daughter of Dr Alexander Samuel Samson of Weymouth Dorset. She accompanied her husband to India where he was serving with the 94th Regiment of Foot during the 1860s, and their only child (to live beyond infancy) was born there on 17 Sept 1865 at Umballa/Ambala, Bengal, India. They named her Beatrice Inez Jerome Cafe McLeod Nairne (1865–1943.) = Zulu War of 1879= The 94th Regiment was stationed in Aldershot military base in Southern England in 1879. On 26 February seven companies of the 94th left Southampton for South Africa on the ship SS China. The total strength of the regiment on board was 28 officers and 897 other ranks including Commanding Officer Lt. Col S. Malthus & Capt S N M Nairne. They took four weeks to cross the Atlantic, arriving at Simon's Bay near Cape Town on 25 March, and then reached Durban on 2 April after a further journey of 35 days. They set up their camp just outside Durban and three days later on 6 April the 94th received orders to commence their march to the front. They marched into Pietermaritzburg on 8 April and left on 11 April and arrived at Greytown on 14 April 1879. After marching more than a hundred miles north they encamped on the right bank of the White Mfolozi on 2 July 1879, within striking distance of Ulundi. They crossed the river and formed a large hollow rectangle before advancing across the Mahlabatini Plain and so took part in the Battle of Ulundi on 4 July. This was the final battle of the Anglo-Zulu War which resulted in a defeat for the Zulu army. The 94th marched with 20 officers and 593 other ranks. Their commanding officer was Lt. Col S. Malthus. His senior officers were Majors Murray and Anstruther, and five captains, including Captain Nairne who took charge of F Company. The 94th Regiment then left Zululand, clad in tattered rags and marched into the Transvaal where all eight companies of the regiment took part in the successful attack on Sekhukhune's stronghold on 28 November 1879. =First Boer War of 1880= In 1880 the 94th were widely distributed throughout the Transvaal, and one of the garrisons was established at Lydenburg (consisting of A and F Companies.) Capt Nairne was as usual in command of F Company. It was during the re-concentration of the companies in December 1880, in response to outbreaks of civil disorder by the Boers that A and F companies were ordered to march from Leydenberg to Pretoria. They were attacked at Bronkhorstspruit in what proved to be the opening clash of the First Boer War. The 94th lost one officer (Lieutenant Herbert Augustine Christopher Harrison) and 53 men killed in the carnage of the attack. Another four officers and 88 men received wounds of which three officers (Lt.Col. Philip Robert Anstruther, Captain Stanford Norman McLeod Nairne and Captain James MacSwiney) and 18 men later died. One officer and 105 men became prisoners of the Boers. (The information on these three military engagements has been summarised from the following article: Details of the ensuing siege of the British garrison at Lydenberg by the Boers are recorded by Mary Long the wife of the Lieutenant who was left in charge of the garrison at Lydenberg in her book Peace and War in the Transvaal. Lt Long (with 50 men) was left in charge of stores at Lydenberg while the 94th marched from Lydenberg to Bronkhorstspruit where they were ambushed. Captain Nairne was originally buried with his fellow officers in a walled enclosure at the site of the battle. The gravestones were later moved to their present site near the battlefield which is a few km south of Bronkhorstspruit on the road to Delmas.

An advantage of employing metaphors is that they permit individuals to visualize an abstract concept or phenomenon with which they have limited experience by comparing it with a concrete, well-understood concept such as physical movement through space. Metaphors to describe the Internet have been utilized since its creation and developed out of the need for the Internet to be understood by everyone when the goals and parameters of the Internet were still unclear. Metaphors helped to overcome the problems of the invisibility and intangibility of the Internet's infrastructure and to fill linguistic gaps where no literal expressions existed. \\"Highways, webs, clouds, matrices, frontiers, railroads, tidal waves, libraries, shopping malls, and village squares are all examples of metaphors that have been used in discussions of the Internet.\\" Over time these metaphors have become embedded in cultural communications, subconsciously shaping the cognitive frameworks and perceptions of users who guide the Internet's future development. Popular metaphors may also reflect the intentions of Internet designers or the views of government officials. Internet researchers tend to agree that popular metaphors should be re-examined often to determine if they accurately reflect the realities of the Internet, but many disagree on which metaphors are worth keeping and which ones should be left behind. Overview An earlier metaphor of the Internet was the information superhighway. Internet metaphors guide future action and perception of the Internet's capabilities on an individual and societal level. Internet metaphors are contestable and sometimes may present political, educational, and cognitive issues.Johnston, R. (2009). Salvation or destruction: Metaphors of the Internet. First Monday, 14(4). Retrieved June 20, 2014. Tensions between producer and user, commercial and non-commercial interests, and uncertainty regarding privacy all influence the shape these metaphors take. Common Internet metaphors such as the information superhighway are often criticized for failing to adequately reflect the reality of the Internet as they emphasize the speed of information transmission over the communal and relationship building aspects of the Internet.Markham, A. N. (2003, October). Metaphors reflecting and shaping the reality of the internet: Tool, place, way of being. In Association of Internet Researchers conference, Montreal, Canada. Internet researchers from a variety of disciplines are engaged in the analysis of metaphors across many domains in order to reveal their impact on user perception and determine which metaphors are best suited for conceptualizing the Internet. Results of this research have become the focus of a popular debate on which metaphors should be applied in political, educational, and commercial settings as well as which aspects of the Internet remain unaccounted for with current metaphors, limiting the scope of users understanding. Metaphors of the Internet often reveal the intentions of designers and industry spokespeople. \\"For instance, those who use metaphors of consumption and shopping malls will devote resources to developing secure exchange mechanisms. Broadcasting metaphors carry with them assumptions about the nature of interactions between audiences and content providers that are more passive than those suggested by interactive game metaphors and applications. Computer security experts deploy metaphors that invoke fear, anxiety, and apocalyptic threat\\" (Wyatt, 2004, p. 244).Wyatt, S. (2004). Danger! Metaphors at work in economics, geophysiology, and the Internet. Science, Technology & Human Values, 29(2), 242-261. The extent to which the Internet is understood across individuals and groups determines their ability to navigate and build Web sites and social networks, attend online school, send e-mail, and a variety of other functions. Internet metaphors provide a comprehensive picture of the Internet as a whole as well as describe and explain the various tools, purposes, and protocols that regulate the use of these communication technologies.Rudestam, K. E., & Schoenholtz-Read, J. (2010). Handbook of online learning: innovations in higher education and corporate training (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage Publications. Without the use of metaphors the concept of the Internet is abstract and its infrastructure difficult to comprehend.Dodge, M. (2008). Understanding Cyberspace Cartographies: A Critical Analysis of Internet Infrastructure Mapping. (Doctoral Dissertation). Retrieved from http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/m.dodge/thesis/chap_4.pdf When it was introduced the Internet created a linguistic gap as no literal expressions existed to define its functions and properties. Internet metaphors arose out of this predicament so that it could be adequately described and explained to the public. Essentially all language now used to communicate about the Internet is of a metaphorical nature, although users are often unaware of this reality because it is embedded in a cultural context that is widely accepted. There are several types of metaphors that serve various purposes and can range from describing the nature of online relationships, modeling the Internet visually, to the specific functions of the Internet as a tool. Each metaphor has implications for the experience and understanding of the Internet by its users and tends to emphasize some aspects of the Internet over others. Some metaphors emphasize space (Matlock, Castro, Fleming, Gann, & Maglio, 2014).  Popular culture  The World Wide Web was the first metaphor of the Internet, suggesting the networked connection of physical computers across the world. Common recurring themes regarding the Internet appear in popular media and reflect pervasive cultural attitudes and perceptions. Although other models and constructed metaphors of the Internet found in scholarly research and theoretical frameworks may be more accurate sources on the effects of the Internet, mass media messages in popular culture are more likely to influence how people think about and interact with the Internet.Baym, N. K. (2010). Personal connections in the digital age. Cambridge, UK: Polity. The very first metaphor to describe the Internet was the World Wide Web, proposed in 1989. However, uncertainty surrounding the structure and properties of the Internet was apparent in the newspapers of the 1990s that presented a vast array of contradicting visual models to explain the Internet. Spatial constructs were utilized to make the Internet appear as a tangible entity placed within a familiar geographical context. A popular metaphor adopted around the same time was cyberspace, coined by William Gibson in his novel Neuromancer to describe the world of computers and the society that gathers around them. Howard Rheingold, an Internet enthusiast of the 1990s, propagated the metaphor of virtual communities and offered a vivid description of the Internet as \\"...a place for conversation or publication, like a giant coffee-house with a thousand rooms; it is also a world-wide digital version of the Speaker's Corner in London's Hyde Park, an unedited collection of letters to the editor, a floating flea market, a huge vanity publisher, and a collection of every odd-special interest group in the world\\" (Rheingold 1993, p. 130). In 1991, Al Gore's choice to use the information superhighway as a metaphor shifted perceptions of the Internet as a communal enterprise to an economic model that emphasized the speed of information transmission. While this metaphor can still be found in popular culture, it has generally been dropped in favor of other metaphors due to its limited interpretation of other aspects of the Internet such as social networks. The most common types of metaphors in usage today relate to either social or functional aspects of the Internet or representations of its infrastructure through visual metaphors and models. = Social metaphors = Internet metaphors frequently arise from social exchanges and processes that occur online and incorporate common terms that describe offline social activities and realities. These metaphors often point to the fundamental elements that make up social interactions, even though online interactions differ in significant ways from face-to-face communication. Therefore, social metaphors tend to communicate more about the values of society rather than the technology of the Internet itself. Metaphors such as the electronic neighborhood and virtual community point to ways in which individuals connect to others and build relationships by joining a social network. Global village is another metaphor that evokes the imagery of closeness and interconnectedness that might be found in a small village, but is applied to the worldwide community of Internet users. However, the global village metaphor has been criticized for suggesting that the entire world is connected by the Internet as the continued existence of social divides prevent many individuals from accessing the Internet. The electronic frontier metaphor conceptualizes the Internet as a vast unexplored territory, a source of new resources, and a place to forge new social and business connections. Similar to the American ideology of the Western Frontier, the electronic frontier invokes the image of a better future to come through new opportunities afforded by the Internet. The Electronic Frontier Foundation is a non-profit digital rights group that adopted the use of this metaphor to denote their dedication to the protection of personal freedoms and fair use within the digital landscape. Social metaphors and their pervasive influence indicate the increasing importance placed on social interaction on the Internet. = Functional metaphors = Functional metaphors of the Internet shape our understanding of the medium itself and give us clues as to how we should actually use the Internet and interpret its infrastructure for design and policy making. These exist at the level of the Internet as a whole, at the level of a website, and the level of individual pages. The majority of these types of metaphors are based on the concept of various spaces and physical places; therefore, most are considered spatial metaphors. However, this aspect should not be considered the only defining feature of a functional metaphor as social metaphors are often spatial in nature. Cyberspace is the most widely used spatial metaphor of the Internet and the implications of its use can be seen in the Oxford English Dictionary definition, which denotes cyberspace as a space within whose boundaries digital communications take place.Bittarello, M. B. (2010). Spatial Metaphors describing the Internet and religious Websites: sacred Space and sacred Place. Observatorio (OBS*), 3(4). The implications of this spatial metaphor in discourse on law can be seen in instances where the application of traditional laws governing real property are applied to Internet spaces.Lemley, M. A. (2003). Place and cyberspace. California Law Review, 521–542. However, arguments against this type of ruling have claimed that the Internet is a borderless space, which should not be subject to the laws applied to places. Others have argued that the Internet is in fact a real space not sealed from the real world and can be zoned, trespassed upon, or divided up into holdings like real property.Graham, M. (2013). \\"Geography/Internet: Ethereal Alternate Dimensions of Cyberspace or Grounded Augmented Realities?\\" The Geographical Journal, 179, 177-182.Blavin, J. H., & Cohen, L. G. (2002). Gore, Gibson, and Goldsmith: \\"The Evolution of Internet Metaphors in Law and Commentary\\" Harv. JL & Tech., 16, 265. Surfing the 'Net' is a metaphor that uses the spatial domain of the ocean to suggest that navigating the Internet is similar to the flow of surfing. Other functional metaphors are based on travel within space, such as surfing the Net, which suggests that the Internet is similar to an ocean. Websites indicate components of a space, which are static and fixed, whereas webpages suggest pages of a book. Similarly, focal points of the Internet structure are called nodes. Home pages, chat rooms, windows, and the idea that one can jump from one page to the next also invoke spatial imagery that guide the functions that users perform on the Internet. Other metaphors refer to the Internet as another dimension beyond typical spaces, such as portals and gateways, which refer to access and communication functions. Firewalls invoke the image of physically blocking the incoming of information such as viruses and pop-up ads. Designers of computer systems often use spatial metaphors as a way of controlling the complexity of interfaces. Designers create actions, procedures, and concepts of systems based on similar actions, procedures, and concepts of other domains such as physical spaces so that they will be familiar to users. In designing hypertext, a system that links topics on a screen to related information, navigational metaphors such as landmarks, routes, and way-finding have often been implemented for users' ease of understanding how hypertext functions.Hsu, Y. C., & Schwen, T. M. (2003). The effects of structural cues from multiple metaphors on computer users’ information search performance. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 58(1), 39-55. = Visual metaphors = Visual metaphors are popular in conceptualizing the Internet and are often deployed in commercial promotions through visual media and imagery. The most common visual metaphor is a network of wires with nodes and route lines plotted on a geographically based map. However, maps of Internet infrastructure produced for network marketing are rarely based on actual pathways of wires and cable on the ground, but are instead based on circuit diagrams similar to those seen on subway maps.Dodge, M., & Kitchin, R. (2001). Atlas of cyberspace (Vol. 158). Reading: Addison-Wesley. The globe, or the Earth viewed from space, with network arcs of data flow wrapped around it, is another dominant metaphor for the Internet in Western contexts and is connected with the metaphor of the global village. Many abstract visual metaphors based on organic structures and patterns are found in literature on the Internet's infrastructure. Often, these metaphors are used as a visual shorthand in explanations as they allow one to refer to the Internet as a definite object without having to explain the intricate details of its functioning. Clouds are the most common of abstract metaphors employed for this purpose in cloud computing and have been used since the creation of the Internet. Other abstract metaphors of the Internet draw on the fractal branching of trees and leaves, and the lattices of coral and webs, while others are based on the aesthetics of astronomy such as gas nebulas, and star clusters. Technical methods such as algorithms are often used to create huge, complex graphs or maps of raw data from networks and the topology of connections. The typical result of this process are visual representations of the Internet that are elaborate and visually striking, resembling organic structures. These artistic, abstract representations of the Internet have been featured in art galleries, sold as wall posters, used on book covers, and have been claimed to be a picture of the whole Internet by many fans. However, there are no instructions on how these images may be interpreted. The main function of these representations has sometimes been explained as a metaphor for the complexity of the Internet.

Its membership includes most public and private high schools in San Diego and Imperial counties. History Official governance for high school sports in this area began in 1913, when the Southern California Interscholastic Athletic Council (SCIAC) was formed. Previous to that, some individual leagues dated back to the 1890s. The first local high school football game was played at Escondido High School against San Diego High School in 1898. The High School Athletic Association of Southern California was formed in 1904 to create a championship in the sport of track and field, precipitating the need for administering all sports. In 1914, the name was changed to the Southern Section also releasing the acronym SCIAC which was taken locally by the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference the following year. In 1917, the CIF took over administering sports statewide and the Southern Section became a part of it. The Southern Section was a behemoth, the largest section covering the most populated southern half of the state. In 1935, the Los Angeles Unified School District split from the section, forming their own CIF Los Angeles City Section. In 1960, the San Diego Section was formed by carving out San Diego County, initially taking 32 schools. In 2000, Imperial County split from Southern Section and joined with San Diego. In 2013 the section began organizing playoff divisions based on team strength not school enrollment. An Open division was created for the top 8 teams in most major sports.

The team was formerly the Augusta RiverHawks, who suspended operations for the 2013–14 season due to ice system failure at James Brown Arena. History The franchise originally played in Augusta, Georgia, as the Augusta RiverHawks from 2010 to 2013. Talks of relocation started in October 2013, when the RiverHawks, the city of Augusta, and Global Spectrum failed to reach an agreement on replacing the James Brown Arena's ice system at a cost of $1.2 million; additionally, the team, city officials and arena officials could not reach a settlement regarding the eight home games lost due to the ice system's failure. Team owner Bob Kerzner had not initially considered relocating to Macon; however Macon Centreplex officials had contacted the league, showing interest in bringing a team, either by expansion or relocation, to Macon. On June 17, the Macon-Bibb Commission approved a five-year deal for the RiverHawks in the Coliseum. On June 25, the RiverHawks made their move to Macon official, unveiling their colors and logo. The team did not take to the ice until the 2015–16 SPHL season, allowing the team to establish its business relations and fanbase in Central Georgia. On February 4, 2015, Kevin Kerr was hired as the director of hockey operations and head coach. In the Mayhem's second season, the team clinched the President's Cup, sweeping the Peoria Rivermen 2–0 in the championship series. After the team's third season, head coach Kevin Kerr was hired by the Greenville Swamp Rabbits of the ECHL as head coach. The Mayhem then promoted assistant coach Leo Thomas as head coach for the 2018–19 season. Under Thomas, the Mayhem went 27–24–5 and lost in the first round of the playoffs in the 2018–19 season. After a 2–6–2 start to the 2019–20 season, the Mayhem released Thomas and assistant coach Ryan Michel took over.

Description Colonies of Alveopora allingi adopt a variety of forms. They can be columnar or encrusting, or have a number of short irregular lobes. The polyps are crowded together, fleshy and elongated, with a crown of tentacles with somewhat inflated tips. Biology Alveopora allingi is a zooxanthellate species of coral. It obtains most of its nutritional needs from the symbiotic dinoflagellates that live inside its soft tissues. These photosynthetic organisms provide the coral with organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes providing up to 90% of their host's energy needs for metabolism and growth. Its remaining needs are met by the planktonic organisms caught by the tentacles of the polyps. Status This coral is susceptible to coral bleaching but not particularly prone to coral diseases. It is an attractive small coral and is collected by the reef aquarium trade. All corals receive protection by being listed on CITES Appendix II. The main threats faced by corals are related to climate change; the mechanical destruction of their coral reef habitats, increasing damage from extreme weather events, rising sea water temperatures and ocean acidification.

He was one of the highest-ranking Uyghur or Muslim politicians of the People's Republic of China.  Early life and career in Xinjiang  Amat was born 1935 in Qira County, Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang Province, Republic of China. His parents were poor Uyghur peasants. From 1952 to 1954, he took part in the land reform movement in his hometown, and joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1953. He rose quickly in the government of Qira and became the county magistrate in 1954 at the age of 19. In 1960, he was selected to study in Beijing at the Central Party School of the CPC for two years. After returning to Xinjiang, he became deputy publicity head of Hotan Prefecture in 1963. During the Cultural Revolution, Amat was elevated to the regional government of Xinjiang in 1969 and elected to the 10th Central Committee of the CPC in 1972. From 1971 to 1979 he served as Xinjiang's party secretary (then subordinate to the first secretary) and director of its Organization Department. In 1979, he became Chairman (Governor) of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region at the age of 44. During his six-year tenure, he oversaw Xinjiang's transition to a market economy in Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening era.  Career in the national government  In 1986, Amat was elevated to the national government and became Minister of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, a key position in charge of affairs concerning ethnic minorities, especially the Tibetans and Muslim groups such as the Uyghurs. As a prominent Muslim CPC leader, he served as a mouthpiece of China's ethnic policies and condemned separatist movements. He served in the position until 1998, and concurrently as vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) from 1988 to 1993. From 1993 to 2003 he also served as a vice-premier-level State Councillor. During his tenure there were multiple anti-Chinese protests in Xinjiang which were suppressed by the government. Amat supported the official policy of harshly treating ethnic separatists while promoting economic growth and stability in minority regions. From 2003 to 2008 Amat served as vice-chairman of the 10th National People's Congress. As one of the highest-ranking Uyghur or Muslim politicians in the history of the People's Republic of China, he frequently visited Central Asian nations and met with visiting dignitaries from Islamic countries. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the United States captured a number of Chinese Uyghurs in the War in Afghanistan and held them in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. China considered the Uyghur detainees terrorists and demanded that the US hand them over to Chinese custody. When the demand was refused, Amat condemned the US in 2006. Amat served as a member of seven consecutive CPC Central Committees, from the 10th to the 16th, spanning 45 years.  Death  Ismail Amat died on 16 October 2018 in Beijing, at the age of 83. He was buried at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, Vice President Wang Qishan, Party former General Secretary Hu Jintao, other Party Politburo Standing Committee members Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji, Han Zheng and many other top leaders attended his funeral.

Located at the northern end of the park, the art installation commemorates the Stonewall riots and features four figures (two standing men and two seated women) positioned in \\"natural, easy\\" poses. The bronze statues are covered in white lacquer, cast in 1980 from plaster moulds of human models. Two \\"World's Fair-style\\" benches and a plaque are also part of the monument. The monument was dedicated on June 23, 1992, and is part of the Stonewall National Monument. The sculpture was originally commissioned in 1979 (10th anniversary of the Stonewall incident) by the Cleveland-based Mildred Andrews Fund. The commission specified that the work must be installed on public land and that it \\"had to be loving and caring, and show the affection that is the hallmark of gay people. . . . And it had to have equal representation of men and women.\\" It was completed in 1980 and was the first piece of public art dedicated to LGBT rights. It was intended for installation in New York but proved too controversial for the city. It was instead installed in Orton Park in Madison, Wisconsin from 1986 to 1991. The Madison installation was funded by the New Harvest Foundation. It was finally moved to New York in 1992. After it was moved to New York, one of the Stonewall veterans, Marsha P. Johnson, commented, \\"How many people have died for these two little statues to be put in the park to recognize gay people? How many years does it take for people to realize we're all brothers and sisters in the human race? We're all in this rat race together.\\" In August 2015, anonymous activists painted two of the figures' faces brown to protest the way the statues \\"white- and cis-wash a movement led by black and brown queer and trans people\\". Stanford University George Segal was visiting Stanford University’s Gay People’s Union (GPU) on a social night on the upper floor of the Old Fire House. George had just come from the meeting where San Francisco’s Arts Commission had just rejected the second casting statue, as later did Los Angeles, and George was wondering what to do with it. GPU member, Mike Brady, told George “We’ll take it. Lets make arrangements with the University.” GPU was an early pioneering LGBTQ student organization. In 1984 it was installed on Stanford University's Main Quad as a \\"long term loan\\". The sculpture was vandalized several times during the first ten years, but eventually became an accepted part of Stanford's public art.

Askins (born 1939) is an American chemist. She is best known for her invention of a method to enhance underexposed photographic negatives. This development was used extensively by NASA and the medical industry, and it earned Askins the title of National Inventor of the Year in 1978.  Early years, education and early career  Askins was born in Belfast, Tennessee in 1939. She began her career as a teacher. After her two children entered school, Askins returned to college to complete her bachelor's degree in chemistry and earn her master's degree in chemistry. She joined NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in 1975.https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/barbara-askins  Research career  Askins is a physical chemist who worked for NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and is best known for her pioneering invention of a process in which \\"images on developed photographic emulsions can be significantly intensified by making the image silver radioactive and exposing a second emulsion to this radiation.\\" The resulting print, known as an autoradiograph, reproduces the image with significant increases in density and contrast. Her groundbreaking method enhanced underexposed emulsions and increased the limits of photographic detection. In short, it made visible the invisible in photos that would otherwise have been useless. This was very useful for a number of applications, including the coaxing of data from underexposed space images—such as those peering deep into space as well as those highlighting the geology of other bodies in our solar system. Askins' invention also led to significant advances in the field of medical technology. In particular, Askins' method prompted improvements in the development of X-ray images. Medical images that were 96 percent underexposed suddenly become readable; this meant that doctors could dramatically decrease the amount of X-ray radiation they gave to patients when running routine or emergency tests. Askins' process was also later used in the restoration of old photographs. Askins patented her invention in 1978 (U.S. patent No. 4,101,780), and NASA employed it extensively for its research and development work. Awards and professional memberships In 1978, the Association for Advancement of Inventions and Innovations named Askins the National Inventor of the Year. She was the first individual woman to earn this honor. Askins is a member of the American Chemical Society, the Sigma Xi honorary research Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the World Future Society.

He drew audiences first at provincial towns such as Bath, then moving his venue to London. His theatre (dubbed \\"Punch's Opera\\" or \\"Punch's Theatre\\") established itself in early 1710 at its first location, at the north end of St. Martin's Street intersected by Litchfield St., not quite in Covent Garden. But by 1711 he relocated the theatre to the galleries of Covent Garden, at Little Piazza, opposite St. Paul's Church. He has been credited with establishing the stock form of the Punch and Judy plays. Charles Magnin, the learned author of the Histoire des Marionnettes en Europe, calls the years of Powell's pre-eminence \\"the golden age of marionettes in England.\\" It has been commented \\"Powell is described as a deformed cripple but his powers of satire were considerable,\\" to the extent that the ministry recruited Powell to lampoon the French prophets to diminish their influence among the populace. He not only narrated (spoke the lengthy prologues), with a wand in hand, but was a puppeteer himself, and he is thought to have built his own puppet figures and written the plays himself. A 20th-century scholar assesses the period of Powell's prominent activity to be 1709–1720, the popularity of his puppetry having waned in the latter years, \\"his son briefly carried on the tradition in the [1720s]\\", and he died 1729. Repertoire =Bath= In Bath (1709), Powell had his success with, e.g., The Creation of the World, which in its Noah's Flood segment featured \\"Punch and his wife dancing in the Ark.\\" The Creation of the World, was also later put on by Powell at Bartholomew Fair. This puppet show was not exclusive to Powell at the time, and a puppeteer known as \\"Crawley\\" staged it at Southwark Fair in 1695, and later at Bartholomew Fair in 1727. *The Children in the Wood, was \\"presumably performed at Bath\\". *Mother Shipton, together with The Seven Champions of Christendom and Valentine and Orson. =Covent Garden= Once in London, in an escalated rivalry with Her Majesty's Theatre in Haymarket (i.e., with serious dramas and operas), he arranged various puppet operas, including: *\\"King Bladud, Founder of the Bath\\" (1711) *The City Rake (The Town Rake, or Punch turn'd Quaker) 1711) *The History of Sir Richard Whittington (\\"The True and Ancient History of Sir Richard Whittington, Thrice Lord Mayor of London, and his Cat\\") (1711) *Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay (1711) *\\"Poor Robin's Dream, or the Vices of the Age Exposed\\" (end of April, 1711?) *Faustus' Trip to the Jubilee (1712) – Spoof of Dr. Faustus *The False Triumph; or, The Destruction of Troy' (1712) *The State of Innocense, or the Fall of Man. (1712) *The Unnatural Brother, or the Orphan Betrayed (1712) *Orpheus and Erudice (1712) *Beauteous Sacrifice (1712) – new play but really a remake of Creation *Venus and Adonis, or the Triumphs of Love: a mock opera (1713) *Mother Lowse (Mother Louse) (1714) Response One contemporary observer who often wrote following Martin Powell's career was Richard Steele, as an editor of the 1709–1710 journal Tatler, or the Lucubrations of Isaac Bickerstaff and later of the 1711 journal Spectator. In the Tatler, Steele assumed the persona of Isaac Bickerstaff, Esquire, writing a (feigned) affront that Powell was mocking Bickerstaff through the puppet Punch. Not much here can be taken at face value, since the venom against Powell is in jest (characterized \\"bantering allusions\\"), the purported letter written by Powell to the editor is a \\"fictitious\\" fabrication, and in the subtext it is really about a veiled defense of his friend Benjamin Hoadly in his church and state dispute against Ofspring Blackall, Bishop of Exeter. Following up the bantering allusions to Powell in the Tatler, Richard Steele, in the Spectator (No. 14), made the under-sexton of St. Paul's, Covent Garden, write to complain that his congregation took the warning of his bell, morning and evening, to go to a puppet show set forth by one Powell under the piazzas. \\"I have placed my son at the piazzas to acquaint the ladies that the bell rings for church, and that it stands on the other side of the garden; but they only laugh at the child.\\" Another correspondent writes describing Powell's show, which he compares favourably with the opera at the Haymarket; \\"for whereas the living properties at the Haymarket were ill trained, Powell has so well disciplined his pig that in the first scene he and Punch dance a minuet together\\". When the fanatics called French prophets were creating disturbances in Moorfields, the ministry ordered Powell to make Punch turn prophet, which he did so well that it soon put an end to the prophets and their prophecies. In 1710, says Lord Chesterfield, the French prophets were totally extinguished by a puppet show. On 20 April 1710 Luttrell mentions that four Indian sachems who were visiting London went to see Powell's entertainment. In the Groans of Great Britain (1711), formerly considered to be Daniel Defoe's work, Charles Gildon (d. 1724) complains of Powell's popularity, and states that his wealth was sufficient to buy up all the poets of England. \\"He seldom goes out without his chair, and thrives on this incredible folly to that degree that, were he a freeman, he might hope that some future puppet show might celebrate his being Lord Mayor as he hath done Dick Whittington.\\" Steele, who saw Powell as late as 1729, states that he made a generous use of his money. Martin Powell's shows lost popularity in within a matter of few years, and dropped out into obscurity after a mention in the anonymous pamphleteer ballad, Bartholomew Fair: An Heroi-Comical Poem (1717). In 1715, Thomas Burnet wrote a brief biography entitled A Second Tale of a Tub, or History of Robert Powell the Puppet Showman. The substitution of Robert for Powell's real name, Martin, was made to render the obvious satire upon Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford more effective.

Tower climbers, also known as wireless service technicians, cell site technicians, cell site engineers, aerial technician, field technicians, tower hands, or simply tower dogs, are people that specialize in maintenance, installation, and decommissioning of cellular and radio tower components such as coaxial cable, antennas, radios, fiber optic cable and broadcast equipment for cell phones, television, radio etc. Description Tower climbers perform routine inspections and tests on broadcasting towers, and may also be called upon to perform repairs and to provide input when plans for new equipment are being developed. Along with the installers of the tower antennas, other crews climb the towers to perform condition checks of the towers, guy lines and lighting systems. One of the most demanding aspects of many tower climber jobs is hauling materials and tools up to the proper installation height on the tower. In most cases, the climber scales the tower to the desired height and lowers a rope to a ground crew member who then ties it to a needed part on the ground. The tower worker then pulls the piece up and secures the rope before installing the part onto the tower. Hazards Tower climbers may be injured or killed by falling objects, structural collapses and equipment failures. Some of the more frequently encountered hazards include falls from great heights; electrical hazards; hazards associated with hoisting personnel and equipment with base-mounted drum hoists; inclement weather; and structural collapse of towers. =In the United States= Working on cellphone towers is the deadliest job in the United States, according to a trade publication,http://www.rcrnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080709/FREE/539166731/1098 and it has been claimed that the tower climbing industry experiences 10 times more death casualties than the construction workers. There were 50 - 100 deaths from falls from communication towers between 2003 and 2011.

Before the First World War Duncan Grant and Maynard Keynes While still in the Bloomsbury area LGBT activity was all very much in a single group. For example, Duncan Grant, a homosexual with bisexual leanings,Angelica Garnett, Deceived with Kindness (1984) p. 33 (in 1995 edition) had affairs with Maynard Keynes, James Strachey, Adrian Stephen, David Garnett and straight Vanessa Bell. Names of LGBT people outside the Bloomsbury Group strictly speaking include Mary Garman, Nina Hamnett, Jane Ellen Harrison, Rupert Brooke and Arthur Hobhouse. D. H. Lawrence had criticised the homosexual tendencies in the Bloomsbury Group, though close to the core members of the groupFrancis Spalding, Duncan Grant: A Biography. (1997) p. 169-170: (around 1915 Lawrence warned David Garnett against homosexual tendencies like those of Francis Birrell, Duncan Grant and Keynes:) \\"Lawrence's views, as Quentin Bell was the first to suggest and S. P. Rosenbaum has argued conclusively, were stirred by a dread of his own homosexual susceptibilities, which are revealed in his writings, notably the cancelled prologue to Women in Love\\" During and after the First World War Later the groups differentiated. Keynes married Lydia Lopokova, and gradually ceased having affairs with men. Other groups more or less split according to the location where they started to live. Most of LGBT men in and around the Bloomsbury Group were conscientious objector during the war: they had to leave London in order to do manual labour on the land. =Lady Ottoline Morrell's circle= Lady Ottoline Morrell's extravagant parties no longer brought the group together, but during the First World War she did provide housing for conscientious objector Aldous Huxley at Garsington Manor, where he was married to Maria Nys after the war. D. H. Lawrence, another visitor of Garsington, befriended Huxley. =Charleston= Also Duncan Grant and David Garnett had to work on the land as conscientious objectors during World War I. They started living with Vanessa Bell in Charleston Farmhouse. Francis Birrell started a bookshop together with David Garnett later on. =Lytton Strachey and Dora Carrington= Dora Carrington, Ralph Partridge and Lytton Strachey Also during the First World War Lytton Strachey and Dora Carrington moved to Tidmarsh Mill House.

Forster spent his time as conscientious objector in Egypt, and remained there some time after the First World War. When returning to England his circle of LGBT friends and acquaintances included W. J. H. Sprott, J. R. Ackerley, Christopher Isherwood, Siegfried Sassoon, Forrest Reid and Benjamin Britten. = Virginia Woolf = Virginia and Leonard Woolf first moved to Hogarth House in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, where they set up the Hogarth Press. Later they moved to Monk's House in East Sussex.  Hogarth Press  Katherine Mansfield and John Lehmann were LGBT acquaintances linked to Hogarth Press, the publishing company Virginia Woolf owned with her husband Leonard Woolf.  Orlando  After Virginia Woolf had moved to Monk's House, she would meet Vita Sackville-West, writing her Roman à clef Orlando: A Biography about her. Woolf also met the LGBT people around her, including Harold Nicolson, Sackville-West's husband, Benedict Nicolson, their LGBT son and Violet Trefusis, her former lover.Souhami, pp. 123-124  Other  Composer and suffragist Ethel Smyth was another later acquaintance of Virginia Woolf.Spalding 1991  References  Bibliography * Todd Avery.

In 1720 the state was renamed Nagod after its new capital. In 1807 Nagod was a tributary to Panna and was included in the sanad granted to that state. In 1809, however, Lal Sheoraj Singh was recognized and confirmed in his territory by a separate sanad granted to him. Nagod State became a British protectorate after the treaty of Bassein in 1820. Raja Balbhadra Singh was deposed in 1831 for murdering his brother. The state fell into debt and in 1844 the administration was taken over by the British owing to economic mismanagement. The ruler was loyal during the Indian Mutiny in 1857 and was granted the pargana of Dhanwahl. In 1862 the Raja was granted a sanad allowing adoption and in 1865 local rule was reestablished. Nagod State was a part of Baghelkhand Agency from 1871 till 1931, when it was transferred along with other smaller states back to Bundelkhand Agency.

All of these schools were once associated with the Los Angeles Unified School District. It is one of ten sections that constitute the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF). History Official governance for high school sports in this area began in 1913, when the Southern California Interscholastic Athletic Council (SCIAC) was formed. Previous to that, some individual leagues dated back to the 1890s. The High School Athletic Association of Southern California was formed in 1904 to create a championship in the sport of track and field, precipitating the need for administering all sports. In 1914, the name was changed to the Southern Section also releasing the acronym SCIAC which was taken locally by the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference the following year. In 1917, the CIF took over administering sports statewide and the Southern Section became a part of it. The Southern Section was a behemoth, the largest section covering the most populated southern half of the state. In 1935, the Los Angeles Unified School District split from the section, forming their own Los Angeles City Section. Private schools within the city limits remained in the Southern Section. Since the advent of charter schools in the Los Angeles area, several high schools are no longer under the direct governance of LAUSD, but remain with the historical leagues and the Los Angeles City Section.

The southern rock-cut chamber contained ceramic datable to a period stretching from approximately the first century BC to 70 AD, an interval that includes the presumed lifetime of Zechariah, Elizabeth and John. =Byzantine period= The lower courses of the current church possibly date to the Byzantine period (4th-7th century). =Early Muslim period= The church is mentioned in the Book of the Demonstration, attributed to Eutychius of Alexandria (940): \\"The church of Bayt Zakariya in the district of Aelia bears witness to the visit of Mary to her kinswoman Elizabeth.\\" According to French archaeologist Félix-Marie Abel, most of the current church probably dates back to the 11th century (the Fatimid period), with the lowest part of the walls possibly dating to the Byzantine period (4th-7th century). =Crusader period= A Russian pilgrim known as Abbot Daniel visited the village in 1106 and described here two churches. In the one identified by him as \\"the house of Zechariah .... where the holy Virgin came to greet Elizabeth\\", he mentions, on the left side, a \\"small cavern, in which John the Forerunner was born.\\" The grotto seen in the current church at the front of the left aisle must be the same one mentioned by Daniel.

It is at present a large square building, uniform and neat all over; but that which is most eminently beautiful in it is its Church. It consists of three Isles, and has in the middle a handsome Cupola, under which is a pavement of Mosaick, equal to, if not exceeding the finest works of the Ancients in that kind. At the upper end of the North Isle, you go down seven Marble steps, to a very splendid Altar, erected over the very place where they say the holy Baptist was Born. Here are Artificers still employed, in adding farther beauty and ornament to this Convent.\\"Maundrell, 1703, p. 92 19th century James Silk Buckingham visited in the early 1800s, and found the convent \\"appeared to be superior in comfort and arrangement to that of Jerusalem, and equal to that of Nazareth. The church is one of the most simply beautiful throughout the Holy Land. As the friars are all Spaniards, it partakes more of the style of that nation than any other, in its ornaments.\\"Buckingham, 1821, pp. 228-229 In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) noted: \\"The Church of the Baptist, in the village itself, is of Crusading origin; but the interior has been covered with encaustic tiles, and none of the older work is recognizable. The dome rises from four heavy piers; the grotto north of the high altar (at the east end of the church), is reached by seven steps; it is said to be the birthplace of St. John. A bad copy of a Murillo is hung on the north side of the church, and much prized by the monks, who are chiefly Spaniards\\".Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, pp. 60-61 =British Mandate period= In 1941-42 the Franciscans excavated the area west of the church and monastery.

It is considered \\"the inaugural work of the Russian Symbolist movement\\" and is in the collection of the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. The image of St. Sergius of Radonezh, who had been born Bartholomew, was near and dear to the artist since childhood and was the embodiment of the moral ideal for Nesterov. Nesterov gave St. Sergius a particularly important role in rallying the Russian people. The painting illustrates an episode from \\"The Life of St. Sergius\\" by Epiphanius the Wise: > One day his father sent him to look for a lost foal. On his way he met a > monk, a venerable elder, a stranger, a priest, with the appearance of an > angel. This stranger was standing beneath an oak tree, praying devoutly and > with much shedding of tears. The boy, seeing him, humbly made a low > obeisance, and awaited the end of his prayers. The venerable monk, when he > had ended his prayers, glanced at the boy and, conscious that he beheld the > chosen vessel of the Holy Spirit, he called him to his side, blessed him, > bestowed on him a kiss in the name of Christ, and asked: \\"What art thou > seeking, or what dost thou want, child?\\" The boy answered, \\"My soul desires > above all things to understand the Holy Scriptures. I have to study reading > and writing, and I am sorely vexed that I cannot learn these things. Will > you, holy Father, pray to God for me, that he will give me understanding of > book-learning?\\" The monk raised his hands and his eyes toward heaven, > sighed, prayed to God, then said, \\"Amen.\\" Taking out from his satchel, as if > it were some treasure, with three fingers, he handed to the boy what > appeared to be a little bit of white wheaten bread prosphora, saying to him: > \\"Take this in thy mouth, child, and eat; this is given thee as a sign of > God's grace and for the understanding of Holy Scriptures. Though the gift > appears but small, the taste thereof is very sweet.\\" From that time on Bartholomew could read and write, became a monk, and adopted the name of Sergius. The artist did his sketches of landscapes in 1899 in the vicinity of the Trinity Sergius Lavra, settling in the village of Komyakovo near Abramtsevo and Radonezh. Abramtzevo became one of his favourite places. There he finished the landscape part and then went to Ufa. The artist was in a hurry, because he was preparing for the XVIII Peredvizhniki exhibition and despite having flu, continued to work actively. One day he felt dizzy, he stumbled (he stood on a small stool), fell and injured the canvas. It was impossible to continue the work, he needed a new canvas, which finally was brought.Нестеровский, художественный. Шедевры. — Изобразительное искусство Башкирии The painting, which caused the most contradictory opinions, became a sensation at the XVIII Peredvizhniki exhibition and was bought by Pavel Tretyakov for his gallery. Until the end of his life, the artist was convinced that \\"The Vision of the Youth Bartholomew\\" remained his best work. In old age, the artist used to say: > I won't be the one who lives. \\"Youth Bartholomew\\" will.

On 23–24 June, gunmen attacked a number of villages in Kaduna State, killing around 150 people. The attack was blamed on Fulani tribesmen. On 25 June 2014, a bomb exploded at the Emab Plaza in the national capital of Abuja, killing at least 21 people. In response to the bombing, the Nigerian military raided two militants camps on 26 June, killing more than 100 people. Background Over 20,000 people have been killed in Nigeria between 2009 and 2014 during an Islamist insurgency, led by the militant group Boko Haram. Boko Haram opposes the Westernization of Nigeria, which they believe is the root cause of criminal behaviour in the country. The federal government declared a state of emergency in May 2013 in Borno State in its fight against the insurgency. The resulting crackdown, however, has failed to stabilise the country. Boko Haram's attacks have intensified in 2014. In February, the group killed more than 100 Christian men in the villages of Doron Baga and Izghe. Also in February, 59 boys were killed in the Federal Government College attack in Yobe State. By mid-April, Boko Haram had been blamed for nearly 4,000 deaths in 2014. Militants then attacked a school and kidnapped 276 girls, of which 57 escaped, in Chibok. The incident brought international attention on the situation in Nigeria, and Western nations promised to help fight Boko Haram. However, attacks continued. On 20 May, 118 people were killed in a pair of bombings in Jos. The following day, two dozen people were killed in a raid on a village. Vigilante groups have subsequently formed throughout the North, with modest success in repelling attacks. Attacks in Gwoza LGA, Borno State, are difficult to confirm due to poor communications. Additionally, Nigeria has also had attacks by MEND. Kaduna village attacks On 23 June 2014, gunmen attacked the villages of Kabamu and Ankpong in Kaduna State, killing 38 people according to vigilante leader Christopher Chisom. Governor Ramalan Yero confirmed the attack, although reported the villages attacked as Fadan Karshi and Nandu. He said 17 villagers had been killed around 10 pm in Fadan Karshi, with two assailants captured or killed. At 2am, 21 people were killed in Nandu by the same gunmen. \\"Many\\" others were injured, although an exact figure was unavailable. The president of the Ninzon Progressive Youths organisation said a threatening letter from the Fulani had warned of the attack earlier in the month. Elsewhere that evening, additional gunmen attacked seven other villages: Dogon-Daji, Gani, Hayin-Kwanta, Kabani, Kabamu, Kobin, and Naidu. According to Chisom, a total of 123 additional people were killed in the overnight raids: 38 in Kobin, 30 in Kabamu, 21 in Dogon-Daji, 16 in Naidu, 9 in Gani, 5 in Hayin Kwanta, and 4 in Kabani. The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) also reported that at least 100 people had been killed in the attacks. According to reports, two of the attackers were wearing police uniforms. No official death toll has been released. The perpetrators' identity is unclear, although three Fulani herdsmen were arrested in connection with the attack on 25 June. A CAN spokesperson remarked \\"I believe that they are terrorists because the Fulani that we live with cannot do this thing.\\" He also said that the chanting indicated the attack was motivated by religion. Three AK-47s and 158 rounds of ammunition were confiscated in the arrests. The Sanga Local Government Area declared a 24-hour curfew in response to the attacks. Emab Plaza bombing An explosion occurred at the Emab Plaza, a busy shopping center, in Abuja just before 16:00 on 25 June near federal government offices. The blast, which occurred during peak traffic hours, resulted in billowing smoke. An eyewitness reported: \\"We heard a really loud noise and the building shook ...We saw the smoke and people covered in blood. It was just chaos.\\" According to official reports, at least 21 people were killed in the attack. The Premium Times reported there were at least 30 deaths with a likelihood of more casualties. More than 50 people were injured in the attack. A suspect attempting to flee the scene was shot and killed. A bag he was carrying contained additional explosives. On 26 June, the Multinational Joint Task Force responded to the attack by raiding two militant camps. According to the Minister of Defense, roughly 50 militants were killed at each location. Two soldiers were killed in the raids. President Goodluck Jonathan cut short an African Union meeting to meet with families of the blast victims on 27 June. \\"Nigerians are struggling, thinking about how to contribute to [the] nation's development and working very hard to take care of their families [while] others are busy to kill people,\\" he remarked. No claim of responsibility was made, but media reports generally linked the bombing to Boko Haram. A week earlier, government intelligence indicated the group was planning to hijack gasoline trucks and drive them into the capital, strapped with improvised explosive devices.

The state had a privy purse of 33,000 Rs. and was one of the nine Chota Nagpur States under the authority of the governor of Bengal Presidency. It was one of the Odia Princely states of India during the period of the British Raj and the major language spoken in the area is Odia. The capital was the city of Kharsawan and the former area of Kharsawan State is now a part of Jharkhand, where its district is named Seraikela Kharsawan district. Kumar Aditya Narayan Singh Deo and his father Maharaj Kumar Rudra Pratap Singh Deo appreciated the name change of the district. History Kharsawan estate was founded in 1650. The rulers of Kharsawan are descended from Kunwar Bikram Singh of Porahat, the first ruler of neighbouring Seraikela State. His second son, Kunwar Padam Singh was the founder of Kharsawan.Rajput Provinces of India – Kharsawan (Princely State) In 1857 Kharsawan estate was recognized as a state. In 1912 Kharsawan came under the authority of the province of Bihar and Orissa, which had been carved from the eastern districts of Bengal. In 1936 the state was placed under the authority of the Orissa Province. Saraikela, along with 24 other princely states of the Eastern States Agency, acceded to the Government of India on 1 January 1948, with a will to merge the princely state with Orissa province of the Indian Republic. As a result, both Kharsawan and Saraikela princely states were merged with Orissa in 1948. On 1 January 1948 itself, the tribals of these two princely states, who were in a majority, revolted against the merger with Orissa. This was supported by Patayet Sahib Maharajkumar Bhoopendra Narayan Singh Deo, third son of Raja Aditya Pratap Singh Deo, as a result of which he was imprisoned to ensure the popular movement died down. The central government appointed a commission under Mr. Baudkar to look into the matter. On the basis of the Baudkar commission report, Saraikela and Kharsawan princely states were merged with Bihar on 18 May 1948. These two princely states became part of Jharkhand when the state was separated from Bihar on 15 November 2000. From 18 May 1948 onward, many non-tribal Oriyas of the districts of Saraikela Kharsawan, East Singhbhum, and West Singhbhum have migrated and settled permanently in Orissa. =Rulers= Former rulers bore the title of 'Thakur' until 1917. They belonged to the dynasty of Videhas. The title of Raja was granted to Kharsawan rulers in 1902, beginning with Raja Ram Chandra Singh Deo. The present head of the royal family is Raja Pradeep Chandra Singh Deo. The last ruler of the state, HH Raja Siram Chandra Singh Deo, signed the merger agreement acceding to the Indian Union on 18 May 1948. The Maharaja of Darbhanga used to visit this state to pay respects as the trade route to the east coast ran through the thick jungles of Singhbhum and safety was guaranteed only to those who were in the good books.

Before his wrestling career ended in 2009, Scherrer trained full-time for Ringerclub Willisau under his personal coach Erwin Mühlemann. Scherrer made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's heavyweight division (97 kg). He lost his opening match 1–7 to Iran's Alireza Heidari, but wrestled his way to overwhelm Turkey's Ahmet Doğu with a vigorous 4–3 verdict. Placing second in the prelim pool and tenth overall, Scherrer's performance was not enough to advance him to the quarterfinals. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Scherrer qualified for his second Swiss squad, as a 32-year-old, in the men's heavyweight class (96 kg) by placing fifth and receiving a berth from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Bratislava, Slovakia. Unlike his previous Olympics, Scherrer suffered through a disastrous game plan, as he lost two straight matches each to Ukraine's Vadim Tasoyev (1–6), and Russia's Khadzhimurat Gatsalov (0–3), leaving him on the bottom pool and placing sixteenth overall.

It describes the relation between the tumor cells and the immune system. It is made up of three phases: elimination, equilibrium, and escape.  Definition  Immunoediting is characterized by changes in the immunogenicity of tumors due to the anti-tumor response of the immune system, resulting in the emergence of immune-resistant variants. = Phase 1: Elimination = During the elimination phase, immune effector cells such as natural killer cells, with the help of dendritic and CD4+ T-cells, are able to recognize and eliminate tumor cells (left). As a result of heterogeneity, however, tumor cells which are less immunogenic are able to escape immunosurveillance (right). The elimination phase, also known as immunosurveillance, includes innate and adaptive immune responses to tumour cells. For the innate immune response, several effector cells such as natural killer cells and T cells are activated by the inflammatory cytokines, which are released by the growing tumour cells, macrophages and stromal cells surrounding the tumour cells. The recruited tumour-infiltrating NK cells and macrophages produce interleukin 12 and interferon gamma, which kill tumour cells by cytotoxic mechanisms such as perforin, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligands (TRAILs), and reactive oxygen species. Most of the tumor cells are destroyed in this phase, but some of them survive and are able to reach equilibrium with the immune system. The elimination phase consists of the following four phases: The first phase involves the initiation of an antitumor immune response. Cells of the innate immune system recognize the presence of a growing tumor which has undergone stromal remodeling, causing local tissue damage. This is followed by the induction of inflammatory signals which is essential for recruiting cells of the innate immune system (e.g. natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells) to the tumor site. During this phase, the infiltrating lymphocytes such as the natural killer cells and natural killer T cells are stimulated to produce IFN- gamma. In the second phase, newly synthesized IFN-gamma induces tumor death (to a limited amount) as well as promoting the production of chemokines CXCL10, CXCL9 and CXCL11. These chemokines play an important role in promoting tumor death by blocking the formation of new blood vessels. Tumor cell debris produced as a result of tumor death is then ingested by dendritic cells, followed by the migration of these dendritic cells to the draining lymph nodes. The recruitment of more immune cells also occurs and is mediated by the chemokines produced during the inflammatory process. In the third phase, natural killer cells and macrophages transactivate one another via the reciprocal production of IFN-gamma and IL-12. This again promotes more tumor killing by these cells via apoptosis and the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. In the draining lymph nodes, tumor-specific dendritic cells trigger the differentiation of Th1 cells which in turn facilitates the development of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells also known as killer T-cells. In the final phase, tumor-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells home to the tumor site and the cytotoxic T lymphocytes then destroy the antigen-bearing tumor cells which remain at the site. = Phase 2: Equilibrium = The next step in cancer immunoediting is the equilibrium phase, during which tumor cells that have escaped the elimination phase and have a non-immunogenic phenotype are selected for growth. Lymphocytes and IFN-gamma exert a selection pressure on tumor cells which are genetically unstable and rapidly mutating. Tumor cell variants which have acquired resistance to elimination then enter the escape phase. It is the longest of the three processes in cancer immunoediting and may occur over a period of many years. During this period of Darwinian selection, new tumor cell variants emerge with various mutations that further increase overall resistance to immune attack. = Phase 3: Escape = In the escape phase, tumor cells continue to grow and expand in an uncontrolled manner and may eventually lead to malignancies. In the study of cancer immunoediting, knockout mice have been used for experimentation since human testing is not possible. Tumor infiltration by lymphocytes is seen as a reflection of a tumor-related immune response. There is increasing evidence that biological vesicles (e.g., exosomes) secreted by tumour cells help to foster an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. During the escape phase, tumor cell variants selected in the equilibrium phase have breached the host organism's immune defenses, with various genetic and epigenetic changes conferring further resistance to immune detection. There are several mechanisms that lead to escape of cancer cells to immune system, for example downregulation or loss of expression of classical MHC class I (HLA-A, HLA-B- HLA-C) which is essential for effective T cell-mediated immune response (appears in up to 90% of tumours), development of cancer microenvironment which has suppressive effect on immune system and works as an protective barrier to cancer cells. Cells contained in tumor microenvironment are able to produce cytokines which can cause apoptosis of activated T lymphocyte. Another mechanism of tumor cells to avoid immune system is upregulation of non- classical MHC I (HLA-E, HLA-F, HLA-G) which prevents NK-mediated immune reaction by interaction with NK cells. The tumor begins to develop and grow after escaping the immune system. = Immunoediting in HIV = Recent studies suggest that cells harboring the HIV reservoir may also be undergoing a process of immunoediting, thereby contributing to the increased resistance of these cells to be eliminated by host immune factors.

This election was the first time that one party had won a majority in both chambers of Congress since the 1874 elections. In the Presidential election, Democratic President Grover Cleveland was defeated by Republican former Senator Benjamin Harrison of Indiana. At the 1888 Republican National Convention, Harrison was nominated on the eighth ballot, defeating Ohio Senator John Sherman, former Governor Russell A. Alger of Michigan, and several other candidates. As in 1876, the Republican candidate won the presidency despite the Democratic candidate's greater share of the popular vote, albeit, also as in 1876, with widespread allegations of voter suppression and fraud aimed at Republican black voters in the South. This situation would not be repeated until the 1960 election. Despite the popular vote margin, Harrison won a comfortable majority of the electoral college, and took most of the states outside the South. Despite the close presidential race, Republicans picked up several seats in both houses of Congress. Republicans won major gains in the House, re-taking the majority for the first time since the 1882 elections. In the Senate, the Republicans won major gains, growing their majority in the chamber.

Republicans won control of the Presidency and maintained control of both houses of Congress. The election marked the end of the Third Party System and the start of the Fourth Party System, as Republicans would generally dominate politics until the 1930 elections. Political scientists such as V.O. Key, Jr. argue that this election was a realigning election, while James Reichley argues against this idea on the basis that the Republican victory in this election merely continued the party's post-Civil War dominance. The election took place in the aftermath of the Panic of 1893, and featured a fierce debate between advocates of bimetallism (\\"free silver\\") and supporters of the gold standard. In the Presidential election, Republican former Governor William McKinley of Ohio defeated Democratic former Representative William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska. McKinley took the Republican nomination on the first ballot, while Bryan took the Democratic nomination on the fifth ballot (at age 36, he became youngest presidential nominee of a major party), defeating former Missouri Representative Richard P. Bland and several other candidates. Bryan's Cross of Gold speech, in which he advocated for \\"free silver,\\" helped deliver him the Democratic nomination, and also attracted the support of the Populist Party and the Silver Republican Party. Though Bryan carried most of the South and the West, McKinley won a comfortable margin in both the electoral college and the popular vote by carrying the Northeast and the Great Lakes region. Democrats won major gains in the House, but Republicans continued to command a large majority in the chamber. The Populists also won several seats, holding more seats in the House than any third party since the Civil War. In the Senate, the Republicans maintained their plurality, keeping control of the same number of seats. The Democrats lost several seats, while the Silver Republicans established themselves for the first time with five seats. Republican William P. Frye won election as President pro tempore.

It is a prominent landmark on the coast of Encounter Bay which is currently used as a recreational reserve and which is notable as a platform to view the adjoining coast and surrounding countryside. Description Rosetta Head is located in the suburb of Encounter Bay about south-west by south of the centre of Victor Harbor and about south of Adelaide. When viewed from a platform such as a ship, it appears as being \\"a grassy mound, high, cliffy on its E[ast] side, and covered with granite boulders; it is steep-to on its E[ast] and S[outh] sides.\\" Its southern tip is considered by Australian authorities as being the western extent of Encounter Bay. On its northern side, there is a small wharf which is connected to the adjoining urban area by a road and which adjoins a body of water is known as Rosetta Harbor. On its southern side, there is a small cove called Petrel Cove. Formation, geology & oceanography Rosetta Head as a headland was formed when the sea reached its present level 7,500 years ago after sea levels started to rise at the start of the Holocene. As a landform, it is a large domed inselberg which is considered to be \\"the most prominent feature along Encounter Bay coastline\\" and whose form is due to its origins via the geological processes of metamorphism and intrusion followed by two phases of erosion; firstly via the action of a northward-moving glacier during the Permian which created the distinctive dome shape and then by wave action from the south due to the sea level rise during the Holocene. When viewed from the adjoining coastline, it is considered to be a typical example of a glacial terrain known as a roche moutonnee. Geologically, Rosetta Head is the result of the intrusion of molten granite (known as Encounter Bay Granite) into a grey metamorphic rock (known as the Kanmantoo group) which was subsequently elevated as part of a mountain building event known as the Delamerian Orogeny between 475 and 500 million years ago. The water adjoining the base of Rosetta Head drops to a maximum depth of within a distance of of its shore. Naming Rosetta Head was given its modern name in 1839 after Rosetta French, the wife of George Fife Angas reportedly by George Gawler, the second Governor of South Australia. The use of the name \\"The Bluff\\" which is the most commonly used name for the headland is attributed to whalers operating in the locality prior to the adoption of the name Rosetta Head. The Ramindjeri, the Australian Aboriginal people who traditionally live in the locality, use the name Kongkengguwar. History =Aboriginal use= =European discovery and use= Rosetta Head was the site of a whaling station and its peak was used as a look-out point to locate whales. The station was established in 1837 and operated until the early 1860s. The wharf, an adjacent sea wall and the connecting road were completed in 1856 by the SA Government to assist whaling industry activity. The wharf was known as the \\"Lilliputian Jetty\\" due to its relatively small size, i.e. wide by deep. A mine was established on Rosetta Head in 1863 to search for copper and other minerals until the abandonment of the venture in 1866. A tablet set into a granite boulder located near Rosetta Head's summit was unveiled on 8 April 1902 by the Governor of South Australia, The Right Honourable Hallam, Baron Tennyson, KCMG to commemorate the centenary of the meeting of the European explorers, Matthew Flinders and Nicolas Baudin, in nearby waters. =Heritage listings= Rosetta Head was listed on the now- defunct Register of the National Estate on 21 October 1980. It was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register on 1 September 1983. Current land use Rosetta Head is used as a public recreation reserve which is managed by the City of Victor Harbor. A walking trail ascends to the summit where views of the adjoining coastline including the Victor Harbor urban area and the nearby islands are available as well as the opportunity to observe southern right whales in the nearby waters between the months of May and November. As of 2007, a proposal existed to connect the Rosetta Head walking trail to the Heysen Trail to its west via a trail following the coastline. A sandy beach on the north side of Rosetta Head is notable as a site for swimming while the wharf is used for recreational fishing. A sandy beach on the south side of the head at Petrel Cove is known for its surfing and surf fishing but is considered to be a hazardous location for swimming. The sea around Rosetta Head is a popular site for recreational diving and is notable as a place to see Leafy sea dragons.

These models are based on the 4 different marketing segments. However, nowadays two additional types have been added to this classification.  Business to business (B2B)  B2B e-commerce refers to all electronic transactions of goods and sales that are conducted between two companies. Sometimes the buyer is the end user, but often the buyer resells to the consumer. This type of e-commerce typically explains the relationship between the producers of a product or and the wholesalers. In addition this can be the relationship between the producers or the wholesalers and the retailers. However the same relationship can occur between the service providers and the business organizations. B2B typically requires more startup cash and it generally means a longer sales cycle, but higher order value and more recurring purchases. In 2015, Google found that close to half of B2B buyers are millennials — nearly double the amount from 2012. As younger generations enter the age of making business decisions, B2B selling in the online space is becoming more important. Examples of this model are ExxonMobil Corporation and the Chevron Corporation, Boeing, and Archer Daniel Midlands. These businesses have custom, enterprise ecommerce platforms that work directly with other businesses in a closed environment. Advantages: * Convenience: While companies can sell through physical storefronts or take transactions by phone, B2B commerce often takes place online, wherecompanies advertise their products and services, allow fordemonstrations and make it easy to place bulk orders. Sellers also benefit from efficient order processing thanks to this digital transaction model; * Higher profits: B2B companies often sell their items in wholesale quantities so that buyers can get a good deal and need to restock less often. Larger order numbers lead to higher potential sales and more cash coming in for B2B sellers. At the same time, the ease of advertising to other businesses through B2B websites can help cut marketing costs and boost conversion rates; * Huge market potential: From business software and consulting services to bulk materials and specialized machinery, B2B sellers can target a large market of companies across industries. At the same time, they have the flexibility of specializing in an area like technology to become a leader in the field; * Improved security: Since contracts are a common part of B2B commerce, there's some security for both buyers and sellers in that there's less concern that one will pay and the other will deliver goods as promised. Since sales usually get tracked digitally, it's also more secure in that B2B sellers can track and monitor their financial results. Disadvantages: * More complex setup process: Getting started as a B2B retailer takes work to figure out how to get customers who stay dedicated and make large-enough orders. This often requires thorough research to advertise to potential businesses, set up a custom ordering system and adapt quickly when sales are underwhelming; * Limits to sales: While B2B companies can sell a lot, they do miss out on potential sales to individual customers. The smaller pool of business buyers and the need to negotiate contracts can put some limits on profits, especially when the company loses key buyers to other competitors; * Need for B2B sellers to stand out: At the same time, the B2B market has many companies competing and selling similar products and services. Sellers often need to cut prices and find special ways to grab companies' attention to succeed in the market; * Special ordering experience needed: B2B companies selling online need to put much effort into designing a website and ordering system that buyers find easy to use. This means presenting product and service information clearly, offering online demos or consultations and using order forms with appropriate options for quantities and any special customization needed.  Business to consumer (B2C)  B2C it is the most common model. It deals with electronic business relationships between businesses, both producers and service providers with end consumers. Many people enjoy this avenue of e-commerce because it allows them to shop around for the best prices, read customer reviews and often find different products that they wouldn’t otherwise be exposed to in the retail world. This e-commerce category also enables businesses to develop a more personalized relationship with their customers. Anything you buy online as a consumer — think wardrobe, household supplies, entertainment — is done as part of a B2C transaction. The decision-making process for a B2C purchase is a much shorter than a business-to-business (B2B) purchase, especially for items that have a lower value and because of this it had shorter sales cycle. Thus B2C businesses typically spend less marketing dollars to make a sale, but also have a lower average order value and less recurring orders than their B2B counterparts.B2C innovators have leveraged technology like mobile apps, native advertising and remarketing to market directly to their customers and make their lives easier in the process.Examples of B2C businesses are everywhere. Exclusively online retailers include Newegg.com, Overstock.com, Wish, and ModCloth, but other major B2C model brick-and-mortar businesses like Staples, Wal-Mart, Target, REI, and Gap. Advantages: * Unlimited market place:It exhibits unlimited marketplace by enabling the customers to explore and shop as per their convenience. It should be in our best interest that we can check on the desired services from home, offices and anywhere else without the stress of following a restricted timeframe. We can purchase the products at a global level from every corner of the world. It means that the internet has broken the international barriers and has given us the opportunity to stash various items and equipment without the need of being at the shops in person; * Lower cost of doing business:The B2C has reduced a number of business components including, employees, purchasing cost, mailing confirmations, phone calls, data entry and the requirement for opening up stores with physical existence. It has influenced and declined the transaction costs for the customers; * Business administration made easier:It has made it easier to record store inventory, shipment, logs and overall business transactions compared with the traditional ways of business administration.These aspects of business are now being calculated automatically with utmost accuracy for the online entrepreneurs. Moreover, it provides real-time update feature through which we can explore all the latest happenings in our business; * More efficient business relationships:Building new and improved associations with the dealers and suppliers; * Work flow automation:This process gives us an edge over shipping products in a timely manner. Furthermore, it automatically adjusts the stock levels and figures out location availability with a ballistic speed. Highly reliable security system with step by step verification, account entry and admiration mode to look after the business transactions.The third party direct sales are backed up with familiar banking and accounting features that enable us to reach out to our vendors and perform internal business transactions accordingly. Disadvantages: * Infrastructure: Even though, it provides a massive customer reach and breaks the international barriers by calling people out on the same platform, but the fact remains unchanged. According to a research, a total number of 26 million people in the world are deprived of using a stable internet connection. It should be in our best interest that some portion of the world is still unable to witness our value added services and this issue will take some time to resolve; * Competition: Indeed, the competition is severe since there are millions of online brands and services that can put our business at a stake in terms of customer base. There are certain companies that have managed to maintain a great market share giving them a chance to survive in the long run. We must understand the importance of introducing new and improved products in the world of internet to acquire the best response from the customers; * Limited Product Exposure: It is worth mentioning that in spite of rewarding the customers with ease of access and a unique level of flexibility for choosing products, the e-commerce has restricted the product exposure for the buyers over the internet. Most websites wouldn’t allow customers to go beyond the glamorous product images and their descriptions at the time of purchasing the product. It gives us an ideal that e-commerce is supporting ‘limited product exposure’, which is why some products disappoint the customers at the time of shipment and are sent back to the companies immediately.  Consumer to business (C2B)  C2B e-commerce is when a consumer makes their services or products available for companies to purchase. The C2B e-commerce model’s competitive edge is in pricing for goods and services. This approach includes reverse auctions, in which customers name the price for a product or service they wish to buy. Another form of C2B occurs when a consumer provides a business with a fee- based opportunity to market the business's products on the consumer's blog. For example, food companies may ask food bloggers to include a new product in a recipe, and review it for readers of their blogs. YouTube reviews may be incentivized by free products or direct payment. This could also include paid advertisement space on the consumer website. Google Adwords/Adsense has enabled this kind of relationship by simplifying the process in which bloggers can be paid for ads. Services such as Amazon Affiliates allow website owners to earn money by linking to a product for sale on Amazon. The C2B model has flourished in the Internet age because of ready access to consumers who are \\"plugged in\\" to brands. Where the business relationship was once strictly one- directional, with companies pushing services and goods to consumers, the new bi-directional network has allowed consumers to become their own businesses. Decreases in the cost of technologies such as video cameras, high-quality printers, and Web development services give consumers access to tools for promotion and communication that were once limited to large companies. As a result, both consumers and businesses can benefit from the C2B model. An example of this would be a graphic designer customizing a company logo or a photographer taking photos for an e-commerce website. Advantages and disadvantages of C2B on an example: The C2B website offers a Lending Tree advertisement at the top of the page, www.thefreemortgagecalculator.com. The advantage of this website is that the owner doesn't have to sell mortgages, meet with customers, or pay for everyday business operation expenses in order to make money. If the Lending Tree advertisement is used by a visitor, the website owner gets paid a commission from Lending Tree for the lead. The disadvantages of C2B transactions are that one must be well versed in web design to create such a website and the amount of money earned is far less than what could be earned by selling the mortgage directly to the consumer instead.  Consumer to consumer (C2C)  C2C represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction and they typically make their money by charging transaction or listing fees. These businesses benefit from self-propelled growth by motivated buyers and sellers, but face a key challenge in quality control and technology maintenance.Another customers’ benefit is the competition for products and often finds items that are difficult to locate elsewhere. Also, margins can be higher than traditional pricing methods for sellers because there are minimal costs due to the absence of retailers or wholesalers. Opening a C2C site takes careful planning. Examples of C2C are companies like Craigslist and eBay which pioneered this model in the early days of the internet. Generally, the transactions of this model are provided by online platforms (such as PayPal), but often are conducted through the use of social media networks (Facebook marketplace) and websites (Craigslist). Advantages: * Availability: It is always available so that consumers can have access to whenever they feel like shopping; * There is regular updating of the website; * Higher profitability: Consumers selling products to other consumers benefit from the higher profitability that result from selling directly to one another; * Low transaction cost: Sellers can post their goods over the internet at a cheaper rate far better than higher price of renting a space in a store; * Direct relationship: Customer can directly contact sellers and do without an intermediary. Disadvantages: * Payment made has no guarantee; * Security issues: There could be theft as scammers might try to create their website with names of some famous C2C websites such as eBay to attract customers; * Lack of controlling quality of the products.  Business to administration (B2A)  B2A, also known as B2G, refers to all transactions between companies and public administration or government agency. Government agencies (administration) use central websites to trade and exchange information with various business organizations. This is an area that involves many services, particularly in areas such as social security, employment, and legal documents. Hurdles to B2G: Businesses that are used to interacting with other businesses or directly with consumers often encounter unexpected hurdles when working with government agencies. Governments tend to take more time than private companies to approve and begin work on a given project. Layers of regulation can drag on the overall efficiency of the contracting process. While businesses may find that government contracts involve additional paperwork, time, and vetting, there are advantages to providing goods and services to the public sector. Government contracts are often large and more stable than analogous private-sector work. A company with a history of successful government contracting usually finds it easier to get the next contract. An excellent example of a B2A model is Accela; it’s a software company that provides government software solutions and public access to government services for permitting, planning, licensing, public health, and so on.  Consumer to administration (C2A)  C2A (consumer to administration) e-commerce encompasses all electronic transactions between individuals and public administration. The C2A e-commerce model helps the consumers to post their queries and request information regarding public sectors directly from their local governments/authorities. It provides an easy way to establish communication between the consumers and the government. Examples of this include taxes (filing tax returns), health (scheduling an appointment using an online service), and paying the tuition to universities.

Democrats retained the House and won control of the Presidency and the Senate. Following the election, Democrats controlled the Presidency and a majority in both chambers of Congress for the first time since the 1858 elections. In the Presidential election, Republican President Benjamin Harrison was defeated by former Democratic President Grover Cleveland. Cleveland won the popular vote by a margin of three percent, but won by a large margin in the electoral college. Populist James B. Weaver also carried five Western states and won a little over eight percent of the vote. At the 1892 Republican National Convention, Harrison fended off a challenge from supporters of former Secretary of State James G. Blaine and Governor William McKinley of Ohio. At the 1892 Democratic National Convention, Cleveland defeated Senator David B. Hill from New York and Governor Horace Boies of Iowa on the first ballot. Harrison had previously defeated Cleveland in 1888, and Cleveland's win made him the first President to serve non-consecutive terms. Cleveland's win in the popular vote also made him the second person, after Andrew Jackson, to win the popular vote in three presidential elections. Reapportionment following the 1890 census added twenty four seats to the House. Republicans picked up several seats in the House, but Democrats continued to command a large majority in the chamber. In the Senate, Democrats made moderate gains to win a majority (including the Democratic Vice President) in the chamber for the first time since the 1880 elections.

The team competed in Ligue 1, the Coupe de France, the Coupe de la Ligue, the Trophée des Champions and the UEFA Champions League. Summary Just weeks after winning a first trophy of the season in Beijing, with the 2014 Trophée des Champions and the 2–0 win over Guingamp, PSG were struggling to impose themselves on Ligue 1. With three wins and five draws, the club was sitting five points adrift of Marseille after eight matches (19 points for Marseille and 14 for PSG). After something of a World Cup hangover for the club's international stars, Les Rouge-et-Bleu really hit their stride in October, and especially November. Lens (1-3), Bordeaux (3–0), Lorient (1–2), Marseille (2–0), Metz (2–3) and Nice (1–0) were all defeated by Laurent Blanc's men. PSG moved second on the ladder, just one point behind Marseille and six ahead of Lyon. PSG were on their way, but December saw a first loss of the campaign to Guingamp (1–0) as the capital club finished the first half of the season in third place, three points adrift of Marseille. The start of January saw PSG make a successful start to the Coupe de France, eliminating Montpellier 3–0. After a surprise 4–2 loss to Bastia in the league, PSG recorded a series of positive results which saw them fighting on all four fronts. In the UEFA Champions League, Thiago Silva and company wrote one of the most spectacular pages in the club's history: after a 1–1 home draw with Chelsea in the first leg of the round of 16, Les Parisiens produced an heroic qualification at Stamford Bridge, going through on the away goals rule. A prestigious victory over Marseille (3–2) and a win in the 2015 Coupe de la Ligue Final against Bastia (4–0) followed before PSG were eliminated from the Champions League by future finalists Barcelona. PSG bounced back by booking their place in the final of the Coupe de France with a resounding semi-final win against Saint-Étienne (4–0) and kept hopes alive of an unprecedented quadruple. Fighting tooth and nail with Lyon in the championship, PSG set a cracking pace with a series of big wins (6–1 against Lille, 3–1 against Metz, 2–0 against Nantes and 6–0 against Guingamp). PSG were in unstoppable form and the pressure told as Lyon cracked against Caen, going down 3–0 in matchweek 36. In the end, it was at the Stade de la Mosson that PSG officially secured a fifth French championship in their history and the third in a row. The capital club then left their mark on French football by defeating Auxerre 1–0 with a goal from Edinson Cavani in the 2015 Coupe de France Final at the Stade de France to claim an unprecedented domestic quadruple.
