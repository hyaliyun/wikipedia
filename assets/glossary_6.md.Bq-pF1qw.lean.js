Talbot.Preuss, Arthur A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies St. Louis: B. Herder Book Co. 1924; republished Detroit: Gale Reference Company 1966; p.356 According to its literature, the purposes of the society is \\"to assist each other in business, to help each other in obtaining employment, to assist the widows and orphans of our brothers, to give aid to our brother in any way that they may need, and assemble for mutual pleasure and entertainment.\\"Preuss p.357, quoting the Constitution and Bylaws of Nest #1482 in Maryville, Missouri Its \\"catechism\\" said \\"Owls do good, speak kindly, shake hands warmly, and respect and honor their women\\".Whalen p.129  History  The order originated among a group of men who engaged in different businesses and periodically met for mutual assistance. This group included John W. Talbot, Joseph E. Talbot, George D. Beroth, J. Lott Losey, John J.Johnson, John D. Burke, William Weaver and Frank Dunbar. They got around to discussing the teachings and methods of different fraternal orders and decided to create a new one, named after the owl. After several months of planning by \\"the best constitutional lawyers in the Middle West\\", the constitution was adopted and the order was founded at the law offices of Talbot and Talbot on Nov. 20, 1904 in South Bend, Indiana.Christian Cynosure Vol. XLVIII #8 Dec. 1915 p.237, quoting an undated issue of the Orders \\"official publication\\" Vol. II #15  Organization  The local units of the Order are called \\"Nests\\" and include officers such an \\"Invocator\\" who served as chaplain.Whalen, William J. Handbook of Secret Organization Milwaukee: The Bruce Publishing Co. 1966; Second printing 1967 p.129 The central organization was evidently the \\"Home Nest\\" in the early twentieth century,Preuss p.358 but it was reportedly called the \\"Supreme Nest\\" in 1979. The head of the organization was the Supreme President.Alvin J. Schmidt Fraternal Orders (Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press), 1980, p. 251 The headquarters are called the \\"Supreme Offices\\"Preuss p.356 quotes a circular issued \\"some years ago\\" by the Supreme Offices located in South Bend, Indiana as late as the 1920s, but had moved to Hartford, Connecticut by the 1930s.http://www.ebay.com/itm/Order-of-Owls-Illustrated- Advertising-Pennsylvania-flag-cancel-1930-/112049685363  Membership  Membership was open to men regardless of their religion.Preuss p.357 At least as late as 1979, though, membership was limited to white males.Schmidt p.250 In 1911 the Order claimed over 300,000 members in the US, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Australia, South Africa and elsewhere.Fortnightly Review Vol. XVIII #22 1911 p.657 In 1924 the Order had 643,748 members in 2,148 lodges.Preuss p.356 It had approximately 100,000 members and 1,500 Nests in 1951,Order Of Owls v. Owls Club Of Mckees Rocks District Court Of United States, Western District Of Pennsylvania; July 27, 1951 In 1957 the Order claimed a membership of 202,000.Whalen p.130 In 1970 it had 40,000 members and 5,000 in 1989.Alan Axelrod International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders New York; Facts on File, inc 1997 p.192  Ritual  The Order of Owls worked four degreesPreuss p.356, quoting an early 1920s circular and had a secret ritual, signs, grips and passwords. The initiate was required to recite a lengthy obligation, before he could join the order.Preuss p.358, reproduces the complete obligation verbatim from p.17 of the ritual An Owls circular in the early 1920s stated that \\"We have a beautiful ritual, but no religious observances. Nothing in the ritual is offensive to any man's religion or irreligion.\\" In 1912, it was reportedFrank L. Nelson. \\"The Secret Society 'Zoo'.\\" Hampton's Magazine 28.3, April 1912. (Google Books) that the Owls' motto, penned by Frank Dunbar at the initial 1904 meeting, was: The same article goes on to state:  Religious controversies  The ritual of the Order of the Owls stated, \\"We advocate no creed. We know there are so many gods, so many creeds, so many paths that wind and wind. We believe that the art of kindness is all this old world needs.\\" Quoted in Preuss p.358. Preuss notes that the quote is from p.9 of the ritual They elsewhere stated that their Order was \\"a secret society of good fellows, who believe in love, laughter and the Kingdom of Heaven ON EARTH.Preuss p.356 quoting a circular issued \\"several years ago\\" emphasis in original It does not believe in postponing ones enjoyments until after death\\"Whalen, pp.128-9. Whalen is evidently quoting the same source, but he includes the latter sentence. Other Owls literature stated claimed they were \\"the only great secret fraternity which does not claim in any manner to be a religious body.\\" After being attacked by the Catholic weekly Newark Monitor in 1907, Supreme President Talbot replied that the order was founded by \\"sober men of Catholic education\\" and reported that 4 of its supreme officers were Catholics, 2 others were married to Catholics in the church and four out of seven of the trustees were Catholics. Furthermore, he claimed that the Owls was the only secret order in which there was nothing objectionable to Catholics other than the Ancient Order of Hibernians which Talbot claimed he had joined twenty years prior. Later, when a Catholic pastor had warned his congregation against the Owls, Talbot wrote him back on Dec. 13, 1910 saying that it had come to his attention that he had a copy of the ritual and was making parts of it known; Talbot protested that the ritual was property of the Home Nest, which was the supreme organization of the order, and \\"amply protected in a legal manner\\" and threatened legal action, but nothing came of the matter.Preuss pp.358-9 p. 358-9 The Order of Owls refused to respond from inquires from the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod's Commission on Fraternal Orders in 1947, 1957, 1960, or 1961.Whalen p.128. They also refused to respond to Whalen  Afro-American Order of Owls  A group called the \\"Afro-American Order of Owls\\" was founded in Maryland in 1911. They were sued by the Order of the Owls over the use of the name. In 1914 the Maryland Court of Appeals issued a split decision allowing the Afro-American Order of Owls to continue using the name, but not the initials \\"A.A.O.O.O.\\" symbol, as it was too close to the white organizations \\"O.O.O.\\" symbol.Theda Skocpol; Ariane Liazos; Marshall Ganz What a mighty power we can be: African American fraternal groups and the struggle for racial equality Princeton : Princeton University Press, 2006 p.45 The legal case's title and number is The Afro-American Order of Owls, Nest Number One a Body Corporate vs. John W.

The Order has no legal standing anywhere in the U.S. and is careless in admitting new members.\\" This had all come out in an investigation by the Grand Rapids Nest and several other dissatisfied Nests. According to the Grand Rapids Herald the Owls had suffered no less than 40 secessions, the revolters taking various names.Fortnightly Review Vol. XIX #17 Sept. 1, 1912 p.482 On May 27, 1921, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that 200 members had left the Order of the Owls to form the Supreme Order of the White Rabbits.

He was a former state judicial policeman who protected the ex-leader of the Gulf cartel, Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n. Upon his arrest, Flores Borrego became the right-hand man of Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez, the former leader of the criminal organization. Although born in Matamoros, Flores Borrego was closely linked to the city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, where he served as the Gulf cartel's regional leader on and off for many years after serving as a policeman during the governorship of Tom√°s Yarrington (1998‚Äì2004) ‚Äì the peak era of the Gulf cartel. The Mexican authorities believe that Flores Borrego is responsible for the split of the Gulf cartel and Los Zetas, a cartel originally formed by deserters of the Mexican Army Special Forces hired in the late 1990s as the private army of the Gulf cartel. While operating in Reynosa in early 2010, Flores Borrego ordered the abduction and execution of a leader of Los Zetas. After the slaying, Los Zetas demanded Flores Borrego's death and threatened to go to war if the Gulf cartel did not hand over the assassin. Nonetheless, Flores Borrego ignored their demands and consequently broke the organization's alliance. On 2 September 2011, Flores Borrego was found dead along with a local police officer on the outskirts of the border city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas. The Mexican authorities indicated that he had been killed by members within his own criminal group over disagreements and territorial disputes. Gulf-Zeta cartels split In the late 1990s, Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the former leader of the Gulf Cartel, began recruiting members of the Mexican Army to protect his territory, personnel, and drug trafficking operations. These original deserters, who were known as Los Zetas, came from the Special Forces squadron of the army, arguably the best trained branch of the Mexican military. Upon the arrest and extradition of C√°rdenas Guill√©n in 2003 and 2007 respectively, Los Zetas strengthen its role in the Gulf cartel, but managed to retain its alliance. Nonetheless, that alliance lasted until early 2010, when disagreements reached a turning point. On 18 January 2010, several members of the Gulf cartel kidnapped V√≠ctor Pe√±a Mendoza, a leader of Los Zetas nicknamed Concord 3 and a close associate and friend of Miguel Trevi√±o Morales, alias Z-40. When he was held captive, Pe√±a Mendoza was asked to switch alliances and join the Gulf cartel, but he refused, earning a beating and an execution, presumably carried out by Flores Borrego. Trevi√±o Morales heard about the incident and issued an ultimatum to Flores Borrego and Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez: Both of the Gulf cartel leaders ignored the command, and Trevi√±o Morales did not wait to avenge the death of his friend. On 30 January 2010, Trevi√±o Morales kidnapped and slaughtered 16 Gulf cartel members in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, marking the start of the cartel war between the Gulf cartel and Los Zetas in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Veracruz that has left thousands of people killed. Los Zetas used violent and intimidation tactics to expand and gained a notorious reputation as Mexico's most violent drug trafficking organization. Over time, it managed to take control of most of the territories owned by the Gulf cartel when they had once essentially operated as a single organization. Kingpin Act sanction On 24 March 2010, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Flores Borrego under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with fifty-three other international criminals and ten foreign entities. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. Assassination On 2 September 2011, the Mexican authorities discovered the bullet-ridden corpse of Flores Borrego inside a Ford Lobo truck on a highway that connects Reynosa, Tamaulipas with the industrial city of Monterrey. His body was found along with the corpse of a policeman named Eloy Lerma Garc√≠a from Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz, Tamaulipas. Before being executed, the two men were stripped to their underwear, severely beaten, tortured and then shot dead execution-style; their corpses were then left on the bed of the Ford Lobo along with a written message directed to the Gulf Cartel faction Flores Borrego commanded ‚Äì a group known as Los Metros. Although the information was never confirmed, the Mexican Army alleges that Flores Borrego was killed by \\"members of his own cartel,\\" presumably on orders from the Gulf Cartel leaders Juan Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez (El R-1) and Rafael C√°rdenas Vela (El Junior). After his death, several factions within the Gulf Cartel went to war with each other, resulting in the deaths and arrests of several high-ranking drug traffickers. An anonymous informant outside of law enforcement but with direct knowledge of the Gulf Cartel criminal workings suggests that El Metro 3 was killed because Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez was appointed as the crime boss of \\"La Frontera Chica,\\" a narrow stretch in the northern part of Tamaulipas, while Flores Borrego kept Reynosa, suggesting that he was above Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez in the cartel's structure. Other unconfirmed reports suggest that C√°rdenas Vela teamed up with Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez to kill Flores Borrego because the former believed that the Gulf Cartel betrayed his uncle Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n (Tony Tormenta) by leading the Mexican military to his whereabouts, and eventually killing him after a gun fight on November 2010 in Matamoros. Mario Ram√≠rez Trevi√±o, who had been working as the regional boss of Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, was appointed within few hours of Flores Borrego's death as the new crime boss of Reynosa, and was given \\"explicit orders to make the [drug market] profitable again.\\" =Rooster statue= On January 2012 at the entrance of a neighborhood in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, where Flores Borrego was rumored to have lived and on one of Reynosa's busiest avenues, a bronze rooster statue was erected in tribute of him. It is not clear who placed the statue but it was adorned with a wreath of flowers bearing the name of \\"Samuel Flores Borrego.\\" Nicknamed El Gallo de Vista Hermosa (\\"The Rooster of Vista Hermosa\\"), the statue mysteriously appeared overnight, and has worried, puzzled, and attracted curious residents of Reynosa. The rooster statue became a Twitter sensation, where Reynosa residents uploaded their own pictures of the monument and created a hashtag to specifically talk about it. During the first week, the residents showed fear of the statue, but that feeling quickly dissolved; one Twitter user said on his page that people were posing for pictures in front of the statue. In addition, a Twitter user noticed that the statue used its own light source at night, and wondered how it got connected and who was paying for the electric bill. A month later, however, the rooster was moved to the Reynosa Palenque, a rodeo arena and live-music venue a few blocks from its original location. Reportedly, the rooster statue once stood outside a restaurant located along a highway that connects Reynosa with Nuevo Laredo. The man who supposedly owned the restaurant was the slain boss of the Gulf cartel, Samuel Flores Borrego, El Metro 3. The statue's location was found on the same highway where the banda singer Valent√≠n Elizalde (nicknamed the \\"Golden Rooster\\") was gunned down on November 2006. According to The Monitor, it is rumored that Elizalde had close ties with the Sinaloa Cartel and that he was gunned down by Los Zetas, who were still under an alliance with the Gulf cartel ‚Äì which was a bitter enemy of the Sinaloa cartel. The night he was killed, Elizalde had sung at a concert in Reynosa, but \\"had been warned not to sing that song in Reynosa...\\" because some speculated that the song mocked the Gulf cartel and Los Zetas and would lead to his assassination. Despite the threats, Elizalde did sing it and was killed; his slaying served as a symbolic blow of the Gulf cartel against the Sinaloa organization. But over the years, the alliances have broken and that sentiment has changed. The Gulf cartel and Los Zetas broke relations in early 2010, and the Sinaloa's battle against Los Zetas has \\"turned old enemies into friends.\\" The rooster statue now serves as a symbolic reminder that the Sinaloa cartel is present in the area, with the flowers as a display that they have respect for the Gulf cartel. =Narco-Rap legacy= There are several Narco-Rap music videos on YouTube dedicated to Flores Borrego from a Reynosa hip-hop group composed of two rappers, Cano and Blunt. The song is called and praises the drug lord for his \\"ferocity and loyalty.\\" The video consists of a handful of images of Cano and Blunt in gangster poses and in mafia outfits. The narco hip hop video also has photos of bullet-ridden SUV's, police checkpoints, and military convoys. =Shirt references= During a routine patrol in Reynosa on 10 February 2012, Mexico's Federal Police spotted six abandoned SUV's parked in the city's major avenue. Inside the vehicles ‚Äì which turned out to be stolen ‚Äì the police officers found several ammunition magazines and rounds. The most noteworthy finding in the seizure were several T-shirts, caps, and patches with the insignias bearing \\"CDG,\\" the Spanish acronym for the Gulf Cartel. Some of the shirts found inside the vehicles, however, had references to Flores Borrego, who had been slain in September 2011. =Birthday banners= Early in the morning on 6 August 2012, several banners celebrating Flores Borrego's birthday were put up on bridges in several cities across Mexico by alleged members of the Gulf Cartel. In the border city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, where Flores Borrego was killed in September 2011, a banner was hung from a major avenue. The written text, found below, was signed with several nicknames from alleged members of the cartel. A day after the banners were put up in the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, gunfights broke out between the Metros and the Rojos. The fact that the Metros made a push into Matamoros serves as a sign that they are determined to kill off those who had turned against the Gulf cartel in the past ‚Äì the Rojos. Reportedly, Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez sent in several armed convoys of the Metros into the city with the backing of the Sinaloa Cartel. Gulf Cartel infighting The division of the Gulf Cartel into separate factions started in November 2010, following the death of drug lord Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n, who was killed by the Mexican Navy in an eight-hour- long shootout in Matamoros. The gangsters loyal to the C√°rdenas Guill√©n clan formed their own group: Los Rojos. Those remaining and loyal to Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez (El Coss) started their own group too: Los Metros. The fight between these two factions began in September 2011, when alleged members of the Los Rojos cartel killed Flores Borrego. During the 1990s and early 2000s, however, the cartel was headed by the imprisoned Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, who \\"operated with a certain structure that allowed for rivalries among lieutenants to exist without affecting the organization as a whole\\". When he was arrested and extradited to the United States in 2003 and 2007 respectively, the remaining lieutenants in the Gulf Cartel fought for the leadership void left by C√°rdenas Guill√©n. This resulted in the death of several leaders and in the split with Los Zetas, the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel that was originally formed by soldiers who deserted the Mexican Army to serve as bodyguards of C√°rdenas Guill√©n. The Gulf Cartel maintains a strong operational control over Reynosa and Matamoros, Tamaulipas, where they earn much of their income from the international narcotics trade and from human smuggling. They receive support from the Sinaloa Cartel and the Knights Templar Cartel in their fight against Los Zetas across northeastern Mexico. Los Metros gang of the Gulf Cartel, in particular, receives aid from the Sinaloa Cartel to confront Los Rojos.

Songwriter Jarkesy was so disappointed with what President Obama was doing to the country, with his unconstitutional executive Orders, his appointing communists as czars, surrounding himself with advisors with close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, closing down coal mines, and with his targeting conservatives for persecution via the Environmental Protection Agency, Internal Revenue Service, and Securities and Exchange Commission, that he wrote a song called The Bad Obama Blues Bad Obama Blues Politics Jarkesy has always been a staunch Republican, and was an Eagle in the Republican party, both donating and bundling large sums of money for candidates up and down the ticket. He spoke out often on the unrest in America, often calling President Obama out for his tactics, being one of the first to call Obama a Communist on air. It was a deep-seated dissatisfaction with what Obama was doing to the country that drove Jarkesy to put together a radio show, the George Jarkesy Radio show where He daily raged against the government over reach, about the abuse of power coming from the Whitehouse, about the administration's use of unelected bureaucrats in the Environmental Protection Agency, Internal Revenue Service, National Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies to target those that disagreed with him. Being a proud Texan, Jarkesy openly embraced Congressman Kevin Brady's Maximizing America's Progress Act, which was designed to take all of the things that Texas had done right to have the most robust economy in the entire United States (in spite of Obama, Jarkesy often noted) and to apply them at the federal level to turn our national economy around and get it back on track. The Map Act one a frequent topic on The George Jarkesy Radio Show, and it, Sponsor, Congressman Kevin Brady was a regular guest, trying to rally support from around the country for what several noted economists had called \\"the most important piece of economic legislation in several decades\\" Jarkesy was cautioned more than once about being so out spoken about the Obama Administration. While bloggers and online radio shows often complain, their audience is far smaller than the wide audience that Jarkesy had in nearly a dozen large markets, and several friends, advisors and peers were concerned about Jarkesy making a target of himself while standing up for what he believed in.

It is native to North America, where it is distributed across much of Canada and the northern contiguous United States.Williams, Tara Y. 1990. Salix serissima. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. This willow is a shrub growing to tall, and known to reach at times.Salix serissima. Flora of North America. The stems and twigs are hairless. The leaves are lance-shaped to oval and are up to 11 cm long by 3.3 wide. They are hairless. The inflorescence is a catkin. This willow grows in forests and woodlands, and in moist habitat such as bogs, swamps, and riverbanks. It grows with aspen (Populus tremuloides) and balsam poplar (P. balsamifera). It may grow with other species of willow. Its seeds remain dormant through the winter and germinate in the spring, allowing it to invade fens and other open, moist habitat. The distribution of this plant extends across northern North America, but several disjunct populations are found to the south. These include four in the Black Hills of South Dakota (two on the Black Hills National Forest); one in the Sherman Mountains of Albany County, Wyoming (on the Medicine Bow National Forest); seven in north-central Colorado (one on the Arapaho- Roosevelt National Forest); and one in southwestern Colorado (potentially on the San Juan National Forest). Though it is not a threatened species in general, in these areas it is considered sensitive. It is threatened by alterations in the hydrology of the peatland on which it grows.Decker, K.

It is the estimated utility of the last use of a supply, i.e., the least important use of that supply. For example, if a use of a good must be given up, it will logically be the last use of the good we would choose. This is because we give up the least important of our satisfactions first‚Äîwhich would be the uses satisfied by the last good since we satisfy our more important needs first. For example, if we lost a unit of a good, the value of the loss would be the value of the least important use of the good. This last good, which represents its final utility, was being applied to our least important wants. In the case of the lost good, it is replaced and the value to which we can assign the loss is not the value of the first most important use of the good, but the least important‚Äîwhat we call the final utility.B√∂hm- Bawerk, Eugen von. \\"The Law of Final Utility - Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk - Mises Daily .\\" The Ludwig von Mises Institute . http://mises.org/daily/4637 (accessed April 29, 2011). According to the law of marginal utility, the value of each good in a stock of identical goods is utility of the last and most easily dispensable unit.von B√∂hm-Bawerk, Eugen, trans. George Reisman. \\"Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk‚Äôs ‚ÄúValue, Cost, and Marginal Utility‚Äù.\\" Ludwig von Mises Institute. mises.org/pdf/asc/2002/asc8-reisman.pdf (accessed April 30, 2011). That is why price is said to be determined by supply and demand: the price reflects the (approximate and average) value of the good, but most closely reflects the value of the last use. If there is a shortage of supply, the good will cease being applied to its least important uses. All else being equal, the price will increase and the increase in price represents, so to speak, the value we attribute to the new last use. Before, with a larger supply, the last use was of less value to us. With a smaller supply the value of the last use is necessarily more important because we always satisfy our more important wants first. Therefore, the increase in price can be seen as a reflection of the increase in value we attribute to the last use of the supply. Ludwig von Mises writes: > \\"When face with the problem of the value to be attached to one unit of a > homogeneous supply, man decides on the basis of the value of the least > important use he makes of the units of the whole supply; he decides on the > basis of marginal utility.\\"Ludwig von Mises. VII. Action Within The World, > 1. The Law of Marginal Utility, Human Action, online version, referenced > 2011-04-30. Example If a hurricane struck Florida and there was a shortage of water, everything else equal, the price of bottled water would increase. Water in Florida, before this shortage, was used for drinking water, cooking, watering plants, and bathing. With the tap off, the price of bottled water has increased to such an extent that bottled water will surely not be purchased for watering plants or bathing. That is, the increase in price reflects the increase in the value we attribute to the last use of the last unit in the supply of the good. To explain, before the hurricane, water was valued according to the fact that it would be used for bathing and watering plants. Now, with a shortage, it is valued according to its ability to quench thirst and cook food. The latter uses importance is \\"approximated\\" in the price of the good. The bottled water which now costs, say, $20 a bottle, is an approximation of the value attribute to drinking water, cooking water, and whatever else it might be used for at the higher price‚Äîgiven that previous uses are not considered due to the shortage of supply and its corollary, the increase in price. That is why it is said that a homogeneous stock of goods is valued according to its final utility‚Äîaccording to its last use of a stock of a good. A supply of a good will be applied to most important wants first and least important wants last. When there is a shortage, all else being equal, the price increases. The smaller supply is being used for the most important wants, but is not being used for the least important wants. In this sense, we can say the increase in price represents the increase in value which the last unit of the supply is filling. Before water cost very little and was used for washing and watering plants. Now, since there is not enough for washing and watering plants and it is instead being used exclusively to drink and cook‚Äîthe value we attribute to those activities is, in a sense, communicated through the higher price. The price reflects that importance of the last use of a supply‚Äîand in this case the supply was truncated to only allow for the more important uses. Final utility is the logical conclusion of marginal utility and a corner stone of price theory.

The advocacy of Kuya, Daniel Razon (CEO of UNTV) also known as \\"Mr. Public Service\\", was to create another historic fun run for education with at least 300,000 participants. Razon said, \\"The Project is actually a fitting follow up of a similar event last held last 2010 that not only left a mark in history in terms of the number of participants, but for the realization of its advocacy of providing free college education to beneficiaries.\\" In partnership with the Department of Education, Razon and the Department of Education Secretary, Armin Luistro, made a deal in response to the shortage of some aspects of education. The \\"Adapt A School Project\\" is one of their initiatives. The 2012 Unity Run was the second charity fun run organized by Breakthroughs and Milestone Productions International through Razon and marketing firm Avant Garde Creatives. In 2010, the record-breaking Kahit Isang Araw Lang - Takbo Para sa Libreng Kolehiyo (Just for One Day - Run for Free College) attracted more than 50,000 runners. The event was the second project formed between Razon and the former head for the Adopt-a-School program. In 2012 a two-story building with seven classrooms was constructed at Apalit National High School in Pampanga. The run also funded two units of classroom on wheels, called Dunong-Gulong, that aim to bring education to out-of-school youth and adult learners in remote provinces. The product of the first marathon-for-a-cause, La Verdad Christian College in the Apalit and Caloocan branches, continues to support the free education of roughly 700 elementary, high school, and college students. The Department of Education participated in Kahit Isang Araw Lang Unity Run. The run was planned to go to different cities: Cebu (Cebu Business Park), Davao (SM City Davao), Puerto Princesa (Mendoza Park), Tacloban (Tacloban City Hall grounds), Butuan City (Butuan City sports complex), Bacolod Panaad Stadium.

They renamed her Amboyna after their recent capture of Ambon Island. She then served briefly in the Royal Navy before she was broken up in 1802. Capture In early 1796 Commodore Peter Rainier sailed a squadron consisting of (his flagship), , , , , one or two armed vessels belonging to the East India Company, and three transports with troops, towards the Dutch possessions in the East Indies.James (1837), vol. 1, p.372. On their way as they were passing through the Straits of Banca, on 22 January they sighted a strange sail. Lieutenant William Hugh Dobbie, fifth lieutenant of Suffolk took her launch to investigate. When it became obvious that the vessel was a becalmed Dutch naval brig, Suffolks boats joined him. Towards early evening, a breeze came up, which enabled the brig to make sail. Dobbie and the boats gave chase, firing their swivel guns as their quarry fired at them. Eventually, Orpheus came up and at 2am captured the brig at 2am. She was the Harlingen, of 14 guns and 45 men.Marshall (1827), Supplement, Part 1, pp.138-40. Rainier put Dobbie in command of Harlingen. On 16 February 1796 the squadron arrived off Amboyna, Molucca islands and landed troops who were able to take possession without facing any resistance. Then on 7 March, the squadron arrived off Great-Banda, or Banda-Neira and again landed troops, this time taking possession after facing only a little resistance. Orpheus and Harlingen covered the landing, their fire silencing a battery. The Admiral found in the Treasury at Amboyna, 81,112 Rixdollars, and in store 515,940 pounds (weight) of cloves; in the Treasury at Banda-Neira 66,675 Rix dollars, and 84,777 pounds of nutmeg, 19,587 pounds of mace, and merchandise and other stores. Estimates suggest that each of the captains in Rainier's squadron received ¬£15,000 in prize money. Service The day after Banda capitulated, i.e., on 9 March, Rainier had Harlingen purchased into the Navy and commissioned her as Amboyna, with Dobbie as her captain. Rainier intended to have Amboyna sail back to England with Captain Robert Lambert (of Suffolk) and the dispatches announcing the victory. At the last minute news arrived of an uprising by the local populace, who were Moslem, against the Dutch on Ambon. Rainier sent Orpheus to Madras with the dispatches instead, and Amboyna to Ambon to support the Dutch. Amboyna spent April and May on this mission before the Anglo-Dutch forces were able to suppress the insurgency. Rainier then had Amboyna escort a ship with a cargo of spices to China. Dobbie's mission was also to procure supplies for the British squadron in the Moluccas. When Amboyna arrived at Macao, it was discovered that she would have to be put on her side to repair damage from a grounding in the Sulu Sea. While Dobbie went up to Whampoa, he left Amboyna in the Typa (inner harbour) under the supervision of Lieutenant Arthur Farquhar, a friend who had traveled on her as a supernumerary. While she was being turned on her side, a gang of \\"ladrones\\" (thieves) attempted to capture and loot her; fortunately Farquhar was able to drive them off. Dobbie returned to Suffolk in December 1797. Lieutenant Joseph Pulham then replaced him as captain of Amboyna. Rainier appointed Lieutenant Peter Heywood of Suffolk on 17 May 1799 to take command of Amboyna, which was then at Mangalore, to sail her to Madras. There he was to take the dispatches reporting the Battle of Seringapatam, which were expected momentarily. However, when Heywood reached Madras he discovered that the dispatches had already left for England on a merchant vessel hired for the purpose. Heywood then immediately returned to the Suffolk. On 14 June 1799, Rainier appointed Lieutenant William Josiah Willougby to command Amboyna. Willoughby had been a midshipman on Suffolk at the capture of Ambon and Banda, and just emerged from a year under arrest. He had demanded a court-martial after Captain William Clark of , on which he was then serving, had arrested him for \\"disrespectful behaviour\\" and then withdrawn the charge. The court martial found Willougby guilty but had sentenced him to time served and ordered him reinstated to his rank; the court martial also exonerated Clark. Willoughby declined the appointment due to ill-health brought on by his confinement and returned to England.'\\"Dictionary of National Biography\\", (1900), Vol. 62 (Williamson- Worden), pp. 37-8. In late 1799 Amboyna was at Mocha following Commodore John Blankett's expedition to the Red Sea to block the French from using it to threaten India. In February 1800 Blankett returned to the Red Sea with a squadron that included Amboyna. Lieutenant Robert Sheldrake took command of Amboyna in April 1800. In September 1800 Vice-Admiral Peter Rainier received the Admiralty's permission to mount an expedition against Java, in particular to blockade Batavia. On 28 September, on the eve of his departure, he allocated his naval forces. Amboyna was at Bombay with the rest of Rear- Admiral Blankett's squadron. In 1801, Lieutenant John Cawley replaced Sheldrake. Fate Amboyna was sold in 1802 for breaking up. Note: An Amboyna, of 350 tons (bm), T.Miller, master, appeared in the East-India register and directory (1803; p.213), with registry at Madras.

The storyline is about a prison carpentry instructor (Guard) who drove a long way to fulfill his wife wish to have her ashes scattered in the sea near her hometown. Along the way, the Guard met many strangers, mostly three main interesting characters. Character A, a widower and wandering traveler, was driving throughout Japan with no home to go back to. A ended up being arrested for vandalizing places and properties. A befriended the Guard and gave hisÁ®ÆÁî∞Â±±È†≠ÁÅ´famous book, from which came the film‚Äôs headline: ‰∫∫ÁîüÁÑ°Ë∑ØÁõ°È£ÑËêç.

B later confessed that he could not go back home to his daughter and wife as his wife was having an affair and he did not have the courage to confront her. So he traveled and traveled and traveled, from city to city, from hotel to hotel. Character C, an assistant to B, was a fisherman from the village of the Guard‚Äôs wife. C had incurred a large amount of debt, unable to pay the debt, C faked his death while C was out of the sea fishing and caught in a torrential storm.

The Aikens had emigrated from Northern Ireland to the Colony of New Hampshire in 1729, and Phineas Aiken was a farmer, member of the Presbyterian church, and American Revolutionary War veteran. Silas Aiken graduated from Phillips Academy, Andoverin 1819, became a Christian at age nineteen and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1825 as the valedictorian of his class. He then taught and studied at the college for three more years in preparation for the ministry. After this period, Aiken was selected as a pastor of the Congregational Church in Amherst, New Hampshire, one of the largest in the state at the time, and the congregation soon underwent a revival. In 1835 Aiken became the pastor of Park Street Church in Boston. Park Street underwent several revivals during Aiken's tenure at the church. While pastoring Park Street, Aiken visited every member of the church at least once per year. In 1849 Aiken left Park Street to pastor the East Parish Congregational Church in Rutland, Vermont. He later received a D.D. from the University of Vermont.

The district was designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on January 17, 2012. In the 1820s and 1830s, the area was a desirable and fashionable place to live, especially after the opening of Tompkins Square Park in 1834. By the mid-1840s, the block consisted largely of row houses, some of which were designed by Joseph Trench, the architect who helped to bring the Italianate style to the United States. However, by the 1850s the influx of German and Irish immigrants to the area had changed the character of the neighborhood, and the wealthier residents began to move uptown. The block was then filled out with tenement buildings, and former single family row houses were turned into boardinghouses or multiple-family buildings. Also located in the historic district is the Tompkins Square branch of the New York Public Library, one of the first Carnegie libraries in New York City, which was built in 1904 to the designs of Charles Follen McKim of McKim, Mead & White.

It lies on the northern boundary of Skagit Valley Provincial Park. With a prominence of , it is one of the fifty most prominent peaks in Canada. The mountain's name was officially adopted on December 2, 1948, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The peak was first climbed in 1908 by a Boundary Survey party. Geology Silvertip Mountain is related to the Chilliwack batholith, which intruded the region 26 to 29 million years ago after the major orogenic episodes in the region. This is part of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, an eroded volcanic belt that formed as a result of subduction of the Farallon Plate starting 29 million years ago.Cenozoic to Recent plate configurations in the Pacific Basin: Ridge subduction and slab window magmatism in western North AmericaMiocene peralkaline volcanism in west- central British Columbia - Its temporal and plate-tectonics settingCatalogue of Canadian volcanoes: Franklin Glacier During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Silvertip is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Silvertip.

It was also the last packet, and the last full rigged ship, built in New York. Construction Charles H. Marshall was named after the Black Ball Line's founder. The ship was a \\"complete three decker\\" with a black hull with a narrow gold streak. Its official number in the Annual list of merchant vessels of the United States was 5728. Its signal letters were J.G.Q.B. Charles H. Marshall was the 135th ship built by William H. Webb, and he retired upon its completion. Voyages Charles H. Marshall's nephew, Captain Charles A.

Among the 400 passengers on board, there were four additional deaths, and one child born. On August 29, 1872, Charles H.

A cymbal stand is a stand designed primarily to support a suspended cymbal in a drum kit or percussion section. There are many forms, including: * Straight stands. * Simple boom stands. * Counterweighted boom stands. * Zero-offset boom stands. * Multiple boom stands. The hi-hat stand is a stand for supporting and operating a pair of clash cymbals; The term cymbal stand in English does not normally include this specialised stand. As well as cymbals, cymbal stands are used to support many other small percussion instruments, and accessories such as practice pads. History Although very ancient examples of single cymbals have been found, all ancient references to cymbals and related instruments have them played in pairs similar to modern clash cymbals. The first modern use of a single cymbal was the orchestral use of a suspended cymbal, using one of a pair suspended by its strap. As suspended cymbals became more common, stands were devised to support them from below. However, even towards the middle of the twentieth century, there was no provision for tilting the cymbal. Cymbals were supported in the same horizontal position as a cymbal suspended by its strap, by brackets affixed to drums, particularly to bass drums, and increasingly on stands. Such horizontal mounting required neither upper felt nor wingnut. Increasing drum kit sizes and increasingly elaborate drum kit parts led to development of versatile modern stands, that allow cymbals to be secured and positioned in almost any position and at almost any angle. Straight stands Straight stands Five cymbal stand heads showing the button and mounting bolt Exploded views showing various patterns of washers, sleeve and nut The simplest free-standing cymbal stands consist of a metal tripod with two or three concentric tubes allowing height adjustment, and a button at the top to allow angle adjustment. Above the button, a mounting bolt goes through the cymbal. Below the cymbal, the mounting bolt passes through first a dome washer and then a bottom felt, which support the cymbal. The bolt then passes through the cymbal. The part of the mounting bolt that passes through the cymbal is separated from the cymbal by a sleeve, most commonly of plastic, which protects the metal cymbal from contact with the metal bolt. Omission of this sleeve by beginners is common, and leads to keyhole damage to the cymbal mounting hole, and often also to cracking around the hole. Instead of a metal dome washer and separate plastic sleeve, some stands use a plastic bottom washer, either domed or flat, combined with the sleeve as a single piece. Above the cymbal is a top felt, above which may be a flat washer but this is sometimes omitted to allow looser mounting of the cymbal, and last a wingnut or cymbal nut. When threaded mounting bolts and wingnuts were first introduced, the standard mounting bolt thread was 1/4\\" BSW, similar to a light camera case screw, but 6M and 8M metric threads are also now common. At first simple metal wingnuts were used, but specialised cymbal nuts were soon introduced. Modern cymbal nuts come in two main varieties, the older being a metal wingnut with an extended metal thread, the more recent being a plastic wingnut in which the thread extension also serves as the mounting bolt sleeve. These plastic wingnuts are most commonly added as an aftermarket accessory, but are not compatible with a combined lower washer and sleeve. There are many commercially available variations on this basic pattern, involving for example springs for looser suspension, hemispherical rubber washers for tighter suspension, or quick-release mechanisms in place of the nut. Some drummers replace the dome washer with a wooden washer or even a spherical or hemispherical wooden bead, with or without a bottom felt, to increase the sustain of the cymbal. The top felt may even be omitted for heavier cymbals mounted close to horizontal, also to increase sustain. Straight stands were popular before the advent of boom stands, and remain popular where space is limited or for supporting heavier cymbals. A five-piece kit sold complete with hardware will typically come with one straight and one boom stand. Boom stands A boom stand adds a second angle adjustment to the straight stand, allowing more flexibility in positioning of the cymbal. =Counterweighted boom stands= Addition of a counterweight to the boom allows use of longer booms and/or heavier cymbals. =Zero-offset boom stands= Zero-offset boom stands use a slightly more complex mechanism that allows the boom to telescope into the stand body when positioned vertically. Such stands can function as either a straight or boom stand, but cannot be fitted with a counterweight. =Multiple boom stands= Some stands are designed to support more than one cymbal by use of multiple booms. Such stands often use the same 20mm tube standardised by Pearl for tom-tom mounts and common on drum racks. Alternative cymbal mounting techniques Other common ways of supporting a cymbal include: * A bracket on a bass drum. * Piggybacking on another cymbal. * An auxiliary boom supported by another stand such as a tom-tom drum stand. * A drum rack.

Robert Nicholl Carne (n√© Robert Nicholl) (13 April 1763 ‚Äì 10 November 1849) was a Welsh rector, landowner, and a magistrate and Deputy Lieutenant of Glamorgan. He built Dimland Castle at the end of the 18th century upon land left him by his father, from whom he inherited 99 acres. Early years Dimlands Castle, pictured c. 1850, was built by Nicholl Carne. Nicholl Carne was born at The Ham, Llanilltud Fawr, Glamorganshire, Wales. He was the sixth son of Whitlock Nicholl (1720-1788), of The Ham, in Llantwit Major, High Sheriff of Glamorgan in 1746. His mother was Anne Lewis (1722-1797), Penllyn. His siblings were brothers (Rev.) Iltyd (b. 1743), (Rev.) John, Whitlock, William, and Edward; his sisters were Eleanor (d. 1822), Susan, Anne, Lydia (1st), Lydia (2nd), and Louisa. Career He received an M.A. degree and, like two of his brothers, was ordained in 1787. The following year, he became curate of Chavenage House. In 1791, he purchased the Thomas Lewis estate in Llanblethian. By 1795, he was rector of Port Eynon, having moved to Llanmaes House. Records show him to be rector of Llanmaes in 1824. As the family mansion, The Ham, was given to the eldest son, Iltyd, Nicholl Carne began building Dimlands in 1799 on land he inherited from his father. Nicholl Carne's original property was small in area, said to be 99 acres. He was known to have purchased surrounding properties, amongst which were Caer Wrgan (\\"Wrganstown\\"), the site of the ancient castle of Jestyn ap Gwrgant, lord of Glamorgan and the last ruler of the Welsh kingdom of Morgannwg, as well as the Millways, near Boverton, both originally sections of the Fonmon Castle estate. He also purchased the property of the Earl of Plymouth. Nicholl Carne purchased Whitecross Farm from his relative, Whitlock Nicholl of Adamsdown, it having originally belonged to Nicholl Carne's father. By 1817, he owned land at Brynsach and Westfield, and by 1835, a farm in Bute. Through his second marriage, he acquired the Nash Estate in 1842, consisting of properties in Nash and Llysworney, and the Lechmore farm. Personal life His first marriage, in 1792, was to Mary (d. 1799), daughter of Daniel Woodward of Chavenage; their only child died in infancy. His second marriage, in 1800, was to Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Capt. Charles-Loder Carne, R.N., and heiress to her uncle, Rev. John Carne, of Nash. They had two sons, Dr. Robert Charles Nicholl Carne (b. 1806) and John Whitlock Nicholl Carne (b. 1816); and four daughters, Emma-Anne, Anna-Maria, Ellen-Louisa, and Frances-Susanna.

Opened in 1988, the system currently has seven lines. Over the years, various models of trolleybuses have been operated in Ruse. History The first trolleybus in the city of Ruse departed in 1988, along the route starting from the Western Industrial Zone. Lines were operated using ZiU-682 trolleybuses. In the following years, as the city was developing, so did the cable network. It was extended throughout the central areas and the industrial zones, replacing many bus routes with trolleybuses. In the beginning, solely Soviet ZiU trolleys were used. While in later years, newer models were also delivered from the same factory in the Russian Federation. Retired trolleybuses from the Swiss cities of Basel and Winterthur were introduced to the network in the late 1990s. On 1 November 2008, Ruse municipality concluded a concession contract with the Bulgarian branch of the Israeli transport company Egged. Under the concession, management of the trolleybus network in the city became the responsibility of the private Egged Ruse transport holding. In several stages, from 2008 to 2013, the entire stock of vehicles was replaced with the purchase of second hand trolleybuses from the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. In 2015, around 70% of the overhead wire network was replaced under the integrated urban transport project. The project also focused on replacing a number of trolleybus pillars and their repainting. After nearly nine years of operating under a private holding, the trolleybus transport was once again transferred to the local municipality on 31 August 2017. The municipally-owned company operating the trolleybus lines in the city is named \\"Municipal Transport Ruse\\". One of the short-term goals of the city was to ensure the proper operation of the trolleybus system. For this purpose, 5 additional used FBW 91T trolleybuses were purchased from Lausanne, Switzerland, as well as 12 Skoda 21 TrACI vehicles from Plze≈à in the Czech Republic.

Trench also had other occupations, managing the Metropolitan Theatre and San Francisco Hall, and, later, became a prospector and miner. In 1856 he ran a mining operation in Mexico, and he formed the firm Sparrow, Trench & Company to run mines in the Nevada Territory.

History Quintessence was founded in 2005 by guitarist Xavier, soon joined by Kriss, Antoine, D√©mence and Ludo. The band's music has significantly evolved with time; their first release reminds of the Scandinavian black metal scene with ubiquitous keyboards, which will later disappear thus giving way to heavy metal-influenced guitar solos and more elaborated song structures. Apart from their early demo, all the lyrics are sung in French. A demo called Black Hordes Unleashed was released in August 2007 under the name Occulta, right before the band changed name for Quintessence and hired a new drummer. This demo, self-released and limited to 200 copies only, consists in 4 tracks reminding many bands from the 1990s, mainly because of the importance of the keyboards and guitar melodies. V.R. then joined the band as a drummer in the end of 2007 in order to prepare the recording of their first full-length Le fl√©au de ton existence, released on 28 March 2009 by the Polish label Nija Art, and reissued in April 2010 by the Japanese label Hidden Marly Productions, adding 5 live recordings to the original track list. This album shows a first evolution in the band's music: keyboards have been abandoned and guitar melodies now clearly play the first role, and the production is much more elaborated than on their first release. This is also the first time the band is singing in French, language they will use for all of their later works. On 30 March 2010, the Mexican label Satanic Records releases a tape called Pictavian Onslaught, which is a split with the French band Valuatir, bringing together songs of each band recorded live during a common gig that took place in May 2009 in the city of Toulouse. Quintessence played at this show songs taken from each of their releases, as well as a Sarcofago cover, Crush, Kill, Destroy. The drums were done by a new member that joined the band in late 2008, Fog, and this concert seems to be the last one performed by the band, according to the statement saying the band no longer performs on stage. The line-up will then be redrafted, as D√©mence and Antoine, respectively doing the vocals and bass, didn't take part in the recording of the second full- length of the band released on 16 February 2011 on the French label Arm√©e de la Mort Records. This second album called Le bourreau de Tiffauges is a concept about the life of Gilles de Rais. The vocals, as well as the bass and drums, are done by Fog and the guitars by Xavier and Kriss. This album consists in 7 relatively long tracks, the song writing is more elaborated than on their previous releases, and guitar solos appear sporadically all along the record. In early 2012, Quintessence has only two members; Xavier and Fog. A new release seems to be planned for 2012: a split LP with the French band Annthennath called Eram quod es, eris quod sum.

The text is highly fragmentary, with portions of only eleven out of twenty-one columns extant. There are seven extant fragments of Songs of the Sagea and 215 of Songs of the Sageb.

Serving on the highest wartime court, he led the investigation and examinations and later the prosecution of the German Resistance group, the Red Orchestra. He shared responsibility for the dozens of death sentences handed down by the Reich court martial to Red Orchestra members. After Germany's defeat in World War II, there were attempts by survivors, family and the U.S. Army to investigate the prosecutions of Red Orchestra members and others, but Roeder was never convicted of any malfeasance or crime because the Allies thought it more expedient to use his 'expertise' to hunt down the Red Orchestra members a second time than to mete out justice for victims of the Nazis; this time to aid the Western Allies with information about the Russians in the nascent cold war.Nelson, Anne: Red Orchestra: the Story of the Berlin Underground, chpt. 22  Life and career  Roeder, the son of a Landgericht director from Kiel, served in World War IShareen Blair Brysac, Resisting Hitler: Mildred Harnack and the Red Orchestra Oxford University Press (2000), p. 350\\\\. in the 83rd Field Artillery as a lieutenant.

It was directed by Jeff Richmond, and written by co-executive producer Ron Weiner. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on February 2, 2012. Guest stars in this episode include Kristen Schaal, Nicholas Dayton, Josh Fadem, and Suze Orman. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) goes head to head with Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to negotiate over her contract, Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) considers quitting the page program after he discovers that nobody had missed him during his absence in the previous episode, and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) are hired as the entertainment for a bar mitzvah. Plot Liz Lemon's (Tina Fey) old agent Simon Behrens (Josh Fadem) informs her that her contract is almost up, and Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) has sent her a new one. Annoyed that Jack would expect her to blindly sign a new contract, Liz decides to negotiate with him for better pay and conditions. She meets with Simon at the library and discovers a seminar tape Jack had recorded called Negotiating to Win. She starts using Jack's own techniques on him in the negotiation, which he recognises and is pleased, since it is now an even playing field between the pair. The two meet at an ice-cream shop, where it seems that Jack has won the negotiation, which prompts him to negotiate with himself in a mirror on her behalf, where he accidentally wins for her. Meanwhile, Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) returns from his temporary firing, only to realize that no one noticed his absence. Hurt, he decides to switch to The Suze Orman Show and provides the TGS crew with an inadequate new page named Hazel Wassername (Kristen Schaal). However, Kenneth ends up speaking with Suze Orman, who explains to him that the reason his TGS friends don't view him as an equal is because he doesn't earn as much as them. Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) are hired by their accountant as entertainment for his son's bar mitzvah, only to be forced to act as Transformers to appease the boy (Nicholas Dayton). The pair come to realize that the boy was only making ridiculous demands because he was nervous about dancing with a girl, which leads Tracy and Jenna to resolve that their own demanding behaviour may be along the same lines, so they pledge to put an end to their selfishness. Finally, the TGS crew realize their mistake and lure Kenneth to a farewell party in order to try to get Tracy to convince him to return, since Tracy depends on him so much. However, to everyone's surprise Tracy does the selfless thing and tells Kenneth to find a better job. Jack invites Liz back to his office, where he laments on his failure to win the negotiation and as a businessman. Feeling guilty, Liz yields to him and he reveals that this was his plan, to prove to himself that he could still win. Nonetheless, he signs the contract that Liz had won, assuring her that he intends to take care of her anyway. At this point, Kenneth arrives and asks Jack if he can talk to him about a better position in the company, to which he responds in the affirmative. Reception According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 3.23 million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 1.3 rating/4 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 1.3 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was noted in the report that there was an apparent widespread DVR technical error, caused by television listings mistakenly carrying information pertaining to the previous episode, broadcast at 9:00 p.m. on January 26. This led to recorders not recording the episode, which negatively impacted upon the rating. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. Kevin Fitzpatrick of TV Over Mind called the episode \\"a fantastic reminder of how 30 Rock could never do without Alec Baldwin, who takes such manic delight in switching characters rapidly and playing off himself\\". He went on to comment on the age of the show, adding \\"stories of late either deliberately or otherwise call back to past plotlines [...] but provided things build to some actual alteration to the status quo, or at the very least a little welcomely-acknowledged nostalgia before the end, there‚Äôs still plenty of room for growth in this six year relationship\\". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club commented favourably upon the episode, opining that it \\"illustrates there‚Äôs plenty of juice left in the show‚Äôs well-oiled machinery\\". He awarded it a B+.

Michele Anne Schoenberger, The Falashas of Ethiopia : an Ethnographic Study, University of Cambridge, 1975, pp. 211-213 For many years Uri Ben Baruch was a dominant figure in the leadership of the Beta Israel community and was distinguished for his leadership and rhetorical abilities.  Biography  = Childhood and youth = Baruch was born in 1910 in the village Balnagab in northern Ethiopia to the prominent Liqa Kahnet Baruch Ahdnan who was the main spiritual leader of the Ethiopian Jews for many years until his death. Baruch was the third son of 8 brothers and sisters. Three of Baruch's brothers studied religion with their father and from other priests. His father was considered to be the spiritual leader of the Beta Israel community and later became a close friend of Dr. Jacques Faitlovitch, who visited their village several times and discussed matters of religion with Kes Abba Baruch Ahdnan many times. = As the Liqa Kahnat (High priest) in Ethiopia = When Baruch's father reached old age, various parties in the Beta Israel community began requesting that Baruch would be appointed as a successor to his father, thus becoming the spiritual leader of the Beta Israel community. Baruch gently refused, claiming that he wasn't eligible since he was not the eldest son. After many convictions he eventually accepted the request, and was appointed as the new religious leader in a grand ceremony in the presence of 120 religious leaders and the general public. Baruch's father eventually died in 1936. Baruch was the main spiritual leader of the Ethiopian Jewish community for nearly 50 years. In 1966, Baruch took part in the establishment of the organization \\"Beta Israel's Congregation\\" (◊ß◊î◊ô◊ú◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú) which aimed at promoting immigration to the state of Israel amongst the Beta Israel community living in all provinces of Ethiopia. As part of these efforts, through the years Baruch sent various letters to Israeli prime ministers, presidents and other officials in an attempt to gain their help. In these letters Baruch described the dire situation of the Ethiopian Jews, which he claimed was deteriorating due to the mission operations, hostilities and discrimination from the government. Due to this activity Baruch and his son Yair Berhan, were both arrested and accused of subversive activity against the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie. Due to this activity Baruch and his son were brought to the emperor and were asked to explain the meaning of their acts. After several hours with the Emperor and his advisers, the emperor decided to release the two. In 1973 when Rabbi Ovadia Yosef became the Chief Rabbi of Israel, Baruch's organization sent a letter to Yosef requesting official recognition of the Beta Israel community. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef's ruling was unequivocal and determined that the Beta Israel are Jews and must be rescued. Following this historic ruling the Israeli Law of Return was applied to the Beta Israel community on March 3, 1975, thus paving the way for their later massive immigration to the state of Israel. = Immigration to Israel = The Jewish Agency requested Baruch to become an example and immigrate to Israel in order to get the rest of the Beta Israel community to follow him. Baruch initially refused the request and claimed that the supreme leader must remain in Ethiopia until the last Jew leave and that only then he would be capable of leaving. After pressure and persuasion from the Israeli establishment Baruch decided to emigrate to Israel as he passed the community's leadership in Ethiopia to his son Yair Berhan. Baruch immigrated to Israel in August 1977. In Israel Baruch continued to work for bringing the rest of the Beta Israel community to Israel. Among various efforts, he met with the then Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and other officials in an attempt to promote the immigration of the rest of the beta Israel community to Israel. During his old age he lived to see one of biggest Beta Israel immigration to Israel which took place during the 1980s. Baruch died in December 21, 1984.

It houses the administrative headquarters of the Gwaneum Order of Korean Buddhism. It is located close to the Dongmangbong Peak, Naksan Park, Donggwanmyo Shrine and Dongdaemun Market.  History  Myogaksa was established in May 1942 by Ven. Taeheo Hongseon in accordance with a geomantic prediction that Seoul residents would be at peace if a temple was constructed here. Based on a geomantic principle, Mt. Naksan, on which Myogaksa is located, corresponds to a land formation known as ‚Äúblue dragon on the left‚Äù in regards to Seoul, and Myogaksa stands on the edge of the mountain. Although Myogaksa is situated on a rather small piece of land in a residential district, its structural integrity is evident in the layout of such structures as Daebulbojeon, Wontongbojeon, Nakga Seon Center, Seokguram, Mountain God Shrine and an Avalokitesvara image carved into the mountain cliff.

When he returned to Japan in 1995, his album collection became the basis for his first company, which sold imported albums and CDs through the mail. Business Man wearing a Zozosuit In 1998, Maezawa used the basis of the mail-order album business to launch the company Start Today. The same year, his band signed with the label BMG Japan. By 2000, Start Today had moved to an online platform, had begun selling clothing, and had become a public company. In 2001, Maezawa declared a hiatus on his music career. Start Today opened the retail clothing website Zozotown in 2004, and six years later, Start Today became a publicly traded company, listed on the \\"Mothers\\" Index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. By 2012, Start Today was listed in the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Maezawa recently introduced ZOZO, a custom-fit clothing brand and the ZOZOSUIT, an at-home measurement system, in over 72 countries and territories. Maezawa resigned from ZoZo in September 2019 after selling a stake of 50.1% in the company to SoftBank for (400 billion Yen). He also sold 30% of his personal stake in ZoZo to Yahoo Japan. Contemporary Art Foundation Maezawa is the founder of the Tokyo- based Contemporary Art Foundation, which he started in 2012 with a goal of \\"supporting young artists as a pillar of the next generation of contemporary art.\\" The Contemporary Art Foundation currently hosts collection shows twice a year. In May 2016, Maezawa attracted significant media attention with a record purchase price at auction of $57.3 million for an Untitled (1982) artwork of a devil by Jean-Michel Basquiat, and broke a record again in May 2017 with a $110.5 million auction for another Untitled (1982) of a skull by the same artist. At the same 2016 auction, Maezawa bought pieces by Bruce Nauman, Alexander Calder, Richard Prince, and Jeff Koons, spending a total of $98 million over two days. Maezawa plans to open a contemporary art museum in Chiba, which will house his collection. Circumlunar flight On 17 September 2018, it was announced that Maezawa will be the first commercial passenger to do a flyby around the Moon. He will fly onboard a SpaceX Starship, which has been in development since 2017. The flight is slated to take place no earlier than 2023 with a duration of nearly six days. He plans to take six to eight artists with him as a part of an art project he has created entitled #dearMoon.Dear Moon. Accessed: 17 September 2018.

He wrote in national newspapers in Britain and in cycling journals. Through his writing ran the conviction that \\"on every real bicycle there is the unseen pennant of progress, the standard of democracy, (and) the banner of freedom.\\"cited http://www.cycling- books.com/Kuklos_biography.htm He also gave magic lantern shows, predecessor of slide shows, which were in demand in the 1920s and 1930s and to which cyclists rode \\"prodigious distances.\\"Journal, Fellowship of Cycling Old- Timers, UK, March 2012 p 81 History Wray was born in Hitchin,CTC Gazette, UK, January 1939 the third son of the Reverend Samuel Wray, a Methodist minister in Sacton, west of Beverley, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. His mother was Ann (n√©e Fitzwater), of Laleham, Middlesex. He was educated at church boarding schools: the Kingswood School in Bath and Woodhouse Grove on the edge of Bradford. He did not share his father's religious belief, however, writing in 1896: \\"While still at boarding-school I revolted from the orthodox Christianity (sub-section Dissent) into which I was born and brought up... So I have never been since (to Church), except to temples not made with hands\\". He hired his first bicycle, a safety bicycle with solid tyres, when he was 17 in 1887 His first ride was from Bradford to Otley and back. At his father‚Äôs insistence he then set out to tour England, an experience his father thought useful before his son started work. Wray bought a solid-tyred penny-farthing - the large-wheeled bicycle that the safety had replaced ‚Äì and set out on that with no luggage and little money, sleeping rough when he had to or staying with friends and relatives. He rode between 700 and 800 miles. The experience guided the rest of his life. His father died while Wray was having what would now be called a gap year and he started work as a lithographic artist, then a photo etcher and pen draughtsmen in Bradford and began writing the first of his cycling columns for the Bradford Observer. He joined the Yorkshire Road Club. In 1907 he married Emily Gertrude Fisher, known as Klossie, and together they toured all Britain and continental Europe. He left Bradford in his 20s to work for the Daily News, a national newspaper in London that was absorbed by the News Chronicle. He wrote there for 25 years before joining the Daily Herald, where he wrote weekly until a few days before his death. He often mentioned Bradford and the Yorkshire Dales. From 1894, he began using the byline Kuklos (the Greek word for a wheel, or circle but also used for a circle of poems) and by the following year earned enough to live as a writer. While in London, he joined the North Road Cycling Club, one of the country‚Äôs oldest. Opinions Wray was a man of independent and firm opinions. George Herbert Stancer, the president of the Cyclists‚Äô Touring Club, described him as the cyclist‚Äôs \\"doughtiest champion.\\" The Bicycle called him \\"an individualist, and even those who disagreed with his opinions had to admit the sincerity of his beliefs.\\" He wrote \\"with a sincerity so strong as to become almost violent.\\" One of his campaigns was against a cycling institution which attracted thousands, the annual service for cyclists killed in the First World War, held at a memorial on the green at Meriden in the English Midlands. His article, Mendacious Meriden, upset many but was often reprinted. Picture shows Wray and other cycling tourists such as W. M. Robinson and Neville Whall, who used the names Wayfarer and Hodites, were in demand for their picture shows in the 1920s and 1930s and cyclists would travel \\"prodigious distances\\" to see them. Wray took his pictures on glass slides three inches by three inches. He arranged them into sequences with names such as Wildest Britain, The Irish Paradise, A Cyclist in Lighter Vein and Old Inns and Nature and Novelist. The tradition and the slides died out with the start of the Second World War and the advent of 35mm transparency film. Wray's pictures passed on some years after his death to George Herbert Stancer, the secretary of the Cyclists Touring Club and then to a Norfolk enthusiast, Les Reason. They are now held at the national cycle archive at Warwick University. Books Collections of his writing were published as books, notably A Vagabond's Note-Book (1908) and The Kuklos Papers (1927). Other works included The Visitors Book (1937), observations collected from hotel visitors' books. Earlier he wrote a series of articles for the Daily News about cycling in war torn France during the first part of World War I. These were collected together in Across France in Wartime, published in J.M.Dent's Wayfarer's Library in 1916. In 1916 he translated Le Feu (English: Under Fire: The Story of a Squad), a novel by the French communist, Henri Barbusse. Death Wray died on 16 December 1938 while under anaesthetic in the operating room of a London hospital. He was given a non-religious funeral at a crematorium in London, witnessed in heavy snow by \\"a handful of Kuklos‚Äôs personal friends, men and women famous in the cycling world, to whom their departed comrade had been the inspiration of many of their beliefs and ambitions.\\" He asked for no mourning and no flowers. Emily Wray submitted a tribute to her husband at the request of The Bicycle. She wrote: He does not die that can bequeath Some influence to the land he knows That dares, persistent interwreath Love permanent with the wild hedgerows. He rides the loud October sky. He does not die ‚Äì He does not die.

Representing the United States of America, Goepper won a bronze medal at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia and won a silver medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. He has also won three gold medals and two silver medals at the Winter X Games. His sponsors include PowerBar, Red Bull, and V√∂lkl. Early life Nick Goepper was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, but raised in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. In Lawrenceburg he skied at Perfect North slopes which has an elevation of 800 feet along with 100 acres of terrain. He has two younger sisters, one younger brother, and a cat. He began skiing at the age of five, started competing when he was eleven years old, and landed his first double backflip by thirteen. Perfect North Slopes in Lawrenceburg, IN. Early career In 2009, Goepper moved to Sandy, Oregon where he attended school and trained with professional skiers at Wy'East Mountain Academy (formerly Windells Academy) on a full ride scholarship under Head Coach Mike Hanley. He also attended Westminister University. Goepper won a gold medal at the 2013-14 FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup in Cardrona, New Zealand and qualified for the 2014 Olympics at the 2013 Dew Tour in Breckenridge, Colorado. He placed first despite having to ski with a broken hand and no poles. Awards At the 2014 Winter Olympic Games, Nick Goepper, Gus Kenworthy, and Joss Christensen swept the medal podium winning bronze, silver, and gold, respectively in men's slopestyle skiing. The all American trio appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman in New York City and were also featured together on a Kellogg's Corn Flakes cereal box. He was also featured on a Jif peanut butter jar. Goepper's hometown threw a parade for him when he returned and Perfect North Slopes gave him a lifelong pass. He also met former Indiana Governor Mike Pence and threw the opening pitch of the season for the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. Following the Pyeongchang Olympics, Goepper was awarded the Sagamore of the Wabash Award which is the most prestigious award an Indiana resident can receive. He later met President Donald Trump at the White House where he was mistakenly addressed as Mark Goepper. Philanthropy In December 2014, Goepper partnered with Wy'East Mountain Academy (formerly Windells Academy) to host a rail jam competition at Perfect North Slopes which attracted more than 150 participants with all proceeds donated to \\"The Cure Starts Now Foundation\\". In June 2017, he joined a group of Olympic athletes on a week mission trip to Kigali, Rwanda organized by \\"Kids Play International\\". Public appearances In 2014, Goepper and his mother were featured in the NBC Sports televised series How to Raise an Olympian sponsored by the P&G; \\"Thank You, Mom\\" campaign. His mother, Linda, recalled Goepper spending all day skiing in the terrain park at Perfect North Slopes and building ramps/jumps in the family backyard to use year-round. Goepper talked about watching hours of freestyle skiing videos of professionals. His sisters, both gymnasts at the time, taught him flips and helped coach him before competitions. Goepper also mentioned about selling candy bars on the school bus, mowing neighbors' lawns, and babysitting children to pay for his skiing related expenses when his father, Chris, lost his job during the Great Recession. Before heading to his first Olympics, Goepper attended the 71st Golden Globe Awards where he met celebrities like Usher, actor Leonardo DiCaprio, actress Reese Witherspoon, former professional boxer Mike Tyson, and singer Taylor Swift whom he later asked to be his Valentine but was declined. Before competing in his second Olympics, Goepper was interviewed by People Magazine. He said that he had a panic attack throwing rocks at some cars shortly after the Sochi Olympics. However, he immediately confessed to police and paid about $8,000 for damages. Goepper also shared about his struggle with suicidal thoughts. \\"There came a point when I was drinking every day and I was constantly thinking about ways to end my own life,\\" he said. He was admitted into a rehabilitation center in Houston, Texas for two months and has since recovered. Goepper wanted to show resemblance with his audience instead of motivating them by sharing his experience. After competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics, Goepper took a week long trip in New York city for a series of interviews and media appearances. Personal life On May 4, 2018, Goepper proposed to his girlfriend in Marco Island, Florida and announced their engagement on Instagram with the caption \\"She's stuck with me forever! Lizzy Braun-not-for-long\\". Goepper hopes to compete in the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, China. Besides skiing, he enjoys surfing and skateboarding which he claims are helpful for cross training. In December of 2014, Nick Goepper confessed to Dearborn County Sheriff's department that he was the \\"unknown local\\" who had been throwing rocks at traveling cars, damaging personal property & threatening driver safety {cite weburl=https://www.fox19.com/story/27670675/local-olympian- charged-for-throwing-rocks-at-vehicles/title=Local Olympian accused of throwing rocks at vehicles date=December 19, 2014work=FOX19access- date=September 17, 2019}}. Goepper was forced to pay $8,000 in fines in lieu of jail time for Reckless Endangerment. Nick Goepper's family attended the Olympics at Sochi, Russia to cheer him on.

Background The term unicast refers to a one-to-one transmission from one point in the network to another point. Conventionally, unicast is considered more secure because the frame is delivered solely to the intended recipient and not to multiple hosts. This diagram illustrates the unicast transmission of a frame from one network host to another: 200px When a switch receives a unicast frame with a destination address not in the switch‚Äôs forwarding table, the frame is treated like a broadcast frame and sent to all hosts on a network: 200px Causes The learning process of transparent bridging requires that the switch receive a frame from a device before unicast frames can be forwarded to it. Before any such transmission is received, unicast flooding is used to assure transmission reach their intended destination. This is normally a short-lived condition as receipt typically produces a response which completes the learning process. The process occurs when a device is initially connected to a network, is moved from one port to another or after 5 minutes of inactivity when the device is typically purged from the forwarding table. A switch that has no room left in its address cache will flood the frame out to all ports. This is a common problem on networks with many hosts. Less common is the artificial flooding of address tables‚Äîthis is termed MAC flooding. Another common cause are hosts with ARP timers longer than the address cache timeout on switches‚Äîthe switch forgets which port connects to the host. Devices other than switches may create unicast floods as well. A router which has a bridge interface but does not have the destination frame's address in the bridge cache will flood the frame out to all bridge members. Misconfigured features of the networks may lead to unicast flooding as well. If there are two layer 2 paths from Host A to B and Host A uses path 1 to talk to Host B, but Host B uses path 2 to respond to Host A, then intermediate switches on path 1 will never learn the destination MAC address of Host B and intermediate switches on path 2 will never learn the destination MAC address of Host A. A final cause of unicast floods are topology changes. When a link state changes on a network port which participates in rapid spanning tree, the address cache on that switch will be flushed causing all subsequent frames to be flooded out of all ports until the addresses are learned by the switch. Remedies There are several remedies discussed in the links above. But for many situations, a low end switch needs to be replaced with a higher end switch‚Äîone that has a larger address table and one that can block unicast floods. Blocking unicast floods on a Cisco switch is easy to do, but it is not enabled by default. After ensuring that timeouts and/or security features have been configured to maintain table entries on client access ports longer than typical host ARP cache timeouts, this command is used to quiet down the unicast floods on those ports: Switch(config-if)# switchport block unicast Other techniques involve isolating hosts at Layer 2, which blocks intra-LAN communication not destined to the router. A handy tool (available in lower end switches ) is the Switch(config-if)# switchport protected or a more robust, cross-switch solution than 'switchport protected' is the use of Private VLANs. Effects on Networks When a network is experiencing unicast flooding, network performance is degraded. Here is an graph of a bridge before and after adjusting the size of the bridge address cache: 580px 80% of the frames were flooded out never to be received by the destination address, while 20% was valid traffic (image from first reference). In high volume networks, the flooded traffic may cause ports to saturate and lead to packet loss and high latency. Another side effect of exhausted address tables is the compromise of data. The security considerations are discussed in the MAC flooding‚Äîone of several causes of unicast floods. If an end user is running a packet sniffer, the flooded frames could be captured and viewed.

Shoup. It changed names and locations over the years, before going out of business as Advanced Voting Solutions, Inc. of Frisco, Texas in 2015. History Safemaker Jacob H. Meyers created the Automatic Voting Machine in 1888 and established the Automatic Voting Machine Corporation (AVM) in 1898. Samuel R. Shoup followed his example, built his own lever voting machine and founded the Shoup Voting Machine Corporation in 1905. It \\"operated on a limited scale\\", until \\"the development and sale of the model 2.5 in the mid 1930s turned the corporation into a successful and profitable operation.\\" The two rivals grew to dominate the American market. By 1928, one of six citizens registered their votes on an AVM or Shoup machine. In all, Shoup sold 100,000 lever-operated voting machines, half of which were still working and in use for the 2000 presidential election. In the 1950s, the company was renamed the R. F. Shoup Corporation. \\"In 1961, General Battery and Ceramic Corporation of New York incorporated ... Shoup Voting Machine Corporation.\\" The voting machine operations were sold in 1965, and an S corporation was formed. Shoup's first foreign sale was to Trinidad in 1968. Aerospace business Macrodyne-Chatillon Corporation \\"acquired Shoup Voting Machines in 1969 for an estimated $6,000,000, primarily in stock.\\" As a result of adverse publicity from criminal charges (see next section) and a \\"$2.3 million federal income tax lien which resulted in the Internal Revenue Service seizing certain assets\\", \\"effective March 31, 1972, Macrodyne-Chatillon wrote off its investment in, and deconsolidated, The Shoup Voting Machine Corporation (Shoup), a owned subsidiary.\\" Both AVM and Shoup machines used a tabular layout. In the Shoup version, each political party was assigned a column, each office a row; AVM reversed this arrangement. Most Shoup machines came with a booth for privacy that could be \\"collapsed into a package that was relatively easy to transport and store.\\" Ransom F. Shoup introduced improvements between 1929 and 1975. Lever voting machines went out of production by 1982, but continued to be employed until much later. Rhode Island used Shoup machines from 1936 into the 1990s. The first voting machines in Louisiana were from Shoup; they were employed for more than 50 years, beginning in the 1940s. It was not until January 2010 that The New York Times reported that New York City was expected to choose a replacement for its mechanical Shoup machines after \\"about a half century\\" of use. The company was renamed Shoup Voting Solutions, Inc. in 1992 and Advanced Voting Solutions, Inc. in 2001. Criminal cases In July 1971, United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell announced that the Shoup Voting Machine Corp. of Philadelphia, its subsidiary Southern Municipal Sales, Inc., Shoup president Irving H. Myers, company executive vice president Martin V. Schott, several other Shoup employees, and other individuals had been indicted by a Philadelphia grand jury for a total of four indictments for bribery, mail fraud, and conspiracy. According to one indictment, \\"Shoup officials conspired to sell 200 machines to Hillsborough County\\", Florida, for $530,700 using bribery, then bought 180 back as scrap for $5,400. Another indictment charged that Shoup officials then bribed an official of Harris County, Texas, to buy 100 of them. On March 1, 1972, the Sarasota Herald- Tribune reported that Shoup had changed its plea from innocent to no contest and was fined $45,000, while a former salesman had changed his plea to guilty and received a sentence of 181 days. In 1972, C. H. \\"Sammy\\" Downs, a former Louisiana state senator serving as his state's public works director in the administration of Governor John McKeithen, resigned when he was indicted by a federal grand jury for bribery in connection with procuring state business for the Shoup company. The firm was also indicted in the case. In the 1973 trial, the case against Downs, pushed by U.S. Attorney Gerald J. Gallinghouse of New Orleans, resulted in a hung jury.

Bishop (August 3, 1936 - September 15, 2013) was a radio and television personality who is known for being Chicago's original \\"Svengoolie\\", and for his award-winning twelve-year stint on \\"Sun-Up San Diego.\\" Education Born Jairus Samuel Ghan in Chicago to Russian Jewish parents, he graduated from Wright Junior College, the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and Columbia College Chicago. Career =Radio= In 1961, he got his start in radio at WNMP (now WCGO) in Evanston, hosting the morning- drive program. He also worked part-time on stations in Rockford and Springfield. In 1962, he was hired at WPGC-AM-FM in Washington, D.C., where he stayed for a year, before being hired on at Cleveland giant KYW as a night- time DJ. He had used his real name of Jerry Ghan at his previous jobs, but began using the name, 'Jerry G' at WPGC. KYW program director Ken Draper requested he use that same name. \\" During his three-year stint at KYW, Jerry G. toured with the Beatles as a reporter for Group W and NBC Radio stations on their 1964 and 1965 tours, hosted a weekly dance-party program, \\"Jerry G & Co.,\\" on KYW's television outlet, and recorded a song, \\"She's Gone,\\" backed by local group the Statesmen. Released as a single on the Clevetown label as by \\"Jerry G & Co.,\\" it became a local hit in 1966. When Ken Draper was program director at Chicago's WCFL from 1965 to 1968, he hired Bishop in 1967. Draper then asked him to pick a last name to go with the \\"Jerry G.\\" name he had been using. He and his wife flipped through the Cleveland phone book, and together settled on the name \\"Bishop.\\" =Television= In 1969, Jerry G. became a staff announcer and the host of an afternoon local version of the movie/call- in contest show Dialing For Dollars on WFLD-TV, which was also located in Marina City in what is now The House of Blues building. This affiliation with WFLD would lead to Jerry inventing his most famous role as Svengoolie on Channel 32's Screaming Yellow Theater in 1971. Bishop was the announcer of the Friday night scary movie anthology Screaming Yellow Theater when he had an idea to create a live host for the program-the character that became known as Svengoolie-at first a Bela Lugosi-type voice under a title card (and over Link Wray's 1958 hit \\"Rumble\\"), then on-screen, in the guise of a green-haired, green-bearded, guitar strumming hippie who slept in a psychedelic painted coffin and told corny, vaudeville-era jokes given a horror-movie skew. The show's title was derived from Screaming Yellow Zonkers, a yellow, sugary glazed popcorn snack, first produced in the 1960s. Svengoolie was a pun on the name Svengali + ghoul. The show, and character, proved to be wildly successful; the show lasted from 1970 until 1973, when parent company Field Communications sold WFLD-TV to Kaiser Broadcasting, which chose to replace Theater with a similar show popular in Cleveland, The Ghoul Show. (The Svengoolie persona would be resurrected, with Bishop's permission, in 1979 by Rich Koz, who had been a writer for the original series; Koz continues in the role today.) =Return to radio= After leaving WFLD, Bishop would be hired by WMAQ as their morning-drive personality. He also worked on the station's television outlet (channel 5), hosting \\"Chicago Camera,\\" a Sunday-afternoon variety program. He also anchored the \\"Today in Chicago\\" segment of NBC's \\"Today\\" show. He would work for WMAQ until 1975, when WMAQ changed formats from MOR/talk to country and replaced their entire announcing staff. Bishop remained in the Windy City for a short time afterwards, acting as Director of Corporate Affairs for The National Easter Seal Society of Chicago. In August 1978, he headed West, to San Diego and KFMB-TV, where he assumed the co-host chair of the long-running morning-talk program \\"Sun-Up San Diego.\\" His co- host, until 1983, was Danuta Rylko. He collected three local Emmy Awards and a National Press Club Award for his work on the show, which he co-hosted for twelve years until its cancellation in 1990. In 1980, he served as local moderator of the discussion segment of the innovative Norman Lear project \\"The Baxters\\"; the segment was titled \\"The Baxters with Bishop.\\" In 1992, he worked at adult-contemporary KPOP (now KLSD), and wound up his broadcasting career with a three-year stint hosting a show (via voice-tracking from San Diego) on WRLL (\\"Real Oldies 1690\\"), an Oldies extended-AM station aimed at the Chicago area, beginning in 2003. =Restaurateur= Away from his radio/television pursuits, Bishop and his family operated two Chicago-themed restaurants in San Diego's Seaport Village for 36 years: the Greek Islands Cafe (based on a similarly-named restaurant in Chicago) and Asaggio Pizza Pasta Plus, a Chicago-style pizzeria. The latter closed permanently in September 2018, having been in business for 31 years. Death Bishop died on September 15, 2013, at the University of California - San Diego Medical Center, of a heart attack. He was survived by his wife of 49 years, Liz, and his children Melissa and Christopher.

He served in many Rotary Clubs throughout New South Wales and Victoria. In 1981, while a member of the Rotary Club of Mornington, Victoria, Scott was moved by the plight of families affected by sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). To encourage further research on this problem, he proposed that Rotary establish a national research foundation with a corpus of A$2 million to fund health research, with a focus on family health problems. Rotary accepted this proposal and Scott served as treasurer on the board of the Australian Rotary Health Research Fund (later called Australian Rotary Health). By 1995, ARH had raised enough money to fund its first grants, which went to research on SIDS.

It is the only novel by Lins that has been published. It took Lins 10 years to complete the book. The novel was hailed by critics as one of the greatest works of contemporary Brazilian literature. It was made into a feature film of the same name in 2002, which went on to be nominated for four Oscars. An English translation of the book was published in 2006. Thanks to the international recognition of the film, the book continued to be translated into several more languages, including Italian, French, Spanish and German. Title The book is named after the Favela in which the novel takes place, Cidade de Deus. Cidade de Deus was established in 1960 in the western zone of Rio de Janeiro as part of a government strategy to systematically move favelas away from the city centre and relocate inhabitants to the suburbs. Synopsis City of God is set in a city renowned for its natural beauty. The novel follows the lives of gangsters and petty criminals living in the Favela. The novel is set from the 1960s through to the 1980s. In the beginning, delinquents make money through hold-ups. In the 1970's, cocaine arrives and takes its place in the criminals' lives, both dealing and consuming vast amounts. Drug lords use their wealth to buy guns, which give them more power. Conflicts over who controls the drug trade in the Favela result in gang wars. Written laws do not apply; power is held by criminals and drug lords who rule the Favela. The poorly paid police monitor the gangs, not for the sake of public safety, but to ensure their corrupt income from the gangs.

Husain, 540 U.S. 644 (2004), was a United States Supreme Court case related to Olympic Airways Flight 417. The case arose from the death on 4 January 1998 of Dr. Abid Hanson,Lithwick, Dahlia. \\"The Accidental Tourist.\\" Slate. Wednesday 12 November 2003. Retrieved on 4 July 2009. a passenger on Olympic Airways Flight 417 from Cairo, Egypt, via Athens, Greece, to New York City in the United States. Hanson died following exposure to secondhand smoke.Supreme Court brief Dr. Hanson, who had a \\"history of recurrent anaphylactic reactions\\" and sensitivity to secondhand smoke, had requested a non-smoking seat. When the family boarded the Boeing 747 aircraftHusain v. Olympic Airways (Archive), 316 F.3d 829 (9th Cir. 2002), in Athens, the family found that the assigned seats were three rows ahead of the economy-class smoking area; there was no partition between the smoking and non-smoking sections. The family repeatedly requested a seat farther away from the smoking section but the flight attendant, Maria Leptourgou, would not move the passenger to any of the eleven other unoccupied seats on the aircraft. Hanson felt a reaction to the smoke and died several hours later, despite his doctor's aid. Background Secondhand smoke as seen in a bar. Smoking on international flights was already seen as a safety issue by the International Civil Aviation Organization's aviation medicine section, which had sought an outright ban by 1996.Smoking restrictions on international passenger flights Abid Hanson and his wife, Rubina Husain, were sitting in non-smoking seats on Olympic Airways Flight 417, but were very near the smoking section. Dr. Hanson was allergic to second-hand smoke. The couple's request to be moved was denied by the flight crew, and because of the inhalation of smoke during the flight, Dr. Hanson died. Rubina Husain filed suit in a California federal district court seeking damages under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention. This Article allowed damages to be recovered by international air travelers for accidents that occur during a flight. Applying the statute from the Warsaw convention, the district court ruled that Mr. Hanson's death was an \\"accident\\" and awards Rubina Husain $1.4 million. This ruling was affirmed by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Legal case The Supreme Court of the United States decided the appeal in Olympic Airways v. Husain. Before the case reached the Supreme Court, the lower courts had decided as follows: > The District Court found petitioner liable for Dr. Hanson‚Äôs death, and the > Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that, under the definition in [Air France > v. Saks, ] of ‚Äúaccident,‚Äù the flight attendant‚Äôs refusal to re-seat Dr. > Hanson was clearly external to him, and unexpected and unusual in light of > industry standards, Olympic policy, and the simple nature of the requested > accommodation.Court Syllabus On initial appeal, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit unanimously affirmed the finding of the District Court that Leptourgou's actions not only met the definition of ‚Äúaccident‚Äù under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention, but also rose to the level of being ‚Äúwilful misconduct‚Äù under Article 25; by passing that threshold, it removed a $75,000 cap on damages. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals award of US$700,000 in compensatory damages against Olympic Airways, holding that: \\"the conduct here constitutes an 'accident' under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention.\\"Decision of the USSC Question before the Court If a preexisting medical condition is aggravated by airplane conditions, can it be considered an \\"accident\\" under the Warsaw Convention's Article 17, holding the airline responsible for the damages? Decision of the Supreme Court In a 6-2 decision in favor of Husain, Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court. The Court cited the decision in Air France v. Saks, which held that \\"any injury is the product of a chain of causes....some link in the chain was an unusual or unexpected event external to the passenger.\\" Further, the flight attendant's refusal to allow the couple to change seats was the \\"link in the chain\\" that caused Dr. Hanson's death.

Facaded from an alley way History One of the oldest churches in the city, it occupies the site of a former church originally dedicated to the apostles. In later centuries, the church was renamed after St Syrus of Genoa, a beatified bishop. Originally the cathedral of Genoa, it stood outside of the original walls, and was vulnerable to attacks from Saracen pirates; the title of Cathedral was transferred to San Lorenzo. There is another church dedicated to San Siro, San Siro di Struppa, outside the city center. Legend holds that the bishop was able to banish a Basilisk that dwelt in a well adjacent to the church; a plaque on a nearby house recalls the miracle. This event is represented in a medieval bas relief on the portico arcade next to the church, as well as a fresco by Carlone in the apse. From the tenth to 12th centuries, building of the original Romanesque structure of the church and bell-tower proceeded. In 1478, a fire destroyed much of the church. Nearly a century later, prodded by Cardinal Vincenzo Giustiniani and the Pallavicini family, reconstruction was begun following the demands of Counter-Reformation architecture, with a main central nave. That nave was frescoed by Giovanni Battista Carlone with Conversion of St Peter, Martyrdom of St. Peter, and Death of Simon Magus. Paolo Brozzi completed the quadratura decoration. The chapel of the Piet√† was commissioned by Taddeo Carlone in 1595 (and completed by 1606 by the marble-carvers Santino Paracca, called Valsoldo, and Alessandro Ferrandino). In 1904, the romanesque bell-tower, due to its perilous situation had to be demolished and was never rebuilt. Other works of art include the Triumph of the Cross in the cupola by Carlone, and canvases of the Annunciation, Birth of Mary, and St Anthony by Orazio Gentileschi (the brother of Aurelio Lomi). Other artists with paintings in the church include Domenico Fiasella, Giovanni Domenico Cappellino, Andrea Semino, Giacomo Lomellini, Cristoforo Roncalli, Gregorio De Ferrari, Domenico Piola (2nd chapel on right), and a Decapitation of Saint by Carlo Bononi . The church contains a number of sculptures by Taddeo Carlone. The main altar design and sculpture were completed by Pierre Puget.

Located on the planet Tatooine, it first appeared in the 1977 film Star Wars, described by the character Obi-Wan Kenobi (played by Alec Guinness) as a \\"wretched hive of scum and villainy\\". A notable scene set in a seedy Mos Eisley cantina crowded with numerous alien races made a particular impact on audiences. Location filming for the spaceport took place from 1975‚Äì76 in Tunisia, with interiors filmed at Elstree Studios in London. Depiction =Film= Dante's View, overlooking Death Valley, was used as the establishing shot for Mos Eisley in Star Wars (1977) Filming location in Ajim, Tunisia for the Mos Eisley Cantina for Star Wars (1977) Mos Eisley made its first appearance in the original 1977 film, Star Wars. It is depicted as a busy, bustling port city situated in a desert plain, populated with transients of all species. The lawless spaceport attracts criminals, smugglers and fugitives. Spacecraft land at docking bays dotted across the city. The Mos Eisley scenes occur early in Star Wars, when the young hero Luke Skywalker and his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi travel to the spaceport in search of a pilot, accompanied by the droids, C-3PO and R2-D2. Obi-Wan warns Luke that the spaceport may be dangerous. Upon arrival, Luke and Obi-Wan enter the cantina, a dimly-lit tavern patronised by visiting starship pilots. Strong drink is on sale at the bar and there are frequent outbreaks of violence among the clientele. The cantina attracts a range of exotic alien species, although droids are not permitted to enter ‚Äî the bartender orders them to leave, saying \\"We don't serve their kind in here\\". A band of domed-headed aliens plays a set of otherworldly jazz-style music. Luke is threatened with violence by two of the customers, Ponda Baba, an Aqualish, and Doctor Evazan, a deformed human, but Obi-Wan intervenes with his lightsaber, cutting Ponda's arm off in the fight. This is the first time a lightsaber is used in combat on-screen in the Star Wars franchise. Obi-Wan introduces Luke to a pair of smugglers, Chewbacca and Han Solo, and they negotiate terms for passage to the planet Alderaan. After Luke and Obi-Wan have departed, Han is involved in a brief confrontation with Greedo, a green- skinned gangster; the exchange ends violently when Han shoots Greedo dead. As the group prepare to leave, they are followed to Docking Bay 94 by Garindan, a spy working for the Empire. Following a brief gunfight with Imperial stormtroopers, they board the Millennium Falcon spaceship and take off from Tatooine. =Books= In the novelization of the film, Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker by George Lucas (ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster), Mos Eisley is described as a haphazard, run-down settlement built of concrete and sandstone, a large part of it built underground to escape the heat of Tatooine's twin suns. The cantina is described as a dark, sinister bar full of \\"one-eyed creatures and thousand-eyed, creatures with scales, creatures with fur\\". The narrative describes \\"Tentacles, claws and hands... wrapped around drinking utensils\\". The Expanded Universe anthology of intertwined short stories, Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina, edited by Kevin J. Anderson, explores the cantina and its clientele further. The book names the establishment as \\"Chalmun's Cantina\\", introducing its proprietor as a Wookiee named Chalmun; it also reveals that the bartender is named Wuher. The book also explores the reasons for the cantina's ban on droids: the bartender claims to dislike everyone, but lashes out at droids because they are the only thing that will not try to fight back; the proprietor Chalmun does not tolerate droids because they do not drink, and therefore occupy valuable space. The backstory of the cantina's resident swing band is also expanded in the short stories \\"We Don't Do Weddings: The Band's Tale\\" by Kathy Tyers and \\"Empire Blues\\" by Daniel Keys Moran. The band is named as Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes and it is revealed that the players belong to a race called Bith. Their main musical number is also given a title, \\"Mad About Me\\". =Television= Mos Eisley appears in the 2019 Star Wars television series, The Mandalorian. In \\"Chapter 5: The Gunslinger\\", the Mandalorian is forced to set down in Mos Eisley for repairs after a space battle with another bounty hunter. In order to pay for the repairs, the Mandalorian goes to a local cantina to look for a bounty. There, he meets a rookie bounty hunter, Toro Calican, who hires him to help locate Fennec Shand, a dangerous mercenary. The pair locate Shand just beyond the Dune Sea and apprehend her. However, when the Mandalorian goes to retrieve transport for them, Shand tries to turn Calican against him by telling Calican about the Mandalorian turning against the bounty hunter guild to rescue the child. Calican kills Shand and decides to capture the Mandalorian and the child and collect all three bounties. The Mandalorian, however, is able to overcome Calican and rescue the child and Peli, a mechanic that was repairing his ship and watching the child. The Mandalorian gives Peli the reward for Shand as payment for the repairs and he and the child depart Tatooine. Production =Filming= Star Wars Celebration, Anaheim The first view of Mos Eisley in Star Wars is a shot of Death Valley in California from the Dante's View lookout, with a matte painting added in the distance. The actual filming on location took place on the Tunisian island of Djerba. In 1975, during the early stages of production on Star Wars, the appearance of the Mos Eisley cantina and its clientele was realized through the work of concept arts Ron Cobb, Rick Baker and Ralph McQuarrie and costume designer John Mollo. Mollo worked with George Lucas to compile a chart of visual designs for a range of character types. In collaboration with Mollo, make-up artist Stuart Freeborn designed the masks and prosthetics to match each of the costumes, along with Doug Beswick, Rick Baker, Phil Tippett, Nick Maley and Christopher Tucker. Freeborn has remarked that the cantina scene was specifically set up to be a \\"shock\\" scene ‚Äî until this point in the film, there had been few appearances of non-human creatures, and the entrance into the cantina suddenly presented the audience with an array of outlandish species. Working from Lucas's direction and a maquette, set designer John Barry created the cantina set complete with circular bar and shady alcoves. Mollo included a few costumes borrowed from Westerns, and based some other costumes on characters from the 1950 film Destination Moon and the 1960s television series Lost in Space. The alien musicians in the band were played by a number of the Industrial Light & Magic crew, including Phil Tippett, Jon Berg, Rick Baker, who all mimed to the Benny Goodman tune \\"Sing, Sing, Sing\\" at George Lucas's suggestion. In the foreground, a selection of creatures who appeared in the cantina The exterior scene was initially filmed in 1976 at the little town of Ajim, which is a fishing port on the Isle of Djerba, Tunisia. The film crew added some false frontage to the structure, which has seen no refurbishment since 1976. The local owner was reimbursed eight dollars a day. The interior set was constructed and filmed on Stage 6, Elstree Studios in London. Harrison Ford filmed his first scene with Alec Guinness ‚Äî Ford later remarked that the prospect of working with Guinness \\"scared the shit out of me\\". As filming progressed, Lucas encountered many problems; the production was running over-budget and both cast and crew were suffering health problems. Stuart Freeborn fell ill and was unable to complete his work on the cantina creature masks. In early 1977, under pressure to complete his movie (now more than $2 million over budget), Lucas negotiated limited additional funding from 20th Century Fox executives to support second unit filming. Some of the most important additional footage shot was to enhance the cantina scene at Hollywood Center Studios. Lucas had been dissatisfied with the make-up in previous shots due to Freeborn's illness, and was now able to fully realize the scene with several close-ups of alien creatures, complete with Freeborn's masks. Lucas also supplemented the limited coverage he had from the Tunisia footage with footage from Death Valley. The new material was cut into the film by Lucas's editors, including Lucas's wife Marcia Lucas. Lucas remained dissatisfied with the final cut of the cantina scene, and when Lucasfilm released the Special Edition of Star Wars in 1997, Lucas made a number of changes to the shots. In the opening sequence of the cantina scene, a sinister werewolf-type character was replaced by a CGI pipe- smoking reptile. The second change to the cantina scene was an adjustment to the confrontation between Han Solo and Greedo, which altered the rapid sequence of action so that Greedo is shown to fire the first shot. This change has proved one of the most controversial among Star Wars fandom, and gave rise to the popular slogan \\"Han shot first\\" in objection to the alteration. The aliens in the Cantina Band (later named \\"Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes\\") were played by Industrial Light & Magic crew. =Music= Throughout the cantina scenes in Star Wars, there is constant background music played by an alien band. This diegetic music was composed for the film by John Williams, and consisted of two pieces written for trumpet, three saxophones, clarinet, Fender Rhodes piano and percussion, along with steel drum and synthesizer. George Lucas briefed Williams to imagine \\"several creatures in a future century finding some 1930s Benny Goodman swing band music ... and how they might attempt to interpret it\\". Williams combined traditional jazz instruments with instruments associated with Afro-Caribbean music in order to create a sound that was \\"both alien and yet familiar at the same time.\\" Spin-off merchandise =Toys= In 1978 the toy manufacturer Kenner Products released a Cantina Adventure Set as part of its range of Star Wars action figures. The playset consisted of a miniature plastic bar with a cardboard backdrop depicting various cantina creatures and an Imperial stormtrooper. A second version of the playset was brought to market in 1979, named the Creature Cantina Action Playset. In September 2020, LEGO Released a Master Builder Series (MBS) Mos Eisley Cantina Set. It featured 3,187 pieces, 21 Minifigures and cost $349.99 USD/EUR. =Music releases= The first piece of music from the Cantina scene was released in 1977 on the Star Wars Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, entitled simply \\"Cantina Band\\". Later CD of the soundtrack album included the second piece, which was titled \\"Cantina Band #2\\". The first \\"Cantina Band\\" number has since been retitled \\"Mad About Me\\". That same year, the record producer Meco released a space disco version of the Star Wars title theme and \\"Cantina Band\\" on his single \\"Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band\\". Since then, numerous popular cover versions and parodies have been released which feature the \\"Cantina Band\\" melody, including \\"Star Wars Cantina\\" (1996) by Mark Jonathan Davis, a parody song of Barry Manilow's \\"Copacabana\\";Burton, Bonnie. \\"Richard Cheese: Star Wars Swings!\\", 12 May 2006. reprinted online at Interviews of Richard Cheese at Cheese's website. \\"Cantina Band\\" (1995) by the rock band Ash, as the B-side of their single \\"Girl From Mars\\"; \\"Digga Digga Doo\\" (2004) by the Asylum Street Spankers, from their 2004 album Mercurial; and \\"Cantina\\" (2007) by Voltaire from his album Ooky Spooky; A bluegrass version of the theme is heard during the bar scene in the 2011 film Paul, recorded by Syd Masters and The Swing Riders.

It was first broadcast on USA Network in the United States on January 31, 2012. The episode was directed by Andrew McCarthy and written by Jeff F. King. The episode has been noted to draw many themes from Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. When Elizabeth Burke (Tiffani Thiessen) overhears a neighbor (Joe Manganiello) discussing a future crime, she, Mozzie (Willie Garson), and Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer) work together to prove his guilt. According to the Nielsen ratings system, an estimated 3.042 million household viewers watched the original broadcast of the episode, with 1.0 million in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. \\"Neighborhood Watch\\" received mostly positive reviews, with many complimenting Thiessen's performance. Plot After Peter Burke (Tim DeKay) leaves a scanner at home, Elizabeth overhears plans for a robbery. Peter visits the scene of the alleged crime, but finds nothing to suggest that the robbery exists. Neal and Peter attribute Elizabeth‚Äôs actions to paranoia stemming from her recent kidnapping by Matthew Keller. However, Mozzie believes that the robbery was real, and begins helping Elizabeth monitor Peter‚Äôs scanner. Mozzie and Elizabeth soon hear the same voices from the original transmission, and discover that they are the voices of the Burke‚Äôs new neighbors, Ben (Manganiello) and Rebecca Ryan (Lola Glaudini). Elizabeth immediately visits their house, coercing an invitation for dinner that night. While at dinner, Elizabeth excuses herself from the table in order to search the house. She discovers nothing, but soon finds herself locked in a bedroom. Neal, speaking to her through a window, walks her through picking the lock. However, she is soon found by an annoyed Peter. Peter finally agrees to investigate the Ryans, quickly being informed by Diana Berrigan (Marsha Thomason) that Ben has an armed robbery conviction. As Peter phones Elizabeth to let her know that she was correct, Ben visits the Burke home and vaguely threatens Elizabeth. Clinton Jones (Sharif Atkins) follows Ben and discovers the identity of Ben‚Äôs partner: Connor Bailey (Will Chase). In order to get closer to the suspects, Neal visits Ben‚Äôs parole office under the alias Nick Halden. Using information gathered by Neal, Peter quickly realizes that the target of the heist is a luxury hotel. Peter and Neal hurry to the hotel, barely missing Ben and Connor. At the Burke home, Elizabeth and Mozzie follow Rebecca as she leaves the house. Realizing that Peter will not reach them in time, Elizabeth approaches the Ryans as an FBI agent. Her attempt fails just as Peter and the FBI arrive. Production Joe Manganiello appeared in the episode as Ben Ryan. It was first reported on June 30, 2011 that Joe Manganiello would appear in an episode of White Collar as an ex-con and the Burkes' new neighbor at some point during the second half of the season. A day after Manganiello's casting was announced, it was reported that Will Chase would appear in an episode with Manganiello as Connor Bailey, another ex-con. On July 11, 2011, series creator Jeff Eastin announced via Twitter that Andrew McCarthy would direct the episode. It was his first directing credit, though he had previously portrayed Vincent Adler during the second season. \\"Neighborhood Watch\\" was written by Jeff F. King, his first writing credit after directing \\"Power Play\\" in the second season. Eastin has acknowledged that the episode contains various themes from Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, and that the idea had been in development for multiple seasons; many reviewers mentioned the theme as well. Tiffani Thiessen announced on July 26, 2011 that production had recently wrapped on the episode. On August 26, 2011, USA Network announced simultaneously with the fourth season renewal that Lola Glaudini would appear in the series; she ultimately appeared in \\"Neighborhood Watch\\" as Rebecca Ryan. Reception Tiffani Thiessen's performance as Elizabeth Burke was especially praised by critics. =Ratings= The initial broadcast of \\"Neighborhood Watch\\" was viewed by 3.042 million viewers, which at the time was the second-lowest of the series. It received 1.0 million viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, down by approximately 0.1 million viewers from the previous week. The episode ranked eleventh overall in the 18‚Äì49 demographic for the night and finished fifth in its timeslot, after Teen Mom 2, Tosh.0, The Game, and Justified. =Reviews= \\"Neighborhood Watch\\" received positive reviews, with many critics praising Tiffani Thiessen's larger role. Kenny Herzog of The A.V.

C. Charles of TV Fanatic heavily praised the episode, calling it \\"a great hour\\" and \\"the Rear Window of the 21st century.\\" Jessica Rae mentioned that the episode was \\"well thought-out and delightful,\\" and praised Elizabeth's more prominent appearance. Brittany Frederick of Starpulse.com gave the episode a more mediocre review, calling it \\"fairly run- of-the-mill.\\" She stated that Manganiello \\"has the glower down pat\\" and complimented the additional scenes between Thiessen and Willie Garson; however, she said that she hoped that the episode would mark the end of Elizabeth's recovery after her kidnapping.

Locomotives of the type were also supplied to railways in China and Czechoslovakia and to various industrial operators. Production In all, 1,145 units of this class were built. The internal factory type designations of the engines should not be confused with their railway operator classes: * 2 prototypes (1964) * 867 as type V 100.1 as DR V100.0 class (subsequently 110.0 class) (1965‚Äì78) * 59 of type V 100.2 for China (1974‚Äì76) * 131 of type V 100.3 for China (1977‚Äì82) * 68 of type V 100.4 as DR 111 class (37 locomotives) and various industrial users (1981‚Äì83) * 18 of type V 100.5 as DR 110.9 class (11 locomotives in 1976/83) and CSD T476 class (7 locomotives in 1981)  History (DR locomotives)  Factory plate of a V100 The diesel programme established in the mid-1950s by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany to replace steam locomotives introduced the V 15, V 60, V 180 and V 240 diesel classes. However, it did not include an engine of about for light to medium passenger and goods train duties or for heavy shunting work, which could have replaced steam locomotive classes 38, 55, 57, 78 and 93. This gap was initially to be plugged by importing engines based on the Soviet TGM3 class. But when it became clear that the Soviet Union was not in a position to supply these locomotives, the DR began developing its own diesel engine in 1963, which was to use as many of the components of the V 180 as possible. The result was a four-axled diesel locomotive with a central driver's cab and hydraulic transmission designed by the firm of Lokomotivbau Karl Marx Babelsberg. The first prototype (in blue livery) of 1964 still had the well- known engine from the V 180; but the second prototype in 1965 (in red livery) was given the engine of Type 12 KVD 18/21 A-3 from VEB Motorenwerk Johannisthal. The two prototypes were not taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and were later destroyed in a major fire in the repair shop at Cottbus. Their numbers were later re-used. After it became clear that series production would take place at Lokomotivbau Elektrotechnische Werke Hans Beimler Hennigsdorf, they built a further prototype in 1966 (number V 100 003). This (third and oldest surviving) loco is now owned by the Berlin-Anhalt Railway Society (F√∂rderverein Berlin-Anhaltische Eisenbahn) in the Martin Luther town of Wittenberg and sports its original livery (cream with green stripes). One year later, production started. In the years that followed, the V 100 replaced almost all state railway locomotives on medium duties and thus hauled all types of train, working all over East Germany. In the 1970 DR fleet renumbering, class V 100 became class 110. The last of the main series of 867 locomotives for DR was built in 1978 (numbers 110 001-171 and 110 201-896). Subsequent deliveries to DR included 11 class 110.9 locomotives for departmental (i.e. non-revenue) use, which were equipped to provide power to track maintenance machinery and snow blowers. Finally 37 class 111 locomotives were built for shunting purposes, these lacking train heating apparatus having extra ballast to increase traction. Many of the locomotives were rebuilt and renumbered during their lives: * DR class 108 (DBAG class 298.0) - class 110.0 rebuilt as shunting locomotives; * DR class 110.0 (DBAG class 201) - mixed traffic locomotives as built; * DR class 110.9 (DBAG class 710) - departmental locomotives as built: * DR class 111 (DBAG class 293) - shunting locomotives as built (later rebuilt as DBAG class 298.3); * DR class 112 (DBAG class 202) - class 110.0 rebuilt with 883 kW engines; * DR class 114 (DBAG class 204) - class 110.0 rebuilt with 1100 kW engines; * DR class 115 - original designation for class 114 (when class 114 was intended for 1029 kW rebuilds); * DR class 199 (DBAG class 299) - class 110.0 rebuilt to run on metre gauge lines; * DBAG class 203 - class 202 rebuilt with 1380 kW engines After the merger of the West and East German railways to create Deutsche Bahn AG, the large fleet of this very robust and reliable East German locomotive was no longer wanted on German rails. An unusual problem arose with a rolling motion that was traced to the wheel profile. On newly laid and ground rails the engine rocked at high speeds. The Deutsche Bahn finally reduced its permitted maximum speed to , which meant it could be taken out of service because this speed was too low for duties on main lines. Individual locomotives were later equipped with special shock absorbers on their bogies to counter the rocking motion. =Harzkamel= In the 1980s 30 locomotives were supplied to the HSB https://www.hsb-wr.de/Unternehmen/Fuhrpark/Diesellokomotiven/199-8-Harzkamel/ re-gauged to the 1 metre narrow gauge.

Life and works Scheuer made his first profession in the Society of Jesus in 1901. In 1916 he completed his formation and began teaching. In 1920 the Jesuit Superior General, Wladimir Ledochowski, sent Bulot to speak with Pierre Scheuer (and also Pierre Charles) about their support for some suspected philosophical propositions supposedly drawn from the work of Pierre Rousselot's Les yeux de la foi. However, Emile Mersch spoke with Bulot and wrote to the General in defense of Scheuer and Charles. However, the General ‚Äòrusticated‚Äô Scheuer. Forbidden to teach, Scheuer begun an intense new career of retreat preaching, especially to the clergy. Though he hardly published anything, Scheuer‚Äôs influence, especially on the Jesuit College at Louvain, is described as exceptionally wide and deep. He was a senior colleague and close friend of Joseph Marechal. For 40 or 50 years one could see the two friends walking along the corridors of the college, Scheuer‚Äôs Plato to Marechal‚Äôs more timid Aristotle.Andr√® Hayen, ‚ÄúIn Memoriam Pierre Scheuer, S.J.,‚Äù Revue Philosophique de Louvain 55/45 (1957) 139-142.

If they have a common source in the philosophy of immanence of Maurice Blondel, the opening towards Kant was due to the initiative of Scheuer. This is not to make of Marechal his disciple or successor; his originality remains intact; but he profited from the favourable atmosphere towards the Kantian critique in the scholasticate of Louvain under the influence of Scheuer.Dirven 47, cited in Michel de Give, review of Daniel J. Shine, An Interior Metaphysics: the Philosophical Synthesis of Pierre Scheuer, s.j., Revue Philosophique de Louvain 65/86 (1967) 243-245. Richard De Smet counts Scheuer among his great influences, and describes him as ‚Äúa prince among metaphysicians and a mystic,‚Äù saying that ‚Äú[e]very conversation with him, every answer he gave me to difficult problems of philosophy or faith, every rare lecture he gave us were seeds of enduring light.‚ÄùRichard De Smet, ‚ÄúSurrounded by Excellence: An Evocation,‚Äù Jivan: Jesuits of South Asia: Views and News 11/10 (December 1990) 10. Scheuer‚Äôs influence persists in the metaphysics notes composed by De Smet.Richard De Smet, ‚ÄòMetaphysica Generalis‚Äô. While no copy of these Latin cyclostyled notes has yet been traced, we have a good idea of them from Jean de Marneffe, 'General Metaphysics: Study Guidelines Prepared by J. de Marneffe, S.J.‚Äô (Pune: Pontifical Athenaeum, 1966): Marneffe himself acknowledges that his notes freely use material contained in De Smet‚Äôs notes.

Privately, he attributed it to the powers of Ju and Ja idols and as a result he named the large expanse Ju-Ja Farm. Because of the numerous superstition that surrounded Juja Farm, it became a no-go zone and locals used to fear entry into a land they always heard had been jinxed. As a result, McMillan's wife took the two idols from the house and buried them in Ndarugu valley, near Thika Town. As a result, the name Juja started entering into annals of colonial history in Kenya and refused to give way to its former name ‚ÄòWeru wa Ndarugu‚Äô, the Ndarugu plains.

Connection to the land and waters is vital in Australian Aboriginal culture and to that of Torres Strait Islander people, and there has been a long battle to gain legal and moral recognition of ownership of the lands and waters occupied by the many peoples prior to colonisation of Australia starting in 1788, and the annexation of the Torres Strait Islands by the colony of Queensland in the 1870s. , Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples‚Äô rights and interests in land are formally recognised over around 40 per cent of Australia‚Äôs land mass. Description and distinctions According to the Attorney-General's Department: 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence (as per this page). Native title in Australia includes rights and interests relating to land and waters held by Indigenous people under traditional laws and customs, and recognised in accordance with the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth). Although this is federal legislation and therefore applicable to the whole of Australia, the way in which the processes for native title operate in each state and territory is dependent on the history of the land rights arrangements of the particular state or territory. In some jurisdictions, titles to large areas of traditional lands were granted before the Act commenced. The Native Title Act was passed after the High Court of Australia' decision in Mabo and others v. Queensland (No. 2), the test case in claiming land rights through the court system, which recognised for the first time that Indigenous people had rights to their land governed by their own laws and customs pre-dating colonisation by thousands of years. It recognised the dispossession of their lands, and in particular that their laws included land title (native title), and that Indigenous land rights which had not been extinguished by subsequent Crown grants continued to exist. Different types of land rights laws exist in Australia, allowing for the renewed ownership of land to Indigenous Australians under various conditions. Land rights schemes are in place in the Northern Territory, Queensland (including the Torres Strait Islands), New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The land titles may recognise traditional interest in the land and protect those interests by giving Aboriginal people legal ownership of that land. Also, according to the National Native Title Tribunal: \\"A successful land rights claim usually results in a special grant of freehold title or perpetual lease. A title document for the land is issued. The title is normally held by a community or an organisation, not by individuals. There are usually some restrictions on selling, and dealing with, land that has been granted in a land rights claim. Normally, the land will be passed down to future generations in a way that recognises the community‚Äôs traditional connection to that country\\". Indigenous land rights relate to the rights and interests in land of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia, and the term is also used to describe the struggle for those rights. , Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples‚Äô rights and interests in land are formally recognised over around 40 per cent of Australia‚Äôs land mass. The recognition of Indigenous rights in land and waters is fundamental to the process of reconciliation. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence (as per this page). History The colonisation of mainland Australia started in 1788, while the Torres Strait Islands were only taken over by the colony of Queensland in the 1870s. The Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia of 1836, which were issued during the period of British colonisation of South Australia, included recognition of the rights of the Aboriginal peoples of South AustraliaDraft of the Order-in-Council Establishing Government 23 February 1836 (UK), National Archives of Australia ‚Äì the first ever recognition of Aboriginal rights on the continent ‚Äì but the promise was never kept. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the movement of Aboriginal peoples in Australia was controlled by colony- and later state-based laws, such as the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 in Queensland. This often meant that they were confined to living on Aboriginal reserves or mission stations, where they had no rights to land ownership. =The struggle for land rights= The passing of Aboriginal land rights legislation in Australia in the late 20th century was preceded by a number of important Aboriginal protests. The modern land rights movement started with the 1963 Yolngu Bark Petition, when Yolngu people from the remote settlement of Yirrkala, in north-east Arnhem Land, petitioned the federal government to have their land and rights given back. The 1966 Wave Hill Walk-Off, or Gurundji Strike, started with a protest about working conditions, but grew into a lands right issue, with the people claiming rights to the land which was then a cattle station owned by a large British company, Vesteys. The strike lasted for eight years. In 1961, at the Native Welfare Conference, a meeting of federal and state ministers responsible for Aboriginal welfare, agreed on a policy of assimilation. The measures included the removal of discriminatory legislation and restrictive practices, welfare measures, education and training to assist the involvement of Aboriginal people in the economy, and the education of non-Indigenous Australians about Aboriginal culture and history. It brought about a more widespread awareness by non- Indigenous people to social justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. South Australian Premier Sir Thomas Playford argued for integration rather than assimilation of Aboriginal people, and others questioned the concept of assimilation, with its paternalistic attitude. The Aboriginal Lands Trust Act 1966 (SA) established the South Australian Aboriginal Lands Trust (ALT).Aboriginal Lands Trust Act 1966. South Australian Acts (Point-in-Time). Retrieved on 29 January 2012. This was the first major recognition of Aboriginal land rights by any Australian government, and predated the 1967 Referendum. It allowed for parcels of Aboriginal land previously held by the SA Government, to be handed to the Aboriginal Lands Trust of SA under the Act. The Trust was governed by a Board composed solely of Aboriginal people. =1970s activism and legislation= In the 1970s, Indigenous Australians became more politically active, and a powerful movement for the recognition of Indigenous land rights emerged. Also during this decade, the federal government started buying privately-owned land in order to benefit Indigenous communities, and also to create Crown land which would be available for claim. In 1971, Justice Richard Blackburn of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory ruled against the Yolngu in Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd (the \\"Gove land rights case\\") under the principle of terra nullius,Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd (1971) 17 FLR 141. when they sought native title rights over the Gove Peninsula. However, Justice Blackburn did acknowledge the claimants' ritual and economic use of the land and that they had an established system of law \\"a subtle and highly elaborate\\" system of laws (Madayin). In this way, this was the first significant legal case for Aboriginal land rights in Australia. In the wake of Milirrpum, the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission (also known as the \\"Woodward Royal Commission\\") was established in the Northern Territory in 1973. This Royal Commission, chaired by Justice Woodward, made a number of recommendations in favour of recognising Aboriginal Land Rights.Aboriginal Land Rights Act . Central Land Council. Retrieved on 29 January 2012. Taking up many of these recommendations, the Whitlam government introduced an Aboriginal Land Rights Bill to Parliament; however, this lapsed upon the dismissal of the government in 1975. The succeeding conservative government, led by Malcolm Fraser, reintroduced a Bill, though not of the same content, and it was signed by the Governor-General of Australia on 16 December 1976. PDF of original version The Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976 established the basis upon which Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory could claim rights to land based on traditional occupation. The statute, the first of the Aboriginal land rights acts, was significant in that it allowed a claim of title if claimants could provide evidence of their traditional association with land. Four Land Councils were established in the Northern Territory under this law. The Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976 established a procedure that transferred almost 50 per cent of land in the Northern Territory (around 600 000 km2) to collective Aboriginal ownership.Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia), Aboriginal land rights and native title , retrieved 30 January 2012. Following this, some states introduced their own land rights legislation; however, there were significant limitations on the returned lands, or that available for claim. Paul Coe, in Coe v Commonwealth (1979), attempted (unsuccessfully) to bring a class action on behalf of all \\"Aborigines\\" claiming all of Australia.Coe v. Commonwealth [1979] HCA 68. =1980s South Australia= In 1981 South Australian Premier David Tonkin returned of land (10.2% of the state's land area) to the Pitjantjara/Yankunytjatjara people, as the APY lands. The land rights legislation was introduced by Premier Don Dunstan in November 1978, several months prior to his resignation from Parliament. An amended bill, following extensive consultation, was passed by the Tonkin Liberal Government, as the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Land Rights Act 1981. In 1984 Premier John Bannon's Labor Government passed the Maralinga Tjarutja Land Rights Act 1984 to return lands to the Pitjantjara people in the remote western area of the state. The legislation was proclaimed in January 1985 and was followed by a ceremony in the desert attended by Maralinga Tjarutja leader Archie Barton, John Bannon and Aboriginal Affairs Minister Greg Crafter.Sydney Morning Herald, 3 December 2008, \\"Hero of the Maralinga People\\" =1995: Aboriginal Land Corporation= In 1995 the Aboriginal Land Corporation was established by the Federal Government to assist Aboriginal Australians to acquire land and manage Aboriginal held land sustainably and in a manner that provides cultural, social, economic and environmental benefits for themselves and future generations. The corporation is funded by an annual payment from the investment returns of the Australian Government's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Account. Indigenous land tenure by state and territory =Northern Territory= The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (see above) provides the basis upon which Aboriginal Australian people in the Northern Territory can claim rights to land based on traditional occupation. The freehold land cannot be sold or transferred, but it can be leased. =Queensland= In Queensland, the Aboriginal Land Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Islander Land Act 1991 provide for Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander freehold respectively. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander freehold land occupies 5%, or of northern Queensland. A Registered Native Title Body Corporate (RNTBC) can be trustee of this land, who can grant leases of up to 99 years for any purpose. A third type of land tenure, mainly held by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in remote and regional Queensland, is the Deed of Grant in Trust (DOGIT). These were established primarily to administer former Aboriginal reserves and missions. They came about through legislation passed by the Queensland Government in 1984. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander local governments hold trusteeship of the DOGITs, and land tenure under this type of tenure is held in collective title, held in trust for future generations. From 1 January 2015, some trustees, namely those classified as \\"urban\\" or \\"future urban\\") are able to convert parts of the collective title to either Aboriginal freehold or Torres Strait Islander freehold title. Mer (Murray) Island (the subject of the Mabo No.1 (1988) and No.2 (1992) cases) is Torres Strait Islander freehold and Aurukun is Aboriginal freehold land. =South Australia= In the 2013 Review of the Aboriginal Lands Trust Act 1966, the powers of the Trust were reviewed and changed to modernise the Trust and the Aboriginal Lands Trust of South Australia Act 2013 (SA) was passed. =Western Australia= The Aboriginal Lands Trust (ALT) of Western Australia was established by the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act 1972. This body holds about , or 10% of the State's land. There are different types of tenures held by different parts of this land, including reserves, leases and freehold property. There are many remote communities on this land, inhabited by about 12,000 people. Land reform is ongoing, to use the land in a way which benefits the Aboriginal people.

She returns in The Grudge 2 and compels her sister, Aubrey, to put a stop to the curse. Her portrayal was met with critical acclaim by critics and the films crew. Character arc =The Grudge= Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the main protagonist of The Grudge. She is an American social worker who moves with her boyfriend, Doug, to Tokyo. She volunteers to take care of a woman named Emma Williams when Emma's first caretaker, Yoko, does not show up to work. When Kayako Saeki, an undead woman bound to a curse, starts killing people around her, she starts investigating the curse's origin. She decides to head back to the house to keep Doug from falling to the curse, but fails. Karen then tries to stop the curse by burning down the house, but this instead releases the curse. =The Grudge 1.5= In the animated short film The Grudge 1.5, Karen is rescued by a young Chinese journalist, Eason when he arrives the house on fire to find Detective Nakagawa, but he saves Karen before they were attacked by Kayako and the two make it out alive and Karen is taken to the hospital. =The Grudge 2= The second installment reveals that Karen was hospitalized after the events of the first film.

Reception Gellar received praise for her performance in the first film, and many of them referenced her performances as the reason for the film's success. Upon her appearance in The Grudge 2, she received praise again but also received mixed reviews due to the character's surprise death. Casting Before Gellar was cast, numerous other actresses were suggested, such as Selma Blair; the two of them had previously starred together in the teen movie Cruel Intentions.

In the summer of 1817 he created a 50/1 upset by winning The Derby after being entered in the race to act as a pacemaker for a more highly regarded stable companion. The rest of his form was well below top class, with his only other success coming when he was allowed to walk over at Newmarket. Background Azor was a chestnut horse bred by his owner John Payne. Payne also owned Azor's dam Zoraida and his older sister Zora who won a race at Newmarket and finished second in the Riddlesworth Stakes in 1815. Azor's sire Selim won the Craven Stakes and the Oatlands Stakes at Newmarket and went on to have a successful stud career, siring the classic winners Medora (Epsom Oaks), Nicolo (2000 Guineas), Turcoman (2000 Guineas), the filly by Selim (1000 Guineas) and Turquoise (Oaks) as well as the British Champion sire Sultan. He was trained by Robert Robson, who sent out the winners of thirty-four Classics from his stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Azor was the first notable winner for James \\"Jem\\" Robinson, who went on to win twenty-four classics including a record six Epsom Derbies. Racing career =1817: three-year-old season= Azor did not race as a two-year-old, and made his first racecourse appearance at the Newmarket Craven meeting. On 12 April he ran in the Billingbear Stakes, a 100 guinea race for three-year-olds over the Ditch Mile course. He was not among the favourites and finished unplaced behind The Flyer. On 22 May, Azor started as a 50/1 outsider for the Derby at Epsom. The Student, trained like Azor by Robert Robson, started the 7/4 favourite in a field of thirteen runners. Azor was thought to be in the race to act as a pacemaker for The Student and Jem Robinson was ordered to take the ride by his employer to prevent him from riding for a rival trainer. When Azor set off in front he was ignored by the other jockeys and allowed to build up a huge lead. Although his margin was reduced in the straight, he hung on to win from Young Wizard, another 50/1 outsider. His victory was considered the most inexplicable upset in the race up to that time. Following his Epsom win Azor was sent to the Newmarket July meeting for a 200 guinea Sweepstakes. He was allowed to walk over when his two opponents, both owned by the Duke of Grafton, were withdrawn. Azor returned to Newmarket in autumn for two races at the \\"First October\\" meeting. On 30 September he ran in a 200 guinea match race over ten furlongs against the five-year-old Anticipation.Anticipation won 1816 Ascot Gold Cup. Anticipation won 1819 Ascot Gold Cup again. He was beaten by the older horse despite carrying twenty-eight pounds less than his rival. Two days later, Azor finished second of the six runners behind Fitz-Orville in the two mile Town Plate. Stud career Azor did not race after his defeats at Newmarket in autumn 1817 and late in the following year he was offered for sale as a potential stallion. According to the General Stud Book Azor was exported to Austria (\\"sent to Vienna\\").

The Latin emperor, Henry of Flanders, desired to expand his territory in Asia Minor at the expense of the Nicaeans. He had already achieved a victory in 1205 at Adramyttium, but the need to counter the Bulgarians in Europe had forced him to conclude a truce and depart. By 1211, only a small exclave around Pegai remained in Latin hands. Taking advantage of the losses suffered by the Nicaean army against the Seljuks in the Battle of Antioch on the Meander, Henry landed with his army at Pegai and marched eastward to the Rhyndacus river. Henry had probably some 260 Frankish knights. Laskaris had a larger force overall, but only a handful of Frankish mercenaries of his own, as they had suffered especially heavily against the Seljuks. Laskaris prepared an ambush at the Rhyndacus, but Henry assaulted his positions and scattered the Nicaean troops in a day-long battle on 15 October. The Latin victory, won reportedly without casualties, was crushing: after the battle Henry marched unopposed through Nicaean lands, reaching south as far as Nymphaion. Warfare lapsed thereafter, and both sides concluded the Treaty of Nymphaeum, which gave the Latin Empire control of most of Mysia up to the village of Kalamos (modern Gelenbe), which was to be uninhabited and mark the boundary between the two states.

Based on the 2007 comic series of the same title by Lee Hyun-sae, it starred Uee, Lee Yong-woo and Lee Da-hee. The drama was pre- produced in 2010 (filmed completely before broadcast), and initially expected to air on MBC in December 2010, but the network decided not to give it a timeslot. After several postponements, it aired on cable channel tvN from August 8 to October 25, 2011 on Mondays and Tuesdays at 23:00 (KST). But instead of the original 20 episodes of 70 minutes each, it was re-edited into 24 episodes spanning 45 minutes each. Synopsis Sung Mi-soo (Uee) is a cheerful, humble country girl from Gangwon Province. She comes from a poor family, and her mother used to work as a caddy. With her bright personality and determined efforts, Mi-soo is striving to become a professional golf player. On the other hand, Min Hae-ryung (Lee Da-hee) is an elite athlete who has been groomed for professional golf since a young age. Placed in the best environment to play golf, Hae-ryung's emotions are always controlled and she has a deep emotional wound inside of her. These two girls from different backgrounds share the same dream of being the next top golfer, a dream that leads them to former pro golfer John Lee (Lee Yong-woo). John Lee was the first Korean to win a PGA title. His background was a mystery other than the fact that he was an adoptee. Aside from golf, he also excelled in the Afro- Brazilian dance/martial arts style known as capoeira. But even though he found success by winning the PGA title, John Lee stopped playing golf to become a golf course tester. John Lee agrees to lead Mi-soo and Hae-ryung into becoming the next queens of golf like Se Ri Pak, Michelle Wie, Jiyai Shin, and Eun-Hee Ji.

It is a secular, technological heaven in which all human dead have been resurrected, from the earliest sentient hominids to humanity‚Äôs distant posthuman descendants. The City is portrayed as a pluralist, pacifist utopia in which violence is impossible and tolerance is paramount, although there are many Citizens with philosophical objections to this form of paradise.

The label specializes in the promotion of mostly Irish rock and alternative music. The label has a discography that charts over three decades of Irish rock and alternative music. The company has released albums by leading Irish artists, including The Blades, David Hopkins, Perry Blake, Reemo, The Moondogs, Metisse, Big Self and performance artist Nigel Rolfe, as well launching the career of now established acts, such as Aslan and Microdisney. Reekus Records is a member of the Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA). History =1980s: Kaught at the Kampus and the origins of Reekus= The creation of Reekus Records originated from Kaught at the Kampus, a vehicle for local Cork bands, whose central aim was to give support slots to acts at the Downtown Kampus, a club night in the Arcadia Ballroom. Kaught at the Kampus included tracks by Nun Attax, Microdisney, Mean Features and Urban Blitz. The album had been recorded on 30 August 1980.McCarthy, Tony. \\"U2 Agus An Arc\\".

Notable releases during this period include The Blades' double A-side single, \\"The Bride Wore White\\" / \\"Animation\\" in 1982 (in the Hotpress National Poll, \\"The Bride Wore White\\" was voted best single of the year) and The Last Man In Europe. =2000s= In 2001, the label released the solo album from The Blades' songwriter and frontman Paul Cleary, entitled Crooked Town. This was followed by re-releases of The Blades' albums Raytown Revisited and The Last Man In Europe on CD format. John Peel favourites, The Moondogs released Red Fish in 2003 (their first album in over twenty years), and in 2002 and 2007 respectively, Reekus released California and Canyon Songs, albums by Sligo-born songwriter Perry Blake. Several new bands were added to the label's roster in this period: in October 2003, Saville released Somnambular Ballads, which led Hotpress to call them \\"one of the nation's favourite bands\\"; in 2005, Amber and Green by David Hopkins was released through Reekus; it was given 4.5/5 in Hotpress and made album of the week on the Larry Gogan Show on RT√â 2fm.

Other well-received releases include Kaeleidoscope by Carosel, Blood Is Not Enough by Myp Et Jeep, Cash Is King by Mocrac, and Charm Offensive by The Radio, amongst many other albums, EPs and singles. In 2003 Reekus moved into print with the publication of It Makes You Want To Spit - The Definitive Guide to Punk in Ulster. Because of the few venues and even fewer gigs around at the time of the Northern Irish Troubles, music fans embraced a punk, DIY aesthetic. The book was originally an 84-page fanzine, compiled and rewritten by Reekus Records. Celebrating its 30-year anniversary, Reekus Records released the compilation Too Late To Stop Now in 2012. 2010s In 2010 Reekus released the debut album from up-and-coming Dublin folk rockers Sweet Jane, Sugar For My Soul, which was called \\"beautiful... a cohesive record, one of intriguing atmosphere and stunning depth.\\" The band have since changed their name to their current moniker Buffalo Sunn.

Causes  The rapid expansion of the Chalukya Empire had resulted in the Chalukya annexation of the Vishnukundin kingdom. The Vishnukundins were allies of the Pallavas of Kanchi who were emerging as a major power in the 6th century AD. This embittered the Pallavas against them and a large number of battles were fought.Dikshit, p 93  Events  In about 617‚Äì18, Pulakesin II invaded and annexed Vengi.Dikshit, p 94 After his success against Vengi, he proceeded southwards and confining the Pallavas to the area around Kanchi. The Pallava king Mahendravarman I met Pulakesin at the town of Pullalur or Pollilur, about nine miles north of Kanchi. In the ensuing battle, Mahendravarman is believed to have suffered defeat. The Aihole inscription of Pulakesin II gives a detailed description of the battle The Kasakudi plates state While Mahendravarman's enemies are not mentioned by name, some historians interpret this edit as a description of Pallava victory over the Chalukyas. However, others feel that a Pallava victory might have been improbable as there are evidences of the Chalukya army's incursions as far south as the Chera, Chola and Pandya countries.  Aftermath  Following the victory, Pulakesin attacked Kanchi but unable to penetrate the defences of the Pallava capital, he proceeded southwards and ravaged the northern and central parts of Tamil Nadu intruding as far as the Kaveri River. Then, after accepting the submission of Chera, Chola and Pandya kings, Pulakesin II returned to Vatapi.

The line runs from Frose via Gernrode to Quedlinburg. It was closed in 2004. The Gernrode‚ÄìQuedlinburg section was subsequently converted by the Harz Narrow Gauge Railway Company to metre gauge. Since 26 June 2006 the line has been re- opened as part of the Selke Valley Railway.  History  On 28 July 1864 the Magdeburg‚ÄìHalberstadt Railway Company (Magdeburg-Halberst√§dter Eisenbahngesellschaft, MHE) received the approval of the Duchy of Anhalt to buy the C√∂then-Bernburg Railway (C√∂then-Bernburger Eisenbahn) and the concession to build the Halberstadt‚ÄìAschersleben‚ÄìBernburg‚ÄìHalle line. The terms of the concession included the requirement to build a branch line from Frose to Ballenstedt to the summer residence of the dukes of Anhalt. In 1865, work began on the line from Frose to Ballenstedt, which were, however, soon delayed because the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. The line from Frose to Ballenstedt Schlo√ü (Ballenstedt Castle station, later renamed Ballenstedt West) was formally opened on 7 January 1868. The line was classified as a Nebenbahn (branch line) in 1878. The extension to Quedlinburg was opened on 1 July 1885. As a result of the building of the line, plans for the development of railways in the eastern Harz could be realised some years earlier than would have been otherwise possible. In 1887, the narrow-gauge Selke Valley Railway (Selketalbahn) was put into operation; this connected Gernrode to the standard gauge line from Frose. Because of the tight curve radii, Rollbock or transporter wagons could not be used on the narrow gauge railway and freight had to be reloaded in Gernrode. = Since the Second World War = The Frose‚ÄìQuedlinburg line was also affected in 1951 by orders to canabalise track superstructure for the Berlin outer ring (Berliner Au√üenring). In addition to the dismantling of sidings, the existing S49 profile rails were replaced by weaker S33 profile rails, some taken from the partly closed Windberg Railway (Windbergbahn) in Saxony. As a result, the allowable axle weights and the line speed had to be reduced, resulting in extended travel times. Freight traffic was discontinued in sections. No freight trains ran between Gernrode and Frose from 1 January 1998 and between Quedlinburg and Gernrode from 10 June 2001. The route was used for regular rail passenger services until 2003. The 2003 annual timetable listed a total of eight daily train pairs on the Quedlinburg‚ÄìAschersleben route under KBS 332: Quedlinburg‚ÄìGernrode‚ÄìAschersleben. This route required these trains to reverse in Frose station. Other trains on weekdays provided extra services between Quedlinburg and Ballenstedt Ost to provide hourly services.Deutsche Bahn timetable ‚Äì valid from 15 December 2002 to 13 December 2003 The Ballenstedt Ost signal box was severely damaged by arson on 28 June 2003. Deutsche Bahn made no attempt to repair it, despite requests from the affected districts. Instead, rail replacement buses were operated between Ermsleben and Gernrode. At the same time, preparations began for the closure of the line. Operations between Aschersleben and Ermsleben was discontinued after 13 December 2003 and the last train ran between Gernrode and Quedlinburg on 31 January 2004. Traffic on the railway line between Quedlinburg and Aschersleben was formally abandoned by the state on 31 December 2004, while the parallel bus service had been increased in the meantime. The Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahnbundesamt) approved the closure of the Frose‚ÄìGernrode section on 15 June 2004 and it was formalised on 31 July 2004. At some level crossings (including on the L85, at the Roseburg and most recently in June 2012 in Ballenstedt and Ermsleben), the rails have been removed and the crossings has been paved. Almost all tracks between Gernrode and Ballenstedt were removed in 2016. There is a plan to build a bike path along the route. = Conversion of the Quedlinburg‚ÄìGernrode section = Since 1990 there had been plans to install dual gauge track between Gernrode and Quedlinburg, which however failed for a long time due to the lack of financial support from the state and Deutsche Bahn. After the Harz Narrow Gauge Railway bought this section of the line, it established its own financing for the conversion of the line to metre gauge and the renovation of all level crossings. The state of Saxony-Anhalt provided funds worth a total of ‚Ç¨6.5 million for the project. The construction began on 18 April 2005. The converted track was approved for use by the railway supervisory authority of Saxony-Anhalt on 17 February 2006. It was opened on 4 March 2006 with a festive event with special trains. Since various remaining works had to be carried out, only a few special trains operated until the start of scheduled passenger traffic on 26 June 2006. The 2017 timetable shows six pairs of trains a day between Gernrode and Quedlinburg, two of which are hauled by locomotives.  Name  The line was popularly called the Balkan, apparently a modification of Balkan Express, a name used mockingly for several railway lines in Germany.  Stations = Bad Suderode = The airfield of Quarmbeck, which had been used since 1927, was rebuilt in 1934 as the German Air Force base of R√∂mergraben. A three-kilometre connecting track was built from Bad Suderode station. This ran parallel to the track to Quedlinburg until shortly before the halt of Quedlinburg-Quarmbeck, where it curved to the right to the barracks area. = Quedlinburg-Quarmbeck = The halt, located next to state route 239 (Quedlinburg‚ÄìBad Suderode), was opened on 2 October 1936 under the name of R√∂mergraben. = Quedlinburg = Quedlinburg station was opened in 1863 as a through station. Its track 3 had, before the conversion to metre-gauge, a connection towards Halberstadt. A bypass track now allows locomotives to run around. The Blankenburg‚ÄìQuedlinburg railway (known as the Qu√§ke) operated passenger services from track 1 West from 1908 to 1969 via Thale-Bodetal to Blankenburg (Harz).

The opposing forces met at Poimanenon, south of Cyzicus in Mysia, near Lake Ku≈ü. Background and battle Since the Treaty of Nymphaeum in 1214, the Latin Empire had controlled the northwestern littoral of Asia Minor, from Nicomedia to Adramyttium, as well as the Mysian plain. In November 1221, the energetic founder of the Nicaean Empire, Theodore I Laskaris, died, and was succeeded by his son-in-law, John III Doukas Vatatzes, who had emerged as the victor out of the civil strife that had commenced since the death of Theodore I Laskaris. The succession was disputed by Theodore's brothers, the sebastokratores Alexios Laskaris and Isaac Laskaris, who rose up in revolt and requested the aid of the Latin emperor, Robert of Courtenay. At the head of a Latin army, they marched against Vatatzes. The two armies met at Poimanenon, near a church dedicated to the Archangel Michael. In the ensuing battle, Vatatzes achieved a decisive victory; among the captives taken were the two Laskaris brothers, who were blinded. Aftermath Summing up the importance of this battle, the 13th-century Byzantine historian George Akropolites wrote that \\"Since then (this battle), the state of the Italians [the Latin Empire] ... began to decline\\". The news about the defeat at Poimanenon caused panic in the Latin imperial army besieging Serres from the Despotate of Epirus, which withdrew in chaos in the direction of Constantinople and was therefore defeated decisively by the troops of the Epirote ruler, Theodore Komnenos Doukas. This victory opened up the way for the recovery of most of the Latin possessions in Asia. Threatened both by Nicaea in Asia and Epirus in Europe, the Latin emperor sued for peace, which was concluded in 1225. According to its terms, the Latins abandoned all their Asian possessions except for the eastern shore of the Bosporus and the city of Nicomedia with the surrounding region.

Design and development The WM-21 was designed to replace the WM-16, which was based on the yet older Fokker C.V, and as such was considered unsuitable for operational service. The WM-21's structure was strengthened, and the aircraft received a new, more efficient wing set. A tailskid was fitted to allow for shorter landing runs on grass airfields. A conventional biplane, the S√≥lyom was powered by a Weiss WM-K-14A radial engine, and had an open cockpit. A total of 128 aircraft were built by three different factories: 25 by Manfred Weiss, 43 by MAVAG, and 60 by MWG. Operational history A WM-21 S√≥lyom in service Throughout the war, the Royal Hungarian Air Force used 48 of them for reconnaissance. They served alongside 38 Heinkel He 46s, and 37 IMAM Ro.37s, supplemented by 13 Heinkel He 111s. They first entered service in 1939 with short-range reconnaissance units. Although they were active during the 1940 dispute with Romania, their first active operational use was during the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941.

The New York Times has described him as \\"known for his crusading reports about political abuses in Belarus\\" and \\"a thorn in the side of Lukashenko's autocratic government\\". He was awarded the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Award in 1999 and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Prize for Journalism and Democracy in 2002. Pavel Sheremet died in Kyiv on 20 July 2016 in a car explosion. The Ukrainian Prosecutor's Office stated in July 2016 that the explosion was caused by a bomb and labelled the death of Sheremet a murder. Biography =Early career= From 1994 to April 1995, Sheremet was the anchor and producer of Prospekt, a weekly news and analysis program on Belarus state television. The program was banned by Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko one week before a referendum to increase the president's powers. Sheremet then became editor-in-chief of the Belarusian newspaper Belorusskaya Delovaya Gazeta. The same year, he also began working for the Russian public television company ORT, and was named its Minsk bureau chief in 1996. Because of increasing control of Belarusian media by the Lukashenko government, Russian television was often the primary resource of Belarusian citizens for alternative news. =Border-crossing incident= On 22 July 1997, Sheremet, along with an ORT cameraman and their drivers, filmed himself crossing illegally from Belarus to Lithuania and back again to show the ease with which smugglers could cross the border. Lukashenko's government was in the midst of an anti-smuggling initiative, and had only recently ordered new troops to the borders. Sheremet and his companions were detained by a border patrol after jumping a fence to film unguarded areas. Sheremet and one crew member, Dmitry Zavadsky, were later charged with illegal border crossing, \\"exceeding their professional rights as journalists\\", and participating in a conspiracy. Russian authorities protested the arrests, which led to what BBC News called a \\"public row\\" between the two nations. Yeltsin canceled a planned trip for Lukashenko to visit Moscow after he was already on his way; his plane was denied entry into Russian airspace. On 18 January 1998, Sheremet and Zavadsky were sentenced to two years' imprisonment and 18 months' imprisonment, respectively, but given suspended sentences and a \\"nominal\\" fine of US$15. =Further journalistic career= In November 1997, Sheremet was one of the signatories of Charter Ninety-Seven, a pro-democracy manifesto demanding an end to \\"the infringement of basic human rights and liberties by the administration of President Alexander Lukashenko\\". Sheremet also acted as the movement's spokesman. In 1999, he conducted a rare television interview with Naina Yeltsina, which The New York Times criticized as \\"indulgent\\" and \\"[doing] its best to present Mrs. Yeltsin in a sympathetic light\\"; Sheremet's station ORT was largely controlled by oligarch Boris A. Berezovsky, a Yeltsin ally. Sheremet's partner and former co-defendant Dmitry Zavadsky disappeared on 7 July 2000, failing to arrive for a meeting at the Minsk airport with Sheremet. Sheremet accused the Belarusian authorities of having arranged his forced disappearance in retaliation for his reporting, later alleging that he had been informed of government \\"death squads\\" by former Belarusian General Prosecutor Oleg Bazhelko. Zavadsky was declared legally dead in 2003. In 2012 Sheremet started working at the Internet newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda (Ukrainian Truth), where he launched a journalistis blog. In 2015 he led a programme Ukrainian radio programme , first on weekends in the program \\"Show of Pavel Sheremet¬ª,\\"Show of Pavel Sheremet\\", 20 September 2015 and then on weekdays in the \\"Morning of Pavel Sheremet\\".\\"Morning of Pavel Sheremet\\" on Radio \\"Visti\\" last broadcast, 19 July 2016 Sheremet resigned from the Public Television of Russia (OTR) in July 2014, saying that journalists who didn't follow the \\"style of Kremlin propaganda\\" while covering the ongoing crisis in Ukraine were \\"hounded\\".

History East Front of the U.S. Capitol showing Rogers's Columbus Doors (center, at top of stairs), after 1871 installation. Rogers, an expatriate American artist trained and living in Italy, was a Neoclassical sculptor noted for his carved works in marble. He visited the United States in 1855, and was awarded the commission for the doors. He had never done anything on this scale, and was not known for working in bronze. Rogers's sculptural theme was Scenes from the Life of Columbus. Each door has four panels illustrating significant events, and the semi-circular transom above the pair illustrates Columbus landing in the New World. The border surrounding the doors and transom is adorned with statuettes of figures who participated in the Columbus story and nautical items such as anchors and rudders. Figures around the outer rim represent Asia, Africa, Europe and America. Between 1856 and 1858, Rogers modeled the doors first in clay, then in plaster. They were cast in bronze at the Royal Bavarian Foundry in Munich, Germany, from 1860 to 1861. Because of delays in transportation related to the American Civil War, they did not arrive in the United States until 1863. They were installed on the East Front in 1871.Architect of the Capitol Webpage With transom, the doors are 16 ft 8 in tall, and 9 ft 9 in wide. They weigh approximately 20,000 pounds (10 tons).

Born in Islington, London,Alan Clark, Dictionary of British Comic Artists, Writers and Editors, The British Library, 1998, pp. 107-108 on 10 October 1914, he joined the Amalgamated Press as an editorial assistantGeorge Beal, Obituary: Leonard Matthews, The Independent, 5 December 1997 in 1939, starting as a sub-editor on the weekly comic Knockout under editor Percy Clarke. Matthews persuaded cartoonist Hugh McNeill, then working for rival DC Thomson's comics The Beano and The Dandy, to go freelance and work for AP. McNeill contributed \\"Deed-a- Day Danny\\" and \\"Simon the Simple Sleuth\\" to Knockout's initial lineup, and remained a mainstay of AP's comics for the rest of his life;Norman Wright and David Ashford, Masters of Fun and Thrills: The British Comic Artists Vol 1, Norman Wright (pub.), 2008, pp. 89-102 he and Matthews remained friends until McNeill died in 1969. Matthews served in the RAF during the Second World War, and also compiled training manuals for the Air Ministry in London. He volunteered as a fire lookout, and saved AP's offices at Fleetway House from burning down during an air raid. After the war he returned to Knockout, becoming editor in 1948. He featured more adventure strips, including adaptations of classic adventure novels, scripting some of them, including The Three Musketeers, drawn by Eric Parker. He wrote pirate strip \\"Captain Flame\\" for artist Sep E. Scott,Norman Wright and David Ashford, Masters of Fun and Thrills: The British Comic Artists Vol 1, Norman Wright (pub.), 2008, pp. 170-180 and Dick Turpin serials for H. M. Brock and D. C. Eyles. He was also an artist, drawing strips like \\"Daffy the Cowboy Tec\\" for Knockout.Denis Gifford, Encyclopedia of Comic Characters, Longman, 1987, p. 57 In 1949 he became editor of a second comic, Sun, acquired by AP from rival publisher J. B. Allen. Again, he increased the adventure content, hiring Geoff Campion to draw \\"Billy the Kid\\", and introducing new characters like Max Bravo and Battler Britton. In 1950 he launched Cowboy Comics, a digest-sized series repackaging western comics originated for the Australian market,Norman Wright and David Ashford, Masters of Fun and Thrills: The British Comic Artists Vol 1, Norman Wright (pub.), 2008, pp. 8-9 and later became editor of Thriller Comics, which published historical adventure stories in the same format. He scripted several of them, including adaptations of Lorna Doone and Quentin Durward. In the 1950s he became Managing Editor of AP's comics, including the girls' and nursery titles as well as the boys' titles. In 1958 AP was bought by the Mirror Group and renamed Fleetway Publications, and in 1961 Matthews was named Director of Juvenile Publications, and launched several new titles, including Princess, Buster and War Picture Library. In 1962 he launched Look and Learn, a lavishly illustrated weekly magazine inspired by the Italian magazines Conoscere and La Vita Meravigliosa, and in 1965 launched Ranger, which combined educational features with comic strips, such as \\"Rob Riley\\" and the highly regarded \\"Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire\\". Whilst Mike Butterworth is credited as the author of the\\"Trigan Empire\\" it was Leonard Matthews who initiated the original concept, as Mike Butterworth explained, \\"The original Impetus was from that veritable genius Leonard Matthews, then my senior group editor when I was editing \\"Sun‚Äù and ‚ÄúComet\\". He threw the first introductory script at me and told me to take it from there. He had no idea where to further it but he knew where to look for a guy who did.....\\" . He left Fleetway at the end of 1968 to set up his own company,Brief history of Look and Learn Martspress, packaging comics and juvenile publications like Once Upon a Time for City Magazines. A small man, Matthews liked to have tall men working for him.

It was founded in 1858, and is a registered charity. The Society has had various names, e.g. in the 1870s it was called the Birmingham Natural History and Microscopical Society, and from 1894 to 1963 the Birmingham Natural History and Philosophical Society. History The Society was founded in 1858. For a considerable part of its early life, it was called the Birmingham Natural History and Microscopical Society. In 1877, the Society played the lead in forming the Union of Midland Natural History Societies, which published the journal The Midland Naturalist. Some of the societies in the union later merged with the Birmingham Natural History Society. The Birmingham Philosophical Society, founded in 1876, merged in 1894, when the title of the Society was changed to the Birmingham Natural History and Philosophical Society. The Midland Malacological Society and the Birmingham Entomological Society were amalgamated in 1906 and 1908 respectively.Proceedings of the Birmingham Natural History and Philosophical Society 15(1), 1921‚Äì1922, cover page The society's activities were greatly reduced by world war one but activity had picked up again by 1920. In 1924 the society carried out an extensive survey of Hartlebury Common. The Society rooms suffered bomb damage on October 25, 1940 and as a result the society suspended its activities for the remainder of hostilities. The society began to meet again in 1945 and restarted publication of its proceedings in 1950. The current title of the Society was first used in its Proceedings in 1964.Proceedings of the Birmingham Natural History Society 20(3), 1964, cover page Important early members of the society included the botanist James Eustace Bagnall (1830-1918), who produced the first Flora of Sutton Park (now a national nature reserve) and later the first Flora of Warwickshire. Activities The society was responsible for the designation of Edgbaston Pool as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and until 2012 was formally involved in its management. The society operates a library for its members, and holds regular meetings (at the Friends Meeting House in Selly Oak, ), field trips and training sessions. It publishes a journal, Proceedings of the Birmingham Natural History Society (ISSN 0144-1477). First published in 1870, the journal currently appears in four parts to a volume; parts have appeared a different intervals over time, e.g. each part of Volume 15 covered two calendar years whereas each part of Volume 29 covered three.Cover pages of the relevant volumes: Proceedings of the Birmingham Natural History and Philosophical Society 15(1) 1921-1922 and Proceedings of the Birmingham Natural History Society 29(1) 2008‚Äì2010 As of 2012, the hon. secretary is Dr Peter Jarvis.

Development and design The prototype Fazan flew in 1941 as a shoulder-wing monoplane powered by a Alfa Romeo 126 R.C.34 radial engine. It had a fixed conventional landing gear with a tailwheel. Flight testing of the prototype showed that the aircraft was unstable and was nose-heavy in level flight, and was considered unsafe during forced-landings. By analogy with the Hunchback of Notre-Dame, the prototype gaining the unflattering nickname \\"Quasimodo\\".Bern√°d 2001, p. 16. The second prototype was redesigned with a high-wing, a revised undercarriage and new cockpit glazing, while retaining the engine and three-bladed fixed-pitch propeller of the first prototype. The revised aircraft successfully passed its flight trials, and a small batch of six similar aircraft, designated KB-11-I, followed. While this batch was being built, a further-revised version was produced, the KB-11-II. This took advantage of the availability of large quantities of PZL-license built Bristol Pegasus engines that had been captured by the Germans during the Invasion of Poland, with a Pegasus XXI driving a two-bladed wooden propeller replacing the Alfa-Romeo, while the fuselage glazing was changed again. This revised aircraft was renamed Fazan, and was followed by 43 production aircraft. Operational history The KB-11 was used to replace Letov ≈†-328s and PZL P.43 in the short-range reconnaissance squadrons of the Bulgarian Air Force, equipping four squadrons. Fazans were used in joint Bulgarian-German-Italian operations against Tito's Partisans in Serbia from 1943.Green and Swanborough 1989, p. 70. Following Bulgaria's armistice with the Soviet Union and declaration of war against Germany in September 1944, the Bulgarian Air Force was used in support of Bulgarian Army forces in Serbia and Macedonia who were fighting against their former allies. KB-11 equipped units saw only limited use in this offensive, possibly because of the aircraft's similarity to the German Henschel Hs 126.Green and Swanborough 1989, pp. 73‚Äì74.Bern√°d 2001, pp. 16‚Äì17. In 1947, 30 KB-11s were transferred to Yugoslavia as part of war reparations following the Paris Peace Treaties. They were used as trainers, liaison aircraft and target tugs. The wooden wings were replaced by metal wings by Ikarus, allowing the KB-11 to continue in service in Yugoslavia until 1958.Bern√°d 2001, p. 17.

It was named after their novelty hit of the same name. The album peaked at no 48 at the Billboard 200 chart. The album was recorded at Kay Bank Studio and rushed to the stores to capitalize on the success of the \\"Surfin' Bird\\" single, released two months earlier. According to Rick Shefchik's book Everybody's Heard about the Bird, which chronicles the band's rise and fall, both the Surfin' Bird album and the single each went on to sell over a million copies.Shefchik (2015), pp. 139‚Äì140 & p. 148 (link). Richie Unterberger of AllMusic wrote: \\"The only album released by the Trashmen during their lifetime actually outstrips most of the Southern California-based competition, due to the ferocious grit of the playing and a vaguely demented, go-for-broke recklessness.\\" __TOC__ 1964 LP release Two editions are known to have an incorrect track list on the back of the sleeve ‚Äì the track listing printed on the vinyl is correct, though.See the sleeve pictures on Discogs of this US release and this Canadian release, which show incorrect track lists. An example of an edition with a correct track list is this one. Interestingly, the erroneous track list was later used for the 1995 CD reissue (see below). The LP incorrectly credits the title track to Steve Wahrer, the band's drummer and vocalist. \\"Surfin' Bird\\" is actually a fusion of two songs by the Rivingtons: \\"The Bird's the Word\\" and \\"Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow\\". Following legal threats by the group, the song was re-attributed to all four members of the Rivingtons. \\"Kuk\\" is a song originally by the Astronauts. For reasons unknown, some copies of the album credit Rich Fifield, but not Jon Patterson, while others credit Patterson, but not Fifield.Discogs features two US editions (1, 2) that credit Jon Patterson. All the other listed version do not. The 1995 reissue has Fifield listed in the credits, not Patterson. 1995 CD reissue In 1995, the album received an official CD reissue by Sundazed Music. This release uses a different track order, and adds four extra songs.Two versions of the 1995 Sundazed reissue are known to exist: one with a red-colored CD, and one with a blue-colored CD. Aside from the color, there are no differences between the two. Sundazed re-released the CD version in 2010. A 2011 CD release in Poland, with the same track order, is also known to exist. 1990 CD compilation A label called Request Record released a CD called Surfin' Bird in 1990. The first 12 tracks of it comprise the original Surfin' Bird LP, in the same track order. The next 12 tracks are singles by the Trashmen. The last 2 tracks are \\"Cyclon\\"/\\"Sally-Jo\\", the A-side of a 1961Shefchik (2015): \\"The Travelers made their first recording in May 1961, taping two original songs in the living room of Jim Thaxter's parents' house.

A standardized breed is being developed from them; among cat fancier and breeder organizations, it is presently fully recognized by the World Cat Federation (WCF), with breeding regulated by the World Cat Congress (WCC), under the name Aphrodite's Giant; and provisionally by The International Cat Association (TICA) as the Aphrodite. All three organizations permit shorthaired and semi- longhaired versions and no out-crossing to other breeds. The earliest known written record of cats on Cyprus refers to a story of Saint Helen of Constantinople sending two boatloads of cats to a monastery on the island from Egypt or Palestine in the 4th century A.D. to deal with an infestation of snakes. Cats on Cyprus have been able to breed for centuries with comparatively little outside influence; this has resulted in a distinct, locally adapted variety of cat which appears to have developed as a feral population in the inner highlands, though is found throughout the island in modern times. While wildcats in association with humans on Cyprus date to at least 7500 B.C. ‚Äì the earliest proven association of cats with humans ‚Äì there is no known connection between those ancient tamed-wild specimens and modern domesticated Cyprus cats, despite breeder claims to the contrary. History Cyprus cat demonstrating athleticism A paper by J.-D. Vigne, et al., concluded in 2004 that the discovery of Near Eastern wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) remains in a 9,500-year-old grave in Cyprus is the oldest example to date of a cat in close association with humans. Archaeologists led by Jean Guillain working at the Neolithic site of Shillourokambos uncovered carefully interred remains of a cat alongside human remains and decorative artifacts, on an island separated from the mainland since before human habitation, thus indicating human introduction of cats to the area. \\"Examination showed that a small pit or grave had been deliberately dug out, and the body of the cat was placed in it, then rapidly covered.\\" The cat skeleton pre-dates Egyptian depictions of cats by 4,000 years or more. There is no evidence that modern cats of any variety are descended from ancient Cypriot wildcats; nevertheless both WCF and TICA have uncritically repeated breeder claims of such descent. Cyprus cats of today are more likely linked with the monastery named Saint Nicholas of the Cats (Greek , ), which was founded in the 4th century A.D.. It is located near Akrotiri. According to Byzantine legend, Helena of Constantinople (Saint Helen) shipped hundreds of cats from Egypt or Palestine to Cyprus in 328 A.D. to control venomous snakes that had infested the area around the monastery, following a drought lasting 37 years. The monastery had two bells, one to call the cats to meals and the other to send them into the fields to hunt snakes. The population of cats at the site (today a nunnery) once dwindled, but has now revived thanks to care by the resident nuns. The Nobel laureate Giorgos Seferis wrote of these cats in his poem \\"The Cats of St. Nicholas\\".The story being a legend, it is impossible to know for certain today if shiploads of cats were really sent to Cyprus in the 4th century and cats have, of course, been arriving on the island (often as ship's cats) for many centuries. The World Cat Congress is of the opinion that Cyprus cats developed over time in mountainous inner Cyprus from various populations of cats around the island and became large and bushy-haired to cope with hunting comparatively large prey like rats, big lizards and snakes in cool, wet, mountain weather, though summers there are fairly hot and dry (Both WCF and TICA note that the thickness of the coat in purebred Aphrodite cats descended from this populations still varies seasonally). The other two organizations' breed summaries are generally consistent with this view, though it is uncertain who first produced this account of their origin, or on what basis. It is unclear whether Cyprus cats are closely related to the broader Aegean cat landrace of mainland and island Greece. Genetic testing to date has shown only that the Cyprus cats are distinct enough that a breed could be developed from them.  Characteristics  Cyprus cats are somewhat thick-haired (from short-haired up to \\"semi-longhaired\\" in cat fanciers' jargon), and are an athletic and energetic variety. Feral populations are found throughout the island of Cyprus, from mountainous and cooler regions to the lower, hotter areas near the coasts, including in the cities. As such, this cat has locally adapted to different climates / seasonal change; however, it may be more associated with the mountainous areas.  Aphrodite breed development  Local breeders began in 2006 to attempt to establish a standardized breed from local feral cats. In 2008, a World Cat Federation (WCF) all-breeds judge visited Cyprus to work at a cat show and was introduced to a breeder of purebred cats developed in this trial breeding program from the Cyprus cats. Considering the cats distinct, he wrote a standard of points and named them Aphrodite Giant. The president and board members of WCF advised that these Aphrodite cats should be shown outside Cyprus to become better known within the cat fancy, but did not immediately accept the nascent breed. Subsequently, a group of interested people in Cyprus decided to form a club, which was named the Cyprus Cats National Breed Association (CyCNBA), which applied for government approval and started functioning in late 2009. CyCNBA applied to affiliate to the World Cat Federation in April 2012. In addition, it was agreed that a letter be sent to a leading specialist in cat genetics, Leslie Lyons of University of California, Davis, asking whether she would agree to DNA-test a selection of Cyprus cats to see whether it was possible to genetically define them as a breed. The professor, who intended shortly to begin a further study of Turkish Van and Turkish Angora cats (whose ancestry has long been disputed), agreed to study samples submitted from Cyprus. A total of 248 cats were studied, including a number of random-bred Cyprus cats from the Malcolm Cat Sanctuary, for comparison. \\"All cats were considered in one large analysis. The analysis partitioned the cats based solely on genetic variation, not by any other identification.\\" (L. Lyons ‚Äì 2 January 2012) The January 2012 report concluded that \\"Cyprus cats are a distinct population within the Mediterranean\\" and that a \\"breed from Cyprus could be developed\\". On 1 July 2012, the cat became a fully recognised breed of the World Cat Federation, originally as just the Aphrodite's Giant Longhair (though it is actually in the organization's semi-longhaired division,)after the CyCNBA attended the WCF General Assembly in Gelsenkirchen, Germany and applied for recognition of the cats in April 2012. Today, WCF also recognizes a short-haired variant. In September 2017, The International Cat Association (TICA) recognized the cats, under the name Aphrodite, as a \\"preliminary new breed\\", in its own breed group and with both shorthaired and semi-longhaired varieties. Some TICA members have started breeding programs for the Aphrodite in Europe, Asia, and the United States. In breeder terminology, this constitutes a natural or traditional breed ‚Äì one developed from local stock to preserve its key characteristics, rather than created by breeders to have new features. = Breed standards = The WCF standard calls for the Aphrodite's Giant to be large, strong, and muscular but not cobby, and big-boned even as kittens. The cats may be shorthaired or semi-longhaired and of any colors other than colorpoint or mink (which comes from the Burmese gene), nor with any white spots if otherwise solid-colored. \\"In bicolour, non-regular colour setting is desired.\\" The coat should be soft and wooly, and is expected to be longer and with an undercoat in winter, and always lacking any top coat except possibly on the back. In detail, WCF calls for muscular hips and shoulders; back legs slightly longer than front (a trait shared with another insular breed, the Manx); medium-long, \\"well-plumed\\" tail, commensurate with body size (and visibly tapering in the shorthaired version); a long-triangular head with straight cheeks, long and straight muzzle, \\"strong\\" chin, rounded front of the face, slightly domed forehead and \\"a very slight dip under the height of the eyes\\"; wide-based, medium-large ears, forming an open V (rather than being straight upward); and olive-shaped, oblique-set eyes of any uniform color. Weight range is not specified. WCF has set no temperament or breeding rules for this breed, and defers on breeding points instead to the World Cat Congress (WCC), which permits no out-crossing, other than between the longhaired and shorthaired varieties of the breed. Only WCC (a confederation of national and international cat federations, which does not itself issue breed standards, just breeding regulations) uses the term Aphrodite's Giant Shorthair for the latter. WCC asks that judges disqualify smaller specimens of both, to preserve the large-boned nature of the breed. Under the TICA definition, Aphrodites may be shorthaired or semi-longhaired and have any color and pattern, except they may not be colorpoint or mink and should not have a \\"locket\\" spot on the chest. The coat should be soft and lush and may seasonally vary in undercoat density (not required). They are \\"athletic, well- muscled, solid\\" and of medium to large build, but must have a gentle, non- aggressive temperament. Fully adult male weight range is ; female, , which is heavy for a female cat. On finer points, the TICA standard calls for hips and shoulders of the same width; back legs slightly longer than front; an overall long-triangular, straight-cheeked head with a squared but not flattened muzzle and slight concavity between nose and brow leading to a slightly rounded forehead; wide-based, wide-set and fairly large ears forming an open V; oblique, olive-shaped eyes of any color; a full-width chin of normal depth; medium-long, tapering tail consistent with the body and coat (and plumed in the longhaired version). Jowls are permitted in adult males. No out-crossing to other cats is permitted (though the two varieties of Aphrodite are a single breed for TICA purposes). WCF and TICA sharply conflict with each other on the cat's speed of maturity, perhaps owing to different foundation stock for their breed variants. The WCF standard says that they develop quickly, while TICA says they are comparatively slow to mature (another trait shared with the Manx), taking three to five years to reach full size. TICA's overview of the breed describes them as affectionate and social and in some ways dog-like in behavior toward their keepers.

It first appeared in 1892. Literally, it means Tour of Orissa. In reality, though, it is not a travelogue but a commentary on the state of affairs in the Orissa of that time. It has two major components. Part of it is a satirical comment on the educated class of Orissa of that time who used to imitate the lifestyle of the British. The significant part, however, is the author's tribute to eminent people of Orissa of that time such as Madhusudan Das, one of the foremost builders of modern Orissa, poet Madhusudan Rao, poet Nanda Kishore Bal and the British civil servants who did considerable work for development of Orissa and survival of Oriya language such as Thomas Edward Ravenshaw and John Beames.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974. History Courthouse c. 1911 Iron County was established in 1885, when it was split from Marquette County. At the time of Iron County's creation, Iron River, then the only incorporated village in the county, was designated the county seat. However, a bitter dispute over the location of county buildings immediately erupted between the geographically disparate east side, centered on Crystal Falls, and the west side, centered on Iron River. At one point county records were spirited away from the temporary courthouse in Iron River by men from Crystal Falls. It was eventually decided to hold a county-wide referendum on the issue. The vote was held in 1888 to decide the location of the county seat; Crystal Falls won by only 5 votes. In 1889, the question was again put before voters, and this time Crystal Falls was selected by a margin of nearly 100 votes, which settled the question. Bonds were issued for $30,000 to fund courthouse construction, and architect J. C. Clancy of Antigo, Wisconsin was engagesd to design the courthouse. It was constructed in 1890-92 by Louis A. Webber of Menasha, Wisconsin, who bid $26,470. However, Webber was unable to complete the work, and the county hired another contractor to complete the courthouse, entailing a revised total cost of about $40,000. The clocktower and statures representing Law, Mercy, and Justice were added in 1910. A wing containing offices was added to the courthouse in 1955. In 2003-04 another wing was added to the building. The project included a meticulous restoration of the original courthouse by sandblasting and repairing the brickwork. Description The Iron County Courthouse is a 2-1/2 story Richardsonian Romanesque building sitting on a hilltop overlooking Crystal Falls' business street. It is built with reddish brown brick walls with stone trim atop a rubble masonry foundation. The front facade has a conical tower on one corner and a square wooden tower topped by a belfry with hexagonal cupola on the other. A rock-face granite central archway contains the main entrance, which is approached via a stairway. Above the archway are the impressive 17-feet-high zinc statues representing Law, Mercy, and Justice. Inside is a polished oak circuit courtroom. It has an octagonal ceiling covered with decorative pressed metal and a large chandelier with muses and dragons set into the center.

It is a three-part adaptation of the 1993 novel of the same name by author Larry McMurtry and is the third installment in the Lonesome Dove series serving as a direct sequel to Lonesome Dove (1989), ignoring the events of Return to Lonesome Dove (1993). The series is set in the 1890s. The series stars James Garner as former Texas Ranger Captain Woodrow F. Call, now a bounty hunter, hired to track down Joey Garza (Alexis Cruz) who is preying on the railroad. It also features Sissy Spacek, Sam Shepard, Ned Beatty, Randy Quaid, Wes Studi, Charles Martin Smith, and George Carlin. Plot summary =Part 1= A young psychopathic Mexican bandit named Joey Garza has murdered numerous people, and cost railroad tycoon Colonel Terry significant business and money through his deadly train robberies. Captain Woodrow F. Call is a grizzled veteran of the west, a man in stark contrast to the inexperienced urban Ned Brookshire, who has been sent to Clarendon, Texas, from New York by Terry to contract Call's services in apprehending the bandit. They form an unlikely pair as they search for Garza, and soon they learn in Laredo, Texas, that he is not the only outlaw preying on the railroad. Pea Eye Parker, formerly of the Hat Creek outfit, now owns a farm in the Texas Panhandle. He is married to Lorena Wood, the former whore and lover of Gus McCrae, and now a school teacher. Pea Eye is devoted to her and their five children, and she has learned to reciprocate and become almost equally as attached to him. He is, however, increasingly pressured by his wife to settle down, so he initially declines to accompany Call and Brookshire in the hunt for Garza. His loyalty and devotion to Call finally prevails, though, and he sets out after Call, where he is soon joined by the celebrated Kickapoo tracker, Famous Shoes. The series also follows the family of 19-year-old Joey Garza. Joey's mother, Maria, is the midwife of Ojinaga, a small Mexican village on the Rio Grande. She has had a string of brief, failed marriages and has three children, of which Joey is the oldest. Joey, in possession of a Swiss sniper rifle, learns that Call is after him and having shot a gringo, hides out in Crow Town, an outlaw village deep in the borderland desert. The law arrives, and in her son's absence, Maria is taken over the river and is brutalized by the deputies there. Lorena, meanwhile, learns that a former flunky of Blue Duck, Mox Mox, is alive. Known for burning his captives alive, he was thought to have been killed years before. The news, brought by Charles Goodnight, is especially traumatic for her, since she had nearly been burnt by him while she was a captive of Blue Duck. Fearing for the lives of her children, she sends them on the train to Nebraska, to the protection of her friend Clara Allen. =Part 2= Garza continues his killing spree, returning often to his abandoned mine hideout to store his loot. Maria, now rescued from the deputies by Billy Williams, goes to Crow Town to warn her son that Call is getting closer. She still has reason to hate Call, who had her father and brothers hanged for rustling 30 horses. Call, now in Chihuahua City and also accompanied by Laredo Deputy Ted Plunkert, receives news updates by telegram of the ongoing killings and that the other killer is a past nemesis called Mox Mox. Garza, still hiding out west of the Pecos River in Crow Town, soon meets another notorious denizen‚Äîthe legendary Texas gunfighter, John Wesley Hardin. After Maria arrives to warn him, she kills the town's \\"devil pig\\" and later butchers it after Joey disappears and steals her horse. She then sets off back home, but not after inviting the town's whores to accompany her on the walk back. Mox Mox and his gang soon arrive in Crow Town looking for Garza, seeking him for the payrolls he stole and denied them, and leave after a tense stand- off with Hardin. Meanwhile, Corporal Pea Eye and Famous Shoes, unaware of the threat of Mox Mox, continue south to find Captain Call. They are thrown into the Presidio jail when the sheriff accuses Famous Shoes of being a horse thief and decides to hang him. Captain Call, arriving in Ojinaga, hears of their plight and crosses the river to free them from jail, near-killing the sheriff after he refuses to allow their release on order of the governor. He then continues in pursuit of Mox Mox. He ambushes the gang alone just as they are about to burn Jasper Fant's children alive, killing all but two - Quick Jimmy, a renegade Cherokee, who escapes unscathed, and Mox Mox himself, who soon dies. Meanwhile, Lorena, in search of Pea Eye, arrives in Laredo, and Garza rides off to Langtry, Texas, where he shoots and hangs Judge Roy Bean. =Part 3= Call accompanies the children back to Fort Stockton, Texas, just as Lorena arrives in town. They then head off together to find the posse, but Garza shoots Call twice after he rides out to check on three nearby horses. Severely wounded, and unable to make it back to town in time, he asks Lorena to amputate his right leg. This done, they finally end up back in Maria's house in Ojinaga. On the trail, Deputy Plunkert receives news of his wife's suicide and rides off for Laredo, but is soon killed and stripped by bandits. Call's remaining posse is then ambushed by Garza, who shoots the horses and steals their provisions. Brookshire, despairing of the situation, decides to face Garza, but is shot dead in cold blood. In the morning, Famous Shoes returns and asks Pea Eye for his boots, since Garza feels he will not be followed without them. Pea Eye, however, has him scout where Brookshire's shotgun is, and despite being wounded, manages to spray Garza with buckshot. Garza then drags himself back to his native village and attempts to kill his younger siblings. Maria tries to stop him, but he stabs her. The butcher then mortally wounds him. Lorena and Bill return with Pea Eye just as Maria dies from her wounds. At her request, Pea Eye and Lorena adopt Maria's two surviving children, and return with them to their farm. Call, crippled and no longer able to pursue bandits, goes to live with them, and becomes increasingly attached to Teresa, Maria's blind daughter, demonstrating for the first time an attachment to anyone besides Gus McCrae.

Historical inaccuracies Roy Bean was not shot and hanged on his front porch, but actually died in his sleep, possibly due to alcohol poisoning in 1903, a decade after the events of the series. The depiction of the character holding court in his saloon and being a hanging judge is based on legend. John Wesley Hardin is depicted as an outspoken drunk, always hanging out in the Crow Town bar. In actuality, he was arrested for his crimes in 1877, approximately twenty years before the series' setting, and served a 17-year sentence until 1894. After his release, he moved to El Paso, Texas where he was shot and killed the following year by John Selman. Home media It was released in Region 1 on DVD on April 24, 2001.

The mission secured the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act, which was rejected by the Philippine Legislature and Manuel Quezon. History The OsRox Mission was the 9th mission in a series of missions lasting from 1919 to 1933. While the previous missions gave good impressions the Filipinos in the minds of Americans, they were marked by misunderstandings among Filipino leaders. The Americans had mixed opinions on whether to give the Philippines independence; some political leaders in the US thought that giving the Philippines independence would result in them losing their power in business. Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act The OsRox Mission stayed in the US the longest and secured the passage of the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act. It would establish the Philippine Commonwealth as a transition government for 12 years before receiving independence on July 4, 1946.Halili, p.186. It separated the Philippine Legislature in two \\"camps\\", the Antis and the Pros. The Pros were led by Osme√±a and Roxas, who supported the act as they believed it was the best one they could get out of the US Congress. Senate President Manuel Quezon led the Antis and objected the act due to its \\"objectionable features\\". He also believed that the act did not truly grant the Philippines independence. Aside from granting the Philippines independence, the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act also reserved military bases from the US and let American goods into the country for free. These provisions were seen as controversial. The Philippine Legislature ended up rejecting the OsRox Mission's work for the following reasons: #The provisions affecting the trade relations between the United States and the Philippines would seriously imperil the economic, social and political institutions of the country and might defeat the avowed purpose to secure independence for the Philippines at the end of the transition period. #The immigration clause was objectionable and offensive to the Filipino people. #The powers of the High Commissioner were too indefinite. #The military, naval and other reservations provided for in the act were inconsistent with true independence, violated dignity and were subject to misunderstanding. Aftermath In November 1933, Quezon embarked on the last Independence Mission to the US to try to secure a better independence bill for the Philippines.Halili, p. 187. He was not as successful as Osme√±a and Roxas, as the result of the mission was a near copy of the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act called the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act. It removed the provision of military reservations in the Philippines and substituted another for ‚Äúultimate settlement as to naval bases and fueling stations.\\" It was passed by US President Franklin Roosevelt and was unanimously passed by the Philippine Legislature.

Including the books Shiver, Linger and Forever all set in the fictional Minnesota town of Mercy Falls, which is close to the real town Ely. Main characters =Grace Brisbane= Grace Brisbane was taken from her backyard tire swing and attacked by the wolves behind her house when she was 11. When she is saved from them by a yellowed-eyed wolf, Sam, she begins to feel a deep connection with him, often referring to him as \\"Her Wolf\\", and spending much of the winter months looking out for him. In Shiver they meet after Sam is shot by Tom Culpeper during a hunt of the wolves following Jack Culpeper's \\"death\\", and begin a strange yet touching relationship. However, in Linger it is not Sam's humanity that is in jeopardy but Grace's, as she comes down with an unknown illness and almost dies. She is re-bitten by Cole and shifts at the end of Linger. In Forever, Grace tries to make her way back to Sam, but in her wolf form and with the ever present worry of shifting, it becomes hard. Eventually, after a run in with a sinkhole, that Shelby chased her into, Cole and Sam had to drag her out of before she drowned, she and Sam are re-united. And as the wolves are hunted by Isabel's father, she risks losing not only her friends but her life. She helps Sam lead the pack to the new peninsula, with help from Cole and Isabel. She completed high school after the wolf hunt through summer school. She has dark blonde hair and brown eyes, described as a dark brown. almost black. She has a keen interest in maths. She expresses the view that she has raised herself because her parents were barely ever home. =Samuel Roth= Samuel Kerr \\"Sam\\" Roth was bitten by Beck, who needed young blood to keep the wolf pack going, when he was only 7 as he waited for his school bus, before Shiver. Sam was raised in Duluth. After his parents tried to kill him by holding him down in a bath and cutting both his wrists, he was adopted by Beck, age 8. Both his parents got life sentences for the attempted murder of their son. After Grace is pulled off her tire swing and almost killed by the wolves, Sam saves her by shifting and carrying her home. When the wolves are hunted, after the \\"death\\" of Jack Culpeper, and he is shot, Grace finds him, naked, on her back porch and they start a relationship. When they both discover that by injecting meningitis into their system, and inducing a fever, shifting will be stopped, Sam and Jack volunteer to be injected. Jack later dies and after Sam shifts halfway through the injection, Grace assumes that he has died too. He did survive and they are reunited at the end of Shiver. During Linger Sam has to come to terms that he is now fully human. And when an increasingly sick Grace calls out in her sleep, her parents find out Sam has spent the night, and Lewis forbids her from seeing her again, ground her and Amy drives to the hospital. Leaving Sam alone, with the knowledge that something is wrong with Grace, but not knowing what. He then spends his nights alone in Beck's house with only new werewolf Cole and 11 years worth of memories. His birthday falls during the events in Linger ‚Äì his birthday falling in March. Grace presents him with studio time in a local Duluth recording studio 'Anarchy Incorporated'. He loses Grace at the end of Linger when she was re-infected with the wolf toxen by Cole, to save her from dying, and shifts, running into Boundary Wood. In Forever, when the wolves are under threat, Sam is injected by Cole so he can shift and lead the wolves out of boundary wood and to the peninsula Officer Koenig gave them. He prefers tea to coffee. He has a strong passion for guitar and song-writing, often coming up with lyrics during key scenes in the book. He has black hair, an \\"interesting shaped nose\\" and wolfish yellow eyes. =Isabel Culpeper= Isabel Rosemary Culpeper was the sister of Jack Culpeper until he died in \\"Shiver\\". She and her family were originally from California, but moved to Minnesota when Isabel was 14, before the books started. She found out about the wolves after Jack, whom the town believed to be dead, came to her. She was later told the whole story by Sam and Grace. It was because of Isabel that they were able to get meningitis infected blood from her mother's clinic. Isabel stays with Jack as he is slowly killed by the meningitis, and blames herself for his death. She and Cole have an on-off sort of relationship throughout the trilogy, which started when Isabel found him walking around her house naked. After Linger and before Forever we are told that Cole left more than twenty voicemails on Isabel's phone, none of which she picked up on. And at the start of Forever, after she saves Cole's life she immediately leaves when he begins to speak to her. During the course of Forever they grow back together, and Isabel helps him break into the health clinic, so he won't break into the high school, so he can find a microscope and test his blood. At the end of Forever, Isabel is heart broken when she assumes Cole has been killed, and cries with relief when he phones her in the second last chapter. Isabel was sent back to California, to her grandparents', by her parents after she interrupted the hunt to help the wolves escape. She is a highly sarcastic person, and is described as 'cold' and as an 'Ice Princess' by other characters. When she lived in California she attended Santa Maria Academy, where her best friend was Isabel D. whom Isabel describes as a 'bitch', but it is clear she misses her old life. She has long blonde hair in Shiver which she cuts before the start of Linger, and blue eyes. =Cole St. Clair= Cole St. Clair was bitten and infected along with two others, his friend and bandmate Victor being one of them, while touring for NARKOTIKA, his band, in Canada by Beck and Salem. He was introduced in Linger. He is originally from Phoenix in New York State where he lived with his scientist father. He expressed his love for his Mustang, and that it was the only thing he truly missed from his life before being a wolf. In Forever Isabel gives him a small die cast black Mustang. After becoming a wolf he quit the band, of which he was lead vocalist, keyboardist and frontman. He was known to have led a troubled life, experimenting with drugs, of which his track marks are proof, and sleeping with his female fans whilst on tour. He dated Angie Baranova, Victor's sister, before the books, but after admitting he had slept with fans whilst on tour she left him. His, and Victor's, celebrity identity remained a secret to Isabel, Grace and Sam for the majority of Linger, but after he and Isabel were approached by a trio of Cole's fans, he had to explain himself. Likewise, Sam and Grace found out about him whilst they were visiting a recording studio in Duluth where Sam saw a magazine cover on display with NARKOTIKA featured. In Forever he frequently injects himself as a way of finding a real cure for shifting. After breaking into the health clinic and checking his blood under a microscope, he comes to the conclusion that, like malaria, there is no cure to shifting into a wolf, only prevention and treatment to reduce the symptoms (shifting). He was able to catch Beck and make him shift so he, Sam and Grace could ask Beck how he moved the wolves from Wyoming to Minnesota. After being told that Hannah, with guidance from Derek, was able to keep human thoughts while in her wolf body, Cole attempted to do the same. Eventually he realised he could not, but that Sam could, so they both decided Sam would have to shift and lead the wolves out, when Cole would travel beside them and send him picture messages to guide him. During the discussion with Beck, Cole stated he would buy the peninsula from Koenig, telling him that it was the least he could do for the pack. He was almost killed in Forever by Shelby, being so badly injured that the other characters, including Isabel, had assumed him dead, but survived. He calls Isabel, in California, from Beck's house in the final chapters of Forever to let her know he is alive. He is described as having brown hair and green eyes. =Shelby= Shelby is a troubled werewolf who was taken in by the pack after Beck found and took her from a place that was never named, but it is assumed she was sexually and physically abused there. Shelby relishes the fact that becoming a wolf lets her forget her past. Throughout the trilogy, Sam states that what Shelby wanted most was for Sam to take over from Paul as alpha, when she would then be his mate. She attempts to kill Grace in Shiver to achieve this goal of hers, she fails when Sam steps in. During her attack on Grace, Lewis Brisbane shoots her. Grace thought she had been killed, but in the last chapters of Shiver she is seen outside the health clinic silently watching. It is assumed that she was the one who attacked Paul, almost killing him, in Shiver, as a way of letting Sam take over as Alpha. In Forever she kills Olivia, in the prologue which she narrates. Olivia's death results in many difficult situations for Sam, including he almost being arrested for both Olivia's death, and Grace's disappearance. She also attempted to kill Grace again by chasing her through the woods after Grace shifts, she is unable to finish the task as Grace falls into a sinkhole and almost drowns. She is killed by Cole during the final scenes in Forever. She is close in age to Sam and is said to have white-blonde hair, and white fur in her wolf form. We are told that she has a strong southern accent. Major Human Characters *Rachel Vega is one of Grace's best friends. She is described as being hyperactive with wild light-brown hair and freckles and as being the glue that held the group, Grace, Rachel and Olivia, together. She lives with her father, step-mother and siblings. She believed that Sam had kidnapped Grace in Forever, but told him she didn't believe he killed her. She was told about the wolves by both Sam and Grace in Forever after she is picked up from school. She helps Grace and Sam keep their secret from Grace's parents, and lies to them about taking Grace with her to Norway. In truth, she was going alone and had to lie about taking Grace along to keep her from shape-shifting in front of her non-suspecting parents. She creates many nicknames for the characters in the trilogy, 'The Boy' for Sam, and 'Ice Princess', 'Tundra Queen' and 'she-of-the-pointy-boots' for Isabel, in relation to her cold-heartedness. *Amy Brisbane is Grace's mother. She is an artist and is described as absentminded, and almost always being paint splattered. Both her parents were described as giving Grace a lot of space when she was growing up, making her the independent person she is, so much so that they did not notice when Sam stayed in Grace's room at night. She is approached by Sam, after a girl's body (Olivia's) was found When Grace left, who tells her the body was not Grace's. She got a kitten to help with the loss, showing how little Grace mattered to her. Amy offers a compromise to Grace, that she completes high school and keeps in touch with them while they let her see Sam. *Lewis Brisbane is Grace's father. He joined Isabel's father in the first wolf hunt in Shiver, after Jack \\"died\\", which led to Grace falling out with him, as she believed he might have been the one to shoot Sam. He shot Shelby when she attacked Grace in the Brisbane's kitchen in Shiver. In Linger he bans Sam from seeing Grace, when he is found in her room after curfew. As parents, Lewis and Amy, were described by Grace as choosing when they wanted to be parents and when they wanted to be room-mates. A couple of months after Grace's wolf attack, at age 11, her father left her locked in a car on what was said to be \\"the hottest May day on record in Mercy Falls\\". *Officer William Koenig is a police officer who was introduced in Shiver. He had small parts in the first two books, but got a larger part when he was told about the wolves by Sam in Forever. He tells Sam that his father had told him stories of a University friend who had been a werewolf, and this was the reason he believed Sam about the pack. He gave a family owned peninsula to the pack, when he heard about how Tom Culpeper planned to hunt the wolves, as a way to save the pack. *Tom Culpeper is Isabel and Jack Culpeper's father. He is argumentative with his wife. He has a large collection of taxidermy, including a wolf, which Sam suspects of being one of the werewolves. He is told to be a small-town lawyer and egomaniac Tom has a strong hatred of the wolves, that stems from the fact he believes his son to be killed by them. He organises a hunt in Shiver, and another larger cull in Forever to rid Mercy Falls of them. He pays little attention to Isabel unless it suits him. Major Werewolf Characters *Geoffrey Beck known as Beck to those closest to him. He told Cole he was bitten by Paul when he was suicidal. But told Grace in Shiver he was bitten at the age of 28, while on a hiking vacation in Canada and that he had heard there were wolves in Minnesota, and guessed they were of his kind, he met Paul who then took him \\"under his wing\\". It is unknown which story is true He was Sam's adoptive father. He is a lawyer during the summer months, when he was human, he bought a house for the pack from the money he earned. His wife, Jen, died of breast cancer after Beck had been infected, it is known that he mourned for her on the day she died every year after her death. After she died, Beck became transfixed on Sam. He believed he could be a better parent, and raise Sam as his own. He was the leader of the pack when they were in their human forms. Beck shifted into a wolf permanently, leaving Sam and Cole with the responsibility of taking care of the pack. He shifted back to human shortly in Forever after Cole captured and injected him. He was told of the hunt and during the conversation said that he wanted to stay with the pack; If they died, he died, and if they lived, he lived. He was killed in Forever by Tom Culpeper during the hunt. He was 48 years old and had dark auburn hair and blue eyes. A little known fact is that, in the first draft of the novel, Beck was named Grant. His name was changed because 'Grant' was too similar to 'Grace'. *Olivia Marx was also one of Grace's best friends. She was, along with Grace, fascinated by the wolves in Mercy Falls. Grace calls her the embodiment of summer with her tanned skin and green eyes. She was bitten by Jack Culpeper in Shiver, because Jack hoped Grace would tell him the Cure to help Olivia. She had the choice to be injected with meningitis, but decided she would rather be a wolf than take the risk. She was murdered by Shelby in Forever. Sam is questioned about her death, as she was just outside Beck's property line when Shelby killed her. Her brother, John Marx, found her death hard to come to terms with and blamed Sam for her death, almost have a fist-fight with him outside a Quik-Mart before Cole stepped in. She is sometimes called Olive as a nickname by her friends. *Jack Culpeper was Isabel's brother and also a werewolf. He was bitten after he taunted the pack with a BB gun, and was so badly injured he was pronounced dead, he later healed himself and ran from the morgue. The whole of Mercy Falls mourned his death, and the high school students wore black for weeks after his \\"death\\". He is told to have clung to his old life after he left the morgue, for example walking around the parking lot of the school in his wolf form, and breaking into his parents house. He bit Olivia while in his human form, a fact that disgusted Grace when she was told. He died in Shiver when Grace injected him with bacterial meningitis in an attempt to stop him shifting. He was described as being a violent and aggressive individual, even before he was bitten. *Victor Baranova was Cole's bandmate in NARKOTIKA, in which he was drummer. He had a sister, Angie, whom Cole dated and cheated on multiple times with female fans. He was bitten, because Cole did not want to go alone, in Canada whilst on tour. He was shot by Tom Culpeper in Linger and was buried by Cole, Sam and Grace. *Ulrik is a werewolf. We are told he is from Germany, and has kept his accent even after all the years he spent in America. He taught Sam how to bake bread, and he is where Sam got his love for German poetry, especially of the poet Rilke. He drove the car that brought Beck and Paul to Duluth so they could bite and infect Sam. *Paul is a werewolf and is the leader, alpha male, when the pack is in its wolf form. He was the one who got Sam interested in guitar. He is a large black wolf. Paul held Sam down while Beck bit him in Duluth. Minor Human Characters *John Marx is Olivia's older brother. It is clear from his interactions with Grace in Shiver that he is attracted to her and calls her 'Gorgeous,', but Grace assumed that it was all just an act until the look on his face when he saw Sam and she thought it must have been more serious than she thought. After Olivia's disappearance, he became worried for her, clinging to any information from her. He blames Sam for Olivia's death, and after a run-in at a convenience store in Forever, keys Sam's car. *Karyn is Sam's employer, she owns The Crooked Shelf, the independent bookstore where Sam sometimes works. She is friendly with Beck, but doesn't know him well enough to call him by his last name, instead of his first. She becomes defensive of Sam when Officer Koenig come to take him for questioning in relation to Olivia's death, and Grace's disappearance. *Dr. Teresa Culpeper is Isabel and Jack's mother. She volunteers in a low-income health clinic twice a week in Shiver. It is known that during her education she experienced severe family problems and almost gave up. *Angie was Victor's sister before his death. She dated Cole, but left him after he told her he had slept with female fans while on tour. *Dmitra works at the studio, Anarchy Incorporated, in which Sam records a demo in Linger. Whilst at the recording studio Sam and Grace discover the true identity of Cole St. Clair. *Congressman Landy Marshall backed Tom Culpeper in the cull of the wolves in Forever. Isabel states that her mother and Mr. Marshall had had a relationship before Mrs. Culpeper met Isabel's father. *Mr. Dario and his two guard dogs moved into a house 75 acres away from Beck's house, becoming Sam's closest neighbour as he grew up. Mr. Dario owned his two pure white guard dogs to protect his antique business ‚Äì drugs. Both dogs were fitted with electric collars so they were shocked if they moved outside Mr. Dario's property, the charge was measured from a small black box that left powdery black paint on the hands of whoever touched it. Sam was so worried about the dogs that he asked Beck to teach him how to kill them, they practised breaking bones at the joint with dead chickens and watched dog fights. Later, the dogs were released by Shelby, who was spotted by Sam with the black powder on her hands, and they attacked Paul, almost killing him before Sam stepped in, killing one dog and keeping the other away from Paul before Beck ran out to shoot the other dog. *Annette and Gregory Roth are Sam's parents. They thought he was possessed by the devil and tried to kill him by cutting both his wrists with razor whilst they held him down in a bath. We are told in Linger that Sam used to scream when he heard running water during his adoption to Beck, and he could not bear the sight of a bathtub until Forever, when he finally overcame his fear. Annette was the one who originally decided that Sam shouldn't be allowed to live and later told a neighbour that her son was taking too long to die, they were both arrested. *Jen Beck was the wife of Beck. She was already a terminal cancer patient when she met Beck. She and Beck had always wanted children, but as she only had 8 months left to live after they got married, the dream was impossible. *Jackie a young female fan of Cole's, who gave him unnamed drugs. They caused Cole to pass out on the floor of the club he was performing at. It is assumed the man Cole saw during this concert was Beck, who later recruited him and Victor, to the wolf pack. *Jeremy a fellow member of NARKOTIKA with Cole and Victor. He describes himself as a 'part-time Buddhist'. Cole calls him in Forever. *Madison, Taylor and Mackenzie were friends of Isabel. She talks about Madison and Taylor in Forever when she needs an excuse to get out of the house. And leaves school with Mackenzie. *Ben owns the fish and tackle shop Grace enters on her search for a phone at the start of Forever. She phones Sam from Ben's shop but shifts before he arrives. Ben is described as has a body odor problem, and a wife whose laugh is like a dog's bark. Minor Werewolf Characters *Christa Bohlman was a werewolf Sam remembers in Shiver, though she was killed before the book began. She was a reckless person, much like Shelby, who killed two people and bit a third, Derek. Sam watched from the stairs as Christa and Beck had an argument, about the two people and Derek, which ended in Beck ordering her from the pack, and shooting her. She was later buried by Beck and Ulrik. *Derek was bitten by Christa. He was shot and killed during the hunt, in Shiver, that Tom Culpeper organised. *Salem is described multiple times as the \\"crazy, bindle wolf\\", He has a notched ear and a \\"foul, running eye\\". Sam suspects that he was the one who pulled Grace off her tire swing, and the one who, with Shelby, infected Jack Culpeper. He and Beck went to Canada to recruit new members of the wolf pack, but Salem shifted before they got back. Salem is the omega of the pack. *Unnamed Girl She was bitten by Beck in Canada with Cole and Victor. It is assumed she died as she was never mentioned again. *Hannah is a wolf made reference to in Shiver and Forever. She is mentioned in Beck's journal, and she guided the wolves out of Wyoming when they were being hunted and killed by the natural wolf population. *Melissa a werewolf mentioned once in Forever. *Derrick a werewolf mentioned once in Forever.

History In 1923, the Commonwealth acquired a site on a bend of the Swan River at Maylands for the construction of Perth's first permanent aerodrome. The Maylands aerodrome opened in 1924 and West Australian Airways immediately moved its hangar from Langley Park to the new site and commenced building another larger hangar. Other tenants included MacRobertson Miller Aviation Company, Airlines (WA) Ltd and the Royal Aero Club of Western Australia. Charles Kingsford Smith landed at Maylands to complete the first non-stop flight across Australia. On 8 August 1928, the Southern Cross took off from Point Cook near Melbourne and set course for Perth, a distance of over . Competitors in the Western Australian Centenary Air Race from Sydney to Perth finished the race at Maylands Airport on Sunday 7 October 1929. During World War II the Maylands Airfield was requisitioned by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). From February 1942, it was also used by the United States Army Air Forces for refuelling and aircraft ferrying purposes. Between 6 April 1942 and 5 August 1943, No. 35 Squadron, flying Avro Ansons, was based at Maylands to transport supplies and passengers to Allied units throughout Western Australia, as well as supporting the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Army. By the end of the 1930s, it became clear that the Maylands Aerodrome was limited in the size and speed of aircraft it was able to handle thus causing the Government to seek an alternative site for a future airport, with land being purchased at Guildford. The Perth Airport was initially used as a military airfield during the Second World War, but soon afterward it became the main airport for Perth. Maylands continued as a base for general aviation operations, but the aerodrome was too small and the circuit conflicted with nearby Perth/Guildford. By the end of the 1950s, Department of Civil Aviation decided that Maylands should be closed and ordered all the tenants to move. The Royal Aero Club of Western Australia left Maylands on 23 April 1959 and set up operations at Perth/Guildford pending the opening of the new general aviation airport at Jandakot. The opening of Jandakot Airport in 1963 allowed Maylands to be finally closed to all operations on 30 June 1963. Current The remaining corrugated iron and weatherboard buildings now lie within the bounds of land currently in use by Western Australian Police, and housed the Police Academy until 2002 when they were moved to a new facility in the suburb of Joondalup. Several of the surviving hangars from the aerodrome are included on the state's Register of Heritage Places. Some of the remaining area of the airport has now been developed as a public golf course.

Cui's body of work is largely characterized by her play with space and dimensionality, which take shape in her geometric imaginings of Chinese cityscapes. The most common subjects of her works are models of Chinese cultural landmarks of the 1980s and 1990s, such as Shanghai Bank Tower, which are either already or soon-to-be demolished. These towering structures are often surrounded by organic, swirling shapes to place them in a constant state of motion and transition, yet a 'sinofuturistic' context which both revives and reinvents their initial purposes. Biography Cui Jie was born in 1983, in Shanghai, China. In 2006, she graduated from China Academy of Art Oil Painting Department. She currently lives and works in Beijing, China. Cui Jie is represented by LEO XU PROJECTS and Mother's Tankstation, Dublin. Cui Jie is described by The Wall Street Journal as one of the youngest \\"China's Rising Art Stars.\\"The quoted article from WSJ's site She has been named one of Phaidon Press's leading painters in its publication, Vitamin P3, and she is profiled in the December/January 2015 issue of Surface Magazine. Cui's early works questioned the truth in reality through the unconventional combination of images on canvas, a multi- perspective approach which she associates with Orson Welles. Later, in groups of new paintings, she shifted her style from the previous one to the study of forms and figure-ground relationship. In these paintings, she pays much attention to and magnifies the architectural details of structures, buildings and landscape, using the idea of fragments and layers so as to convey a sense of alienation. To reach their dream-like state, her scenes employ huoshaoyun (literally, 'fire clouds') and similar non-naturalistic environments, fusing both time and space. Her classical training is reflected most apparently in her most recent exhibitions, which merge a variety of architectural styles to create fantastical, futuristic images of urban Chinese metropolises. Cui's blending of forms and emphasis on unity emerge from conceptions of the ideal in Chinese history. The theme of Chinese industry and the role of the worker, for instance, appears in her repeated subjects of government buildings, extending her works into the realm of political commentary on Mao era socialism, nationalism, and collectivist propaganda while also speaking to contemporary building practices of rapid urbanization: the razing of village and suburban communities to erect residential and commercial districts. As a result, many of her works obscure the delineation between utopian and dystopian landscapes, questioning upgrade culture and contemporary practices of cultural preservation. Cui has stated that she views architecture as \\"experiencing history just as human beings;\\" interviews quote her artistic focus as an expansion on Wassily Kandinsky's synesthetic style of painting, visualizing sound itself and other sensuous experiences as part of the urban landscape. Cui Jie's work has been attributed to influences ranging from Bauhaus, Russian Constructivism, International, Surrealism, and Japanese Metabolism aesthetics. Her art directly recalls such perspectives in the 1959 Ten Great Buildings project in Beijing which followed the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, which were based in such architectural styles to reinvent China in the vision of Mao Zedong. Cui Jie's works have been exhibited worldwide, including at The 4th Prague Biennale (2009), ‚ÄúPoetic Realism: An Reinterpretation of Jiangnan‚ÄîContemporary Art from South China‚Äù (Madrid, 2008), Notes of Conception (Beijing, 2008).

It has a similar functionality as Cisco's NX-OS or Juniper's Junos. FTOS 10 is running on Debian. As part of a re-branding strategy of Dell FTOS will be renamed to Dell Networking Operating System (DNOS) 9.x or above, while the legacy PowerConnect switches will use DNOS 6.x: see the separate article on DNOS. Hardware Abstraction Layer Three of the four product families from Dell Force10 are using the Broadcom Trident+ ASIC's, but the company doesn't use the API's from Broadcom: the developers at Force10 have written their own Hardware Abstraction Layer so that FTOS can run on different hardware platforms with minimal impact for the firmware. Currently three of the four F10 switch families are based on the Broadcom Trident+ (while the fourth‚Äîthe E-series‚Äîrun on self-developed ASIC's); and if the product developers want or need to use different hardware for new products they only need to develop a HAL for that new hardware and the same firmware can run on it. This keeps the company flexible and not dependent on a specific hardware-vendor and can use both 3rd party or self designed ASIC's and chipsets. The human interface in FTOS, that is the way network-administrators can configure and monitor their switches, is based on NetBSD, an implementation which often used in embedded networking- systems. NetBSD is a very stable, open source, OS running on many different hardware platforms. By choosing for a proven technology with extended TCP functionality built into the core of the OS it reduces time during development of new products or extending the FTOS with new features. =Modular setup= FTOS is also modular where different parts of the OS run independently from each other within one switch: if one process would fail the impact on other processes on the switch are limited. This modular setup is also taken to the hardware level in some product-lines where a routing-module has three separate CPU's: one for management, one for L2 and one for L3 processing. This same approach is also used in the newer firmware-families from Cisco like the NX-OS for the Nexus product-line or the IOS XR for the high-end routers (the Carrier Routing Systems) from Cisco. (and unlike the original IOS: processes under IOS aren't isolated from each other). This approach is regarded not only a way to make the firmware more resilient but also increases the security of the switches Capabilities All FTOS based switches offer a wide range of layer2 and layer3 protocols. All features are available on all switches: some switch models (in the S-series) offer an additional license for layer3 or routing: this additional license is NOT required to use that protocol, but only required to get support from the Dell Force10 support department on using these features. All interfaces on FTOS running switches are configured as a layer3 interface and by default shutdown. To use such an interface as an ethernet switchport you need to configure it as such (with the command \\"switchport\\") and then enable that port using \\"no shutdown\\". =Layer2 capabilities= All standardized ethernet standards are supported by switches running FTOS including: Spanning Tree Protocol and RSTP, VLAN and the IEEE 802.1Q standards, QinQ or IEEE 802.1ad, Link Layer Discovery Protocol and LLDP MED. The S-series switches ending with a V and some of the E-series line-cards support Power over Ethernet or PoE with the standards for this protocol. =Layer3 capabilities= As mentioned above, by default an interface on a switch running FTOS are configured as a layer3 port. All FTOS switches are thus routers with many interfaces that can (and most often are) reconfigured into a layer2 ethernet switch. All FTOS switches run at least the following routing protocols: Routing Information Protocol and RIP version 2, OSPF, IS-IS and Border Gateway Protocol version 4. Management Interface Switches running FTOS can only be configured using a command-line interface or CLI: FTOS doesn't offer a web-based Graphical user interface. Initial configuration is done via the console port using either a straight-through or roll-over cable (depending on model) to a terminal on 9600 bit/s and some models also support an AUX port allowing remote management via a dial-in modem. Most switches have a standard serial port or offer a USB-B port. After initial configuration access to the cli is possible via telnet and/or SSH. FTOS based switches also support SNMP and file-transfer (FTOS upgrades and startup- configuration data) can be done via FTP, TFTP or Secure copyFTOS Configuration Guide, 6 February 2008. Retrieved: 18 May 2012 Most switches running FTOS offer a dedicated management interface where the IP routing to/from the management system is not part of the internal switching or routing system. Some S-series switches only offer in-band management using a physical router interface or a VLAN interface in layer-3 mode. Open Automation Under the name OpenAutomation 2.0 Dell Networking switches running DNOS 9.x (the new brand-name for FTOS) offers a number of features under this name. These features include:Dell Force10 Open Automation 2.0, visited 29 May 2013 =Smart Scripting= Dell Force10 switches support so called smart scripting. It is possible to develop scripts that run on the switches running FTOS. Both Perl and Python are supported as scripting languages to automate environment specific repetitive tasks or to build in custom behavior. Users who write such scripts are promoted to share these scripts with the user-community and make them available to other Force10/DNOS users.Humair Ahmed offering FTOS scripts to others. Checked 10 May 2013 Force10 introduced the smart scripting in FTOS in 2010, following other vendors like Cisco for their Nexus product rangeNetworkcomputing.com: F10 enhances open automation framework with...., 9 November 2010. Visited: 29 May 2013 =Bare metal provisioning= Force10 switches support a bare metal provisioning option: if you need to deploy a number of similar switches you can put both (desired/latest) firmware release and standard user-specific configuration on a USB key: when deploying the switches you can insert the USB key, power-up the switch and it will automatically load the correct firmware and configuration. In combination with smart scripting someone can combine these features for a fully automated installation and configuration of new switches. =Virtual server networking= Part of the Open Automation platform are special features for the use of virtualization in your datacenter. Virtualization allows you to create complete (virtual) server-systems running on a standard hypervisor farm. This will create new challenges for networking in such a datacenter, support automated configuration of datacenter switches to connect newly created virtual servers. The open automation platform has several features to support thisTechnical Whitepaper: Network automation with F10 Open Automation Framework, downloaded 25 May 2013 . =Network Automation= According to Dell the move to (server and datacenter) virtualization is one of the most important developments in the IT industry. According to this vendor the industry must prevent that this path leads to getting locked-in into specific vendors due to the use of proprietary technologies.

He was born in Markneukirchen, and worked there from 1890 till his death. During that time, he made copies of Stradivari and other types of Cremonese violins. He was a student of Heberlein. He was the first of the Voigt family to settle in England (from 1885 and 1890) and some of his stringed instruments, especially his violins, were made there. He also made some fine bows for violin, cello, and viola, which can reach prices of up to ¬£3000. The tonal quality of these instruments can be rather hard, but with almost no limit to volume. The family of Voigt is largely associated with the London-based firm of that name, but it is true that the Voigt family never really gave up its German roots. This was truly a large family - the French authority Ren√© Vannes lists no less than 43 violin makers of that name. Arnold Voigt (1864 - 1952), who was a student of Heberlein, in fact spent merely 5 years in London - from 1885 to 1890. For the rest, he lived and worked in his birth city - Markneukirchen, where he also died. He was prolific in his output as violinmaker, but Henly also calls him 'an expert bow maker. Faithful representations of celebrated models worked with an artistic eye.' Arnold Voigt bows please from every perspective - it demonstrates beautiful workmanship on good material. The heads are a statement in elegance - more French than German. They bears Arnold Voigt's stamp on the shaft in the usual place, and also has the intertwined 'AV' logo embossed into the left flank of the frog, making this certainly his authentic work. In England the firm of Voigt was the great competitor for the firm of W. E. Hill & Sons - in many respects their output was very much on a par, and situates this bow well in quality.

The two facilities were established together in July, 1984. However, the museum maintains its own grounds and gardens, separate from the library. The museum houses nearly 4,000 works by both local and world famous artists. French Impressionist paintings by Claude Monet and Paul Gaugin are among the museum's collection, as are modern Japanese paintings by Sekine Shoji and Kishida Ryusei. The museum also houses works of 20th century American realism, prints, Earthenware, ceramic art, and textiles. The museum owns an important part of Ben Shahn's Lucky Dragon series, about the Daigo Fukury≈´ Maru (literally, Lucky Dragon No. 5), the Japanese fishing boat caught in the Bikini Atoll hydrogen bomb blast.  History  In May 1977, a meeting was held for citizens of the prefecture to \\"consider matters of culture.\\" In the months following this meeting, a survey on the topic was distributed throughout the prefecture. Further action was not taken until January 1978, when a report encouraging the promotion of prefectural culture was delivered to the governor. About one year later, in February of 1979, another report, this time containing a plan for the promotion of prefectural culture was delivered to the governor. Regulations regarding funding the maintenance of cultural facilities were established the following month and in June of the same year, an investigative committee with ten members was created to plan the foundation of the Fukushima Prefectural Museum of Art. Regulations regarding funding the acquisition of art were established that December. In January of 1980, the committee issued a report detailing a plan for the foundation of the museum to the governor. It was decided in February that the museum and library would be located within Fukushima City. That same month the artist Kiyoshi Sait≈ç donated 227 pieces of his own work to the prefecture. It was decided in April 1980 that the museum would be located at the former site of the Fukushima College Economics Department. The first purchases of art on behalf of the museum were decided on in May 1980 and included the painting \\"Pine Baron\\" (Japanese: Êùæ„Åº„Å£„Åè„ÇäÁî∑Áàµ) by Andrew Wyeth. Following over a year of planning, construction of the museum began in July 1982 and was completed in March 1984. The museum opened its doors to the public for the first time on July 22, 1984. In June 1995, the museum surpassed one million visitors. In April 1998, 67,125 people visited the museum for an exhibition of the work of Pablo Picasso. In September 1999, the museum's 100th exhibition was held commemorating the 100th birthday of Sekine Shoji.

Often appearing in Westerns, Mart√≠nez had roles in Jeremiah Johnson, in which he played a Crow chief, and Ulzana's Raid, which was directed by Robert Aldrich and co-starred Burt Lancaster. Mart√≠nez was often typecast in roles that stereotyped Latinos, Native Americans, and Mexicans, but he frequently changed and reworked his characters through his acting, sometimes causing tensions with a production's director. Early life Mart√≠nez was born on November 5, 1930, in Cozumel, Mexico. His oldest living sister, Guadalupe Martinez, resides in San Diego, CA. His other living sister, Elvira, resides in Glendale, CA. His interest in acting led him to study method acting under Seki Sano. Career His professional breakthrough came in the 1967 Mexican dramatic film, Pedro P√°ramo, which was directed by Carlos Velo and premiered at the Cannes Film Festival that same year. He moved to Los Angeles, California, shortly after making Pedro P√°ramo, where he worked as a professional film, television and stage actor for more than thirty years. In Jeremiah Johnson, which was set in the American West shortly after the Mexican American War, Mart√≠nez's and Robert Redford's characters come into conflict, but come to an understanding and peace in the film's silent, unspoken finale. In addition to Jeremiah Johnson and Ulzana's Raid, both released in 1972, Mart√≠nez was cast opposite Anthony Quinn and Kevin Costner in the 1990 movie, Revenge, as well as the 1993 film, The House of the Spirits. Mart√≠nez's appearance in Revenge reportedly fulfilled a longtime dream to work with Anthony Quinn, who was also originally from Mexico. Film director Lee Tamahori specifically cast Mart√≠nez in the James Bond film, Die Another Day, due to his performance in the Ulzana's Raid. Mart√≠nez was cast by Tamahori in 2001 and Die Another Day was released in 2002. Mart√≠nez often appeared in western films, television, and miniseries, such as Stones for Ibarra, Centennial, How the West Was Won, and Ishi: The Last of His Tribe in 1978. He guest-starred in Death Valley Days, Gunsmoke, Bonanza, and The High Chaparral. Mart√≠nez's guest roles in non- western series included Quincy, M.E., Northern Exposure, L.A. Law, Marcus Welby, M.D., Dynasty, Ironside, and opposite Bill Cosby in The Bill Cosby Show. On stage, Mart√≠nez was an original cast member for Zoot Suit, which broke sales records for live theater when it opened in Los Angeles in July 1978. In 1988, he co-starred in Summer and Smoke with Christine Lahti and Christopher Reeve at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles. Mart√≠nez's last film was Castingx, a 2005 Dutch movie directed by Ad Bol. Personal life He lived in semi-retirement in the Netherlands since approximately 2002 or 2003. Death Joaquin Mart√≠nez died from pancreatic cancer at his home in Everdingen, the Netherlands, on January 3, 2012, at the age of 81. He was survived by his wife, Marja Valkestijn; daughter, Jennifer; son, Christopher; stepson, Sjoerd; and his former wife, Mary Preston.

Their \\"self\\" antigens are displayed to a developing T-cell and signal those \\"self-reactive\\" T-cells to die via programmed cell death (apoptosis) and thereby deletion from the T cell repertoire, preventing autoimmunity.

Background He was the only son of William FitzWilliam, 3rd Viscount FitzWilliam and Mary Luttrell, daughter of Thomas Luttrell of Luttrellstown Castle.Cokayne Complete Peerage 2000 Reissue Vol 1, p. 287 He was probably born at Dundrum Castle, where his parents lived in the early 1640s. After the Irish Rebellion of 1641 the FitzWilliams, who had previously been among the largest landowners in Dublin, were dispossessed of most of their lands. Thomas's father spent some years in France and fought for Charles I in England during the English Civil War, becoming Governor of Whitchurch.Ball, F. Elrington History of Dublin Alexander Thom and Co. 1902-1920 Vol.2 p. 20 In 1655 William and his elder brother Oliver FitzWilliam, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, having made their peace with the English Parliament, were allowed to recover part of the family estate. After the Restoration of Charles II the FitzWilliams, with their record of loyalty to the Crown, were in high favour with the new regime, and recovered the remainder of their lands including their main seat, Merrion Castle. Thomas' father succeeded to the Viscountcy in 1667 and Thomas himself three years later. He also inherited considerable estates in County Westmeath from his maternal uncle Thomas Luttrell. Religion and politics Thomas's father was an open and devout Roman Catholic, who was attended at his death by several Catholic priests, and married his daughters into Catholic families.Ball, p.20 Thomas shared his father's religious beliefs: according to tradition he gave money for the building of a Catholic Mass house at Booterstown. When James II succeeded to the throne Thomas enthusiastically supported his pro-Catholic policy and for the next few years he was a political figure of some importance. James appointed him to the Privy Council of Ireland, and made him a Commissioner of the Treasury. During the Williamite Wars he was given a military command: in 1691 he raised a troop for the relief of the Siege of Limerick but was defeated in a clash with Wiliamite forces.Ball, p. 21 After the downfall of the Jacobite cause, Lord FitzWilliam was the subject of an Act of Attainder, but the attainder was later reversed, whether because of the family's record of loyalty to the Crown, or because of their wealth and influence, is unclear. He took his seat in the Irish House of Lords in 1695, but although he was willing to swear allegiance to William III, his conscience forbade him to join the Church of Ireland and he withdrew from the House. No further action was taken against him. He died, still in full possession of his estates, on 20 February 1704. Family Lord FitzWilliam married firstly Mary Stapleton, daughter of the leading Parliamentarian Sir Philip Stapleton and his first wife Frances Hotham: this was a somewhat surprising marriage, given the deep divisions about religion and politics between the two families. They had one surviving son- *Richard FitzWilliam, 5th Viscount FitzWilliam. He married secondly Elizabeth Pitt, daughter of George Pitt of Strathfieldsaye; she was a distant cousin of William Pitt the Elder. They had one daughter- *Mary, who married George Talbot and was the mother of nine children including- **George Talbot, 14th Earl of ShrewsburyCokayne p. 287 References Category:Viscounts in the Peerage of Ireland Category:17th-century Irish politicians Category:People from Dundrum, Dublin Category:1704 deaths Category:18th-century Irish people Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Members of the Irish House of Lords ","title":"Thomas FitzWilliam, 4th Viscount FitzWilliam"},{"id":"34525111","text":"The Volkhov River drainage vasin.

An open REST API allowed external applications to access the existing entries.  Details  Twick.it differed from other online encyclopedias by the short length of the explanation and the fact that there could be more than one explanation of a topic. A system of ranking, in which all registered users can participate equally, was meant to ensure that the best rated explanation appears at top; articles which are judged by the community as an incorrect or incomplete, rank on irrelevant lower ranks.

It was a shuttlecraft assigned to the USS Enterprise, and was the first of its type to be seen on screen in the franchise, appearing in the episode \\"The Galileo Seven\\". It appeared an additional four times in the series before being replaced by the Galileo II, a repaint of the full-size exterior model. Requests for building the props required to allow a shuttle to appear in episodes were initially turned down by Desilu Productions due to the cost. When Aluminum Model Toys became interested in building model kits of the Enterprise, a deal was struck in which they built the props in exchange for the licence. In addition to a miniature, two full-size props were built. After the end of the series, the full-scale exterior model was donated to a school for the blind. It then passed through a series of owners before being sold at auction in 2012. It was then restored and donated to the Johnson Space Center. Concept and design Leonard Nimoy as Spock, standing in front of the Galileo A shuttle had been suggested initially during the production of \\"The Enemy Within\\", but was ultimately rejected due to the cost. It was raised again in Oliver Crawford's pitch for \\"The Galileo Seven\\". Series creator Gene Roddenberry attempted to persuade executives at Desilu Productions that the prop was needed for both this episode and his plan for \\"The Menagerie\\", but they rejected this again because of the budget. This delayed production on \\"The Galileo Seven\\" for more than two months. In July 1966, previews began to air for Star Trek, which were seen by executives at Aluminum Model Toys (AMT). They sought the contract to produce model kits based on the starships seen in the series. A contract was signed between AMT and Desilu on August 1 of that year, stipulating that kits based on the Enterprise could be made in exchange for AMT providing a full- scale exterior of a shuttle and an interior set. The prop measures long, and tall. The Shuttle was built by Gene Winfield, a speciality car designer, from blueprints created by Thomas Kellogg, who worked on the Studebaker Avanti. Two versions were built. The first was intended for exterior filming, while the second version opened up to reveal interior sets and allow a variety of camera angles. These were constructed during August 1966 in Phoenix, Arizona, at a cost of $24,000, which was around double the original estimate, although it was still fully funded by AMT. AMT also built the filming miniature which was sent by the studio to original Enterprise builder Richard Datin when he was building the corresponding shuttlebay for the sum of $2,100, which was charged to the episode budget. The familiar decals were applied by Datin; prior to that the shuttle was marked with a simple \\"173 \\" number. For the Galileo II, the exterior full-size model was repainted to represent the new shuttle. After the end of the series, Paramount donated the Galileo prop to a school for the blind. It subsequently passed through the hands of several owners, before being stored in Ohio for some twenty years and falling into disrepair. It was auctioned on June 28, 2012, with the price holding at around $20,000 until the final 90 seconds, when three bidders jumped in. The prop sold for $70,150 to Adam Schneider. Schneider released a statement on TrekBBS, commenting that he was \\"very, very happy to have the opportunity to acquire and renovate Galileo\\" and planned to \\"restore her and put her on display for the fans.\\" =Later Galileos= The Galileo II was created for the episode \\"The Way to Eden\\" to replace the original Galileo, which had been destroyed in \\"The Galileo Seven\\". This was despite the Galileo appearing in further episodes following the apparent destruction, which was attributed to an oversight by the producers. According to the non-canon in-universe reference work Star Trek: Ships of the Line, the Galileo II was the final remaining class F shuttle in service and was put on display at the National Air and Space Museum. A new shuttle named Galileo 5 was created for Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. It was designed by Nilo Rodis and Andy Neskoromny, with the miniature constructed by Greg Jein. Two full-size props were also built, with one of them later being used in Star Trek: The Next Generation. The miniature was sold in 2014 by the Profiles in History auction house in Calabasas, California. Another shuttlecraft called Galileo appeared in the Star Trek: The Next Generation finale, \\"All Good Things...\\", in the timeline set prior to the start of the pilot. This was intended to be a reference to the Galileo seen in the original series. =Restoration= Schneider said that \\"The Galileo is important because it's really the biggest surviving movie or TV set of the modern era. Describing the fictional spacecraft as \\"the precursor to the space shuttle Enterprise\\", he added that \\"it was important to preserve it because it is a piece of not just TV history, but our space program's history.\\" Schneider discussed the restoration effort with fans of the series online and managed to contact Winfield, who suggested that a boat restorer might be the most appropriate craftsman to restore Galileo. The restoration efforts were conducted by Master Shipwrights in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, with more than 2,000 man hours put into the reconstruction. The funding for this came from Schneider, as he was concerned that use a crowdfunding model would slow down work. The intention was not only to restore the exterior of the prop, but to improve it structurally in order to ensure that it would not be damaged by being moved around. However, the rebuild was not without incident. Four days after the prop arrived in New Jersey, Hurricane Sandy hit the area. The shop flooded, destroying both the electrics and all of the tools. The restored Galileo was unveiled at Master Shipwrights on June 22, 2013. Following this, Schneider contacted more than twelve air and space museums to find a good fit for Galileo, as he wanted it to be on display. He eventually settled with NASA's Space Center Houston, part of the Johnson Space Center, where it was unveiled on July 31, 2013. Attendees at the event included Don Marshall, who portrayed Lt. Boma in \\"The Galileo Seven\\", along with Robert Picardo from Star Trek: Voyager, Tracy Scoggins from Babylon 5 and Gil Gerard of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. It went on permanent display within the Zero-G Diner at the Center as part of an exhibition to show how science fiction has influenced real-world space exploration. It has since been loaned to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City, where it was placed on display alongside the Space Shuttle Enterprise. Appearances The first appearance of the Galileo was in the season 1 episode \\"The Galileo Seven\\". In this episode, an away team is led by Spock (Leonard Nimoy) to investigate an anomaly while the Enterprise heads on to the planet Makus III to lend medical aid. The shuttle is pulled off course and crashes on the planet Taurus II. The away team attempts to find a way to return the damaged Galileo to orbit, while being attacked by the natives of the planet. The crew refuel the shuttle from the battery packs of their collective phasers, and once in orbit, Spock dumps and ignites the remaining fuel to produce a giant flare that allows the Enterprise to find them. The crew are transported to safety as the Galileo burns up in the atmosphere. During the course of the episode, a second shuttle, named Columbus, is seen. This is a re-use of the miniature model of the Galileo. All future appearances of the miniature in the series were re-uses of the footage from this episode. Despite its destruction, the Galileo is seen a further four times during the second season. In \\"Metamorphosis\\", the Galileo is forced to land on an unknown planet. Unable to discern a cause of the shuttle's malfunction, Spock meets with Zephram Cochrane (Glenn Corbett), who explains that a dampening field on the planet is preventing the shuttle from working. When Spock continues in his attempts to repair the shuttle, Cochrane's non- corporeal \\"Companion\\" (voiced by Elizabeth Rogers) destroys his equipment and damages the vessel. Captain Kirk (William Shatner) tries to convince the Companion to let them leave, but it merges with a human and loses its powers ‚Äì repairing the shuttle in the process. In \\"The Doomsday Machine\\", the guilt- ridden Commodore Matt Decker (William Windom), who has lost the crew of his USS Constellation to the machine, steals the shuttle in a suicidal attempt to destroy the alien \\"planet killer\\". The identification insignia of the shuttle reads NCC-1701/6. The shuttle is destroyed along with Decker, but this sacrifice at least gives Kirk the clue he needs to destroy the machine by feeding the derelict Constellation into its maw. A burned and punctured AMT Enterprise plastic model was filmed as the Constellation.Cushman, Marc, with Susan Osborn, These Are the Voyages, TOS, Season Two, Jacobs/Brown Press, Los Angeles, 2014, pp 147, 152-53 In \\"Journey to Babel\\", the Galileo ferries the ambassadors to the Enterprise. The episode's script originally specified use of the transporter, but stock footage of the shuttle was used to reduce costs. In the final appearance of that version of the shuttle, it is taken on an apparent suicide mission by Spock into a giant space amoeba in \\"The Immunity Syndrome\\". After the Enterprise also enters the amoeba, Kirk risks the ship by ordering a tractor beam lock on the shuttle to save both it and its pilot. The Galileo II appears in the episode \\"The Way to Eden\\", after Dr. Sevrin (Skip Homeier) and his followers hijack the Enterprise and take it to the planet Eden in Romulan territory. They then steal the shuttle, which they use to reach the planet. Models and toy lines A variety of models and toys were created based on the design of the Galileo. These include several versions by the Franklin Mint, such as a pewter model of Galileo II in 1990 and two versions of Galileo dioramas, depicting the shuttle on a planet set within a mini-globe, in 1995. Hallmark produced a Christmas decoration of the Galileo in 1992; this was only the second release in the range, following the previous year's production of the Enterprise. The Galileo has also appeared within a set of shuttlecraft models for the Star Trek: Official Starships Collection in 2015. In 2020 the Round 2 model company released a new accurate kit of the Galileo.

She has performed as a back-up vocalist for Steely Dan on several tours and recordings. Childhood and education Carolyn Leonhart was born in New York City on 10 July 1971, daughter of bassist and composer Jay Leonhart and vocalist Donna Leonhart. She was exposed to music from a very early age, attending her father's gigs where she saw him accompany famous singers such as Sarah Vaughan, Mel Torm√© and Peggy Lee. Leonhart sang on television commercials as a young child. She attended The High School of Music & Art in New York City, and for four years sang in the school's Gospel Choir. While at school, she performed in the TV show \\"It's Showtime At The Apollo\\". At home she would spend hours singing while her father and brother played jazz standards. She won the Lena Horne High School Jazz Vocalist competition while in her senior year. Leonhart attended the University of Rochester, obtaining a degree in Comparative Religion. While at university she remained deeply involved in music, singing with bands at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester. She recorded two solos with the Toshiba EMI label, and in her senior year was named Best College Jazz Vocalist by Downbeat Magazine. Singing career Leonhart returned to New York and in 1994 began singing in jazz clubs. That year she competed in the Thelonious Monk International Vocal Jazz Competition, coming third. A critic said her choice of the songs \\"Nobody Else but Me\\" and \\"Day Dream\\" was daring, but she needed greater control and more focused delivery. In the following years Leonhart performed with a variety of musicians including The Real Live Show, a hip-hop group, and Wax Poetic. The Wax Poetic project combines electronica, trip hop, funk, and jazz. In 1998 she recorded an album with the Swiss Percussion Ensemble, a group of four classical percussionists whose instruments were mainly made of glass. In 2000, Leonhart released the album Steal The Moon, a collaborative project with pianist and composer Rob Bargad. Since then she began performing regularly with her own group at the Smoke Jazz Club in New York City, at Steamers and The Vic in California, and at other clubs on the east coast. Leonhart and other members of the Swiss Percussion Ensemble formed Lyn Leon, a pop/lounge group that made several successful tours of Europe and released the album Glass Lounge in Germany in 2004. Lyn Leon toured with the jazz singer Al Jarreau during the fall of 2004. Leonhart said \\"Improvising with Al Jarreau was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. It opened me up to another level of creative awareness and expression\\". Between 2000 and 2007 Leonhart was a lead back-up vocalist with Steely Dan, singing on three world tours and two albums. She performed again with Steely Dan in 2009 and 2011. She and the group's other female backing vocalists, Cindy Mizelle and La Tanya Hall, are usually spotlighted singing lead on the song \\"Dirty Work\\". Other activities Leonhart met Wayne Escoffery, a London-born saxophonist, in a New York Jazz club in 2002. The two began dating when they had time during their busy tour schedules. They married in Manhattan on 17 January 2004. As of 2020, they are no longer married. Leonhart studied Contemporary Commercial Music Vocal Pedagogy Institute at Shenandoah University. In recent years she has become an Assistant Professor at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. Her goal as a teacher is to help vocal students gain an awareness of their instrument, their voice, avoid mistakes and learn better, freer vocal function. Style Leonhart has said that she does not consider herself a jazz singer, just a singer, and she has performed with ensembles covering a wide range of musical styles. She was deeply influenced by her father and by Donald Fagen and Walter Becker of Steely Dan. She says that other influences include Wayne Shorter, Woody Shaw, Ahmad Jamal, Herbie Hancock, Miles Davis and John Coltrane. She has been described as having an \\"intimate and soulful voice and broad tonal palette ... a singer who works intuitively, with a voice that projects both strength and vulnerability\\".

The fable and its versions When a goat starts eating a vine's leaves and shoots, the vine retorts that it will still have enough juice left to produce grapes, the wine from which will be poured over it when the goat is sacrificed. The earliest record of the fable is in an epigram by Leonidas of Tarentum, who lived in the area of southern Italy colonised by Greeks in the 3rd century BCE.Greek Anthology, III.99 Later Greek references come from Western Asia, including another epigram by Evenus of Ascalon containing simply the vine's retortGreek Anthology IX.75 and the prose collection of fables by Aphthonius of Antioch.Aesopica site Elsewhere in Europe it first appeared in Latin fable collections from German language areas, including Sebastian Brant's Esopi Appologi sive Mythologi (1501)p.366 and the 150 poems based on fables by Pantaleon Candidus (1604).Centum et Quinquaginta Fabulae carminibus explicatae, poem 94 The tale only began to appear in English fable collections in the 19th century.

Election Originally appointed by the Regional Council of Tuscany, since 1995 de facto and 2000 de jure, he is elected by popular vote every five years under universal suffrage: the candidate who receives a plurality of votes, is elected. His office is connected to the Regional Council, which is elected contextually: one fifth of the assembly seats are generally reserved to his supporters, which are wholesale elected concurrently with the President. The Council and the President are linked by an alleged relationship of confidence: if the President resigns or he is dismissed by the Council, a snap election is called for both the legislative and the executive offices, because in no case the two bodies can be chosen separately. The popular election of the President and the relationship of confidence between him and the legislature, allow to identify the Tuscan model of government as a particular form of semi- presidential system. Powers The President of Tuscany promulgates regional laws and regulations. He can receive special administrative functions by the national government. The President is one of the forty-one members of the Regional Council and, in this capacity, he can propose new laws. The President appoints and dismiss the Regional Cabinet (called Giunta Regionale in Italian). The Cabinet is composed by no more than eight regional assessors (assessori, literally \\"aldermen\\"According to Google Translate) who cannot be members of the Council at the same time. Assessors should not be confused with the ministers: according to Italian administrative law, assessors only receive delegations from the President to rule a bureau or an agency, the Region being a single legal person, not divided in ministries. One assessor is appointed Vice President. The Regional Cabinet prepares the budget, appoints the boards of public regional agencies and companies, manages assets, develops projects of governance, and resorts to the Constitutional Court of Italy if it thinks that a national law may violate regional powers. The President and the Cabinet are two different authorities of the Region: in matters within its competence, the Cabinet has the power to vote to give its approval.

He is also the author of A Short History of the Sudan (1965) which was one of the first history books to be written about what was then Africa's biggest country; it was used for the history syllabus in Sudan up until 1989.  Early years  Mandour was born in Umbukole, a small village located in the Northern state of Kurti county; Sudan. At a very young age, his mother died from Typhoid fever and his father provided for the family until he became ill and was unfit to work. His eldest brother decided to go into labor in order to support the family. However, Mandour grew up to be interested in receiving an education and was enrolled in a small primary school in Umbukole. He then enrolled at a Secondary school and later did his pre-university examinations, coming second in the Sudan, after the notable Abdalla Eltayeb. He was then accepted into the Faculty of Education at Gordon Memorial College, formally renamed University College Khartoum (now known as the University of Khartoum) and was later transferred to the University of London for his final year.  Career  Sudan received independence from the United Kingdom on January 1, 1956, and Ismail al-Azhari of the Democratic Unionist Party became the first Prime Minister of the Republic of Sudan. After his graduation and marriage, Mandour began working for the Institute of Education for several years, and in 1960, he was selected to partake in the Eleventh Session of the UNESCO General Conference in Paris 1960. Shortly afterwards, Mandour was commissioned by the Government of Sudan to head the Institute of Education in Bakht er Ruda. =Bakht er Ruda= The Institute of Education in Bakht er Ruda was established in 1934 by Mr. P. Garifet and it was the first Institute of Education in Sudan. The main objectives of the Institute was to enhance the school curriculum across the country and to train and improve the abilities of teachers who had not received primary education. Garifet became the first dean/principal of the institution and held the post from October 1934 until February 1950. Upon being chosen to head the institution, Mandour and his family moved to Bakht er Ruda and he was its Principal from July 1961 until July 1966. It was during his time at Bakht er Ruda that he wrote his famous history book, A Short History of the Sudan, and following his five years at the institute, he played a key role in laying the foundations of the education systems in Sudan whilst continuing to fulfill the main objectives of the Institution. Mandour became well known for his abundant knowledge as well as his strong personality and kindness. A common 'story' demonstrating his kindness was often told by the locals in Bakht er Ruda. One day, whilst he was on his way to work, he saw a young boy who appeared to be guiding his father. He approached them, and asked the boy ‚Ä≥why are you not in school‚Ä≥? The boy replied ‚Ä≥I have to look after my father for he is ill and I cannot afford to go to school‚Ä≥. Mandour then immediately enrolled the child at a school in Bakht er Ruda, paid for his fees, gave the young boy pocket money and supported his family. The young child proved to be very intelligent, and worked hard throughout his education career and he is now the director of one of the banks in Sudan. =Principal of the Institute of Education, Sudan= Following Mandour's success at Bakht er Ruda, the El azhari administration appointed him as Vice-Principal of the Institute of Education in Sudan in 1967 and shortly afterwards, Principal of the Institute of Education in Sudan in 1968. He continued to plan and implement education systems in other parts of Sudan and worked closely with Professor Abdalla Eltayeb. However, his days in office were numbered. Following the military coup of 1969 which was headed by Gaafar Nimeiry, El Azhari and many other democrats were either imprisoned or sacked and the Nimeiry administration sought to change the current education system in Sudan. Mandour strongly opposed the new non-democratic government for he was close with El Azhari and believed that the current system was extremely reasonable. At a national conference held in 1969 to discuss the adoption of a new education ladder, the new minister of education (Mohiuddin Saber) talked about changing the current step-ladder, and mandour stated that it was not necessary, and that if it were to happen it would mean that more classes would have to be built in order to accommodate more students which may take time. Mohiuddin replied by saying that while the change took place, the students could be taught outside of the classes and ‚Ä≥underneath trees if necessary‚Ä≥. At this point, it is known that mandour stood up from his seat and said to Saber that he knew nothing about education, the Sudan or its history, and that the first thing he should know is that in many parts of Sudan, there are ‚Ä≥no trees‚Ä≥. He then took his briefcase and walked out of the conference. Several other incidents between mandour and the new minister led to him being sacked from his position as Principal of the Institute of Education just two months after the military coup took place.  Entry into Saudi Arabia  Just a couple of days after the news of his dismissal hit headlines, the Saudi Ambassador to Sudan showed up at Mandour's house in Khartoum and told him that the Minister of Education in Saudi Arabia had heard of his unfair sacking and that he, along with Saudi officials, wanted him to become the first Director of Education. Mandour accepted the invitation, and he and his family moved to Saudi Arabia in 1970. After working in Saudi for a several years, Abdalla Eltayeb sent him a letter stating that he had been made the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Khartoum and that he wanted him to lead the Faculty of Education and to become the Vice-President of the University. Mandour negotiated a temporary deal with the Minister of Education in Saudi Arabia and then set off to work at the University in 1976. However, Abdalla Eltayeb was shortly sacked by the Nimeiry administration and Mandour immediately resigned from his post and returned to Saudi Arabia. Throughout his time in Saudi he appeared in many TV interviews, several of which were aired internationally. He was also chosen to deliver a key note speech in front of the Saudi Royal family where he spoke about the importance of education and gave his views about the current education systems in the country. Whilst returning to Sudan for a vacation, it is known that President El Nimeiry sent a representative to his house in Khartoum, and the representative said to Mandour; ‚Ä≥President Nimeiry wishes to apologise for any inconvenience he may have caused, and he wishes to meet with you as soon as possible and he is willing to offer you a high position in the ministry‚Ä≥. Mandour replied by saying; ‚Ä≥Tell El Nimeiry that if he comes to my house, two things may happen. Either, I will tell him to get out, or I will get up and leave my own house. Tell El Nimeiry that I do not wish to see him and that I refuse to be a part of his regime‚Ä≥. Mandour was offered the chance to work for UNESCO and the Minister of Education in Saudi Arabia recommended that it would be better if his own country nominated him, but the Nimeiry administration declined due to the fact he was against their regime. The Saudi's then decided that they would nominate him to represent their country, and prior to him winning the nomination, he worked for UNESCO for over two years. In the early 1980s, Mandour was chosen to become the Vice- Chancellor of the Islamic University of Madinah, but fell ill shortly after he started working and later died in London in October 1981. He is buried in the Khatmiyya graveyard in Sudan.  Legacy  During his short time as Vice- President of the University of Khartoum, Mandour founded the Department of Special Education as a means of preparing and training future teachers to work in educational institutions. In 1993, the department was integrated with the department of applied psychology and in 2007, a newer education program for training the specific needs for student teachers was recently approved by the University of Khartoum Senate. After his death, Abdalla Eltayeb published a poetry book called four tears for four great men. One of the men he talks about is Mandour, and he describes him as being one of the 'Greatest men in Sudan'. A hall at the University of Khartoum is named in Mandour's honor, and his book has continued to encourage many people around the world in discovering the rich story of Sudan's long history.

He was a member of Common Cause, a wartime think tank envisaging the shape of a post-war society. Other members included Professors K. S. Isles and G. V. Portus, Dr. A. R. Callaghan, Sidney Crawford, Charles Duguid and John W. Wainwright.  Headmasterships  While headmaster of St. Peter's College, Adelaide, Pentreath carried out a considerable new building programme and he developed the curriculum to include art, music and crafts to a degree unusual for the time. When he was appointed at Wrekin College, Shropshire, he inherited a near-Victorian regime. he quickly introduced his own warm and personal style of leadership, and first won over the boys and later the staff. According to Sir Peter Gadsden whom Pentreath appointed Head Boy at Wrekin in 1948: \\"We began to enjoy new freedoms: we were allowed out into the country on bicycles to discover for ourselves interesting places ‚Äî Housman's Shropshire, The Ironbridge Gorge and the Welsh borders. A host of new activities developed ‚Äî films, plays, current affairs, discussion groups, overseas trips.\\" Time's Paces: Pentreath quoted the verse 'When I was a babe and wept and slept, time crept ...' in his last sermon as headmaster of Wrekin. He had seen Henry Twells's version in Chester Cathedral where it is to be seen attached to a clock.See this ChesterTourist.com website: http://www.chestertourist.com/cathedral.htm Retrieved 2012.02.22. Photographs of the clock and the poem are to be found by scrolling down this large collection of photographs. It does not appear that Pentreath publicised his version in any other way. In 1952 he moved to Cheltenham College where he introduced the same ethos that had proved so successful at his earlier schools. However, he seems to have found the regime of the previous headmaster rather too \\"progressive\\". He reduced the number of hours the boys spent in unsupervised study and introduced a new rule that boys were not to go round with their hands in their pockets \\"but will learn to move about, not languidly searching for pennies in the dust, but with straight backs and squared shoulders, looking the world in the face.\\" (Speech Day address to College, 1952). This was quoted with approval by the Daily Mail.E-mail information provided by the Assistant Archivist at Cheltenham College.  Retirement  Pentreath left Cheltenham College due to the ill-health of his wife, Lesley, and was appointed Canon of Rochester Cathedral in 1959. He entered into the life of the cathedral with typical zest. When not in residence, he became a chaplain and guest lecturer on more than sixty Swan Hellenic cruises to Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean. He had a particular gift for bringing the ancient sites to life and his lectures won him many admirers. He was also Secretary of the Hellenic Travellers' Club. When he retired from cruise lecturing, he organised the Swans lecture programmes, and was much in demand as a lecturer with the National Association of Decorative and Fine Arts Societies (NADFAS). He was working on his memoirs at the time of his death.  Publications  * Hellenic Traveller: a Guide to Ancient Sites of Greece.

It comprises 7,700 ha (19,027 acres) of the county's north coast from just west of Holme-next-the- Sea to Kelling, and is additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) listings; it is also part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The North Norfolk Coast is also designated as a wetland of international importance on the Ramsar list and most of it is a Biosphere Reserve. Habitats within the SSSI include reed beds, salt marshes, freshwater lagoons and sand or shingle beaches. The wetlands are important for wildlife, including some scarce breeding birds such as pied avocets, western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings. The location also attracts migrating birds including vagrant rarities. Ducks and geese winter along this coast in considerable numbers, and several nature reserves provide suitable conditions for water voles, natterjack toads and several scarce plants and invertebrates. The area is archaeologically significant, with artefacts dating back to the Upper Paleolithic. The mound of an Iron Age fort is visible at Holkham, and the site of a 23 ha (57 acres) Roman naval port with a fort built on the castrum pattern is just outside Brancaster. The site of the medieval \\"chapel\\" (probably a domestic dwelling) at Blakeney is no longer accessible. Remains of military use from both world wars include an armoured fighting vehicle gunnery range, a hospital and bombing ranges, as well as passive defences such as pillboxes, barbed wire and tank traps. The SSSI is economically important to the area because of the tourists it attracts for birdwatching and other outdoor activities, although sensitive wildlife sites are managed to avoid damage from the large numbers of visitors. Another threat is the encroachment of the sea on this soft coast. The Environment Agency considers that managed retreat is likely to be the long-term solution, and is working with the Norfolk Wildlife Trust to create new reserves inland to compensate for the loss of scarce habitats at the coast.  Description  The SSSI is a long, narrow strip of coast that starts at the eastern boundary of The Wash between Old Hunstanton and Holme-next-the-Sea, and runs east for about 43 km (27 mi) to Kelling. The southern boundary runs roughly west to east except where it detours around towns and villages, and never crosses the A149 coast road. The SSSI has a wide variety of habitats, with bare mud, sand and shingle characterising the intertidal zone along the whole of the coast, although higher areas may have algae or eelgrass that are grazed by ducks and geese in winter. The salt marshes which form on sheltered coasts, in the lee of islands, or behind spits are described in the SSSI notification document as \\"among the best in Europe\\" due to their exceptionally diverse flora. Sand dunes occur at several places along the coast, but the best examples are at Holme Dunes, Holkham, Blakeney Point, and Scolt Head Island. The latter two sites are also important for geomorphology research purposes as structures consisting mainly of shingle ridges. Reed beds are fairly localised, but substantial areas occur at Titchwell Marsh, Brancaster and Cley Marshes. Grassland is represented by grazing pasture reclaimed from former salt marsh, with wetter areas at Cley and Salthouse marshes. Woodland is limited in the SSSI, although a belt of Corsican pine planted at Holkham has provided shelter for other trees and shrubs to become established.  History  = To 1000 AD = thumb Norfolk has a long history of human occupation dating back to the Palaeolithic, and including significant archaeology. Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago, before the last glaciation, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic (10,000‚Äì5,000 BCE), the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are under the sea.Robertson et al. (2005) pp. 9‚Äì22. Early Mesolithic flint tools with characteristic long blades up to Murphy (2009) p. 14. long found on the present-day coast at Titchwell date from a time when it was from the sea. Other flint tools have been found dating from the Upper Paleolithic (50,000‚Äì10,000 BCE) to the Neolithic (5,000‚Äì2,500 BCE). By 11,000 BC, the makers of the long blades had gone. Two timber platforms have been identified within the peat at Titchwell, and may possibly be rare Bronze Age (2,500‚Äì800 BCE) survivals.Robertson (2005) p. 149. Seahenge is another early Bronze Age site found on the coast at Holme in 1998. It consists of a ring of 55 oak posts and was built in 2049 BC; a similar nearby structure, Holme II, may be almost two centuries older. A large Iron Age fort at Holkham enclosed 2.5 ha (6.1 acres) at the end of a sandy spit in what was then salt marsh, and remained in use until the defeat of the Iceni in 47 AD. Roman period settlements have been discovered all along the Norfolk Coast, notably the complex at Branodunum, which covered at least 23 ha (57 acres) near Brancaster. This site included a fort built on the castrum pattern enclosing 2.6 ha (6.3 acres) within its walls, 2.9 m (10 ft) wide. The fort had internal turrets at the corners and was backed by an earth rampart.Fields (2006) p. 25.Edward, Derek A; Green, Christopher J S \\"The Saxon Shore fort and settlement at Brancaster\\" pp. 21‚Äì28 in Johnson (1977). Early Saxon sites are scarce close to the Norfolk coast, but a gold bracteate found near Blakeney Chapel was a rare and significant 6th-century find, and there is a somewhat later Saxon cemetery at Thornham. The Danelaw left few tangible traces within the SSSI, but place names such as Holkham (\\"ship town\\") reflect the Viking influence. Saxon building foundations were described as the ruins of \\"Cley Chapel\\" on a 1797 map, although it is more likely that they belonged to a barn. = Medieval to nineteenth century = Blakeney Haven in 1586 An \\"eye\\" is an area of higher ground in the marshes, dry enough to support buildings. Cley Eye had been farmed since the earliest human habitation, and was 28 ha (70 acres) in extent in 1651, but is much reduced by coastal erosion.Brooks (2011) p. 21.Bishop (1983) pp. 130‚Äì133. The Eye and its Saxon barn were accessed by an ancient causeway, passable at low tide. A 1588 map showed \\"Black Joy Forte\\" in the same area, which may have been intended as a defence against the Spanish Armada, but was never completed. On the other side of the Glaven, Blakeney Eye had a ditched enclosure during the 11th and 12th centuries, and a building known as \\"Blakeney Chapel\\", which was occupied from the 14th century to around 1600, and again in the late 17th century. Despite its name, it is unlikely that it had a religious function. Nearly a third of the mostly 14th-to-16th-century pottery found within the larger and earlier of the two rooms was imported from the continent,Birks (2003) pp. 1‚Äì28. reflecting the Glaven ports' importance in international trade at this time. The sheltered waters of Blakeney Haven had brought prosperity to the internationally important Glaven ports of Cley, Wiveton and Blakeney. Blakeney gained its market charter in 1222, and the three ports, along with Salthouse, were jointly required to provide three ships for Edward II in 1322,Lambert, Craig (2012) \\"The contributions of the Cinque Ports to the wars of Edward II and Edward III\\", p. 65 in Gorski (2012). having previously contributed to his father's navy in 1301. By the early 15th century, Blakeney was one of the few ports permitted to trade in horses, gold and silver, through \\"merchants sworn by oath to the king\\", which contributed to the town's growing wealth.Robinson (2006) pp. 3‚Äì5. In 1640, land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe just to the west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the wharf,Pevsner & Wilson (2002) p. 435. and further reclamation east of the Glaven meant that all the Glaven ports declined;Labrum (1993) pp. 113‚Äì114. Cley and Wiveton silted up in the 17th century, but Blakeney had packet ships until 1840.Pevsner & Wilson (2002) pp. 394‚Äì397. Similar marsh reclamation schemes took place elsewhere, often with the same consequence for the local harbours, as for example at Holkham. Only Wells-next-the-Sea had significant trade into the late 20th century. = Twentieth century coastal defences = Ruined World War II pillbox at Cley Artillery may have been installed at Gun Hill on the coast near Burnham Overy during the Napoleonic wars, but there were no modern fortifications in north Norfolk at the start of World War I. Following the German naval attack on Great Yarmouth in November 1914, defences such as trenches, concrete pillboxes and gun batteries were constructed along much of the Norfolk coast. The main bases were outside the SSSI boundaries, but Thornham Marsh was used between 1914 and 1918 by the Royal Flying Corps as a bombing range. A World War I concrete building on Titchwell's west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the British Army returned in 1942; some brickwork on Titchwell Marsh is all that remains of a military hospital dating from that period.Titchwell Marsh before the RSPB. RSPB information sheet. There were no new fortifications along this coast at the start of World War II. After the fall of France in 1940, the threat of invasion led to the creation of new defences. In addition to the installation of anti-tank and other passive obstacles, fourteen coastal batteries, each of two guns, were constructed. Some of these emplacements and other military bases fell within the SSSI area. Four spigot mortar base plates found at Holme dunes may not have originated at that site, since there is no record of such armament there.Birks (2003) p. 60. The marsh at Titchwell was reflooded, and pillboxes built into the beach bank. Between 1942 and 1945, the marsh was used by the Royal Tank Regiment; an armoured fighting vehicle gunnery range was established and banks were constructed for firing practice, with targets set at intervals. Some of the still extant islands were built to hold \\"pop-up\\" targets, operated by cables from winches in a building whose foundations now lie below a bird hide. Remains of the triangular concrete track used by the tanks also survive. Military activities continued in the area after the war, and the Royal Air Force returned to Thornham Marsh between 1950 and 1959. Bombing practice was supervised from a control tower, which was demolished in 1962, leaving only a concrete structure opposite the end of Titchwell's west bank. The remains of two World War II Covenanter tanks, probably used as targets, are sometimes exposed at low tide. The SS Vina, an 1894 cargo steamer, was anchored offshore in 1944 for use as an RAF target, but a gale dragged her to the sands off Titchwell, where the wreck can still be seen at low tide. Brancaster beach had a base including three pillboxes, Nissen huts and two gun emplacements, and another possible base, comprising about fifty different structures, was located in a salt marsh north-east of Burnham Overy Staithe. A wreck at the west end of Scolt Head Island was used as a bombing target, and the remains of a Blenheim bomber were found at the north of the island in 2004. Royal Artillery military fortifications were established at Cley beach, including two 6-inch (15.24 cm) guns, five buildings, two pillboxes, a minefield, and concrete anti-tank blocks. A spigot mortar emplacement and an Allan Williams Turret machine gun emplacement were sited closer to the village. One of the pillboxes and remains of the beach gun emplacements were still surviving as of 2012. The military camp accommodated 160 men and was later used to hold prisoners of war. Near the end of the war, the camp was used to house East European refugees, and was finally pulled down in 1948. Many of the wartime buildings were destroyed by the Royal Engineers in 1955, but the generator house was taken over by the coastguard service as an observation post. It was acquired by the NWT in 1983, and the upper part was used as a look-out, while the larger lower section became a beach caf√©.Brooks (2011) p.26. The building was overwhelmed by shingle in a storm in 2008, and subsequently demolished. = Conservation = thumb The first step towards the protection of this coast by a national conservation body was the purchase of Blakeney Point from the Calthorpe family by banker Charles Rothschild in 1912. Rothschild gave the property to the National Trust in 1912, which has managed it since. In 1926, another early protected area was created when Norfolk birdwatcher Dr Sydney Long bought the land which makes up the Cley Marshes reserve for the sum of ¬£5,100, to be held \\"in perpetuity as a bird breeding sanctuary\\". Long then went on to establish the Norfolk Wildlife Trust (NWT). The current SSSI was created in 1986 from pre-existing SSSIs at Blakeney Point, Holme Dunes, Cley, and Salthouse Marshes (all designated in 1954), Morston Saltmarshes and Brancaster Manor (1968), Stiffkey Saltmarshes (1969), Thornham Marshes (1972) and Titchwell Marshes (1973), together with the national nature reserves (NNRs) at Scolt Head Island (1967)Allen & Pye (1992) p. 148. and Holkham (1968),Rowley (2006) p. 365. and substantial formerly undesignated areas. Although much of the SSSI is in private hands, considerable areas are managed by large conservation organisations. As well as the two NNRs, there is an RSPB reserve at Titchwell Marsh, and Norfolk Wildlife Trust reserves are at Cley and Salthouse Marshes. The NWT also manages the Holme Dunes NNR. In addition to Blakeney Point, the National Trust owns land at Brancaster Staithe. The SSSI covers 7,700 ha (19,027 acres) and is additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar listings, and is part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Scolt Head Island and the coast from the Holkham NNR to Salthouse are a Biosphere Reserve.  Fauna and flora  = Birds = Bearded reedling The SSSI is designated as a Special Protection Area for birds for its variety of coastal habitats. The large breeding colonies of Sandwich terns and little terns, especially those at Blakeney Point and Scolt Head Island, are of \\"European importance\\" as defined in the Birds Directive, and the coast as a whole meets Natural England's criteria for nationally important populations of common terns, pied avocets and reedbed specialists like western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings. Other birds nesting in the wetlands include the northern lapwing, common redshank, and sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers. Ringed plovers and Eurasian oystercatchers lay their eggs on bare sand in the dunes. Little egrets, Eurasian spoonbills, ruffs and black-tailed godwits are present for much of the year,Harrup & Redman (2010) pp. 235‚Äì250. and the egret and spoonbill have both started nesting within the SSSI.Norfolk Wildlife Trust (2011) pp. 6‚Äì7. In spring and early summer, migrant birds including the little gull, black tern, Temminck's stint and garganey may pass through on their way to breed elsewhere. In the autumn, birds arrive from the north; some, such as whimbrels, curlew sandpipers and little stints, just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south, others staying for the winter. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds. Large numbers of ducks winter along the coast, including many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, goldeneyes and northern pintails. Red-throated divers are usually on the sea, and brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae. Barn owls and sometimes hen harriers quarter the marshes in winter, and snow bunting flocks can be found on the beaches. Thousands of geese, mainly pink-footed, roost at Holkham. The SSSI's north-facing east coast location can be favourable for huge numbers of migrating birds when the weather conditions are right.Elkins (1988) pp. 136‚Äì137.Newton (2010) pp. 97‚Äì98. These may include vagrant rarities.Newton (2010) p. 50. A black-winged stilt, which acquired the nickname \\"Sammy\\", arrived at Titchwell in 1993 and became a permanent resident up to its disappearance in 2005. Other major rarities included a western sandpiper at Cley in 2012, a rufous-tailed robin at Warham Greens in 2011, and a black-winged pratincole at Titchwell in 2009. = Other animals = Atlantic ditch shrimp Water voles are a highly threatened species in the UK, with a 70‚Äì90% decline in numbers mainly due to predation by the introduced American mink, but also habitat loss and water pollution. East Anglian sites of national importance for this species include Cley, Titchwell and other Norfolk coastal sites. Brown hares are widespread, and European otters may be seen at several locations. Both common and grey seals can be seen at the Blakeney Point colony and off the beaches.Taylor (2009) pp. 136‚Äì137. The common frog, common toad and common lizard all occur in suitable habitats,Norfolk Wildlife Trust (2005) pp. 12‚Äì15. and the rare natterjack toad breeds at Holkham and Holme.Natural England (2009) pp. 7‚Äì15. The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, hummingbird hawk-moth and ghost moth are sometimes seen, particularly in the woods at Holkham, along with the common butterfly and moth species. In some years the clouded yellow, Camberwell beauty, painted lady or diamondback moth may be seen, and the silver Y can sometimes occur in huge numbers. The dune tiger beetle is a nationally rare denizen of moist sand dunes. The lagoons behind the shingle beach at Salthouse and Cley are salty due to the percolation of seawater through the bank.Net Gain (2011) 574‚Äì586. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm sand or submerged vegetation, and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including the starlet sea anemone, lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, and lagoon cockle. These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the water beetle yellow pogonus, and even here it is localised and hard to find. = Plants = Marram grass binds the dunes On exposed parts of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no vegetation except possibly algae or eelgrass. Where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marshes contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The uncommon spiral tasselweed and long-bracted sedge are other lower salt marsh specialists. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh, although they are uncommon in the UK away from this coast. They may occur alongside scarce species including lesser centaury, curved hard-grass and sea pearlwort, with soft hornwort in the dykes. Grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass are important in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid and carline thistle flower on the dunes, and Holkham's Corsican pines shelter creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest orchids. The shingle ridges on Scolt Head Island and from Blakeney Point east to Salthouse attract biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat. The reedbeds, the largest of which are at the Cley, Salthouse and Titchwell reserves, are dominated by common reed, and salt marsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common bulrush also occur in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and Salthouse Marshes have jointleaf rush, common silverweed, and less common grasses such as annual beard grass, marsh foxtail, and slender hare's-ear. The flat land just inland from the dunes at Holkham was reclaimed from the marshes by the nineteenth century and was initially used for grazing. It was made arable during World War II, but the water levels have been raised to make the fields attractive to breeding and wintering birds. The pastures are of international importance for the tens of thousands of geese and ducks that feed there in the winter months.  Access and facilities  The former lifeboat station, now a visitor centre, at Blakeney Point Scolt Head Island is accessed by a ferry from Burnham Overy Staithe which runs between April and September. Blakeney Point can also be reached by boats from Morston quay, either to see the seal colonies or to avoid the long walk up the shingle spit from Cley Beach. The National Trust has an information centre and tea room at the quay, and a visitor centre on the Point, formerly a lifeboat station, is open in the summer months.Dorling Kindersley (2009) p. 214. The rest of the SSSI is close to the A149 coast road, and can be accessed at many points by footpaths or roads. The main nature-orientated facilities are on the major reserves. Holme Dunes NNR is accessed from Holme-next-the-Sea. It has a visitor centre, three bird hides, one of which has disabled access, and a 4 km (2.5 mi) nature trail. The other reserves are all adjacent to the A149. Titchwell Marsh RSPB is just west of Titchwell village and has a visitor centre, caf√© and hides. Most of the reserve and its facilities are wheelchair accessible, but the last part of the footpath to the beach is rough, and crosses a steep bank. The two bird hides at Holkham NNR can be reached from the end of Lady Anne's Drive in Holkham village; there is also a car park further east on Beach Road, Wells-next-the- Sea. Cley Marshes visitor centre and car park are to the south of the A149, opposite the main reserve. The centre and four of the five bird hides are accessible to people with limited mobility. Their proximity to the main coast road means that the reserves can be accessed by bus as well as car. The Peddars Way National Trail runs the length of the SSSI, and only short sections of this part of the long distance footpath venture south of the SSSI boundary.  Recreation  Birdwatching visitors help to support the local economy. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites (Snettisham, Titchwell, Holkham, Morston Quay, Blakeney and Cley) found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent ¬£122 million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs. Titchwell Marsh RSPB, Cley Marshes NWT and Holkham NNR each attract 100,000 or more visitors annually.Liley (2008) pp. 4‚Äì6. The small village of Titchwell shows the effect that wildlife visitors can have locally. It adjoins the RSPB's busiest reserve, Titchwell Marsh, and a 2002 survey reported that an estimated 137,700 visitors spent ¬£1.8 million in the area in 1998.Shiel et al. (2002) pp. 6‚Äì16. The village has two three-star hotels and a shop selling telescopes and binoculars, although it does not have a general store or a public house.Titchwell Manor Titchwell Manor. Retrieved 11 December 2011.Briarfields Briarfields Hotel. Retrieved 11 December 2011.In Focus In Focus. Retrieved 11 December 2011. The large number of visitors sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers, little terns and common seals, but also wintering geese. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle.Liley (2008) pp. 10‚Äì14. Damage is reduced by measures such as wardening breeding colonies, using fences, boardwalks and signs to control access, and appropriate positioning of car parks.Liley (2008) pp. 19‚Äì20. The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast into zones for tourism development purposes. Holme dunes, Holkham dunes and Blakeney Point, sensitive habitats suffering from visitor pressure, were designated as red-zone areas with no development or parking improvements to be recommended. \\"Orange\\" locations had fragile habitats, but were under less tourism pressure, or, as with the large nature reserves, were equipped to cope with many visitors. The most robust sites, mainly outside the SSSI, were placed in the green zone.Scott Wilson Ltd (2006) pp. 5‚Äì6.  Threats  The underlying geology of the North Norfolk coast is Cretaceous chalk, exposed at Hunstanton cliffs just to the west of the SSSI, but for the entire length of the SSSI coast, the chalk is buried by soft Quaternary glacial debris.Robertson et al. (2005) p. 46. Unlike the rapidly eroding soft cliffs further east, the coast of the SSSI has shown a less consistent pattern, with a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950. This coastline is threatened by climate change, with sea level rising an estimated at 1‚Äì2 mm per year for the last 100 years, increasing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.East Anglia Coastal Group (2010) p. 32. thumb One of the most vulnerable stretches is that between Blakeney Point and Weybourne, which included the Cley and Salthouse Marsh reserves.East Anglia Coastal Group (2010) p. 27. The coast here is protected by a shingle ridge, but the sea attacks the ridge and spit through tidal and storm action, with a single storm sometimes moving a \\"spectacular\\" amount of shingle. The Blakeney Point spit has sometimes been breached, becoming an island for a time, and this may happen again.May, V J (2003) \\"North Norfolk Coast\\" in May (2003) pp. 1‚Äì19. The northernmost part of nearby Blakeney was lost to the sea in the early Middle Ages, probably due to a storm.Muir (2008) p. 103. The spit is moving towards the mainland at about 1 m (1 yd) per year,Gray (2004) pp. 363‚Äì365. and for the last two hundred years maps have been accurate enough for the encroachment of the sea to be quantified. Blakeney Chapel was 400 m (440 yd) from the sea in 1817, but this had reduced to 195 m (215 yd) by the end of the 20th century. The landward movement of the shingle means that the channel of the River Glaven becomes blocked increasingly often, leading to flooding of the reserve and Cley village. The Environment Agency considered several remedial options to protect these vulnerable areas, and a new route for the river to the south of its original line was completed in 2007 at a cost of about ¬£1.5 million. The Environment Agency's long-term policy is to hold the line only to protect communities and infrastructure,East Anglia Coastal Group (2010) p. 62. with managed retreat as the solution to rising sea levels elsewhere, even at sites like Cley where the financial benefits from the recreational value of the reserve outweigh the cost of maintaining the sea defences.Turner et al. (2001) pp.128‚Äì139. A scheme to allow tidal flooding of part of the reserve has already been implemented at Titchwell Marsh. Another strategy is to create new reserves inland. To compensate for the inevitable loss of the important reedbeds at Cley, the Environment Agency and the Norfolk Wildlife Trust have been working since 2010 to make a new wetland near Hilgay. The Hilgay Wetland Creation Project is converting former farmland into a variety of wetland habitats by using banks, ditches and a lake to manage water levels. The Trust sees this as the first stage of a long-term plan to create a roughly Wissey Living Landscape.

It stars Arjun, Cheran, Vimal, Muktha Bhanu and newcomers Surveen Chawla and Lasini. The film features music composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja. Cinematography and editing were handled by Bhojan K. Dinesh and S. N. Fazil respectively. The film was released on 1 May 2013.  Plot  Varun (Vimal) and Anjana‚Äôs (Lasini) love story happens in the Ooty mountains (in Tamil literature, they are referred to as Kurinji); Gunasekar (Cheran) and Mallika‚Äôs (Muktha Bhanu) story happens in Tuticorin seashore (Neidhal); and Paul Harris Rosario (Arjun Sarja) and Divya‚Äôs (Surveen Chawla) story happens in the city (Marudham). The story revolves around these couples and the trials and tribulations they face. Varun explains the story of his life where he had fallen with Anjana in spite of knowing that her engagement has been called off, but he later sacrifices his love after hearing Guna and Mallika's story. Guna is a philanthropist who runs an organisation called \\"Punnagai,\\" a rehabilitation center for jail prisoners. Mallika, a physiotherapist, silently pines love for him. When Guna failed to unite a prisoner (Aadukalam Naren) with his family, Mallika does the job. Impressed with her, he handles the responsibility of taking care of Punnagai to her and leaves the town. Another story is of Harris, a swimming coach, and his student-cum-lover Divya (Varun claims Divya is his childhood friend, but there is no scene where they are together). Divya is disappointed for losing the swimming match, and her father Thiruvengadam (Thambi Ramaiah) advises another coach named Elango (John Vijay) to replace Harris with another coach, but Divya is adamant that Harris should be her coach. Meanwhile, Harris gets involved in a bike accident where his legs and hands have been hurt, but he encourages Divya to take part in the Olympics swimming match. Divya practices for the match rigorously and wins the competition by finishing it in less than 56 seconds. In 2016, Varun narrated these stories because they prompted him to write a novel called \\"Moondru Kaadhal\\". Harris arrives at the press conference of the book release and says that he is alive because of Divya. She is the epitome of goodness and confidence, and he narrates that though she had won the match, she died due to heart attack on the swimming pool. The film ends with Harris uttering Kaadhal Ketpadhalla Koduppadhu (\\"Love is not to be asked but to be given\\").  Cast  * Arjun as Paul Harris Rosario * Cheran as Gunasekar * Vimal as Varun * Muktha Bhanu as Mallika * Surveen Chawla as Divya * Lasini as Anjana * Thambi Ramaiah as Thiruvengadam (Divya's father) * Shanthi Williams as Guna's mother * Ravi Raghavendra as Varun's father * John Vijay as Elango * Aadukalam Naren as Prisoner * Bosskey as Interviewer * Boys Rajan as Doctor * Sathyan * Appukutty * Ritvik Varun in a special appearance * Robert in a special appearance * Blaaze in a special appearance  Production  In July 2011, reports confirmed that Vasanth would start directing his next film, titled as Moondru Per Moondru Kaadhal, four years after his last film Satham Podathey was released. Vasanth reportedly had been waiting with the script for three years to \\"get the right actors\\". He further noted that the film was not a love story but a \\"story about love\\". The film would consist of three love stories featuring the three lead characters, which play out in three landscapes: by the seaside, in the mountains and on the plains. Bharath Kumar, a fan of Vasanth's films, came forward to produce the film along with his friends under his newly launched Mahendra Talkies banner. Moondru Per Moondru Kaadhal was started on 9 August 2011. The director had roped in Arjun, who had worked with Vasanth in Rhythm (2000) before, and director-turned-actor Cheran for the lead roles, while stating that four newcomers would be selected for another male lead and the three lead female roles. By November 2011, sources suggested that Shiva might be roped in for the third lead role, but the actor denied being approached by the team, while later the month it was speculated that Vasanth would introduce his son to play the role. In January 2011 eventually, Vasanth confirmed that Vimal had been finalized. Muktha Bhanu, formerly credited as Bhanu, was chosen to portray one of the female leads, while Shruti Iyer, a Kingfisher Calendar Model Hunt model from Mumbai and participant of I AM She 2010 beauty pageant, and Punjabi actress Surveen Chawla agreed to play the other two lead roles, making their Tamil film debuts. Shruti Iyer was rechristened and credited as Lasini in the film. Furthermore, National Film Award winning actors Thambi Ramaiah and Appukutty were selected for supporting roles, providing comic relief. Despite knowing Tamil, Lasini, a native of Palakkad, had to train to improve her Tamil accent. Chawla, despite already knowing how to swim, did additional training to prepare for her role and Muktha Banu had to speak in Nagercoil slang for her scenes. Shooting for the film began by late 2011 in Kerala, and was continued in Nagercoil in November and December 2012. In July 2012, the crew moved to the hill station of Ooty to film major portions. Another schedule was later held in Hyderabad.  Music  Vasanth roped in Yuvan Shankar Raja as the composer, who he had previously worked with in Poovellam Kettuppar (1999) and his last project Satham Podathey (2007). In an interview, the director stated that Yuvan Shankar Raja had put in about seven months of work for this film, while describing the genre of the soundtrack as post-modern music. The soundtrack album features six songs with lyrics penned by Na. Muthukumar. Composing was started even before the film was launched, with the first song being recorded on 9 August 2011. Popular Bollywood singer Sonu Nigam originally sang the melody titled \\"Mazhai Mazhai Mazhaiyo Mazhai\\", which was recorded in Mumbai. The final version, however, featured Karthik's vocals. Neha Bhasin, who had sung the well received song \\"Pesugiren\\" in Satham Podathey before, lent her voice for another song in the album. Nandini Srikar of Ra.One fame crooned a solo \\"Aaha Kadhal\\", which, too, was recorded in Mumbai, while composer Ramesh Vinayagam sang a peppy number titled \\"Stop the Paatu\\" for the album. A teaser trailer of \\"Stop The Paatu\\" was released online in September 2012 and garnered positive response. The composer himself performed the song \\"Unakkagave\\" which was dubbed as the first dubstep track in Tamil cinema. Yuvan Shankar Raja later revealed that he had not composed a single new tune for the film, but that all were stock songs he had earlier recorded which were chosen by Vasanth. The final mixing was done by Kausikan Sivalingam in Berlin, according to Vasanth. The album was launched in a critically acclaimed event on 25 January 2013 at the Park Sheraton Hotel in Chennai. The entire cast and crew of the film, besides noted film personalities, including directors K. Balachander, K. S. Ravikumar, K. Bhagyaraj, N. Lingusamy, Sasi and actors Shanthanu Bhagyaraj, Kushboo, Krishna, Prakash Raj were present at the function which was host by television anchors Ma Ka Pa Anand and Divyadarshini. The songs from the album were also performed live on stage by the original artists. The album received very positive critical response.

It offsets the Mid-Atlantic Ridge by 320 km to the left. Its transform valley has a depth of 5000m. The fracture zone can be traced for over 2500 km east to west. Exploration history From temperature data gathered from the deep ocean on the German Meteor expedition (1925-1927) Georg W√ºst already suspected that there should be a passage through the Mid-Atlantic Ridge around latitude 9 North. The Vema Fracture Zone was then discovered in 1956 by G.R. Hamilton on board , with additional surveying taking place in the years 1959‚Äì1960. In the 1960s research was done by , , RV Chain, RV Argo and . The fault was subsequently explored by the French research vessel Jean Charcot in 1977 using its SeaBeam Classic multibeam echosounder, the French submersible Nautile and its mothership RV Nadir in 1989, the US in 1993, and the Russian RV Akademik Nikolay Strakhov in 1998, making it one of the world's best surveyed seafloor features. Transverse ridge The southern wall of the transform valley is crowned by one of the longest and highest transverse ridges of the entire mid- ocean ridge system. This narrow ridge must have risen as a single vertical slab 6.6 million years ago. Up to three million years ago the ridge was at or even above sealevel. Later it subsided to its present depth of 450 meters. Lema Fracture Zone While the transform valley of the Vema Fracture Zone has a V-shaped profile, the next fracture zone to the south has a steep vertical wall on its southern side rising from a horizontal valley bottom. As an L would fit in well here, this fracture zone is nicknamed Lema Fracture Zone. The north‚Äìsouth distance between the Vema and Lema fracture zones is 70 km. =Ridge jump= Up to 2.2 million years ago the Vema transform fault was 40 km shorter than today, and the Lema fracture zone had a leftward offset of 40 km. Then the old spreading valley between Lema and Vema died, and spreading started from an axis 40 km to the east. The Vema transform was thus extended by 40 km, while the Lema fracture zone was reduced to zero offset. Spreading from the new axis has meanwhile increased the distance between the old and the new axis to 80 km.

Education He finished in 1988 Cumhuriyet High School in Ankara. After graduating from the Faculty of Medicine at the Hacettepe University in 1995, he completed his special studies in plastic and reconstructive surgery between 1995 and 2001 at the same university. √ñmer √ñzkan served in 2004 as a research fellow at the Tokyo University in Japan in perforator flap and super microsurgery and later at the I-Shou University in Kaohsiung, Republic of China (Taiwan) in plastic surgery and hand surgery for a period of six months each. In 2006, he spent three months at the Bogenhausen Clinic of the Munich Technical University, Germany on a fellowship granted by the European Association of Plastic Surgeons (EURAPS). √ñmer √ñzkan was appointed associate professor at the Akdeniz University's Institute of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery in 2006. His scientific field covers aesthetic surgery for face and body, breast reconstruction, tissue engineering, facial muscles reconstruction at facial nerve paralysis, jaw reconstruction and urogenital surgery. Achievements √ñmer √ñzkan and his team performed a uterus transplant on August 9, 2011 to 21-year-old Derya Sert with an organ taken from a cadaver. She lacked womb from the birth. This is a first-ever operation in the world because former transplants were carried out by using organs from living donors. It is expected that the patient will be implanted in August 2012 with an embryo, which was previously fertilized and kept frozen, to give birth to a test-tube baby in May 2013. On September 25, 2010, two arms of 23-year-old Fatih Demirel, who died in a motorcycle accident in Milas, Muƒüla Province, were transplanted to Cihan Topal (29). Topal lost in 2008 his both arms below elbow as the corn harvester caught his upper limbs. On January 21, 2012, √ñmer √ñzkan and his team successfully performed two important transplants simultaneously at the Akdeniz University Hospital, a full face transplant and a multiple limb transplant, both for the first time in Turkey. The 19-year-old marble worker Uƒüur Acar's face was badly burnt by a toppled oven at home when he was a 40-day-old baby. The second transplant was simultaneously carried out in another operating room on Atilla Kavdƒ±r, who at the age of eleven had lost both his arms and one leg following an electric shock as he contacted overhead lines while trying to chase away birds with a metal stick. His transplanted right leg had to be amputated, however, one day later due to capillary immunity complication while his transplanted two arms showed no problem. The donor for the both transplants was Ahmet Kaya, who, hit by a train in U≈üak, died on January 20 at the age of 39. √ñmer √ñzcan personally collected the necessary organs from U≈üak, and took them to Antalya on board an aircraft belonging to the Ministry of Health. On May 16, 2012, he performed with his team country's fourth face and their second full face transplant. The face and ears of the 27-year-old patient Turan √áolak from Izmir was burnt as he fell into an oven when he was three and half years old. The donor was Tevfik Yƒ±lmaz, a 19-year young man from U≈üak, who had attempted suicide on May 8. He was declared brain death in the evening hours of May 15 after having been in intensive care station for seven days.

prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, was shot dead in the lobby of the House of Commons, at about 5:15 pm on 11 May 1812, by John Bellingham, a Liverpool merchant with a grievance against the government. Bellingham was detained and, four days after the murder, was tried, convicted and sentenced to death. He was hanged at Newgate Prison on 18 May, one week after the assassination and one month before the start of the War of 1812. Perceval remains the only British Prime Minister to date to have been assassinated. Perceval had led the Tory government since 1809, during a critical phase of the Napoleonic Wars. His determination to prosecute the war using the harshest of measures caused widespread poverty and unrest on the home front; thus the news of his death was a cause of rejoicing in the worst affected parts of the country. Despite initial fears that the assassination might be linked to a general uprising, it transpired that Bellingham had acted alone, protesting against the government's failure to compensate him for his treatment a few years previously, when he had been imprisoned in Russia for a trading debt. Bellingham's lack of remorse, and apparent certainty that his action was justified, raised questions about his sanity, but at his trial he was judged to be legally responsible for his actions. After Perceval's death, Parliament made generous provision to his widow and children, and approved the erection of monuments. Thereafter his ministry was soon forgotten, his policies reversed, and he is generally better known for the manner of his death than for any of his achievements. Later historians have characterised Bellingham's hasty trial and execution as contrary to the principles of justice. The possibility that he was acting within a conspiracy, on behalf of a consortium of Liverpool traders hostile to Perceval's economic policies, is the subject of a 2012 study. Background =Biography= Posthumous portrait of Spencer Perceval Spencer Perceval was born on 1 November 1762, the second son from the second marriage of John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont. He attended Harrow School and, in 1780, entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a noted scholar and prizewinner. A deeply religious boy, at Cambridge he became closely aligned with evangelicalism, to which he remained faithful all his life. Under the rule of primogeniture, Perceval had no realistic prospect of a family inheritance, and needed to earn his living; on leaving Cambridge in 1783, he entered Lincoln's Inn to train as a lawyer. After being called to the bar in 1786, Perceval joined the Midland Circuit, where his family connections helped him to acquire a lucrative practice. In 1790 he married Jane Wilson, the couple having eloped on her 21st birthday. The marriage proved happy and prolific; twelve children (six sons and six daughters) were born over the following 14 years. Perceval's politics were highly conservative, and he acquired a reputation for his attacks on radicalism. As a junior prosecuting counsel in the trials of Thomas Paine and John Horne Tooke, he was noticed by senior politicians in the ruling Pitt ministry. In 1796, having refused the post of Chief Secretary for Ireland, Perceval was elected to Parliament as the Tory member for Northampton, and won acclaim in 1798 with a speech defending Pitt's government against attacks by the radicals Charles James Fox and Francis Burdett. He was generally seen as a rising star in his party; his short stature and slight build earned him the nickname \\"Little P\\". After William Pitt's resignation in 1801, Perceval served as Solicitor General, and then as Attorney General, in the Addington ministry of 1801‚Äì04, continuing in the latter office through the Pitt ministry of 1804‚Äì06. Perceval's deep evangelical convictions led him to his unwavering opposition to the Catholic Church and to Catholic emancipation, and his equally fervent support for the abolition of the slave trade, when he worked with fellow evangelicals such as William Wilberforce to secure the passage of the Slave Trade Act 1807. When Pitt died in 1806 his government was succeeded by the cross-party \\"Ministry of All the Talents\\", under Lord Grenville. Perceval remained in opposition during this short-lived ministry, but when the Duke of Portland formed a new Tory administration in March 1807, Perceval took office as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons. Portland was elderly and ailing, and on his resignation in October 1809, Perceval succeeded him as First Lord of the Treasury‚Äîthe formal title by which prime ministers were then known‚Äîafter a wounding internecine leadership struggle. In addition to his duties as head of the government he retained the Chancellorship, largely because he could find no minister of appropriate stature who would accept the office. =Troubled times= Perceval's government was weakened by the refusals to serve of former ministers such as George Canning and William Huskisson. It faced massive problems at a time of considerable industrial unrest and at a low point in the war against Napoleon. The unsuccessful Walcheren Campaign in the Netherlands was unravelling, and the army of Sir Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, was pinned down in Portugal. At the outset of his ministry Perceval enjoyed the strong support of King George III, but in October 1810 the king lapsed into insanity and was permanently incapacitated. Perceval's relationship with the Prince of Wales, who became Prince Regent, was initially far less cordial, but in the following months he and Perceval established a reasonable affinity, perhaps motivated in part by the prince's fear that the king might recover and find his favourite statesman deposed. When the final British forces withdrew from Walcheren in February 1810, Wellington's force in Portugal was Britain's only military presence on the continent of Europe. Perceval insisted that it remain there, against the advice of most of his ministers and at great cost to the British exchequer. Ultimately this decision was vindicated, but for the time being his main weapon against Napoleon was the Orders in Council of 1807, inherited from the previous ministry. These had been issued as a tit-for-tat response to Napoleon's Continental System, a measure designed to destroy Britain's overseas trade. The Orders permitted the Royal Navy to detain any ship thought to be carrying goods to France or its continental allies. With both warring powers employing similar strategies, world trade shrank, leading to widespread hardship and dissatisfaction in key British industries, particularly textiles and cotton. There were frequent calls for modification or repeal of the Orders, which damaged relations with the United States to the point that, by early 1812, the two nations were on the brink of war. At home, Perceval upheld his earlier reputation as scourge of radicals, imprisoning Burdett and William Cobbett, the latter of whom continued to attack the government from his prison cell. Perceval was also faced with the anti-machine protests known as \\"Luddism\\", to which he reacted by introducing a bill making machine-breaking a capital offence; in the House of Lords the youthful Lord Byron called the legislation \\"barbarous\\". Despite these difficulties Perceval gradually established his authority, so that in 1811 Lord Liverpool, the war minister, observed that the Prime Minister's authority in the House now equalled that of Pitt. Perceval's use of sinecures and other patronage to secure loyalties meant that by May 1812, despite much public protest against his harsh policies, his political position had become unassailable. According to the humorist Sydney Smith, Perceval combined \\"the head of a country parson with the tongue of an Old Bailey lawyer\\". Early in 1812 agitation for repeal of the Orders in Council increased. After riots in Manchester in April, Perceval consented to a House of Commons enquiry into the operation of the Orders; hearings began in May. Perceval was expected to attend the session on 11 May 1812; among the crowd in the lobby awaiting his arrival was a Liverpool merchant, John Bellingham. John Bellingham =Early life= Bellingham was born in about 1770, in the county of Huntingdonshire. His father, also named John, was a land agent and painted miniatures. His mother Elizabeth was from a well-to-do Huntingdonshire family. In 1779 John senior became mentally ill, and, after confinement in an asylum, died in 1780 or 1781. The family were then provided for by William Daw, Elizabeth's brother-in-law, a prosperous lawyer who arranged Bellingham's appointment as an officer cadet on board the East India Company's ship Hartwell. En route to India the ship mutinied and was wrecked off the coast of the Cape Verde islands; Bellingham survived and returned home. Daw then helped him to set up in business as a tin plate manufacturer in London, but after a few years the business failed, and Bellingham was made bankrupt in 1794. He appears to have escaped debtors' prison, perhaps through the further intervention of Daw. Chastened by this experience, he decided to settle down, and obtained a post as a book-keeper with a firm engaged in trade with Russia. He worked hard, and was sufficiently regarded by his employers to be appointed in 1800 as the firm's resident representative in Archangel, Russia. On his return home, Bellingham set up his own trading business, and moved to Liverpool. In 1803 he married Mary Neville from Dublin. =In Russia= A contemporary engraving of John Bellingham In 1804 Bellingham returned to Archangel to supervise a major commercial venture, accompanied by Mary and their infant son. His business completed, in November he prepared to return home, but was detained on account of a supposed unpaid debt. This arose from losses incurred by a business associate for which Bellingham was deemed liable. He denied any responsibility for the debt; his detention, he thought, was an act of revenge by powerful Russian merchants who‚Äîerroneously‚Äîthought that he had frustrated an insurance claim relating to a lost ship. Two arbitrators appointed by the governor of Archangel determined that he was responsible for a sum of 2,000 roubles (about ¬£200), a fraction of the original amount claimed. Bellingham rejected this judgement. With the issue still unresolved, Bellingham obtained passes for him and his family to travel to the Russian capital, St Petersburg. In February 1805, as they prepared to set out, Bellingham's pass was revoked; Mary and the child were permitted to proceed, but he was arrested and imprisoned in Archangel. When he sought help from Lord Granville Leveson-Gower, the British ambassador in St Petersburg, the matter was dealt with by the British consul, Sir Stephen Shairp, who informed Bellingham that as the dispute involved a civil debt, he could not interfere. Bellingham remained in custody in Archangel until November 1805, when a new city governor ordered his release and allowed him to join Mary in St Petersburg. Here, instead of arranging his family's swift return to England, Bellingham laid charges against the Archangel authorities for false imprisonment, and demanded compensation. In doing so he outraged the Russian authorities, who in June 1806 ordered his imprisonment. According to his later account, he was \\"often marched publicly through the city with gangs of felons and criminals of the worse description [to the] heart-rending humiliation of himself\\". Mary had meanwhile returned to England with her son (she was pregnant with her second child), eventually settling in Liverpool where she set up a millinery business with a friend, Mary Stevens. For the next three years Bellingham made constant demands for release and compensation, seeking help from Shairp, Leveson-Gower, and the latter's successor as ambassador, Lord Douglas. None were prepared to intercede on his behalf: \\"Thus\\", he later wrote when petitioning for redress, \\"without having offended any law, either civil or criminal, and without having injured any individual ... was your Petitioner bandied from one prison to another\\". Bellingham's position worsened in 1807, when Russia signed the Treaty of Tilsit and aligned itself with Napoleon. Two further years passed before, after a direct petition to Tsar Alexander, he was released and ordered to leave Russia. He arrived in England, uncompensated, in December 1809, determined to secure justice. =Seeking redress= On his return to England Bellingham spent six months in London, seeking compensation for the imprisonment and financial losses he had suffered in Russia. He considered the British authorities to be responsible, through their neglect of his repeated requests for help. Successively he petitioned the Foreign Office, the Treasury, the Privy Council, and Perceval himself; in each case his claims were politely rejected. Defeated and exhausted, in May 1811 Bellingham accepted his wife's ultimatum to abandon his campaign or otherwise lose her and his family. He joined her in Liverpool to begin life afresh. During the following 18 months, Bellingham worked to rebuild his commercial career, with modest success. Mary continued to work as a milliner. The fact that he remained uncompensated continued to rankle. In December 1811 he returned to London, ostensibly to conduct business there, but in reality to resume his campaign for redress. He petitioned the Prince Regent, before resuming his efforts with the Privy Council, the Home Office and the Treasury, only to receive the same polite refusals as before. He then sent a copy of his petition to every member of Parliament, again to no avail. On 23 March 1812, he wrote to the magistrates at Bow Street Magistrates' Court, arguing that the government had \\"completely endeavoured to close the door of justice\\", and asking the court to intervene. He received a perfunctory reply. After consulting his own MP, Isaac Gascoyne, Bellingham made a final attempt to present his case to the government. On 18 April, he met with a Treasury official, Mr Hill, to whom he said that if he could get no satisfaction, he would take justice into his own hands. Hill, not perceiving these words as a threat, told him he should take whatever action he deemed proper. On 20 April, Bellingham purchased two .50 calibre (12.7 mm) pistols from a gunsmith of 58 Skinner Street. He also had a tailor sew an inside pocket to his coat. Assassination =House of Commons, 11 May 1812= Nineteenth-century illustration of Perceval's assassination in the Newgate Calendar Bellingham's presence in the House of Commons lobby on Monday 11 May, caused no particular suspicion; he had made several recent visits, sometimes asking journalists to confirm specific ministers' identities. Bellingham's activities earlier that day did not overtly indicate a man preparing desperate measures. He had spent the morning writing letters and visiting his wife's business partner, Mary Stevens, who was in London at the time. In the afternoon he had accompanied his landlady and her son on a visit to the European Museum, in the St James's district of London. From there he made his way alone to the parliament buildings in Westminster, arriving in the lobby shortly before five o'clock. In the House, as the session began at 5:30 pm, the Whig MP Henry Brougham, a leading opponent of the Orders, drew attention to the Prime Minister's absence and remarked that he ought to be there. A messenger was sent to fetch Perceval from Downing Street, but met him in Parliament Street (Perceval having decided to walk and dispense with his usual carriage) on his way to the House, where he arrived at about 5:15. As Perceval entered the lobby, he was confronted by Bellingham who, drawing a pistol, shot the Prime Minister in the chest. Perceval staggered forward a few steps and exclaimed \\"I am murdered!\\" before falling face down at the feet of William Smith, the MP for Norwich. (It was also variously reported Perceval had said \\"Murder\\" or \\"Oh my God\\".) Smith only realised that the victim was Perceval when he turned the body face upwards. By the time he had been carried into an adjoining room and propped up on a table with his feet on two chairs, he was senseless, although there was still a faint pulse. When a surgeon arrived a few minutes later, the pulse had stopped, and Perceval was declared dead. In the pandemonium that followed, Bellingham sat quietly on a bench as Perceval was carried into the Speaker's quarters. In the lobby, such was the confusion that, according to a witness, had Bellingham \\"walked quietly out into the street, he would have escaped, and the committer of the murder would never have been known\\". As it was, an official who had seen the shooting identified Bellingham, who was seized, disarmed, manhandled and searched. He remained calm, submitting to his captors without a struggle. When asked to explain his actions, he replied that he was rectifying a denial of justice on the part of the government. The Speaker ordered that Bellingham be transferred to the Serjeant-at-Arms's quarters, where MPs who were also magistrates would conduct a committal hearing under the chairmanship of Harvey Christian Combe. The makeshift court heard evidence from eyewitnesses to the crime, and sent messengers to search Bellingham's lodgings. The prisoner kept his composure throughout; although warned against self-incrimination, he insisted on explaining himself: \\"I have been ill- treated ... I have sought redress in vain. I am a most unfortunate man and feel here\\"‚Äîplacing hand on heart‚Äî\\"sufficient justification for what I have done.\\" He had, he said, exhausted all proper avenues, and had made it clear to the authorities that he proposed to take independent action. He had been told to do his worst: \\"I have obeyed them. I have done my worst, and I rejoice in the deed.\\" At around eight o'clock, Bellingham was formally charged with Perceval's murder, and was committed to Newgate Prison to await trial. =Reaction= William Cobbett, who denounced the government from his prison cell Reports of the assassination spread quickly; in his history of the times, Arthur Bryant records the crude delight with which the news was received by hungry workers who had received nothing but woe from Perceval's government. In his prison cell, Cobbett understood their feelings; the shooting had \\"ridded them of one whom they looked upon as the leader among those whom they thought totally bent on the destruction of their liberties\\". The scenes outside the Palace of Westminster as Bellingham was taken out for transfer to Newgate were consistent with this mood; Samuel Romilly, the law reformer and MP for Wareham, heard from the assembled crowd \\"the most savage expressions of joy and exultation ... accompanied with regret that others, and particularly the attorney general, had not shared the same fate\\". The throng surged around the hackney coach carrying Bellingham; many tried to shake his hand, others mounted the coach-box and had to be beaten off with whips. He was hustled back into the building, and kept there until the disorder had died down sufficiently for him to be moved, with a full military escort. Among the governing classes there were initial fears that the assassination might be part of a general insurrection, or might spark one. The authorities took precautions; the Foot Guards and mounted troops were deployed, as was the City militia, while local watches were reinforced. In contrast to the public's evident approval of Bellingham's actions, the mood among Perceval's friends and colleagues was sombre and sorrowful. When Parliament met the next day, George Canning spoke of \\"a man ... of whom it might with particular truth be said that, whatever was the strength of political hostility, he had never before that last calamity provoked a single enemy\\". After further tributes from government and opposition members, the House moved a grant of ¬£50,000 and an annuity of ¬£2,000 to Perceval's widow, which provision, slightly amended, was approved in June. The regard in which Perceval was held by his peers was made evident in an anonymous 1812 poem, \\"Universal Sympathy, or, The Martyr'd Statesman\\": Proceedings =Preliminaries= Newgate Prison, c. 1810 An inquest into Perceval's death was held on 12 May, at the Rose and Crown public house in Downing Street. Among those who gave evidence were Gascoyne, Smith, and Joseph Hume, a doctor and Radical MP. He had helped to detain Bellingham, and now testified that from his controlled behaviour after the shooting, Bellingham appeared \\"perfectly sane\\". The coroner duly registered the cause of death as \\"wilful murder by John Bellingham\\". Armed with this verdict the Attorney General, Sir Vicary Gibbs, requested the Lord Chief Justice to arrange the earliest possible trial date. In Newgate prison, Bellingham was questioned by magistrates. His calm demeanour and poise led them, unlike Hume, to doubt his sanity, although his keepers had observed no signs of unbalanced behaviour. James Harmer, Bellingham's solicitor, knew that insanity would provide the only conceivable defence for his client, and despatched agents to Liverpool to make enquiries there. While awaiting their reports he learned from an informant that Bellingham's father had died insane; he also heard evidence of Bellingham's supposed derangement from Ann Billett, the prisoner's cousin, who had known him from childhood. On 14 May, a grand jury met in the Sessions House, Clerkenwell, and after hearing evidence from the eyewitnesses, found \\"a true Bill against John Bellingham for the murder of Spencer Perceval\\". The trial was arranged to take place the next day, Friday 15 May 1812, at the Old Bailey. When Bellingham received news of his forthcoming trial he asked Harmer to arrange for him to be represented in court by Brougham and Peter Alley, the latter an Irish lawyer with a reputation for flamboyance. Confident of his acquittal, Bellingham refused to discuss the case further with Harmer, and spent the afternoon and evening making notes. After drinking a glass of porter, he went to bed and slept soundly. =Trial= An early 19th century trial in progress at the Old Bailey The trial began at the Old Bailey on Friday 15 May 1812, under the presiding judge Sir James Mansfield, Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. The prosecuting team was led by the Attorney General, Gibbs, whose assistants included William Garrow, himself a future Attorney General. Brougham having declined, Bellingham was represented by Alley, assisted by Henry Revell Reynolds. The law at that time limited the role of defending counsel in capital cases; they could advise on points of law, and could examine and cross-examine witnesses, but otherwise Bellingham would have to present his own defence. After Bellingham had entered a not guilty plea, Alley asked for a postponement to allow him time to locate witnesses who could attest to the prisoner's insanity. This was opposed by Gibbs as a mere ploy to delay justice; Mansfield concurred, and the trial proceeded. Gibbs then summarised the prisoner's business activities before meeting misfortune in Russia‚Äî\\"whether through his own misconduct or by the justice or injustice of that country, I know not\\". He recounted Bellingham's unsuccessful efforts to obtain redress, and the consequent growth of a desire for revenge. Having described the shooting, Gibbs dismissed the possibility of insanity, maintaining that Bellingham was, at the time of the deed, fully in control of his actions. Numerous eyewitnesses testified to what they had seen in the Commons lobby. The court also heard from a tailor who, shortly before the attack had, on Bellingham's instructions, modified the latter's coat by adding a special inside pocket, in which Bellingham had concealed his pistols. When Bellingham rose, he thanked the attorney general for rejecting the \\"insanity\\" strategy: \\"I think it is far more fortunate that such a plea ... should have been unfounded, than it should have existed in fact\\". He began his defence by asserting that \\"all the miseries which it is possible for human nature to endure\\" had fallen on him. He then read the petition that he had sent to the Prince Regent, and recalled his fruitless dealings with various government agencies. In his view the principal blame lay not with \\"that truly amiable and highly lamented individual, Mr Perceval\\", but with Leveson-Gower, the ambassador in St Petersburg who he felt had originally denied him justice, and who he said deserved the shot rather than the eventual victim. Bellingham's main witnesses were Ann Billett and her friend, Mary Clarke, both of whom testified to his history of derangement, and Catherine Figgins, a servant in Bellingham's lodgings. She had found him recently confused, but otherwise an honest and admirable lodger. As she stood down, Alley informed the court that two more witnesses had arrived from Liverpool. However, when they saw Bellingham, they realised that he was not the man to whose derangement they had come to attest, and withdrew. Mansfield then began his summing up, during the course of which he clarified the law: \\"The single question is whether at the time this act was committed, he possessed a sufficient degree of understanding to distinguish good from evil, right from wrong\\". The judge advised the jury before they retired that the evidence showed Bellingham to be \\"in every respect a full and competent judge of all his actions\\". =Verdict and sentence= The jury retired, and within 15 minutes returned with a guilty verdict. Bellingham appeared surprised but, from Thomas Hodgson's contemporary trial account, was calm, \\"with[out] any demonstrations of that concern which the awfulness of his situation was calculate to produce\\". Asked by the court clerk if he had anything to say, he remained silent. The judge then read the sentence, Hodgson records, \\"in a most solemn and affecting manner, which bathed many of the auditors in tears\\". First, he damned the crime, \\"as odious and abominable in the eyes of God as it is hateful and abhorrent to the feelings of man\\". He reminded the prisoner of the short time, \\"a very short time\\", that remained for him to seek for mercy in another world, and then pronounced the sentence of death itself: \\"You shall be hanged by the neck until you be dead, your body to be dissected and anatomized\\". The entire trial had lasted less than eight hours. =Execution= Bellingham's execution was fixed for the morning of Monday 18 May. The day before, he was visited by the Revd Daniel Wilson, curate at St John's Chapel, Bedford Row, a future Bishop of Calcutta, who hoped that Bellingham would show true repentance for his act. The clergyman was disappointed, concluding that \\"a more dreadful instance of depravity and hardness of heart has surely never occurred\\". Late on Sunday, Bellingham wrote a last letter to his wife, in which he appeared confident of his soul's destination: \\"Nine hours more will waft me to those happy shores where bliss is without alloy\\". Large crowds gathered outside Newgate on Monday; a force of troops stood by, since warnings had been received of a \\"Rescue Bellingham\\" movement. The crowd was calm and restrained, as was Bellingham when he appeared at the scaffold shortly before 8 o'clock. Hodgson records that Bellingham mounted the steps \\"with the utmost celerity ... his tread was bold and firm ... no indication of trembling, faltering, or irresolution appeared\\". Bellingham was then blindfolded, the rope fastened, and a final prayer was said by the chaplain. As the clock struck eight the trap door was released, and Bellingham dropped to his death. Cobbett, still incarcerated in Newgate, observed the crowd's reactions: \\"anxious looks ... half-horrified countenances ... mournful tears ... unanimous blessings\\". In accordance with the court's sentence, the body was cut down and sent to St Bartholomew's Hospital for dissection. In what the press described as \\"morbid sensationalism\\", Bellingham's clothes were sold for high prices to members of the public. Aftermath Memorial plaque to Spencer Perceval, in Lincoln's Inn Fields On 15 May, the House of Commons voted for the erection of a monument to the assassinated Prime Minister in Westminster Abbey. Later, memorials were placed in Lincoln's Inn, and within Perceval's Northampton constituency. On 8 June, the Regent appointed Lord Liverpool to head a new Tory administration. Despite their eulogies to their fallen leader, members of the new government soon began to distance themselves from his ministry. Many of the changes that Perceval had opposed were gradually introduced: greater press freedom, Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform. The Orders in Council were repealed on 23 June, but too late to avoid the declaration of war on the United Kingdom by the United States. Lord Liverpool's government did not maintain Perceval's resolution in acting against the illegal slave trade, which began to flourish as the authorities looked the other way. Linklater estimates that around 40,000 slaves were illegally transported from Africa to the West Indies, because of lax enforcement of the law. Linklater cites Perceval's greatest achievement as his insistence on keeping Wellington's army in the field, a policy which helped to turn the tide in the Napoleonic Wars decisively in Britain's favour. Despite this, with the passage of time Perceval's reputation faded; Charles Dickens considered him \\"a third-rate politician scarcely fit to carry Lord Chatham's crutch\\". In due course, little but the fact of his assassination lingered in public memory. As the bicentenary of the shooting approached, Perceval was described in newspapers as \\"the prime minister that history forgot\\". The justice of Bellingham's conviction was first questioned by Brougham, who condemned the trial as \\"the greatest disgrace to English justice\\". In a study published in 2004 the American academic Kathleen S. Goddard criticises the timing of the trial so soon after the act, when passions were running high. She also draws attention to the court's refusal to allow an adjournment that would permit the defence to contact possible witnesses. There was, she maintains, insufficient evidence produced at the trial to determine the true state of Bellingham's sanity, and Mansfield's summing-up showed significant bias. Bellingham's claim to have acted alone was accepted in court; Linklater's 2012 study posits that he could been an agent of other interests‚Äîperhaps Liverpool merchants, who bore the main brunt of Perceval's economic policies and had much to gain by his demise. Comments by a Liverpool newspaper, says Linklater, indicate that talk of assassination was common in the city. It remains unknown how Bellingham gained the funds to spend freely in the months preceding the assassination, when he was not apparently engaged in any business. This conspiracy theory has not convinced other historians; the columnist Bruce Anderson points to the lack of any concrete evidence to support it. In the months immediately following her husband's execution, Mary Bellingham continued to live and work in Liverpool. By the end of 1812 her business had failed, and thereafter her movements are obscure; she may have reverted to her maiden name. In January 1815, Jane Perceval married Sir Henry William Carr; she died, aged 74, in 1844. In 1828, The Times reported that Cornish industrialist landowner, John Williams the Third (1753‚Äì1841) received a dream warning of Perceval's assassination on 2 or 3 May 1812, nearly ten days before the event, \\"correct in every detail\\". Perceval himself had a series of dreams culminating on 10 May with one of his own death, which he had while spending the night at the house of the Earl of Harrowby. He told the Earl of his dream, and the Earl tried to persuade Perceval not to attend Parliament that day, but Perceval refused to be scared off by \\"a mere dream\\" and headed for Westminster on the afternoon of 11 May. A distant kinsman of the assassin, Henry Bellingham, became Conservative MP for North West Norfolk in 1983, and held junior office in the Cameron‚ÄìClegg coalition of 2010‚Äì15. When he temporarily lost his seat in 1997‚Äîhe regained it in 2001‚Äîhis narrow defeat was widely regarded as arising from the intervention of Roger Percival, the candidate for the Referendum Party whose votes largely came from disgruntled Conservatives. Despite the different spelling, media accounts asserted Percival's descent from the assassinated Prime Minister's family, and reported the defeat as a belated form of revenge. The greater part of the Palace of Westminster (Westminster Hall apart) that stood at the time of the assassination was destroyed by an accidental fire in 1834, following which the Houses were comprehensively rebuilt and expanded. In July 2014, a brass memorial plaque was unveiled in St Stephen's Hall, Houses of Parliament, close to the place where Perceval was killed. Michael Ellis, Conservative MP for Northampton North (part of Perceval's old Northampton constituency) had campaigned for the plaque after four patterned floor tiles that were said to mark the spot had been removed by workmen in a recent renovation.

Career and marriage Bliss studied fashion design at the East Sydney Technical College and subsequently became an air hostess for Qantas. She went on to work in public relations at the Parmelia Hilton Hotel in Perth, where she first met businessman Alan Bond in 1979. In 1989 Bliss was involved in an insider trading investigation when she purchased 500,000 shares in Petro Energy at eight cents per share, just before Bond Corporation launched a takeover bid paying 14 cents per share. Bliss became a successful theatrical producer, working in the West End, New York and Sydney. Her notable projects included Our Country's Good in 1991 and The Holy Terror in New York in 1993.Our Country's Good won the Laurence Olivier BBC Award in 1988 for best play. The Broadway production was nominated for six Tony awards.

Third-party logistics providers typically specialize in integrated operations of warehousing and transportation services that can be scaled and customized to customers' needs, based on market conditions, to meet the demands and delivery service requirements for their products. Services often extend beyond logistics to include value-added services related to the production or procurement of goods, such as services that integrate parts of the supply chain. A provider of such integrated services is referenced as a third-party supply chain management provider (3PSCM), or as a supply chain management service provider (SCMSP). 3PL targets particular functions within supply management, such as warehousing, transportation, or raw material provision.\\"Outsourcing Transport and Warehousing: Pricing, Honesty and Contentious Issues\\" Published in Australian Freight Logistics Magazine. Retrieved 2014-3-25. The global 3PL market reached $75 billion in 2014, and grew to $157 billion in the US; demand growth for 3PL services in the US (7.4% YoY) outpaced the growth of the US economy in 2014. As of 2014, 80 percent of all Fortune 500 companies and 96 percent of Fortune 100 used some form of 3PL services. Types Third-party logistics providers include freight forwarders, courier companies, and other companies integrating & offering subcontracted logistics and transportation services. Hertz and Alfredsson (2003) describe four categories of 3PL providers: * Standard 3PL Provider: this is the most basic form of a 3PL provider. They would perform activities such as, pick and pack, warehousing, and distribution (business) ‚Äì the most basic functions of logistics. For a majority of these firms, the 3PL function is not quite their main activity. * Service Developer: this type of 3PL provider will offer their customers advanced value-added services such as: tracking and tracing, cross-docking, specific packaging, or providing a unique security system. A solid IT foundation and a focus on economies of scale and scope will enable this type of 3PL provider to perform these types of tasks. * The Customer Adapter: this type of 3PL provider comes in at the request of the customer and essentially takes over complete control of the company's logistics activities. The 3PL provider improves the logistics dramatically, but does not develop a new service. The customer base for this type of 3PL provider is typically quite small. * The Customer Developer: this is the highest level that a 3PL provider can attain with respect to its processes and activities. This occurs when the 3PL provider integrates itself with the customer and takes over their entire logistics function. These providers will have few customers, but will perform extensive and detailed tasks for them.Martin Murray, Selecting a Third Party Logistics (3PL) Provider, thebalance.com Outsourcing may involve a subset of an operation's logistics, leaving some products or operating steps untouched because the in-house logistics is able to do the work better or cheaper than an external provider. Another important point is the customer orientation of the 3PL provider. The provider has to fit to the structures and the requirements of the company. This fit is more important than the pure cost savings, like a survey of 3PL providers shows clearly: The customer orientation in form of adaptability to changing customer needs, reliability and the flexibility of third-party logistics provider were mentioned as much more important than pure cost savings. =Lead logistics providers= 3PL providers without their own assets are called lead logistics providers. Lead logistics providers have the advantage that they have specialized industry expertise combined with low overhead costs, but lower negotiating power and fewer resources than a third- party provider has based on a normally big company size, a good customer base and established network systems. 3PL providers may sacrifice efficiency by preferring their own assets in order to maximize their own efficiency. Lead logistics providers may also be less bureaucratic with shorter decision-making cycles due to the smaller size of the company.Simchi-Levi and Kaminsky, Designing and Managing the Supply Chain: Concepts,Strategies and Case Studies, third edition, McGraw-Hill International Edition, page 253Arno Heck, Strategische Allianzen, Springer Verlag pp. 47+48 Layers First party logistics providers (1PL) are single service providers in a specific geographic area that specialize in certain goods or shipping methods. Examples are: carrying companies, port operators, depot companies. The logistics department of a producing firm can also be a first party logistics provider if they have own transport assets and warehouses.N. Schr√∂ter,I. Schr√∂ter, Supply Chain Management und Logistik, Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart 2010, Seite 15 Second-party logistics providers (2PL) are service providers which provide their specialized logistics services in a larger (national) geographical area than the 1PL do. Often there are frame contracts between the 2PL and the customer, which regulate the conditions for the transport duties that are mostly placed short term. 2PLs provide own and external logistics resources like trucks, forklifts, warehouses etc. for transport, handling of cargo or warehouse management activities. Second-party logistics arose in the course of the globalization and the uprising trend of lean management when the companies began to outsource their logistics activities to focus on their own core companies. Examples are courier, express and parcel services; ocean carriers, freight forwarders and transshipment providers. The most significant difference between a second party logistics provider and a third-party logistics provider is the fact that a 3PL provider is always integrated into the customer's system. The 2PL is not integrated; in contrast to the 3PL, it is only an outsourced logistics provider with no system integration. A 2PL works often on call (e.g. express parcel services) whereas a 3PL is almost every time informed about the workload of the near future. As technology progresses, the methodology for notifying a 3PL of inbound workload usually falls on API integrations that connect, for example, an E-commerce store with a fulfilment center. Another point that differs 2 and 3PL is the specification and customizing of services. A 2PL normally only provides standardized services, whereas 3PLs often provide services that are customized and specialized to the needs of their customer. This is possible due to long term contracts that are usual in the third-party logistics market. Cost- effectiveness of a third-party logistics provider is only given over long periods of time with stable contract and profits. In contrast to that second party logistics services can‚Äôt be customized, concerning to the fluctuating market with hard competition and a price battle on a low level. And there we have another distinguishing point between 2PL and 3PL: Durability of contracts. 3PL contracts are long term contracts, whereas 2PL contracts are of low durability so that the customer is flexible in responding to market and price changes. With companies operating globally, the need to increase supply chain visibility and reduce risk, improve velocity and reduce costs ‚Äì all at the same time ‚Äì requires a common technological solution. Non-asset based providers perform functions such as consultation on packaging and transportation, freight quoting, financial settlement, auditing, tracking, customer service and issue resolution. However, they do not employ any truck drivers or warehouse personnel, and they don‚Äôt own any physical freight distribution assets of their own ‚Äì no trucks, no storage trailers, no pallets, and no warehousing. A non-assets based provider consists of a team of domain experts with accumulated freight industry expertise and information technology assets. They fill a role similar to freight agents or brokers but maintain a significantly greater degree of ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù involvement in the transportation of products. These providers are 4PL and 5PL services. A fourth party logistics provider has no owned transport assets or warehouse capacity. They have an allocative and integration function within a supply chain with the aim of increasing the efficiency of it. The idea of a fourth-party logistics provider was born in the seventies by the consulting company Accenture. Firms are outsourcing their selection of third-party logistics provider and the optimization process of the integration of these to a PL as an intermediary. That reduces costs and the 4PL have to have an overview of the whole logistics market to choose the ideal 3PL for all operative logistic activities. For being able to provide such an ideal solution fourth-party logistics providers need a good knowledge of the logistics branch and a good IT infrastructure. A fourth party logistics provider selects the 3PL providers from the market which are most suitable for the logistical issues of their customer. Unlike the allocative function of a 4PL in the supply chain, the core competence of a 3PL provider is the operative logistics. Fifth party logistics providers (5PL) provide supply chain management and offer system-oriented consulting and supply chain management services to their customers. Advancements in technology and the associated increases in supply chain visibility and inter- company communications have given rise to a relatively new model for third- party logistics operations ‚Äì the \\"non-asset based logistics provider.\\" On- demand transportation On-demand transportation is a relatively new term coined by 3PL providers to describe their brokerage, ad-hoc, and \\"flyer\\" service offerings. On-demand transportation has become a mandatory capability for today's successful 3PL providers in offering client specific solutions to supply chain needs. These shipments do not usually move under the \\"lowest rate wins\\" scenario and can be very profitable to the 3PL that wins the business. The cost quoted to customers for on-demand services are based on specific circumstances and availability and can differ greatly from normal \\"published\\" rates. On-demand transportation is a niche that continues to grow and evolve within the 3PL industry. Specific modes of transport that may be subject to the on-demand model include (but are not limited to) the following: * FTL, or Full Truck Load * LTL, or Less-than Truckload * Hotshot (direct, exclusive courier) * Next Flight Out, sometimes also referred to as Best Flight Out (commercial airline shipping) * Expedited services: (direct, exclusive courier) Immediate delivery or \\"just-in-time\\" (JIT)Expedited Transportation: Just in Time (JIT)- Retrieved 2018-09-16Best Courier: JIT- Retrieved 2018-09-16 * International Expedited New brokers tend to use what has become known as \\"smile and dial\\" brokering that essentially work as telemarketing call centers.Cargo Transit, Inc.: The Success of the Small Freight Broker (smile and dial brokering)- Posted 2015-12-02, Retrieved 2018-09-18 Brokers have no obligation to successfully ship all loads (as opposed to contract logistics providers) and almost all sales representatives are heavily (and 100%) commissioned, and much of the workers' day is spent cold-calling sales leads. Smile-and-dial brokerages typically require a 15% gross profit margin (the difference between what the shipper pays the brokerage and what the brokerage pays the carrier), and the commission compensation scheme means that the turnover of personnel in the call centers approaches 100% per year. For the occasional shipper, smile-and-dial brokerages can provide a convenient way to have goods shipped. But the lack of deep expertise due to constant turnover, combined with the 15% pricing margins, mean that a reasonably capable traffic professional can obtain transportation services much more economically and reliably, while a shipper needing delivery as soon as possible, from air freight, air charter, ground expedited, flatbed services, refrigerated, LTL or full truckload, liftgate, van or vehicle. With JIT delivery the price will be secondary to on-demand as soon as possible delivery.Tri-State: Expedited service- Retrieved 2018-09-16 Horizontal alliances Raue & Wieland (2015) describe the example of horizontal alliances between logistics service providers, i.e., the cooperation between two or more logistics companies that are potentially competing.Raue, J.S. & Wieland, A. (2015), The interplay of different types of governance in horizontal cooperations: a view on logistics service providers. The International Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 26, No. 2. Logistics companies can benefit twofold from such an alliance. On the one hand, they can \\"access tangible resources which are directly exploitable\\". This includes extending common transportation networks, their warehouse infrastructure and the ability to provide more complex service packages by combining resources. On the other hand, LSPs can \\"access intangible resources, which are not directly exploitable\\". This includes know-how and information and, in turn, innovation. Advantages =Cost and time savings= Logistics is the core competence of third-party logistics providers. Providers may have better related knowledge and greater expertise than the producing or selling company, and may also have more global networks enabling greater time and cost efficiencies. The equipment and the IT systems of 3PL providers are constantly updated and adapted to match the requirements of their customers and their customer‚Äôs suppliers. Producing or selling companies often do not have the time, resources, or expertise to adapt their equipment and systems as quickly.Simchi-Levi and Kaminsky, Designing and Managing the Supply Chain: Concepts,Strategies and Case Studies, third edition, McGraw-Hill International Edition, page 251. =Low capital commitment= If most or all operative functions are outsourced to a 3PL provider, there is usually no need for the client to own its own warehouse or transport facilities, lowering the amount of capital required for the client's business. This is particularly beneficial if a company's warehouse has high variations in capacity utilization, leading to overpurchasing of warehouse capacity and reducing profitability. =Focus= Logistics outsourcing allows companies with limited logistics expertise to focus on their core business. Increasing complexity in business suggests that companies benefit from not devoting resources to areas in which they are not skilled.Simchi-Levi and Kaminsky, Designing and Managing the Supply Chain: Concepts,Strategies and Case Studies, third edition, McGraw-Hill International Edition, page 250 =Flexibility= Third-party logistics providers can provide higher flexibility for geographic distribution and may offer a larger variety of services than clients could provide for themselves. Postal services and private couriers typically factor in distance when they calculate the cost of shipping; many 3PL providers market the benefit of what is known as zone skipping to potential clients, because it shortens the distance between products to be shipped and customers, resulting in lower shipping costs. This also allows businesses to more predictably manage their resources including workforce size, and turn fixed costs into variable costs. Disadvantages =Loss of control= One disadvantage is the loss of control a client has by using third-party logistics. With outbound logistics, the 3PL provider usually assumes communication and interactions with a firm's customer or supplier. To mitigate this, some 3PL‚Äôs attempt to brand themselves as their clients, such as applying clients' logos on their assets and dressing their employees like their clients' employees.Simchi-Levi and Kaminsky, Designing and Managing the Supply Chain: Concepts,Strategies and Case Studies, third edition, McGraw-Hill International Edition, page 252 =IT= The IT systems of the provider and the client must be interoperable. Technology helps increase visibility for the client by way of continuous status updates via Dispatch Management Software and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) which does involve a cost, but it can help avoid penalties for delays and subsequent financial losses such as from not unloading freight in time. = Reverse logistics = Numerous studies have shown that selling products online, rather than in a brick and retail environment, adds extra costs when it comes to handling returns (i.e, reverse logistics). The reliance upon third-party logistics providers to handle aspects of the e-commerce supply chain such as warehousing and pick-and-pack also means these companies must be relied on to handle reverse logistics. Artificially induced demand events such as Black Friday in the United States or Singles' Day in China come with an influx of returned products, which can slow down warehouse operations and in turn delay the issuing of refunds or other methods for mitigating dissatisfied customers. Various industries have found ways to capitalize on reverse logistics by recycling materials such as metal and electrical goods recycling.

It was finished in 1914, revised in 1918, and eventually published in 1922.  Composition  As most of the works by Igor Stravinsky, this three-movement work was arranged from a four-hands on one piano version, from which the final revised version of 1918 derives and differs in some respects. The manuscript (originally titled IStravinsky. Trois pi√®ces pour quatuor √† cordes ‚Äì reduction pour piano √† quatre mains par moi, IStr.) contained no movement titles for any of the three pieces. However, with the passing of time, Stravinsky rearranged these three movements for large orchestra, together with his √âtude pour pianola, and premiered the whole collection as Quatre √©tudes in 1928. The word \\"string quartet\\" in the title refers to string quartet more as an ensemble, rather than a genre. Therefore, the work challenges the traditional notion of string quartet with its implied musical form and idiom. As music critic Paul Griffiths points out, > Stravinsky's work, for the first time in the history of the genre, is > determinedly not a 'string quartet' but a series of pieces to be played by > four strings. There is no acknowledgement of a tradition or a form, and the > lack of any such acknowledgement seems iconoclastic because of our own > experience of the genre's traditions.

The first locomotive was ordered in 1924 from Hanomag of Germany, number 10 351 and it was numbered 752. The remaining 4 were produced by Tampella Oy in Tampere. They were numbered 752-756. The VR3 was then the largest and most powerful Finnish locomotive. It was a success, but in the hands of inexperienced drivers it could all too easily damage buffers or break couplings. Therefore, a screw-drive regulator was fitted.Katajisto, Juhani. (1985). Eilisp√§iv√§n kulkuneuvoja. H√§meenlinna:Tietoteos. At speed there could be longitudinal movement, because locomotive had no bogie wheels, only 5 rigid axles. However, the ‚ÄúRooster‚Äù was generally considered to be a fine locomotive. Some say the name resulted from the slightly louder than normal whistle. They were deliberately designed to work within very large rail yards, where the overall noise level could be very high. The happy crow of the \\"Rooster\\" was for half a century, a familiar sound in Finnish marshalling yards. They proved to be agile and could easily scale the humps and complex pointwork of marshalling yards where their great power compensated for their low speed.

Johnston (2008). The evolution of genome size in ants. BMC Evolutionary Biology 8: 64.  Mutualism  The butterfly Plebejus argus lays eggs near nests of the ant L. alienus, forming a mutualistic relationship. This mutualistic relationship benefits the adult butterfly by reducing the need for parental investment. Once the eggs hatch, the ants chaperone the larvae, averting the attacks of predatory organisms like wasps and spiders as well as parasites. In return, the ants receive a saccharine secretion fortified with amino acids from an eversible gland on the larvae‚Äôs back. As first instar larvae prepare to pupate, the ants carry the larvae into their nests. Once the larvae become pupae, the ants continue to provide protection against predation and parasitism.

It is usually bottled in syrup and used as a decoration on rich chocolate desserts. The Amarena is a variety of the Prunus cerasus developed by Gennaro Fabbri who was born in 1869 in Bologna, Italy. His wife, Rachele, took over an old general store in Portomaggiore, which was near a wild black cherry orchard. She picked the cherries and cooked them in sugar in copper pots. To thank his wife for the treat, he bought a ceramic jar from Riccardo Gatti, an artist from Faenza. The white and blue ceramic jar was then used to sell the syrup and start a small company. He started commercial production of cherry related products in 1905 under the Fabbri brand. The Fabbri company is still family owned, and produces a number of natural cherry pastries, syrups, and beverages.

Bland was a highly active participant in the Civil Rights Movement from her earliest days, and was the youngest person to have been jailed during any civil rights demonstration during that period. Bland grew up in segregated Selma, Alabama, where she was not allowed to enter certain stores and was only allowed to go in the library and movie theater on days labeled \\"colored.\\" As a result of growing up in segregation Bland lost her mother, who died in a \\"white\\" hospital waiting for a transfusion of \\"black blood.\\" Her grandmother encouraged Bland and her sister to march and become a freedom fighter to fight for their freedom, even though her father disapproved due to his fear for their lives. It did not stop Bland who became active in the movement when she was eight years old. When she was eight years old, she attended a meeting with the Dallas County Voters League with her grandmother.  Early life and activism  Bland began her activism in 1961, attending a freedom and voters' rights meeting presided over by Martin Luther King Jr. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) members active in Selma organized local teenagers to participate in the movement, including marching on \\"Bloody Sunday\\" and \\"Turn Around Tuesday\\". On \\"Bloody Sunday\\", March 7, 1965, Bland witnessed fellow activists being beaten by the police and Alabama State Troopers. By the time she was 11 years old, Bland had been arrested a documented 13 times. Bland's first time being arrested was when she was eight years old at the beginning of her activism. During the march while Bland witnessed people being beaten, they could not get away from police as they moved in from the sides, back, and front. Bland's sister, Lynda Blackmon Lowery, was the youngest person that participated in the march, she was 14 years old at that time. Lowery saw people putting Bland in the back of a white car and she thought her sister was dead, but when she got to the car, she soon realized that Bland just fainted. When Bland woke up, she could feel her sister's blood dripping on her face from being hit on the head many times. Bland helped protect white Northerners who chose to participant in the march, they included ministers and college students. On March 21, 1965, she marched from Selma to Montgomery and that same year in August the Voting Rights Act was signed. Bland was one of seven black students who integrated A. G. Parish High School in Alabama.  Career  Bland remains active in several local and regional organizations, including the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the NAACP, the Sunflower Project, Ladies With A Mission, and her church, Ward Chapel in Prattville, Alabama. She has spoken at conferences and workshops for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, and in the states of Maine, Wisconsin, Vermont, Minnesota, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Texas, South Carolina, and throughout Alabama. She served in the United States Army and is a graduate of the College of Staten Island, where she received a Bachelor of Arts degree. She was a co-founder of the Voting Rights Museum located across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, but she left the museum in 2007. After leaving the museum Bland created Journeys for the Soul located in Alabama, Bland takes individuals of all age groups, on a journey to the past. Through educational tours and lectures, she teaches the history of the Civil Rights Movement and the struggle to achieve Voting Rights. Bland received the Robert O. Cooper Peace and Justice Fellowship on April 10, 2014, at an event hosted by SMU. Bland uses her platform to promote the importance of voting and being an active participant in elections. As an activist Bland made it her mission to teach the future generation to about the past of segregation. Bland was a keynote speaker at the celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. at UW-Eau Claire, February 2019. Bland is featured in the 2019 documentary on voter suppression, After Selma, directed by Loki Mulholland, where she describes her childhood, activism, and the ongoing struggle for equal voting rights in the United States.

Completed in 1914, it is one of the earliest Armenian churches in America and the first to incorporate traditional Armenian architecture. History =Background= The first Armenians settled in Fresno in the early 1870s. The first joint Armenian Apostolic and Protestant service was held in 1883 at the First Congregational Church of Fresno. Subsequently, joint Armenian rite services were held in a rented church by Father Aharon Melkonian. By 1899, the membership of the parish reached 150 and an general meeting decided to build a separate church. On April 1, 1900 the Holy Trinity Church was established at the corner of F and Monterey Streets. The construction of the church, a simple wooden structure, was completed in six months and consecration took place on October 1, 1900. It was officiated by Bishop Hovsep Sarajian. It was the second Armenian church to be built in America after the Church of Worcester, Massachusetts. An Armenian school with some 85 students operated in the adjacent building. By 1910, around 4,000 Armenians lived in Fresno (out of the 5,000 in all of California). =Current church= In 1911 the trustees of the church decided to buy land for a new, larger church. A land lot was purchased for $3,000 at the corner of M Street and Ventura Avenue in 1912. The old church was destroyed in a fire on July 9, 1913. The groundbreaking of the new church took place on November 1, 1913 and cornerstone laying on January 4, 1914. The first Divine Liturgy (Badarak) took place in the basement on Palm Sunday, April 12, 1914. The consecration took place on December 13, 1914 with Bishop Moushegh Seropian of Boston officiating. The architect of the new church was Lawrence Karekin Cone (Condrajian), also known as L. K. Cone. The cost of construction stood at $25,000. It became the first Armenian church to be built in the US in the traditional Armenian church architecture. The area where the church is located is known as \\"Armenian Town\\" for its historical Armenian population. It remained a predominantly Armenian area until the mid-1950s. =Later history= In 1927 the Western Diocese of the Armenian Church of North America was established. The church was designated as the cathedral of the diocese, while Bishop Karekin Khachdourian as Primate, who served as pastor until 1933. In 1933, after the murder of Leon Tourian, the primate of the Eastern Diocese, in New York City by a group of Dashnaks, a pro-Soviet group broke away from the pro-Dashnak Holy Trinity Church and formed St Paul's Church in 1939 under the jurisdiction of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin. In 1956 a new building containing a social hall, kitchen and classroom was built next to the church. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 31, 1986. It is currently one of the six Armenian churches in the Fresno area. Architecture The architect of the church was Lawrence Karekin Cone (Condrajian), also known as L. K. Cone. It combines American Revivalism and traditional Armenian architecture. The entrance is in the Beaux-Arts style. The exterior is mostly brick masonry, while the two domes are made of galvanized sheet metal. The church is wide, long and high. It has a seating capacity of 660. The church has a basement, main floor and gallery level with a total of . The interior is entirely painted in beige. In 1982 Kero Antoyan painted murals on the four pendentives. The church contains paintings of the Christ and Mary, St. Sahak and St. Mesrop Mashtots.

Biography =Youth= Hill, born in 1892, was the son of a timber merchant with business interests stretching from Siberia to Persia. He was born in Estonia and educated by French and German governesses. He had exceptional linguistic skills, and learned to speak six languages, including Russian. =First World War= Hill was in British Columbia on a fishing trip when the First World War broke out in 1914. He joined a Canadian infantry regiment and was posted to Ypres in 1915. He displayed exceptional bravery and was seriously wounded. He was then sent to the War Office where after training by Scotland YardRussian Roulette by Giles Milton p47 he began his career as an intelligence officer, his first assignment being to fly agents behind enemy lines in Greece. In 1917, he was sent to Petrograd, ostensibly as a member of the Royal Flying Corps mission, arriving amid the confusion of the Bolshevik Revolution. In his memoirs, not generally regarded as entirely reliable, he described how he took the Romanian crown jewels from the Kremlin to Ia»ôi, helped Leon Trotsky to organise a military intelligence service and the Red Air Force, ran guns to Ukrainian nationalists, and recruited German agents for counter-intelligence work. According to Hill he personally blew up an enemy gasworks, overpowered an assassin who attempted to kill him with a grenade by striking him in the head with a brick and ran one of 2 men who had followed him from secret meeting through with his swordstick.Go Spy the Land p148 & p153 He eschewed carrying firearms whilst undercover as he considered them impossible to explain if searched and improvised having a bottle of acid to hand whenever writing his dispatches so that he could quickly destroy his secret documents if necessary.Go Spy the Land p50 & p152-3 Rather than physical force Hill preferred bribery noting that 'I had always found the value of including in my kit a certain amount of good plain chocolate, half a dozen pairs of ladies silk stockings and two or three boxes of the more expensive kind of Parisian toilet soap. My experience was that, presented at the right psychological moment they would unlock doors which neither wine nor gold would open'Russian Roulette by Giles Milton p49 When the British landed in Murmansk he was obliged to flee to Finland with the Soviet secret service, the Cheka in hot pursuit. He returned briefly to Russia before being posted by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) to the Middle East. SIS being short of funds, he left after three years and lived in a caravan in Sussex with his wife. His service had earned him a DSO and an MBE, and he was mentioned in dispatches three times. Hill took a series of jobs, with Royal Dutch Shell, he was manager of the Globe Theatre in London, and deputy general manager to the theatrical impresario C. B. Cochran. He also wrote two volumes of memoirs, Go Spy the Land (1933) and The Dreaded Hour (1936) as well as two unpublished plays. =Second World War= At the outbreak of the Second World War, Hill was recalled to SIS with the rank of major. He worked as a trainer in section D (destruction), his students including Kim Philby who wrote later that he was impressed by 'Jolly George' Hill's knowledge of explosivesKim Philby, My Silent War (1968), p8 Hill stayed at the training school when it was taken over by the Special Operations Executive (SOE). In 1941, Hill, now a colonel, was chosen to lead a SOE mission to Russia, codenamed Sam. That September, he arrived in Moscow in time for the signing of two agreements between SOE and the Soviet security organisation, NKVD. These were designed to co-ordinate propaganda and sabotage in occupied Europe, to avoid acting in each other's spheres of influence, to help each other infiltrate agents into occupied territory, and to decide on targets and priorities. These agreements did not lead to much genuine activity, though Hill did manage to help infiltrate some Soviet agents into occupied Europe, in and operation codenamed Pickaxe. There were more Pickaxe operations in 1942, though the Foreign Office began to worry that about Britain's allies finding they had dropped Soviet agents into their countries. In addition, SOE was not happy with the quality of some of the agents who were to be transported and regarded a number of them as being completely unsuitable. In the event, there were only four successful missions in 1942 and a further six in 1943. Whitehall became impatient with Sam. Anthony Eden, the British foreign secretary, complained that Hill was wasting the taxpayers' money. Hill replied that the problems resulted from 'sand in axle box tactics' in London; he was supported by the ambassador to Moscow, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. In April 1944, Hill's opposite number, Colonel Chichayev, complained that SOE had done practically nothing and that the Soviets no longer had any need for them. At the same time, SOE was frustrated by NKVD's refusal to co-operate in Soviet-occupied Europe, particularly with the Polish underground army. Hill could not really be blamed: it was unrealistic to expect SOE and NKVD to co-operate successfully. Clark Kerr arrived in London in December 1944 and announced that there was little for Hill to do in Moscow. He now held the rank of brigadier and it was felt that he could be replaced by a more junior officer. Hill returned to London in the summer of 1945. =Post-war= After the war, Hill became a director of the British-owned German mineral water company Apollinarius. He died in 1968, shortly after his second marriage. Works *G. Hill, Go Spy the Land (1933) *G.

In order to conserve fish species, it is also important to be aware of other cultures' knowledge of fish. Ignorance of the effects of human activity on fish populations may endanger fish species. Knowledge of fish can be gained through experience, scientific research, or information passed down through generations. Some factors that affect the amount of knowledge acquired include the value and abundance of the various types of fish, their usefulness in fisheries, and the amount of time one spends observing the fishes' life history patterns.http://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/22-2/SilvanoBegossi2002.pdf  Etymology  The term was first used in the scientific literature by W.T.

Importance in conservation  Ethnoichthyology can be very useful to the study and investigation of environmental changes caused by anthropogenic factors, such as the decline of fish stocks, the disappearance of fish species, and the introduction of non- native species of fish in certain environments.Azevedo-Santos, V. M.; Costa- Neto, E. M.; Lima-Stripari, N. 2010.

With a sound knowledge of fish ecology, informed decisions with respect to fishing practices can be made, and destructive environmental practices can be avoided. Ethnoichthyological knowledge can be the difference between conserving a species of fish, or placing a moratorium on fishing. = Newfoundland's cod fishery collapse = The collapse of the cod fishery in Newfoundland and Labrador was due to a lack of ethnoichthyological knowledge and conservation efforts. The waters of Newfoundland were once teeming with cod. John Cabot's crew reported that \\"The sea there is full of fish that can be taken not only with nets, but fishing baskets.\\"Cod fishing in Newfoundland#15th and 16th Century Until John Cabot's crew arrived in Newfoundland, those who caught cod were mostly subsistence fishermen. They generally used techniques like jigging, longlining, and small trawler use. These methods were not stressful on the cod population. However, the invasion of European superpowers put a great deal of pressure on the environment. At one point, the French, English, Spanish and Portuguese would anchor as nearby as 12 miles off the Newfoundland shore with large trawlers in order to maximize their catch. This was extremely detrimental to the population. The catch of cod reached its peak in 1968 at 80,000 tons,Report on the Status of Groundfish Stocks in the Canadian Northwest Atlantic. Atlantic Stock Assessment Secretariat, Department of Fisheries and Oceans. June 1994. p.19. after which a steady decrease in population was observed. Foreign ships were forced to fish two hundred miles offshore. Despite good intentions, the results were not favourable. This was because Canadian and American fishermen were then freed of competition and able to increase their catch. By the 1980s the amount of fish taken had increased from a safe 139,000 tons to an unsustainable 250,000 tons. The use of draggers was found to be extremely detrimental to the cod population in several ways. Not only did it decimate the number of adult cod, but it wreaked havoc on their reproduction. While spawning, cod are extremely vulnerable to disturbance. Their eggs are often dispersed due to the draggers. The draggers also emit a chemical that is thought to negatively affect the embryogenic development of the cod. Finally, the draggers destroy the habitat of the cod, other fish and crustaceans.Reproductive Success in Atlantic Cod (Gadus Morhua): The Potential Impact of Trawling. A report prepared by: OCEANS Ltd., Newfoundland for the Newfoundland Inshore Fisheries Association. Feb. 1990. pp79-89. The Canadian federal government was forced to issue a moratorium on cod fishing in 1992 due to populations reaching dangerously low numbers. Though local inshore fishermen had been voicing concerns about the state of the population since the early 1980s, the government choose to rely on scientific data. The scientific community failed to see the signs of the unstable population until 1986. When they presented their findings to the government, a suitable reduction was not put in place with enough haste to allow population to stabilize. The government was forced to put a ban on cod fishing or risk extinction. This ban could have been avoided if the ethnoichthyological knowledge of the local fishermen had been given more consideration. Though the moratorium kept the cod from becoming extinct in the Newfoundland area, it also had some negative effects. Large companies lost business and subsistence fishermen were forced to find new ways of making a living. It is unlikely that the cod will ever return to their original numbers.  Specific cultures  Ethnoichthyological knowledge varies among cultures. Every cultural group has a different way of interacting with the fish species in their environment. Often, folk knowledge coincides with the ideas put forth in scientific literature. Those who work with fish, such as fishermen, possess a wide range of knowledge concerning the fish they have experience with. They understand things like the trophic relationships among native and exotic fish species, migratory patterns, and the habitat preferences of the most prized fishes. It has been established that fishermen have a good grasp on classification, and fish biology. This knowledge can be used to improve fishery management strategies. Folk knowledge can be extremely important when expanding biological research.http://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/22-2/SilvanoBegossi2002.pdf = Piracaba River= A small fishery on the Piracaba river in Brazil was the subject of a recent ethnobiological study by Renato et al..http://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/22-2/SilvanoBegossi2002.pdf Researchers wanted to examine the knowledge of the Brazilian fishermen to see how it compared to data in the scientific literature. The fishermen displayed a great deal of knowledge pertaining to diet, predation, distribution, reproduction, and migration. They were more likely be knowledgeable about things such as habitat than reproduction. Though reproduction is imperative to the continuation of the species, knowledge of spawning times has little to no bearing on the fishermen's work. Habitat, however, is a subject in which having knowledge is extremely important. The fishermen must know where the fish live in order to make a good catch. In knowing what a particular species eats, one can determine more precisely where the desired species may be found. Fishermen are also careful to be aware of where the desired species' predators hunt, to ensure that they do not lose some of their catch. The fishermen's knowledge of fish species' habits is increased for species that are common or economically valuable.http://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/22-2/SilvanoBegossi2002.pdf =The Cha-Cha= The Cha Cha, residents of St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, have a strong connection with the fish species in their waters. They are proficient in catching fish through three methods. Traps made of wood, metal, and mesh are used by professional fishermen as well as subsistence fishermen. Subsistence fishermen typically set a few traps in shallow water near their homes, whereas professional fishermen set a large number of traps in deep water. Seining is one of the least common fishing techniques in the Cha Cha culture due to time restraints and yielding an impractically large catch. It is time consuming because it requires a great deal of precision as the technique varies with the size and shape of the fish. It is often considered of lesser importance as the yields are usually so great that the fish cannot all be sold before they spoil. Seining involves using a vertical net that can be drawn up to encircle a school of fish. Handlining, in combination with chumming, is the last of the three methods used by the Cha-Cha. Ten or fifteen pounds of small fish called \\"fry\\" are ground up in a mixture of sand and then tossed into the water. This mixture called chum will attract fish. At this point, hand lines are baited with whole fry. This method results in large harvests of fish. Fish in culture Fish, along with being an important food source, occupy a special place in human culture. Fish star in many novels and movies such as The Old Man and the Sea, Jonah and the Whale, Jaws, Shark Tale and Finding Nemo. Fish have also served a spiritual purpose in some religions. They are important symbols in religions such as Christianity, Hinduism, and Judaism. The Ichthys, a simple fish design, is well known in Christian culture. It is thought to be related to the feeding of the multitudes. Jesus Christ multiplied loaves of bread and fish in order to feed a large gathering of people.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06083a.htm References Category:Ethnology Category:Ichthyology Category:Ethnobiology ","title":"Ethnoichthyology"},{"id":"34525950","text":"A Joseph Plateau Award was an accolade presented by the Flanders International Film Festival Ghent, first awarded in 1985.

Since then, two separate awards were established in Belgium in 2010: the Flemish Film Awards, named Ensor Awards, which are presented each year on the final day of the Ostend Film Festival; and the Magritte Awards, which were established by the Acad√©mie Andr√© Delvaux to recognize cinematic achievement in the francophone film industry.Ensor Academie, filmfestivaloostende.be See also *Cinema of Belgium *Flanders International Film Festival Ghent References External links * * Category:Belgian film awards Category:Television awards Category:Awards established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in Belgium ","title":"Joseph Plateau Award"},{"id":"34525954","text":"Nanbao may refer to the following locations in China: * Nangao, Lingao County (ÂçóÂÆùÈïá), town in Hainan * Nanbao, Luannan County (ÂçóÂ†°Èïá), town in Hebei * Nanbao Township (ÂçóÂ†°‰π°), Handan County, Hebei * Tangshan Nanbao Development Zone (ÂîêÂ±±Â∏ÇÂçóÂ†°ÂºÄÂèëÂå∫), Hebei ","title":"Nanbao"},{"id":"34525961","text":"Lange is a major producer of ski boots used in alpine (downhill) skiing. They introduced the world's first plastic ski boots in 1962, and a greatly improved model aimed at the racing market in 1965. After several World Cup and Olympics wins in 1967 and 1968 made them a must-have on the circuit, Lange has remained a force in the racing market ever since. Their boots have equipped five times as many World Cup medal winners as any other brand into the 2000s. The front- entry design introduced by Lange is used by almost every modern ski boot to this day. Lange remains a major brand worldwide. Bob Lange had been experimenting with plastic reinforced ski boots as early as 1958, but it took some time before the basic design was made usable. The first examples from 1962, built by Lange employee Dave Luensmann, used ABS shells and laces for closure, but were not very successful. A follow-up design released in volume in the winter of 1965/66 used a new thermoplastic shell, hinged cuff, and latching buckles, and became the first commercially successful replacement for leather boots. By 1970 they were almost universal on the racing circuit, and selling hundreds of thousands of examples as the world's leading ski boot brand. Lange entered the hockey market during the 1970s. Lange skates were an outgrowth of their plastic ski boots. Phil Esposito endorsed and used Lange skates. They went out of favor due to their weight non-traditional looks but had the advantages that they were comfortable to wear and offered more protection than traditional skates. A major technical misstep in 1970 led to financial difficulties and the eventual sale of the company to Garcia in 1973. Under the new ownership, the company continued development of the classic front-opening ski boot design. Over a series of models, the cuff began extending up the calf of the leg to greatly improve directional control and reduce lower-leg injuries. Garcia ran into financial difficulties of their own, and their suite of ski products was purchased by the owner of Rossignol in 1978. Under their direction, Lange released the famous bright-orange XL-R and Z designs of the 1980s, versions of which remained the racer's choice well into the 1990s. Modern Lange boots have changed little in design since these models. History =Downhill develops= Alpine skiing developed as a specialization from what was generally a cross-country sport. The downhill portions were shallow, short and had to be skied up, so the majority of the day would be spent in the cross-country striding motion.Morten Lund, \\"A Short History of Alpine Skiing: Frem Telemark to Today\\", Skiing Heritage Journal, Winter 1996, pp. 6-7 As techniques diverged, especially with the widespread introduction of ski lifts, the market for customized downhill equipment rose. A major advance came with the introduction of the Kandahar binding in the 1930s, which allowed the boot to be locked down to the ski during the downhill portions. This provided more control over \\"edging\\", rolling the ski onto its side to generate turning forces. The introduction of the Head Standard ski during the winter of 1950‚Äì1951 furthered this evolution by allowing the skis to hold an edge against the snow with much more force, dramatically improving turning performance. They were such a great improvement, the Standard was known as \\"The Cheater\\" because it allowed any skier to turn with ease.John Dodge, \\"The Cheater\\", Sports Illustrated, 18 December 1961 Like the skis and bindings, ski boots had also evolved from earlier cross-country styles. By the 1950s these were essentially unchanged from the 1800s, consisting of a thick sole with a thinner upper shell of leather, similar to a normal winter boot. A flexible sole allowed the boot to bend forward at the toe to allow the cross- country striding motion. The upper cuff provided little sideways support, as this had not been a serious concern for cross-country. Ideally, for downhill skiing the boot would be rigid side-to-side to transmit rotational forces to the ski, allowing the skier to edge the ski directly. Moreover, in the downhill role there was no need for forward flex of the sole, which was clamped down anyway. =Downhill before Lange= This need led to downhill boots that retained the same basic shoe-like style of earlier designs, but were built much stiffer to allow for greater control. These had the serious drawback of being extremely uncomfortable. This was especially true during the breaking-in period, which might last weeks. One solution had the skier lace up the boots and stand in hot water in a bathtub for an hour to soak, then walk around to allow the leather to move to fit the skier's foot. This had the disadvantage of greatly softening the boot, allowing it to wear out much more quickly. Even if this hot water fitting step wasn't used, strong skiers would wear out their boots in months as the leather softened, and mere weeks if they raced them. This left only a short period of time between the painful break-in period and the time when the boots were too soft to provide good control over the skis. Jean-Claude Killy took to having Michel Arpin ski in his boots while they broke in, giving them to Killy to ski for the few weeks before they wore out. Another solution to improve lateral control was the \\"long thong\\", a leather strap wrapped around the boot and lower leg, which came at the cost of eliminating any sort of quick release. =Lange's first attempts= Robert B. (\\"Bob\\") Lange flew Lockheed P-38 Lightning airplanes for the United States Army Air Forces before leaving to earn a degree at Harvard University, where he studied economics and engineering. It was during this time that he took up skiing, and like many other beginner skiers of the era, found himself dismayed by the relative antiquity of the designs. (Contrast with the Head Standard ski). Lange had another problem to solve; his size 9-1/2 triple-E wide feet demanded custom boots, which he ordered from Peter Limmer. These were not stiff enough for his liking, so Lange attempted to fix this by cutting strips of fiberglass left over from covering his boat, and gluing them to his boots using polyester resin. This 1948 attempt is the earliest recorded attempt at a plastic-reinforced boot. After graduating in 1949 he joined his family insurance business in Dubuque, Iowa, but did this only for a short time. Lange opened Hawkeye Plastics Corporation in the basement of the old Brunswick Radio Company factory, which had gone bankrupt during the Great Depression. In 1955 he received his first contract, from the Eska Company also located in Dubuque, when General Motors asked Eska for 30,000 kiddie-cars in the form of the 1956 Corvette.. Lange's company produced the plastic Corvette bodies for Eska. Over the next few years the company produced a variety of fiberglass products, including hula-hoops and the interiors for refrigerators. Throughout, Lange continued to experiment with improvements to ski boots, buying numerous pairs to cut them up and see if they could be re-enforced to make them stronger. Lange was not the only designer to attempt this, and several boots soaked in epoxy or other glues were available in the 1950s. None of these offered any great improvement, and lacing them up was even more difficult than before. Lange had built several models with epoxy or polyester by 1958, later claiming to have skied a successful all-plastic boot in 1957. =Royalite= Fiberglass simply didn't have the right combination of features for an all-plastic boot. As part of the Corvette contract, Lange's Hawkeye Plastics had sub-contracted the seats to another local plastics company, run by David Luensmann. Luensmann had made the seats for the cars by vacuum-molding Royalite, an ABS plastic from Uniroyal. When Lange's Hawkeye went out of business, enough of this material was left over to experiment with boot designs, and Lange asked Luensmann to try it. Luensmann used strips of the material in a heat press to melt them into a single shell. He handed the results to Lange the next year, in the summer of 1961. After trying them that winter, Lange asked Luensmann to join him in a new company dedicated to making plastic boots. For mass production, the two built a vacuum press to shape the cuffs from larger sections of Royalite. This produced an extremely stiff boot suitable only for the most powerful racers. Attempting to solve the problem, they struck on the solution of molding the boot in two separate parts and joining them through rivets on either side, at the level of the ankle. This allowed the boot to retain all the lateral stiffness of the original design, while allowing the forward flex to be better controlled. The new design, in blue and white, was released in limited numbers in 1962. Several people tried them out and reported a number of minor design issues, especially the problems lacing them up which often required two people. Levered buckles were an obvious solution, first invented by Hans Martin and introduced to the market in 1955 on the Henke Speedfit. However, Henke held the patent on the concept and Lange was reluctant to pay for a license. By the winter of 1963 they had managed to fill only a small number of their orders and even smaller number were in use. These few boots suffered a number of mechanical failures that were traced to the poor performance of ABS plastic in low temperatures. =Adiprene= The Lange Swinger, part of the \\"2nd generation\\" lineup from around 1968. These early examples clearly trace their ancestry to the leather boots they replaced, including a leather-like mottled surface treatment. In late 1962 DuPont provided a solution, a new pourable polyurethane plastic known as Adiprene. This material was much less affected by the cold, but had the distinct disadvantage that it could not be vacuum-molded, as it needed to be used in liquid form. Instead, it had to be heated and poured into a mold and then allowed to cool and set. This made it much more time consuming to use in production, but the advantages were too great to ignore. The company spent most of 1963 trying to solve the production problems, ignoring the growing list of orders for the older ABS models. In the end, no production of the new design was undertaken that year, leading to friction with his sales partners. In 1965 Lange finally added Henke-like buckles to his boots when that company gave up the patent. Not only did the buckle make it easy to close even the stiffest boots, the plastic spread the load across the entire cuff, applying even pressure to the foot. Leather designs tended to distort where the buckles attached, leading to tight spots on the foot and eventually damaging the leather. It was not until 1965 they had built a new molding machine known as \\"Mickey Mouse\\" that could inject the Adiprene to speed production. This system was only marginally functional, and only 600 pairs of boots were produced that year. It was not until early 1966 that full production was able to start and 1,000 pairs had been completed. By the end of the year the number stood at 6,000, doubling in 1967 to 12,000, and again in 1968 to 25,000. By this time, Rosemount Engineering had introduced their own all-synthetic boot. Unlike the Lange, the Rosemount design was made of rigid fiberglass and split open in two parts to put it on. Like Lange, they were only able to produce small numbers of boots, about 900 pair, for the 1965/66 season.Paul Stewart, \\"A Revolutionary New Ski Boot Has A Streamlined Shell Of Rigid Fiber Glass\\", Sports Illustrated, 15 November 1965 Many sources make the claim that Rosemount was first to introduce a plastic boot commercially, but it appears that both were available in limited numbers at the same time. In any event, Lange's earlier Royalite models clearly pre-date any of the Rosemount examples. =Commercial success= 1968's Lady Lange Competite was the first women's-specific race boot, the companion to the Comp model. It differs from the Comp in that it uses a single large flap over the front of the boot, a design note that did not continue on future models. Production was not the only issue; the new design also needed a test market to popularize it. Lange approached the United States ski team hoping to have them test the new design. However, they were being supplied by Heirling, and weren't interested. In January 1966, Lange called Dave Jacob, who was at that time coaching the Canadian ski team. Lange asked if Jacob would be willing to try the new boots with the Canadian team. Jacob agreed and several team members tried them out, but he noted that \\"they were really bad boots.\\" Lange paid Jacob's way to Dubuque to help implement solutions for his concerns. In June 1966 five pairs of boots incorporating these changes were shipped to Mount Hood, where the Canadian team was training. Gerry Rinaldi, Rod Hebron and Nancy Greene tried them on and approved. Soon after, Greene won the Golden Rose Race on the new boots. Lange then flew to the 1966 World Championships in Portillo, Chile and handed out examples to anyone willing to test them. He carried around a tape recorder, asking for any suggestions on how to improve the design. When Hebron and Suzy Chaffee showed dramatic improvement during the races, the new boot became an object of serious curiosity. Curiosity changed to must-have when Greene started winning races in 1967 on the newly formed World Cup circuit, and eventually took the gold medal.Nancy Greene, \\"Questions and Answers\\", Nancy Greene official website Five medals were won on Lange boots at the 1968 Winter Olympics, making them the most-winning brand of the competition. At the Olympics, Lange signed a deal with Dynamic to produce their line of skis for the North American market. The company went public in 1969, and used the proceeds to purchase land in Broomfield, Colorado, building a 40,000 square foot (3,700 m2) boot factory, a 42,000 square foot (3,900 m2) ski factory, and a 20,000 square foot (1,900 m2) warehouse. The new factories dramatically improved production, and over the 1969 season alone the company shipped 100,000 pairs of boots. 1969 was the breakthrough year for the company. Three models were on the market to serve different performance levels, the Standard for recreational skiing, the Pro for more demanding use, and the Comp for downhill racing. There was only one competitor, Rosemont, but their product was based on fiberglass and used a side-opening system that was clearly inferior to Lange's boots and could only compete on the low-end, in spite of a high-end price. By the end of the season, Lange was being sold at hundreds of stores across the country at prices no one else could demand. To reach new markets, plans for a new boot factory in Montebelluna, Italy started, along with another in Montreal to produce ice skates using similar concepts and materials. The Montreal plant was later expanded to sell ski boots to Europe as well, avoiding import tariffs on US products. On top of this, at the 1970 World Championships at Val Gardena, Billy Kidd won the gold medal in Combined on Lange boots, and Lange or Dynamic took medals in every event, men and women's. =Lange-flo= Alden Hanson of Dow Chemical contacted Lange in 1970 to tell them about a new material the company had invented. The new plastic retained a putty-like texture in any weather, and Hanson's son had used it to make boots with a layer of the material sandwiched between a normal leather boot and a hard fiberglass shell. The material was a natural fit with Lange's plastic boots, fitting between the liner and shell. When Lange staff tried it, they unanimously supported it. The timing proved difficult, however; 200,000 pairs of boots were planned for the 1970‚Äì1971 season, and if they were going to use the newly christened \\"Lange-flo\\" it would have to go into production before there was time for extensive testing. Lange decided to press ahead, putting it in all of their boots for the next model year. The boots were launched with a provocative advertising campaign of a woman wearing the new boots and a cat-suit with the same boot buckles holding it closed, in place of a zipper or buttons. The only wording simply stated \\"soft inside\\".\\"History of the Lange Girls\\" , Skiingmag This was the first of a series of provocative ads now referred to simply as \\"the Lange girls\\".Tom Winter, \\"Lange boots revolutionary in more ways than one\\", Vail Daily, 30 December 2004 Although the Lange-flo worked, the vinyl liner that held it proved to crack after hard use,Most sources suggest that the Lange-flo interacted chemically with the vinyl and broke it down. and let the Lange-flo squeeze into the boot. The solution was to place the Lange-flo in a separate plastic bag outside the liner, but as the liners were sown into the boot, this required a recall to re-fit them. About 20,000 of the 200,000 boots shipped that season returned to the factory.Lund suggests that the recall resulted in close to 90% of all the Lange-flo boots being returned for work, but other sources place it at 10%. In their attempt to deal with the problem in a timely fashion, new staff were added and theft became a problem. Bad record keeping and lost tags led to many boots being shipped to the wrong people. Many simply never received their boots back. At about the same time, Dynamic started protesting its agreement with Lange, while cash was needed to start the Canadian plant and introduce the new skate design. Emergency loans kept the company going through 1971, when they reported a $1.5 million loss, largely due to the warrantee work due to Lange-flo. The next year Hanson introduced their rear-entry design, the first real competitor. Lange shares continued to drop throughout. In 1973 a further round of funding failed, and Lange sold the company to Garcia Company, owners of the Mitchell Reel fishing tackle company and tennis brands that was building a ski portfolio. Lange signed on as a consultant to Garcia, but didn't like the results. He left the company shortly thereafter, in July 1974. =Extending upward= Early plastic boots, like their earlier leather cousins, rose just above the ankle and provided little support if the skier leaned forward or back. Around 1966 the French developed a new short-turn technique called avalement that stored energy by bending the tail of the ski and then using this to accelerate out of turns. This required the skier to lean back on the skis, and to support this style, skiers took to adding any number of ad-hoc solutions to add support at the back. During the 1970‚Äì1971 season, Jack Nagel introduced the \\"Jet-Stix\\", an aftermarket accessory designed to be used on plastic boots from Lange or Rosemont. The Jet-Stix consisted of a fiberglass extension shaped like a shoehorn that strapped on under the top buckle so it lay along the back of the calf. These allowed the skier to lean back and raise the front of the ski upward with ease.Northwest Skier, 27 November 1970, p. 11 Lange quickly followed with their own version, the Lange Spoiler.Northwest Skier, 16 October 1970, p. 11 Similar devices were common through 1970. In 1967 Nordica introduced a new injection-moulded \\"hybrid\\" design that wrapped a stiff shell around a conventional leather boot. The innerboot was removable for custom fit work, a major advance over Lange's cemented-in liner. This saw little interest, but Nordica followed this in 1969 with their Astral design, a direct attack on Lange. Their introduction of the bright yellow Astral Slalom in 1972, better known as the \\"Banana Boot\\", incorporated a spoiler directly into the cuff and eliminated the need for a separate device. Soon Nordica were selling 400,000 pairs a year, Lange's first serious competition in the market. For the 1971-1972 season, Lange introduced the \\"Comp II\\" boot, following on their earlier Comp series racing boots but incorporating the higher back similar to the Nordica design. The Comp II was soon joined by the Pro II, and then by midrange Banshee with four buckles of an improved design. This change set off an industry-wide evolution to ever- higher cuffs, culminating in the 1980s with cuffs that rise about half way to the knee. Some designs, the \\"knee highs\\", had secondary cuffs that rose to just below the knee.Seth Masia, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Knee-High Boot\\", Skiing Heritage Journal, pp. 17-18 Under Garcia, Lange continued to improve the boot design, while at the same time they introduced Lange branded skis based on Dynamic models, purchased the Burt ski binding, and added a range of products like ski poles and goggles. Garcia became the first company to offer a complete range of ski gear as an integrated set. Throughout, Garcia's main product line remained its fishing gear, and during the mid-1970s a wave of Japanese competitors arrived and quickly pushed them out of the fishing market. The company went bankrupt in 1978, after owning Lange for only four years. =Boix-Vives and Rossignol= The XL-R cemented Lange's reputation as the racer's boot of choice. Modern boots are little changed from this example from the early 1980s. The Z-R followed the XL-R with a number of minor upgrades. The buckles lock closed, and are released by pulling on the small tabs. A control for the \\"cant\\" of the boot has been added, the small black square over the ankle. Minor changes like this followed all the way to current examples. When Garcia's bankruptcy put them on the market, Rossignol, the famous ski company, was looking to enter the tennis market. Rossignol purchased Garcia's existing tennis production lines and started selling off the other divisions; when Lange skis and Burt bindings failed to find a buyer they were closed down. The same fate awaited Lange boots, but Rossignol's CEO, Laurent Boix-Vives, purchased the company personally through a Swiss holding company, Ski Expansion. New warehouses were opened in Williston and Colchester, Vermont, where Rossignol and Dynastar skis were sent for distribution into the North American market. For a time, Dynastar skis made in the Authier factory were sold under the Lange brand in the United States. During the late 1970s, the rising United States dollar exchange rate and historically-high interest rates made United States operations increasingly expensive. Many North American ski companies found themselves unable to compete with Europe, even as the ski industry was being hit by low participation rates for the same economic reasons. In 1982 Boix-Vives closed the Garcia factories, including Lange in Colorado, moving all boot production to Lange's factory in Italy. Research and development for Lange remained in Colorado. In 1982 they introduced the famous bright-orange XL-R design. The XL-R had a number of improvements over earlier models. Among these was a new buckle design; previous designs generally use a metal loop attached on one side of the cuff and a buckle with a rack cut into the bottom attached to the other. For tighter settings the loop had to be inserted into a rack cut higher on the buckle, lowering the mechanical advantage and making it much harder to close. The new design moved the rack to one cuff and put the metal loop on the buckle itself. This offered steady mechanical advantage on any setting. The new four-buckle system is largely identical to any modern downhill ski boot. The XL-R was a runaway hit on the racing market and soon followed by the XL-S and XL-T versions for different performance levels. The XL series were also well known for the way they allowed water to leak into the boot where the lower cuffs folded over each other near the toe, and prompted many owners to cover the area with duct tape. The liners also tended to \\"pack down\\" fairly quickly, flattening out and no longer offering support. An improved version of the basic XL design was later introduced as the Z-model, which included a new low-profile locking buckle design that would not accidentally open once locked, and a small plastic tab in front of the toe flaps to prevent snow forcing its way in. Meanwhile, the Italian factory at Montebelluna was experimenting with a new custom-fit liner, using a thermosetting plastic called Thermofit. Pressed by rapid changes in the market, notably Salomon's introduction of their hugely successful rear-entry boot line, the Thermofit system was developed as a way to remain on the leading edge. Betting the company on the new system, it failed in testing, leaving the company with no catchy designs. Among the failed attempts to address this problem were in-boot heaters, the CFX and SPE rear-entry designs largely identical to Salomon models, and a \\"mid-entry\\" boot with cable closure, the Mid. Of all of these, only the mid-entry design would be at all successful the market. This design combines a traditional lower boot with a split upper cuff like that of a rear- entry design. The lower portion buckled down to provide strong support, whereas conventional rear-entry boots were sometimes noted for the lack of support for the forward foot and general softness in the leg cuff. Lange no longer produces a mid-entry design, and examples from other companies are also becoming rare. By the late 1980s, Rossignol was in the process of building out their own line of products similar to Garcia's earlier attempts. This led to their purchase of Dynastar and other ski brands. In 1989 they purchased Lange from Boix-Vives, ending Lange ski production. Lange was partnered with Dynastar skis and (after 1994) Look bindings, a pairing that remains to this day. In 2001, Lange continued to be the brand of racing, equipping five times as many many medal-winning skiers in the World Cup as any other brand. =Quiksilver= In March 2005, after years of cycling profits that followed the United States dollar exchange rate, and facing retirement at age 78, Boix- Vives decided to sell his stake in Rossignol. His share was purchased for $55 million by the Australian/United States sporting wear company, Quiksilver, part of a larger $213 million deal. Boix-Vives took over operations of Rossignol's golf division. Quiksilver consolidated all of their North American operations in Park City, Utah. Unfortunately for Quiksilver, this was occurring in a period of poor snow, and profits plummeted. In 2007 several board members, including Boix-Vives, quit the company. With no experienced managers left, and losses on the order of $50 million in the skiing divisions, Quiksilver soon put the company up for sale. In August 2008, Quiksilver announced that it would be selling the Rossignol group to Chartreuse & Mont Blanc, a wholly owned shell company formed by Macquarie Group of Australia.Andrea Chang, \\"Quiksilver to sell Rossignol ski unit\\", Los Angeles Times, 28 August 2008 In July 2013, Macquairie sold the Rossignol Group, along with its subsidiaries Lange and Dynastar, to a partnership of Altor Equity Partners (a Swedish investment group) and the Boix-Vives family.

At that meeting Mrs. Roosevelt asked about the Oak Knoll project, a subdivision where Palmer and his brother-in-law, Richard Sawtell, were building houses of living room, dining room, kitchen, and two bedrooms to sell for $3,250. The payments of $25.50 a month included taxes and insurance under the government's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) program. The President commented that the payments toward purchase of the homes were materially less than most rents at that time. Roosevelt was delighted that private enterprise could provide good homes at moderate rentals. Upon the President's question as to whether the government's help in slum clearance would interfere with such private projects, Palmer remarked that the public housing program in Britain had helped materially to expand the operations of the Building Societies there. He compared that to the same situation in the US where public housing did not serve as a pace setter, and where housing improvement projects in the private sector had actually contracted despite FHA support. Oak Knoll thus served as an early example of success of FHA-backed housing schemes, but also as a driver to move forward with public housing in national policy.

He was participating in a checkout mission for the First International Saturation Study of Herring and Hydroacoustics (FISSHH) project. and , cited in The Helgoland habitat. Wendler, a 36-year- old experienced diver, and two other German aquanauts began the two-day/two- night checkout mission on September 21, 1975. All three divers were employees of the German firm Gesellschaft fur Kernenergieverwertung in Schiffbau und Schiffahrt mbH (GKSS), which operated the Helgoland habitat. On September 23 the three Germans were joined by two American divers: Lieutenant Commander Laurence Bussey of the United States Navy, the head of the project for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Roger Clifford, a fisheries scientist from NOAA's laboratory at Woods Hole.Miller and Koblick, pp. 115, 117. The dates given come from Miller and Koblick; the dates in the Ocean Science News article do not agree. Wendler, Bussey, and another of the German aquanauts, Joachim Rediske, proceeded to undergo a 49-hour decompression inside Helgoland, which was completed at 6:30 p.m. on September 24. Their return to the surface was then delayed by 15 hours due to bad weather and in order to enable them to surface in daylight.Miller and Koblick, p. 264. At 11:30 a.m. on September 25 the three aquanauts surfaced; Wendler was hampered by gear he was carrying. It was later theorized by Captain George F. Bond, the \\"Father of Saturation Diving\\", who was participating in the project, that Wendler may have been lifted ten feet or more by a passing swell just after taking a deep breath. The change in pressure would have allowed bubbles from his lungs to enter his circulatory system. In the final 15 feet before reaching the surface, Wendler suffered a massive gas embolism. Having reached the surface, Wendler clung to a buoy and waved for help. He was brought by the diving tender boat to Rockport, Massachusetts, and received oxygen, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and external heart massage aboard the boat. Upon arrival in Rockport, Wendler was placed in a portable recompression chamber at the project's headquarters at the Ralph Waldo Emerson Inn, where he was recompressed to 165 feet. Wendler spent two hours in the chamber, attended by GKSS medical supervisor Anthony Low, M.D., before being pronounced dead. NOAA convened a board of investigation, headed by Dr. J. Morgan Wells of NOAA's Manned Undersea Science and Technology (MUST) office. The board concluded that Wendler's death \\"was in no way connected with the systems in the habitat or the decompression procedures\\". NOAA Associate Administrator David Wallace ordered that, in order for FISSHH to continue, a recompression chamber must be made available on the dive boat. On November 21, 1975, an American aquanaut experienced either central nervous system bends or an embolism on surfacing from Helgoland; he was successfully treated but experienced some residual disability.Miller and Koblick, p. 118.

Workers have a black shiny colour and a length of about 4‚Äì6 mm, females are larger (6‚Äì6.5 mm) and small males reach a length of 4.5‚Äì5 mm). The head is heart-shaped. Distribution The species has a wide distribution in Europe and Asia, from Portugal and Ireland in the west, Finland in the north to Italy in the south, and eastwards to Korea and Japan. In the UK, records suggest that while occasionally found further North before 1970, it is now found mostly south of The Wash, in East Anglia and Southern England, with a few colonies found in Ireland.  Physiology and behavior  To communicate alarm, the species has been known to dispense Dendrolasin (C15H22O), a Terpenoid compound, from their mandibular glands. The species is associated with the Nitidulid beetle Amphotis marginata, called the \\"highwayman\\" of the local ant world. The beetles occupy shelters along the foraging trails of L. fuliginosis. When night comes, they patrol the trails and take food from the ants returning to the nest. They specifically target those ants with a lot of food in their bodies. They trick ants into regurgitating into their mouths, a common act between ants and other animals called \\"trophallaxis\\". The ants soon realize they have been tricked and begin to fight the beetle. The beetle responds by removing itself from the ants' mouths and flattening its body to the ground in a way that ants cannot roll them over and effectively combat them. Environment The species builds a \\"cardboard\\" nest in old hollow trees, using \\"board\\" ‚Äì a mixture of chewed wood with saliva. A nest contains only one queen, but a large colony can contain as many as 15,000 workers. Like other black ants they tend populations of aphids for their honeydew, and can often be seen travelling in both directions, following scent-trails for long distances to their source of food, which is often a tree. The trails the species make to forage and transport food commonly last for months. As the workers clear the paths of vegetation and debris, making the path easy for massive amounts of ants to travel efficiently. They rarely carry other insects back to the nest. Reproduction as a hyperparasite While other black ants such as Lasius niger, the smaller but much more common (in the UK) species, a queen founds its own nest by laying eggs and then feeding the new larvae with a fluid produced by breaking down its own muscles; a process that leaves her very weak as she cannot tend the larvae and forage for food at the same time. A post-nuptial queen of Lasius fuliginosus cannot found her own nests, but establishes a nest through social parasitism in another species of the same genus - Lasius umbratus, a rare yellow ant with an underground habit (unlike the common yellow ant Lasius flavus which makes small mounds in grass and lawns). She kills or ousts the existing queen and lays eggs, which the existing workers tend. Her offspring workers then slowly take over the nest. Lasius umbratis also establishes its nest in a similar way, by taking over the nest of Lasius niger, the common black ant, so Lasius fuliginosus is sometimes referred to as a hyperparasite.

He has also taught as Visiting Professor in Venice and at the Kennedy Institute (Freie Universit√§t) and Humboldt- Universit√§t in Berlin. Academic writing The subject of Chametzky's Ph.D. dissertation--the plays of John Marston--reflected both his early interest in theater and the then dominant tastes of the New Criticism; his most influential writings on literature would respond instead to the themes of regionalism and ethnicity in other authors, such as Faulkner and Bellow, first read during his graduate school years. Typical of this work is the essay \\"Broadening the Canon: A Consideration of Regional, Ethnic, Racial, and Sexual Factors,\\" which argues that the importance of authors such as George Washington Cable, Abraham Cahan, Charles W. Chesnutt, and Kate Chopin is missed when they are read as regional or \\"local color\\" writers. A collection of Chametzky's essays would later borrow from this essay's title in order to give a general description of his scholarship.Our Decentralized Literature: Cultural Mediations in Selected Jewish and Southern Writers.

From its inception, the magazine had the support of the German and History departments as well as English, and when the English professor Sidney Kaplan--who would in 1970 become a founding member of the University's W.E.B. Du Bois Department of Afro-American Studies--joined the planning committee, the magazine's scope extended further.David R. Clark, \\"Jules Chametzky's Memo (October 23, 1958),\\" Massachusetts Review, Vol. 44, No. 1/2, (2003), pp. 19-20 In a chapter from Enlarging America, the Harvard literary scholar Susanne Klingentein offers a description by Chametzky of the publication's editorial goals during its formative years: ‚ÄúWe wanted to break the logjam of ideas represented by the New Criticism and formalism,‚Äù he comments; publishing so-called \\"marginal\\" voices (e.g., Jewish, black, and women writers) was one way of \\"letting in fresh political and ideological currents.\\"Klingenstein, p. 191 Responding to the tumultuous times, in 1969 Chametzky and Kaplan put together a collection of essays from the first ten years of MR; Julius Lester, in the New York Times, called Black and White in American Culture \\"a rare anthology [...] with a higher degree of relevance than almost any other book of its kind.\\"Julius Lester, \\"For America, on the Eve of its Second Civil War.\\" New York Times, March 29, 1970.

Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1969 In 1967, when the Council of Literary Magazines and Presses (CLMP) was formed by combining two previous organizations, Chametzky was a founding member and its first secretary. The organization's original name, the \\"Coordinating Council of Literary Magazines\\" was given by Chametzky, chosen in order to allude to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee or SNCC. The other signatories to the original NEH grant request letter were editors of other prominent reviews: Robie Macauley, William Phillips, George Plimpton, and Reed Whittemore.Pauline Uchmanowicz, \\"A Brief History of CCLM/CLMP.\\" Massachusetts Review, Vol. 44, No. 1/2, (2003), pp. 72-74.; \\"About CLMP, CLMP History\\" Council of Literary Magazines and Presses Public service Having joined the NAACP in 1950, at the University of Minnesota, Chametzky headed the organization's committee on fair employment practices, and was \\"intensely involved in Minnesota's passing of the first American Fair Practices Employment Act\\".Klingenstein, p.181 Differing with their position on the national (i.e., Jewish/Zionist) question, disagreeing that social realism was the best way to judge or write literature, and opposing Stalinist methods of dealing with political opposition, Chametzky refused to join the American Communist Party.Klingenstein, p.181 His self-definition as \\"a member of the non-communist--i.e. social democratic, or democratic socialist--left\\"E-mail communication from Chametzky to Jim Hicks, February 4, 2012 was confirmed definitively by the trial and execution of Rudolf Slansky, a Czech Jew, formerly Secretary-General of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Such decisions, however, were no protection when in January 1954 Chametzky was named by a witness before the U.S. Justice Department's Subversive Activities Control Board. The case received extensive coverage in the local papers, and Chametzky was called to testify before a special Investigating Committee headed by the University of Minnesota President. He was eventually cleared later that same year.Klingenstein, p. 182-84 Chametzky was a union man from an early age, and a member of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) during his Brooklyn years.\\"Bruce Laurie Talks Union with Jules Chametzky: An Interview.\\" Massachusetts Review, Vol. 44, No. 1/2, (2003), p. 47 At the University of Massachusetts, he supported the Massachusetts Society of Professors (MSP) from its inception in 1972-73, and became the union's third President in 1979-80.Bruce Laurie, \\"Jules Chametzky's Union Years.\\" Massachusetts Review, Vol. 44, No. 1/2, (2003), p. 34 A key accomplishment of his tenure at that post was reconciling the union on the Amherst campus with its members (fewer, though more radicalized) from the University's Boston campus--and developing operating procedures for resolving disputes between them.\\"Laurie Talks Union,\\" pp. 53-4; Laurie, pp. 44-5 Chametzky was also responsible for opening direct lines of communication with the campus administration, and for establishing a cooperative relationship between union and administration on some issues.Laurie, pp. 41-2 He served two terms in Washington as an editor for Thought and Action, the National Education Association journal for higher education.

Personal life He was born in Bergen as a son of merchant and banker Lyder Wentzel Nicolaysen (1794‚Äì1876) and Cathrine Margrethe Wilhelmine Bernhoft (1808‚Äì1871). He was a half-brother of Nicolay Nicolaysen and first cousin of Niels Aars Nicolaysen. In April 1859 in Borre he married his first cousin Bolette Marie Berentine Nicolaysen (1835‚Äì1922). They had the sons Johan Nicolaysen, Lyder Wenzel Nicolaysen and Wilhelm Nicolaysen. He was also an uncle of Lyder Wentzel Christie Nicolaysen and grandfather of Knud Dahl Nicolaysen. Career He finished his secondary education in 1849 and graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.med. degree in 1856. He worked in Christiania, Krager√∏ and M√∏re before becoming a surgeon for army companies in Stockholm (1857‚Äì1860) and Christiania (1862). He was hired at Rikshospitalet in 1863; from 1867 to 1870 he was a research fellow at the university (including thirteen months in the United States). He was a professor at the university and chief physician at Rikshospitalet, until retiring from both posts in 1908. His special field was surgery, but he was also a prominent scholar in dentistry. He was the first in Norway to perform ovarectomy (1866), resection in the knee (1881) and resection in the bowel (1885). He also contributed significantly to the introduction of antiseptic, later aseptic methods in surgery. He chaired the Norwegian Medical Society in 1880, received an honorary degree at the University of Copenhagen in 1879 and was a fellow in the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1875.

It held that no comparator (for instance to a sick man) is necessary to establish discrimination against a pregnant woman. It was unusual in that Carole Louise Webb, the applicant, was represented throughout by a community law centre, the Hillingdon Legal Resource Centre (HLRC), later renamed the Hillingdon Law Centre, the only time that a British law centre case went to the European Court of Justice. The law centre's in-house barrister Michael Shrimpton argued the case before the Industrial Tribunal at London North in February 1988. He was also junior counsel to the late John Melville Williams QC in the Employment Appeal Tribunal and, by then in private practice, appeared at the compensation hearing in 1999. The case was one of the longest-running in British legal history. Facts EMO Air Cargo had an employee called Mrs Stewart who had taken maternity leave. Miss Webb was hired to replace Mrs Stewart, though it was envisaged that she would stay on working after Mrs Stewart came back. Then, however, it transpired that Miss Webb was also pregnant and due to give birth at around the same time as Mrs Stewart. Miss Webb was dismissed. She claimed this was sex discrimination under SDA 1975 s 1(1). The employer argued she was unable to carry out the tasks for which she was recruited. The Court of Appeal held that a sick man, who was the appropriate comparator, would have been treated similarly. The House of Lords referred to the ECJ. Judgment =European Court of Justice= The ECJ referred to the Dekker case and reaffirmed that pregnancy discrimination was sex discrimination. There is no need for a comparison with a man who is ill. This followed from article 2(1) and article 5(1) of Directives 76/207/EEC and 92/85/EC. The ECJ's ruling was mutatis mutandis along the lines of the argument put before the Industrial Tribunal and prepared entirely in-house by Hillingdon law centre. =House of Lords= The House of Lords applied the decision of the ECJ. Lord Keith had said, ‚ÄòThe relevant circumstance for purposes of the comparison required by section 5(3) to be made is expected unavailability at the material time‚Ä¶ [though the] precise reason for the unavailability is not a relevant circumstance, and in particular it is not relevant that the reason is a condition which is capable of affecting only women or, for that matter, only men‚Äô. However, now Lord Keith said when the answer had returned from the ECJ the following.

Muise is noted for litigating the first Constitutional challenge to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act‚Äîcommonly referred to as \\"Obamacare\\". On August 10, 2011, the National Law Journal named him the Appellate Lawyer of the Week for his legal efforts in this case. Other case highlights include participating in the defense of retired LtCol Jeffrey Chessani of the Haditha killings (United States v. LtCol Jeffrey Chessani, USMC) and his successful defense of four Christian missionaries arrested in 2010 for breach of the peace while evangelizing at an Arab festival in Dearborn, Michigan (City of Dearborn v. David Wood, et al.,). Education and background After receiving his undergraduate degree in 1987 from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, Muise served thirteen years as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. He first served as an infantry officer for 9 years, during which time he participated in the Persian Gulf War. While a captain on active duty, he attended Notre Dame Law School, graduating summa cum laude in 1997. Prior to resigning his commission in 2000, Muise served several years as a Marine Judge Advocate while attaining the rank of major. His personal military decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, and the Navy Achievement Medal. Notable cases =United States v. LtCol Jeffrey Chessani, USMC= Muise was one of the attorneys defending Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani, a retired Marine battalion commander, during a court martial involving charges arising out of an insurgent attack against Marines in Haditha, Iraq in November 2005. The allegations against Chessani were for failing to properly report and investigate what is known as the Haditha killings.New Turn In Haditha Case Involving 2 Local Marines; ABC News; October 20, 2007 =American Freedom Defense Initiative v. Metropolitan Transit Authority= Muise, along with co- counsel David Yerushalmi, has represented the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI) -- an anti-Islamization organization founded by Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer‚Äîin several legal actions against various transportation authorities around the country, who have refused to run several of AFDI's proposed pro-Israel/anti-sharia advertisements. On January 31, 2012, the American Freedom Law Center (AFLC) filed a request for a preliminary injunction in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of the State of New York (MTA), seeking to have the MTA run an AFDI \\"pro-Israel / anti-Jihad\\" bus advertisement. On Friday, July 20, 2012, Federal Judge Paul Engelmayer ruled that the MTA violated the First Amendment rights of AFDI when it rejected their advertisement. =Constitutional challenges to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act= On March 23, 2010, Muise and co-counsel David Yerushalmi filed the first federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Thomas More Law Center et al. v. Pres. Obama et al. The case was filed in Detroit, Michigan on behalf of four Michigan residents who did not have health insurance and who objected to the Act's individual mandate, which required them to purchase insurance. On October 7, 2010, the judge ruled against the plaintiffs. The case was appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. which also ruled against the plaintiffs and upheld the individual mandate. Muise and Yerushalmi filed for a U.S. Supreme Court review, and in June 2012, the Supreme Court ruled against the plaintiffs and upheld the individual mandate. In 2012, Muise and Yerushalmi co-authored an article published in Duke University Press's online version of the Journal of Health Politics, Policy, and Law, entitled, \\"Wearing the Crown of Solomon? Chief Justice Roberts and the Affordable Care Act 'Tax'\\", which criticized the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts in the United States Supreme Court's ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. In July 2014, American Freedom Law Center v. Obama, et al, was filed by the American Freedom Law Center which charged the Obama administration of violating its constitutional duty to \\"faithfully execute\\" the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. On May 15, 2015, the court dismissed the lawsuit for lack of standing.American Freedom Law Center v. Obama; AFLC Website; May 15, 2015 In August 2014, Yerushalmi and Muise took over the appeal of Cutler v. United States Department of Health and Human Services, et al. Cutler had challenged the constitutionality of the Act, both on its face and as applied to him and his constituents. Cutler had asserted that the provision requiring individuals to obtain health insurance coverage or face monetary penalties violates the religion clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and a previous Supreme Court Decision, \\"1947 Everson v Board of Education\\", and allows the government to favor one religion over another religion. Cutler sought a declaration that the Act is unconstitutional, invalid, and unenforceable. Cutler also sought to \\"roll back\\" the law to the status it had prior to 2014 on various grounds, arguing that the law now violates the Constitution by allowing unequal protection under the law (referring to the extension of pre-tax subsidies until October 1, 2016, but only if the state insurance commissioner agrees.http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations-and- Guidance/Downloads/transition-to-compliant-policies-03-06-2015.pdf) The court dismissed the case for lack of standing. Notice of appeal was filed by Cutler on July 25, 2014, and then Yerushalmi and Muise from the American Freedom Law Center were contacted to handle the appeal. On October 16, 2014 an injunction pending appeal was filed based on \\"unequal treatment under the law\\". AFLC's opening brief was filed on February 4, 2015. Oral arguments were presented by Muise on May 12, 2015.http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/recordings/recordings2015.nsf/F739B9F1F31FDDFA85257E43005AE4CE/$file/14-5183.mp3http://www.americanfreedomlawcenter.org/case/jeffrey- cutler-v-u-s-dept-of-health-human- services/http://townhall.com/columnists/justinhaskins/2015/05/12/the-most- important-obamacare-case-youve-never-heard-of-n1997884 In February 2014, Muise, on behalf of the American Freedom Law Center, was one of the attorneys who filed an appeal of the dismissal of a lawsuit filed on behalf of Priests for Life, a national, Catholic, pro-life organization based in New York City. The lawsuit challenged the constitutionality of the Health and Human Services contraceptive mandate. The case was dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge Frederic Block for lack of ripeness because the government stated that the new implementing regulations would not be finalized until August 1, 2013.http://www.americanfreedomlawcenter.org/wp- content/uploads/2013/09/Opening-Brief-Filed.pdf On November 6, 2015 the Supreme Court of the United States decided it will review the case combined with 6 other similar challenges to the contraceptive mandate under the case name Zubik v. Burwell.http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/11/court-to-hear-birth- control-challenges/http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/zubik-v- burwell/https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-1453.htmhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-1505.htmhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-105.htm =Saieg v. City of Dearborn= In 2009, Muise successfully challenged the city of Dearborn, Michigan's restriction on a Christian pastor's right to distribute religious literature to Muslims at the city's annual Arab International Festival. In May 2011, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the restriction was unreasonable, and ruled that Dearborn and its police department \\"violated Saieg's First Amendment right to freedom of speech.\\" =Catholic League et al. v. City of San Francisco= Muise filed a federal lawsuit against the City of San Francisco on behalf of the Catholic League and two Catholic citizens after the city passed an official resolution condemning the Catholic Church's teaching which opposed adoptions by homosexual couples. The resolution, adopted March 21, 2006, referred to the Vatican as a \\"foreign country\\" meddling in the affairs of the city and proclaimed the Church's moral teaching and beliefs on homosexuality as \\"insulting to all San Franciscans\\", \\"hateful\\", \\"insulting and callous\\", \\"defamatory\\", \\"absolutely unacceptable\\", \\"insensitive\\", and \\"ignorant\\". The resolution made reference to the Inquisition; and it urged the Archbishop of San Francisco and Catholic Charities of San Francisco to defy Church directives. According to the lawsuit, the Establishment Clause of the Constitution does not permit government hostility toward religion. The lower court dismissed the case. Muise then appealed the ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel affirmed the lower court decision. A request for an en banc rehearing of the appeal by the entire panel of the Ninth Circuit Court was granted with the panel affirming the prior ruling in 2010. Muise petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, but this request was denied. =Johnson v. Poway Unified School District= In 2007, Muise filed a federal lawsuit against a Southern California school district on behalf of math teacher Brad Johnson after he was ordered to remove several banners from his classroom because school officials claimed the banners promoted an impermissible \\"Judeo-Christian\\" viewpoint. The banners, which the teacher had been displaying for over 25 years without complaint, contained slogans such as \\"In God We Trust\\", \\"One Nation Under God\\", and the preamble to the Declaration of Independence. The school district filed a motion to dismiss; however, the federal judge denied the motion in a lengthy opinion, ruling in the math teacher's favor. Upon the completion of discovery, the parties filed cross- motions for summary judgment. The court granted summary judgment for the plaintiff; but the school district appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On May 5, 2011, Muise and the school district's attorney presented oral arguments to a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit. Due to the importance of the case, C-SPAN broadcast the oral arguments. On September 13, 2011, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the summary judgment and ruled that the school district did not violate Johnson's free speech rights. The unanimous decision of the federal appeals court relied on U.S. Supreme Court rulings that said governments can limit the free speech rights of public employees in the workplace.http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/sep/13/federal-court- teacher-cant-use-god-in-classroom Nevertheless, Muise has appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. =Kevin Murray v. U.S. Treasury Sec. Timothy Geithner, et al.= In 2008, Muise, along with co-counsel David Yerushalmi, filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, challenging a portion of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 that appropriated $40 billion in taxpayer money to fund the federal government's majority ownership interest in AIG. The lawsuit claimed that the federal government, through its ownership of AIG, engages in Sharia-based Islamic religious activities. The lawsuit further claimed the use of taxpayer dollars to fund Shariah-based Islamic religious activities violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. While federal Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff, at the request by the Department of Justice, dismissed the lawsuit in 2009,http://www.thomasmore.org/downloads/sb_thomasmore/AIGCase- OrderDenyingDefendantsMotiontoDismiss.pdf he reached a summary judgment in January 2011, noting that the religious involvement did not achieve the \\"excessive entanglement\\" required under a precedential ruling. The case is currently on appeal. =Hansen v. Ann Arbor Public Schools= In 2002, Muise filed a civil rights lawsuit on behalf of former Ann Arbor, Michigan high school student, Betsy Hansen, and her mother against the Ann Arbor Public Schools and several of its administrators and faculty members at Pioneer High School.

Flatau= In 2008, Muise filed a lawsuit challenging a base traffic regulation that prohibits the display of \\"extremist, indecent, sexist, or racist messages\\" on motor vehicles at the Camp Lejeune, North Carolina Marine Corps base. His client, a retired combat Marine whose son was killed in the attack on the , had displayed anti- Islam and anti-Muslim decals and signs on his vehicle and was cited by base officials who said that the decals and signs violated that regulation. The decals included a cartoon Calvin urinating on an illustration of the Prophet Mohammed, a US flag with the words \\"Disgrace My Countries [sic] Flag And I Will Shit On Your Quran\\", and \\"Islam = Terrorism\\". In April 2010, a federal judge ruled in the retired Marine's favor, saying the base regulation was not being enforced in a neutral manner and was therefore unconstitutional as applied to the Marine, and that the base cannot ban anti-Islamic decals while allowing decals that say \\"Islam is Love\\" or \\"Islam is Peace.\\" \\"The fact that [the Marine's] message may be extremely offensive to some is not a sufficient basis for banning [his] decals. While the military may have greater leeway in restricting offensive material in furtherance of securing order and discipline among its troops, it may not do so in a manner that allows 'one message while prohibiting the messages of those who can reasonably be expected to respond,'\\" wrote the federal judge. The base's spokesman responded, \\"The ruling in no way limits or precludes the base commander from ensuring the maintenance of good order and discipline aboard the base,\\" noting that the regulation itself was not deemed unconstitutional.Father of USS Cole victim can display anti-Islam decals; Christian Science Monitor; Warren Richey; April 7, 2010 The marine won the lawsuit, but says he was considered a \\"liability\\" by his employers and coworkers at the base, so he requested to be retired.Anniversary of USS Cole terrorist attack Saturday; The Newnan Times-Harold; Wes Mayer; October 17, 2013 References Category:1965 births Category:American lawyers Category:College of the Holy Cross alumni Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Notre Dame Law School alumni Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Robert Muise"},{"id":"34526411","text":"Odontobutis yaluensis is a species of freshwater sleeper endemic to China.

His seat was Dimlands. Early years Dimlands Castle, pictured c. 1850, seat of John Whitlock Nicholl Carne. Nicholl Carne was born at Dimlands in the Vale of Glamorgan, southeast Wales. His father was the Rev. Robert Nicholl Carne, a rector, magistrate and Deputy Lieutenant of Glamorgan, who built Dimlands at the end of the 18th century upon land left him by his father, from whom he inherited 99 acres. Nicholl Carne' mother was Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Capt. Charles-Loder Carne, R.N., and heiress to her uncle, Rev. John Carne, of Nash. He had an older brother, Dr. Robert Charles Nicholl Carne (b. 1806); and four sisters, Emma-Anne, Anna-Maria, Ellen- Louisa, and Frances-Susanna.

He took up residence at Tresilian Bay in 1844. Subsequent to the death of his father in 1849, he inherited and moved to Dimlands, which adjoined Tresilian. It is possible that Nicholl Carne involved the architect Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt in the Dimlands' 1850 renovation. In 1854, he inherited the Parc-Newydd estate, notable for the Llanwynno coal seams.

He served as Michigan's Acting Governor during 1984 Democratic National Convention.The Political Graveyard: DeMaso, Harry A.Senator Harry DeMaso'Harry DeMaso remembered as a \\"Battle Creek guy,' Battle Creek Inquirer, Andy Fitzpatrick, January 12, 2015 Biography The oldest son of Italian immigrants from Pieve di Cadore, Harry DeMaso (born Aristide Augustino DeMaso) grew up in Battle Creek, Michigan. He graduated from Argubright College of Business and became an accounting instructor for the college. He subsequently attended Michigan State University for one year until he joined the United States Army Air Corps during World War II where he was a drill instructor (1943‚Äì1945). Following the war, he worked an insurance office manager until embarking on his political career. Later in his career, DeMaso served as vice president and member of the board of trustees of the Argubright College of Business (which subsequently was purchased by Davenport University in Grand Rapids, Michigan). In 1952, DeMaso began a political career in Michigan that spanned 34 years. He began as Battle Creek Township Supervisor, an office he held for 13 years, from 1952 to 1965. From 1957 to 1966, he served as a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives (Calhoun County 2nd District 1957-1964, 45th District 1965-1966). For 19 years (1967‚Äì1986), he was a member of the Michigan State Senate (20th district). In the Senate, he was Assistant President Pro Tempore (1974), Associate President Pro Tempore (1975‚Äì1982), Assistant Minority Leader (1982‚Äì1983), and President Pro Tempore (1984‚Äì1986). It was in the latter position that he served as Michigan's acting governor for four days when the Democratic Governor and Lieutenant Governor attended the 1984 Democratic Convention. In 1967 while George Romney was governor of Michigan, DeMaso (Chairman of Michigan's Senate Finance Committee) was a critical sponsor of the state's first income tax. Later in 1972, he stated \\"It's a lot easier for a governor and legislators to levy a tax on cigarettes, tobacco products, liquor, and beer, than to levy broad-based taxes.\\" In 1983 with Michigan mired in a recession and facing declining tax revenue, then Governor James Blanchard proposed a controversial income tax hike in order to maintain government spending. Worried about the state's financial situation, he was the only Republican in a Democratic- controlled legislature to vote for the measure. The controversy surrounding the passage of this tax led to the 1983 Michigan tax vote recalls for several politicians; however no challenge was mounted against Harry DeMaso. DeMaso pursued the development and implementation of a global economic revitalization strategy ‚Äì \\"bringing the world to Michigan.\\" He promoted Battle Creek's Fort Custer Industrial Park during the 1970s and 1980s. Together with former Battle Creek Unlimited CEO/President Joseph Pratt and former Mayor Frederick Brydges, DeMaso through numerous trade missions to Japan and Germany was able to bring new industries into Battle Creek which created many new jobs. The city's status as a Port of Entry was made possible with DeMaso's efforts together with Senator Carl Levin. In 1982, DeMaso was the recipient of Michigan State Senate Resolution 284, honoring his achievements in economic development. Fort Custer Industrial Park today houses numerous international plants and facilities. In addition to the above offices, DeMaso is past director of the Battle Creek Township Civil Defense; past president and secretary-treasurer of the Calhoun County Chapter of Michigan Township Association; past director, Battle Creek Area Development Corporation; past chairman and executive director, Calhoun County Safety Commission; past chairman, Calhoun County Planning Commission; past general chairman, Michigan State Council Technical Committee; former chairman, Battle Creek Association of Supervisors Committee on Constitutional Convention; past member of Michigan Crime and Delinquency Council Technical Committee; and former chairman, Battle Creek Area Government Council. He is a member of the Freemasons, Order of the Eastern Star, Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Legion, Kiwanis, and Elks. DeMaso has won numerous awards including: 1957 - Battle Creek Enquirer and News \\"George Award\\" for community service; 1962 - Michigan Probate Judges and Juvenile Officials Association Award; 1964 - Honorary Legion of Honor, International Order of DeMolay; 1964 - Keep Michigan Beautiful, Inc.

He died during a dive from the Aquarius underwater habitat off Key Largo in May 2009. A subsequent investigation determined that multiple factors combined to cause the accident. Life and career The NEEMO 13 Crew: Left to right: JAXA astronaut Satoshi Furukawa, Smith, NASA astronauts Nicholas Patrick and Richard R. Arnold, habitat technician Jim Buckley, NASA engineer Christopher E. Gerty. Smith was born in Kirkwood, Missouri, but grew up and lived for most of his life in Panama City, Florida. He served in the United States Navy as a Hospital Corpsman aboard the USS Peleliu in San Diego, California, and was honorably discharged after five years of service. He learned to scuba dive while working with Florida State University's Underwater Crime Scene Investigation program. Smith graduated from FSU with a B.S. degree in underwater crime scene investigation in 2005. He subsequently worked as a commercial diver with Miracle Strip Welding & Marine Services and RME-Diver in Panama City Beach, Florida. Smith joined Aquarius, which is owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and operated by the University of North Carolina Wilmington, in 2007. He worked as a habitat technician and undersea research diver. As part of his work with Aquarius, Smith answered questions from schoolchildren. In August 2007, Smith took part as a habitat technician in the NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations 13 (NEEMO 13) mission, one of a series of NASA-NOAA missions which use Aquarius as an analog environment for space exploration. The NEEMO 13 crew lived and worked underwater aboard Aquarius for ten days. Death The Aquarius habitat. In May 2009, Smith was aboard Aquarius to train U.S. Navy divers in saturation diving and prepare for upcoming scientific studies in the Conch Reef area. On May 5, 2009, Smith was assisting two Navy divers, Bill Dodd and Corey Seymour, who were 300 feet from Aquarius using an underwater jackhammer to install a way station that would contain breathable air. Smith informed Dodd and Seymour that he was returning to Aquarius but would be back. Five or ten minutes later, Seymour noticed that Smith was lying on his side in the water, his mouthpiece out of his mouth. Seymour began carrying Smith back to Aquarius, but his air umbilical became fouled about thirty yards from the habitat. Dodd carried Smith the rest of the distance to Aquarius, where the other divers in the habitat helped them get Smith inside. Resuscitation attempts by Dodd, Seymour, and two Navy physicians who dove to the habitat were unsuccessful. Smith was pronounced dead at 3:25 pm by a Navy doctor. His death was the first associated with the Aquarius program. A subsequent investigation by a panel of outside experts determined that Smith's death was caused by a combination of three factors: the failure of the electronic functions of his Inspiration closed circuit rebreather (CCR) due to hydrodynamic forces from the hydraulic impact hammer being used nearby, Smith's inattention to his handset and head up displays, and the other two divers allowing Smith to return to Aquarius alone. The investigation concluded that due to these issues Smith became unconscious from hypoxia and drowned when the mouthpiece came out of his mouth. Saturation and CCR diving at Aquarius were suspended in the wake of Smith's death, but the review board recommended that they be resumed with the implementation of additional safety measures. Tributes Energy and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Brian Baird recognized Smith's service on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, whose district includes the Florida Keys and who had met Smith during a visit to the Aquarius facility, also offered a statement of condolence. On May 15, 2009, at a panel at International Space Medicine Summit III devoted to human performance in analog environments, astronaut-aquanaut Dafydd Williams, who had participated in two NEEMO missions, asked for a moment of silence in Smith's memory. Aquarius donated a Superlite 17 diving helmet, the helmet most frequently worn by Aquarius aquanauts, to the History of Diving Museum in Islamorada, Florida in memory of Smith. Personal life Smith was a triathlete.Hellwarth, p. 261. He enjoyed playing the drums, tennis, exercising and movies.

Personal background Philip Paul was born on August 11, 1925 in Harlem, New York and raised in Manhattan. He learned to play the drums when he was nine years old. His father, Philip Paul, Sr. arrived in the US from St. Croix with his brothers, Fred and John. They worked construction during the day and performed in their own Afro-Caribbean jazz band at night. Paul Jr. became mesmerized by the drums played by his uncle, John. When Paul was nine years old, his father bought him a drum set, along with lessons. By the time he was 13 years old, he began playing with his father's band.Nager, Larry. \\"Keeping Time, Philip Paul, the consummate sideman, is still working his 70-year gig\\", Cincinnati Magazine, Emmis Communications, page 96-97, 190, 192, 194,196-197, October 2009. ISSN 0746-8210 , Paul lives in the Evanston neighborhood of Cincinnati with his wife, Juanita and stepdaughter, Ramona. He continues to perform on the weekends at The Cincinnatian Hotel. Professional background Paul was just out of this teens when he began playing at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem with various musicians including Arthur Prysock, Buddy Johnson's Big Band, Sonny Stitt, Bud Powell, and Dizzy Gillespie. In 1951, he was playing with Buddy Johnson one night, when Tiny Bradshaw heard him play and invited him to move to Cincinnati and join his band. Johnson's band played at the Cotton Club in Newport, Kentucky, just across the river from Cincinnati. The club was considered the premier nightspot for the black community. While Paul and his parents were initially opposed to leaving New York, Paul accepted the offer and moved to Cincinnati. From 1951 to 1964, he was often called on as the \\"go to\\" studio drummer for bands playing at the club. It was while working with Bradshaw that Paul met his future wife, Juanita Snyder, who was a Cotton Club dancer and close friends with one of the band members. They were married in 1952. Paul has stated that while he preferred living in New York, his marriage to Juanita removed any intent to move back to New York. \\"The only thing that kept me here was Juanita. If it wasn't for meeting her, I probably would have left.\\" Soon after arriving in Cincinnati, Paul met Syd Nathan, president and owner of King Records. From 1952 to 1965, Paul became the studio drummer for King Records, as well as two of its subsidiary labels, Federal and Bethlehem. He played drums on over 350 recordings with artists such as Hank Ballard, Milt Buckner, Freddie King, Grandpa Jones, Cowboy Copas, and Bonnie Lou. Paul created the beat for \\"The Twist\\" and was on the original recording by Hank Ballard and the Midnighters. He was also on the original recordings of Little Willie John's \\"Fever\\", Charles Brown's \\"Please Come Home for Christmas\\", Tiny Bradshaw's \\"Train Kept a Rollin'\\", Wynonie Harris' \\"Good Rockin' Tonight\\" and nearly every Freddie King record, including his biggest hits \\"Hide Away\\" and \\"Tore Down\\". > \\"If someone were to try to isolate the single heartbeat of the early days of > rock and roll, as it transitions from 'race music' to 'rhythm & blues' to > whatever you want to call what early rock and roll is, that heartbeat is > Philip.

He was also in the Roy Meriwether Trio, when they recorded their classic \\"Popcorn and Soul\\". He recorded two albums with the Meriwether Trio on the Columbia Records label. He also toured the U.S. and Canada with Jimmy Smith, Nat Adderley, Herbie Mann, and George Weins' Newport Jazz All-Stars. After leaving King, Paul joined the Woody Evans Trio, performing for 25 years at local country clubs, including Cincinnati's Playboy Club and the Beverly Hills Supper Club. During this time, he and his wife Juanita and bassist Ed Conley also toured the country together, performing as the rhythm section with Juanita singing for Jazz stars in cities all over the US. In 2003, Paul released his own CD It's About Time under the Stork Music Productions label. The recording featured Peter Frampton, Kenny Poole, and Marcos Sastre on guitar; Steve Schmidt, Roland Ashby, and Sam Jackson on keyboards; and Ed Conley and Mike Scharf on bass. That same year, Paul served as the drummer on Big Joe Duskin's final album, Big Joe Jumps Again!, which was nominated for the W. C. Handy Blues Award Comeback CD of the Year. The award is considered the most prestigious honor for blues artists. Honors and awards In 2002, Paul was honored by the Cincinnati Enquirer with a Lifetime CAMMY Award for his contributions to the music and culture of the city. In 2009, Paul and his wife, Juanita were honored at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, as part of their \\"From Songwriters to Soundmen: The People Behind the Hits\\". The presentation included a retrospect of his recording background at King Records, his nationwide tours, and his 50 year career as a studio drummer in the Cincinnati nightclubs. In July 2009, he was honored with the Ohio Heritage Fellowship. The Fellowship was presented during the CityFolk Festival in Dayton. The summer-long festival was a statewide celebration of his lifetime of work in the music industry.

Early life Terekhov was born on August 22, 1928, in Montevideo, Uruguay. His mother, Antonia Rodriguez, was a Charr√∫a Indian, a people indigenous to Uruguay and southern Brazil. His father, Mikhail Terekhov, a former dancer, immigrated to Uruguay from Ukraine. At the age of 8 or 10 Miguel Terekhov watched a company perform in his hometown and knew he wanted to perform. He built up the courage to ask his father if he could take ballet class; this is when he learned that his father was a professional ballet dancer. Miguel's father taught him the basics of ballet dance until he began to train with a dancer who was with Diaghilev's company. Not long after he started dancing he was taken into the National Ballet of Uruguay. During Miguels time there he was still in high school and no one at school was aware of his dancing. A newspaper article lauded to his success with the company and his abilities were exposed to his classmates. Even with his new success his father would still rehearse with him in their family garage. the Original Ballet Russe of Colonel de Basil In 1942 the Original Ballet Russe of Colonel de Basil came to Uruguay and desperately needed male dancers for their season touring South America, so Miguel Terekhov joined the company at 14; never finishing high school. His parents had to give parental consent for a passport because he was so young. At 14 he did not know how to care for himself so the stage director Serge Grigoriev became like a father to him. Miguel was learning the rep for the company while already on tour, learning up to two ballets a day. His first year with the Ballets Russes he felt as if he was a part of history, with notable dancers coming before him like Michel Fokine, L√©onide Massine, and Anna Pavlova. Miguel stayed with the Ballets Russes for 5 years. His time with the company ended in 1947 when they finished the American leg of their tour and were planning to make their way through Europe. Many company members had decided to stay in the United States and terminate their contracts with the Ballets Russes, Miguel did not want to see the demise of the company, with so many of the main dancers leaving, so he returned home to Montevideo for 2 years and danced with a company in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo In 1954 Terekhov joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. His friend Victor Moreno introduced him to the director of the company, Sergei Denham. They came to an agreement that Terekhov would join the company for 1 year. When he tried to get his passport to the United States they did not want to give him a work visa. Sergei Denham pulled strings and he was given a work visa with no questions. Terekov met his wife Yvonne Chouteau when he joined the company. Chouteau was about the same age as Terekhov when he joined the Ballet Russe. When he decided he wanted to marry Chouteau he had to ask the permission of Alexandra Danilova, Chouteau's mentor. When everyone was leaving rehearsal one night and Danilova said \\"Miguel, I hear you want to marry my Yvonne,\\" to which he replied \\"yes.\\" Danilova said \\"we must talk about this.\\" They both left the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo after the birth of their first daughter, Christina. Post Performance Career The couple decided that they could not return to the touring life required of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo so Terekhov auditioned for things on Broadway like West Side Story, but was turned down because he danced too much like a ballet dancer. So the couple decided to go to South America to see his family and introduce them to their grandchild. While they were visiting South America they had their second child Elizabeth, who later changed her name to Toni in honor of her grandmother. After a year in Montevideo the couple went to visit Chouteau's family in Oklahoma in 1961. While there the president of the University of Oklahoma asked if Terekhov and Chouteau would teach a ballet class. Terekhov then designed the curriculum for a degree in dance at the university and was the chairman for the department. At the University of Oklahoma Terekhov and Chouteau have their own company, present productions, and dance there themselves. Terekhov died at his daughter's home in Richardson, Texas, of complications from lung fibrosis on January 3, 2012, at the age of 83. He and his wife, who survived him, were residents of Oklahoma City.

History At least two of Macvey Napier's sons lived in Singapore in its early days. David Skene Napier, a merchant, was one of the first magistrates appointed by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1823. Prior to follow in to Singapore after his brother, William Napier had a daughter, Catherine Napier on 1829, by a Eurasian woman from Malacca. In 1831, Napier arrived in Singapore and was appointed as Singapore's first law agent in 1833. He was also one of the four founders of the Singapore Free Press on 1 October 1835, and edited that weekly newspaper until 1846, when he returned to the United Kingdom for health reasons. In 1844, he married Maria Frances Vernon, the widow of architect George Coleman and adopted her son, George Vernon Coleman, who would died at sea on board of HMS Maeander in 1848 at age 4. They soon had a daughter in 1846, Maria J Napier. Memorial to James Brooke Napier, Fort Canning Napier had an infant son with Maria in 1847, James Brooke Napier, but he died at sea on 17 February 1848 at the very young age of 5 months old. The infant James Brooke Napier was commemorated by the largest monument on the Christian Cemetery at the Government Hill, Singapore. William Napier had befriended James Brooke in Singapore and, on being appointed Governor of the new British colony of Labuan in 1848, Brooke chose him to be his deputy as Lieutenant-Governor of Labuan. In 1848, William Napier's daughter, Catherine Napier, met Hugh Low, the Colonial Secretary to Labuan, on the sea-voyage from England to Labuan to establish the new government: they were married, en route, in Singapore.Reece,R.W.H. & Cribb,P.J.

However, three years of data collected and analyzed by Deloitte, refutes the prevalence of showrooming. Deloitte found that, in fact, customers who use a digital device in-store as part of their shopping process were actually more likely to make a purchase ‚Äì not less.  Effects on retailers  Showrooming can be costly to retailers, not only in terms of the loss of the sale, but also due to damage caused to the store's floor samples of a product through repeated examination from consumers.

Efforts to combat showrooming by retailers  Many retailers have tried to compete with showroomers by slashing their own prices. Independent businesses, however, are advised to counter showrooming by adding value via included services and other tactics, such as making information and reviews more readily available to customers so that they might not choose to seek it out online. Some major retailers, such as Target, are attempting to battle showrooming by selling products exclusive to their stores. Walmart is allowing customers to avoid the shipping charges of online purchases by picking up the items in the stores. The same practice is expanding to European countries. Some specialty fashion stores in the U.S. and Australia have introduced a \\"fitting fee\\" for browsing, which is refunded in full if the customer makes a purchase. Best Buy has guaranteed to match the online price of goods listed on Amazon.com, and in April 2013 announced it would begin to lease out space to manufacturers such as Samsung, so customers can view working products and then purchase them at the MSRP.

In the First World War it fought on the Western Front and on the Italian Front as part of 7th Division. The brigade was re-raised under during the Second World War. Boer War British Army brigades had traditionally been ad hoc formations known by the name of their commander or numbered as an integral part of a division. However, units deployed to the Second Boer War in 1899 were organised into sequentially numbered brigades that were frequently reassigned between divisions.Amery, Vol II, p. 114.Dunlop, p 74. 20th Brigade was formed in South Africa in 1900 under the command of Major-General Arthur Paget as part of Lieutenant-General Lord Methuen's 1st Division. It comprised two regular infantry battalions that were already serving in the theatre and had seen much action, together with two Militia battalions newly arrived from Britain: =Order of Battle 1900= The composition of 20 Bde in May‚ÄìJune 1900 was as follows:Amery, Appendix, p 507.Miller, p. 186 & fn 94. * 1st Battalion Royal Munster Fusiliers ‚Äì two companies had served under Methuen at the Battles of Belmont and Graspan,Creswicke, pp. 92‚Äì3. the remainder under Lieutenant-General GatacreCreswicke pp 160. * 2nd Battalion King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry ‚Äì had served in 9th Brigade under Methuen's command at Graspan and Modder RiverCreswicke pp. 93‚Äì108. * 4th (Militia) Battalion Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) * 4th (Militia) Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment When the Militia were embodied in November 1899 and invited to volunteer for overseas service, it had been intended to employ them in garrisons and on lines on communications in order to release Regular troops for frontline service.Dunlop, p. 90. However, 20th Brigade with its mix of Regulars and Militia was immediately thrown into action during Lord Roberts' advance through the Transvaal. Methuen's 1st Division was assigned to guard Roberts' left flank in the Orange Free State. 20th Brigade assisted General Hunter's 10th Division at Christiana then 1st Division captured Hoopstad by a surprise night attack. Methuen's men earned the nickname of 'the Mobile Marvels' for their hard marching. At the end of May Methuen marched to relieve Lindley, and left 20 Bde there to guard the town while he continued on to relieve Heilbron in June.Miller, pp. 186‚Äì93. By now the Boers in Orange Free State had broken up into small parties, and British forces spent many months pursuing them, especially the guerrillas led by Christiaan de Wet (in the 'Great de Wet Hunt'). For the rest of the war, formal divisional and brigade organisations dissolved into ad hoc columns formed and reformed for specific tasks.Amery, Vol IV, p. 412.Miller, pp. 200‚Äì10. First World War Soon after the outbreak of the First World War, a new 20th Brigade was organised, composed of the last three Regular infantry battalions left in Britain after the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) went to France.Becke, pt 1, p. 82. Although not officially designated a Guards brigade, it did contain two Guards battalions (1st Grenadier Guards from Warley Barracks and 2nd Scots Guards from the Tower of London), together with 2nd Border Regiment stationed at Pembroke Dock.Atkinson, pp. 2‚Äì3.http://www.1914-1918.net/7div.htmhttp://www.1914-1918.net/border.htm Both Guards battalions were largely composed of Reservists recalled to the Colours.Atkinson, p. 4. A Guards officer, Brigadier-General H.G. Ruggles- Brise, was appointed to command the brigade.London Gazette 9 October 1914 20th Brigade assembled at Lyndhurst, Hampshire, forming part of 7th Division, which was otherwise composed of Regular battalions brought back from various overseas stations. 2nd Battalion Gordon Highlanders returned from Cairo to complete 20th Bde just before the division sailed from Southampton.http://www.1914-1918.net/gordon.htm =Order of Battle 1914= The composition of 20 Bde on embarkation was as follows: * 1st Bn Grenadier Guards * 2nd Bn Scots Guards * 2nd Bn Border Regiment * 2nd Bn Gordon Highlanders =1st Battle of Ypres= 7th Division landed at Zeebrugge on 7 October 1914, intended to assist the Belgian Army in the defence of Antwerp. In the event all it could do was help to cover the Belgian retreat and then take up defensive positions at Ypres where they were joined by the rest of the BEF after the Race to the Sea. Thereafter 20th Brigade was engaged in heavy fighting at Langemarck and Gheluvelt during the First Battle of Ypres.Edmonds 1914, Vol II.Farrar-Hockley, Ypres. Like several other senior officers who got out among their units to exercise personal command during this confused fighting, Ruggles-Brise was wounded, being carried back 'half dead of a dreadful wound on a stretcher' on 2 November. All the battalion commanders also having become casualties, the Brigade Major (Major A.B.E. Cator) took command as senior officer in the brigade.Farrar-Hockley, Ypres, p. 180. On 5 December, the badly-depleted brigade was reinforced by a Territorial Force unit, the 1/6th (Banff and Donside) Battalion Gordon Highlanders, which had been serving as GHQ troops since landing in France.Edmonds, 1914, Vol II, Appendix 4, p. 488. 20th Brigade's last major action in 1914 was a failed attack on the Well Farm position at La Boutillerie by 2nd Scots Guards and 2nd Border on 18 December. The dead from this action were buried during the Christmas truce.http://www.1914-1918.net/truce.htm =1915= During the first half of 1915, the brigade was involved in the Battles of Neuve Chapelle (10‚Äì13 March), Aubers Ridge (9 May ‚Äì in reserve), Festubert (15‚Äì19 May) and Givenchy (15‚Äì16 June). When the Guards Division was formed in August 1915, 20 Bde's two Guards battalions left to join it, being replaced by two 'New Army' battalions sent from England, the 8th and 9th Battalions Devonshire Regiment.http://www.1914-1918.net/devons.htm The new battalions were 'blooded' at the Battle of Loos. =Order of Battle September 1915= For the Battle of Loos, the composition of 20 Bde (with casualties in brackets) was as follows:Cherry, pp. 92, 97.Atkinson, pp. 205, 231. * 2nd Battalion, Border Regiment (234) * 2nd Battalion, Gordon Highlanders (457) * 1/6th (Banff and Donside) Battalion, Gordon Highlanders (297) * 8th (Service) Battalion, Devonshire Regiment (619) * 9th (Service) Battalion, Devonshire Regiment (256) * 55th Field Company, Royal Engineers ‚Äì attached for this battle * No 1 Mortar Battery ‚Äì attached for this battle * XIV Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery ‚Äì attached for this battle =1916= In January 1916, 1/6th Gordons returned to GHQ troops in exchange for 1/6th Bn Cheshire Regiment, but this battalion left the brigade for 39th Division in February, after which 20 Bde reverted to the normal four-battalion formation. In line with a new organisation for infantry brigades, it formed a Machine-Gun Company and a Trench Mortar Battery in February 1916. During the Battle of the Somme, 20 Bde was involved in the following actions: * Capture of Mametz 1 July * Battle of Bazentin Ridge (14‚Äì17 July) * Attack on High Wood (20 July) * Battle of Guillemont (3‚Äì7 September). =1917= In the early part of 1917, 20 Bde was involved in the following actions: * Operations on the Ancre (January‚ÄìMarch) * German retreat to the Hindenburg Line (14 March‚Äì5 April) * Battle of Bullecourt (3‚Äì16 May) During the Third Battle of Ypres 20 Bde was engaged at: * Battle of Polygon Wood (1‚Äì3 October) * Battle of Broodseinde (4 October) * Battle of Polecappelle (9 October) * 2nd Battle of Passchendaele (26‚Äì29 October) =Italian Front= On 17 November, 7th Division entrained for the Italian Front as part of the reinforcements rushed to assist the Italian Army after the defeat of Caporetto. The division remained on the Piave front until 23 February 1918, when it was ordered to return to France. However, these orders were cancelled in March, and the division moved to the Asiago Plateau, taking part in the fighting there in June. As part of an Army-wide reorganisation, 20th Machine-Gun Company left 20 Bde in Spring 1918 to join the 7th Division Machine-Gun Battalion. A more fundamental reorganisation took place in September 1918: in preparation to move back to France 20 Bde was reduced to three battalions in line with the current establishment for the Western Front. 9th Devons was transferred to another division in France, but the divisional move was once again countermanded. The reduced brigade then took part in the final actions of the war on the Italian Front, the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, including the Passage of the Piave (23 October‚Äì4 November), the capture of the Grave di Papadopoli (23‚Äì26 October) and the Crossing of the Tagliamento (3 November). The brigade was demobilised in Italy soon after the Armistice with Austria. =Brigade Commanders 1914‚Äì18= The following officers commanded 20 Bde during the war:Atkinson, Appendix III, p. 502. * Brigadier-General H.G.

He is known for his pioneering work of applying random sampling methods in agricultural statistics and in biometry, in the 1940s. He was also influential in the establishment of the Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute. As a part of his work at the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, he developed statistical models for assessing the dimensions of hunger and future food supplies for the world. He also developed methods for measuring the size and nature of the protein gap. His other major contributions included applying statistical techniques to the study of human nutrition. One of his ideas, the Sukhatme‚ÄìMargen hypothesis, suggested that at low calorie intake levels, stored energy in the body is used with greater metabolic efficiency and that the metabolic efficiency decreases as the intake increases above the homeostatic range. This involved paying attention to intra-individual variability that was found to be more than the inter- individual variability in protein or calorie intake. He gave a genetic interpretation of the intra-individual variation jointly with P. Narain. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India in 1971. Early life Sukhatme was born in a Deshastha Brahmin family on 27 July 1911 in village Budh, district Satara in the state of Maharashtra in India. He graduated in 1932 from Fergusson College with Mathematics as principal subject and Physics as subsidiary subject. From 1932 to 1936, he studied at University College London where he was awarded a Ph.D. in 1936 and a D.Sc. in 1939 for his work on bi-partitional functions. With J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson he made significant contributions in the statistical theory of sampling which was instrumental in his subsequent research in sampling theory of survey and improvement of agricultural statistics in India. This ushered in what may appropriately be termed as Sukhatme era in the development of agricultural statistics in India.

After the war, Dyrberg became a public administrator, holding several appointed positions in government, and later a public relations executive in banking. For more than 40 years, he also owned and operated a horse farm, breeding and training Icelandic horses in H√∏sterk√∏b, North Zealand. From 1994 to 2000, Dyrberg published his own writing: his novels and memoirs were based on his experiences in the Resistance. He was featured in the 2003 Danish documentary film, With a Right to Kill (Med ret til at dr√¶be), based on the 2001 history by Peter √òvig Knudsen. The book and film were part of some of the first efforts by Danes to seriously study issues raised by the liquidation of 400 persons by the Danish Resistance during the war. The film featured news footage, interviews with surviving agents and leaders of the Resistance movement, and reconstruction of known events. Dyrberg's Holger Danske group was also the subject of Flame and Citron (Flammen og Citronen, 2008), a Danish fictionalized dramatic film based on actions of its two most noted members, who were both killed by the Germans before the end of the war. Nazi occupation and resistance After the Nazis occupied Denmark, Dyrberg was among the many young men who joined the Danish Resistance. He used the code name, \\"Herman,\\" to disguise his identity during the German occupation. He rose to lead the Holger Danske, a resistance group in Copenhagen. Dyrberg had a very close working relationship with Bent Faurschou-Hviid (\\"Flame\\") and J√∏rgen Haagen Schmith (code named \\"Citron\\"), two of the most noted members of the group. After the war, Dyrberg admitted that he had directed the killing of several German informants and soldiers, though the number has never been publicly revealed. Before 1944, the group killed only Danish Nazis, informers, and collaborators, to reduce the threat of overwhelming Nazi retaliation against the civilian population. In 1945, Dyrberg was appointed head of the Resistance Press Office. For decades after the war, issues related to the choices of Danish targets to be liquidated were not much discussed; politicians wanted to support the resistance in the postwar effort to rebuild their society.Morten Henriksen, \\"WITH A RIGHT TO KILL\\" (Met ret til at dr√¶be, Cineuropa Post-war years In 1946 Dyrberg married Lulla. They had two sons together. He went to college after the war, getting a degree in economics in 1948 at the University of Copenhagen. He worked for the government on programs to implement the Marshall Plan, serving in the Directorate for Product Supplies, a trade policy department (1948‚Äì52), and in the Department of Commerce, on its Productivity Committee (predecessor of Danish Trade) (1952-1953). He also worked with representatives of other governments and businesses to help improve the efficiency of industry, trade and commerce in Europe. He later acted as a governmental consultant to the Greek and Italian productivity centers. He continued to represent businesses, for instance the Federation of Merchant Associations. He re-entered government when appointed as Secretary of Craft, and worked in several trade ministry areas. From 1966-86 Dyrberg worked at the Farmers' Bank (in 1976 renamed The Danish Bank). He was appointed as Head of Public Relations and Information. (He was the first PR manager at Danish banking.) He also trained the first consultants in a Danish bank.

This work included being editor of Holger Danske's Home Guard Association's magazine, 1946-48; the weekly magazine Building Trades, 1958‚Äì65; Danish Crafts 1960-62; Advice: The Danish Bank Staff Bulletin, 1966-85; Quarterly, Farmers' Bank's financial magazine, 1967‚Äì71; and Pondus Item, 1967-82; and the member magazine of the Danish Invest, 1987-1992. Dyrberg began writing fiction and memoirs to explore and share his experiences during the war. Beginning in 1994, he published several books: both novels and memoirs about his time in the Danish resistance movement. Representation in other media Dyrberg was featured in the 2003 documentary film, With a Right to Kill (Med ret til at dr√¶be), about the Holger Danske group. The 2008 Danish dramatic film, Flame and Citron (Flammen og Citronen), featured two of his most prominent agents as the central characters, and portrayed the complex, morally ambiguous relations within the Resistance. Gunnar Dyrberg died at his home in H√∏rsholm following a long illness on 8 January 2012, at the age of 90.

First World War The brigade was a unit of the British Army during the First World War formed in September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the Great War, from units of the Regular Army that had been serving overseas in the British Empire. The brigade was assigned to the 7th Division (nicknamed \\"The Immortal Seventh\\") and served on the Western Front and, later, on the Italian Front. After arrival in France in October 1914 the brigade fought in the First Battle of Ypres where, as most units involved in the battle, both British and German, sustained very heavy losses. As the war progressed and the more battles the brigade was involved in the composition of the brigade changed numerous times and the battalions were reinforced largely by volunteers for Lord Kitchener New Armies. =Order of battle in the First World War= The infantry battalions assigned to the brigade during World War I included: * 2nd Battalion, Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) (left December 1915) * 2nd Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment * 1st Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers * 1st Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment (left December 1915) * 1/8th Battalion, Royal Scots (from November 1914, left August 1915) * 1/7th Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) (from 15 November 1915, left 7 January 1916) * 20th (Service) Battalion, Manchester Regiment * 24th (Service) Battalion, Manchester Regiment * 2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment (from May 1916, left October 1916) * 2/1st Battalion, Honourable Artillery Company (from October 1916) * 22nd Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 24 February 1916, moved to 7th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 1 April 1918) * 22nd Trench Mortar Battery (formed 14 April 1916) Second World War The brigade was reformed, now designated the 22nd Infantry Brigade, during the Second World War, exactly a month after the opening of hostilities, by the redesignation of the 29th Infantry Brigade. As it was in the Great War, the brigade was composed entirely of troops of the Regular Army who had been serving in Egypt on the outbreak of war and was again assigned to the 7th Infantry Division until 3 November 1939 when it was redesignated as the 6th Infantry Division. The brigade left the 6th Division on 17 June 1940, coming under command of HQ Western Desert Force. On 2 September 1940 the 22nd Brigade was redesignated Headquarters Matruh Fortress and ceased to be an infantry brigade. The number was subsequently reused to designate the 22nd Guards Brigade. =Order of battle in the Second World War= 22nd Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during World War II: * 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards (left 18 March 1940) * 1st Battalion, Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment) (left 25 November 1939) * 1st Battalion, Welch Regiment (from 28 November 1939, left 23 July 1940) * 2nd Battalion, Highland Light Infantry (from 18 March, left 21 July 1940) * 1st Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment (from 21 July, left 1 September 1940) * 1st Battalion, Durham Light Infantry (from 23 July, left 1 September 1940) * 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards (from 25 July, left 1 September 1940) =Commanders= The following officers commanded 22nd Infantry Brigade during World War II * Lieutenant Colonel E.G.

Facts A 44-year-old woman claimed she was discriminated against on grounds of sex. She was turned down for a job limited to graduates aged 27 to 35. She got her degree as a mature student. The University argued that the limit was justified because careers advisers should be ‚Äònot too far removed in age from the students‚Äô and because they wanted to achieve a spread in age groups, which were 63, 62, 54, 47, 45 and 42 at the time. Tribunal held the pool for comparison was men and women who got degrees when they were aged 25 or over. There were fewer women under age 35 that got degrees than men. Therefore Ms Jones won. It said that the university also lost on justification. The Employment Appeal Tribunal held (following Perera on the absolute bar approach) that the pool had been artificially restricted, and on justification it had ‚Äòeffectively dismissed the matters relied upon by [the University] once it was demonstrated that they were not essential.‚Äô Judgment Ralph Gibson LJ held that the Tribunal was entitled to find the age requirement discriminatory so long as proof of disparate impact was shown. However, the correct pool for comparison was all male and female graduates with necessary experience. So the Employment Appeal Tribunal was upheld. Further, the Tribunal was right to construe ‚Äòjustifiable‚Äô in Sex Discrimination Act 1975, section 1(1)(b)(ii), to mean an objective balance between the condition‚Äôs discriminatory effect the employer‚Äôs reasonable needs. But the Tribunal had gone about the balancing exercise wrongly.

Long known as the Grolier Codex or S√°enz Codex, in 2018 it was officially renamed the C√≥dice Maya de M√©xico (CMM) by the National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico. It is one of only four known extant Maya codices, and the only one that still resides in the Americas. The MCM first appeared in a private collection in the 1960s and was shown at \\"The Maya Scribe and His World\\", an exhibition held at the Grolier Club in New York City in 1971, hence its former name. An almanac that charts the movements of the planet Venus, it originally consisted of twenty pages; the first eight and the last two are now missing. The greatest height of any of the surviving page fragments is 19 centimeters (7.5 in) of folio 8, and the average page width is 12.5 centimeters (4.9 in). The red frame lines at the bottom of pages four through eight indicates that the dimensions were once substantially taller, and that the scribe prepared a space for text under the figure on each page. Accordingly, the manuscript would once have measured 250 centimeters (98.4 in), roughly the size of the Dresden Codex. Its authenticity was disputed at the time of its discovery, but has been upheld by multiple studies. In 2018, a team of scientists coordinated by the National Institute for Anthropology and History demonstrated conclusively that the document dates to the period between 1021 and 1154 CE. The Mexican studies confirm that it is the oldest surviving codex from Mexico and the oldest book of the Americas. Modern history, and authenticity The Codex was first displayed at the Grolier Club in New York, hence its name The first Mexican owner, Josu√© Saenz, claimed that the manuscript had been recovered from a cave in the Mexican state of Chiapas in the 1960s, along with a mosaic mask, a wooden box, a knife handle, as well as a child‚Äôs sandal and a piece of rope, along with some blank pages of pre- Columbian fig-bark paper. Saenz lent the manuscript to the Grolier Club and later presented the book to the Mexican nation. The codex is said to have been found enclosed in a wooden box in a dry cave in the highlands of Chiapas near Tortuguero;Coe 1999, p. 200. Marhenke 2012. it was said to have been found with a turquoise mask that is now in the collection of Dumbarton Oaks.Milbrath 2002, p. 51. In 1965 the Mexican collector Dr. Josu√© S√°enz was taken by two men on a light plane to a remote airstrip in the foothills of the Sierra Madre near Tortuguero in Tabasco state;Markenke 2012. Yates 2012. Baudez 2002, p. 3. the compass of the plane was covered with a cloth but S√°enz recognized his approximate location. At the airstrip he was shown the codex along with some other looted Maya artifacts and was told that he could take the items back to Mexico City for authentication before purchasing them.Yates 2012. The antiquities expert that S√°enz consulted declared that the artifacts were fakes but S√°enz later purchased the codex and permitted Michael Coe to display the codex at the Grolier Club in 1971. In 1976, the United States-Mexico Artifacts Treaty of 1970 was invoked by the Attorney General of Mexico. This resulted in the seizure of the codex and its return to Mexico.Vitelli 1977, p. 461. S√°enz donated the codex to the Mexican government and it is currently kept in the vault of the National Library, after being kept for years in a vault in the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a in Mexico City and not on public display.Marhenke 2012. Yates 2012. Johnston 1977. The claimed discovery of the Grolier Codex would make it the only pre-Columbian codex discovered in the course of the 20th century, except for some codex fragments excavated by archaeologists.Ruvalcaba et al 2007, pp. 299‚Äì300. Following the 1971 exhibition, Michael D. Coe, published the first half-size recto-side facsimile of the codex in The Maya Scribe and His World, published by the Grolier Club in 1973. The MCM was subsequently published various times, by detractors (J. Eric S. Thompson, Milbrath, Baudez, among them) and by proponents (Stuart, Carlson). Coe, Stephen D. Houston, Mary Miller, and Karl Taube published the first full-sized facsimile in 2015, using photographs taken by National Geographic photographer Enrico Ferorrelli in 1987, along with a full set of hand-drawn and uncopyrighted drawings for dissemination, and a thorough analysis of the context, content, and iconography of the codex. Coe et al also demonstrated that the paper is three-ply, which lent itself to the screen-fold format. A new facsimile, based on new photography, was published by the Mexican government in 2018. The English Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson cast doubt upon the authenticity of the MCM in 1975, although he did not see the manuscript himself. As Victoria Bricker and Harvey Bricker have argued, the contents of the MCM have not been copied directly from any known codices, and yet they are consistent with an authentic and accurate prehispanic calendar. Although other scholars have argued for and against the codex, the arguments against the manuscript‚Äôs authenticity became irrelevant in the face of Mexican scientific analysis. Various campaigns of scientific testing of the manuscript have taken place, beginning with a radiocarbon test in 1972 which yielded a date of 1035-1431; a subsequent test in 2012 produced a date of 1050-1284. In 2007, the Instituto de F√≠sica de la Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico subjected the codex to non-destructive testing in an effort to determine its authenticity, and identified the key ingredient of Maya blue, palygorskite. Tests under the sponsorship of INAH yielded additional radiocarbon dates, leading to a consensus that the manuscript dates to the 11th or 12th century. Additional scientific study has demonstrated that the amate paper surface was prepared on both sides with a thin foundation of gypsum, or calcium sulfate (CaSO4) measuring between 0.2 mm-0.3 mm, in order to form a smooth a writing surface. The Mexican studies have also proven that the pigment is contemporaneous with the paper; further work has shown that the pigments include lamp black, red produced from hematite (Fe2O3), blue fashioned from indigo dye and palygorskite, and browns prepared with cochineal. Mexican scientific study has also shown that the codex was subjected to at least three periods of high moisture conditions. Furthermore, tiny arthropods took up residence in the MCM at some point, yielding crisply chewed edges that detractors of the manuscript misconstrued as scissor cuts. Looters handled the codex roughly, tearing apart the pages. Today only pages four, five, and six remain attached to one another. In 2015, ahead of the INAH study, Coe, Houston, Miller and Taube published a full study of the codex. They presented further arguments in support of the authenticity of the document and came to the conclusion that only a Maya priest could have made the work. Despite subsequent publication of a critical review of Coe et. al‚Äôs arguments, teams of scientists under the auspices of Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History were preparing the studies that would declare the MCM to be authentic in 2018. Content Although both front and back (recto and verso) of the MCM were prepared for painting, only one side was completed as a ritual manuscript. Each recto page features a standing deity facing left. The left-hand side of each page is marked by a column of repeated day signs; where this column is complete these total thirteen in all. Ring numbers across the upper margin link the days of the Venus cycle, recorded in a hybrid system that incorporates both the bar-and-dot numeration of the Maya and the single dots used in Central Mexico and Oaxaca. Mesoamerican peoples paid close attention to Venus, understood to be a dangerous and warlike entity (XRF Mesoamerican calendars). Venus‚Äôs cycle was broken down by synodic periods as follows: 90 days of invisibility in superior conjunction (SC), 250 days of visibility as Evening Star, 8 days of invisibility in inferior conjunction (IC), and 236 days of visibility as Morning Star, for a total of 584 days. Five Venus cycles equals 8 solar years of 365 days, providing for numerological opportunities. It is these synodic periods that are spelled out in the MCM ring numbers. For example, page 7 shows a bar and three dots inside the ‚Äúring,‚Äù so that the reader counts forward 8 days from the Lamat day (e.g.10 Lamat, in the second position) to the Kib day (e.g. 5 Kib, in the second position), 8 days later on page 8. On page 8, the count in the ‚Äúring‚Äù is 16, five bars and one dot; this is added to the sum yielded by the 11 dots, which note periods of 20, or 220 days, to total 236 days: 236 is the period of Venus‚Äôs visibility as Morning Star. The book would have served as a guide to precise knowledge in the hands of a Maya priest in the late 11th or early 12th century. The first eight pages of the codex are now lost, as are the last two, but the page numbering today refers to the pages now in existence. Page 1 depicts K‚Äôawiil, who takes a captive. Page 2 depicts a death god, the god most commonly known as Kimi among the Maya. The deity of Page 3 is not easily identifiable, but the blackened eyes of the captive are like those seen on Dresden 60b. K‚Äôawiil repeats on Page 4, this time taking a captive. Page 5 features a version of a solar deity known from Dresden 55a, and as the face of an Early Postclassic Maya mask at the Art Institute of Chicago (1965.782); this sun god sets the temple in front of him afire with a dart launched from his atlatl. A death god appears on page 6, almost certainly a version of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, as first identified by John Carlson. He wields a massive knife and has decapitated another deity that he holds by the hair. The death deity has a jagged flint blade in his nasal cavity, similar to a depiction at the Temple of the Warriors, Chichen Itza. The enigmatic deity of Page 7 stands in front of a shining tree, or what David Stuart first called the ‚ÄúShiner‚Äù. His headdress is very close to the headdresses worn by the five deities in the Vaticanus B Venus passages, and this may further link him to Tlalhuizcalpantecuhtli, god of the Morning Star in Central Mexico. The shining tree may be issuing radiant jade disks. Page 8 has been identified as a bird deity, with some serpent qualities; he wears a thick belt and tezcacuitlapilli over a hide skirt, and he has shot the temple in front of him with a dart from his atlatl. Although sometimes identified as a maize deity, the Page 9 god is the craggy mountain deity or personified mountain from which a maize kernel or a maize god could emerge, like the representation discovered at Tancah in 1974. In the MCM the mountain deity prepares to hurl a stone and takes a captive. Finally, although once thought to be fragments of two different pages, Page 10 can now be recognized as a single page, and the depiction of the third and final skeletal death deity, probably Tlalhuizcalpantecuhtli again. The deity has launched an atlatl dart into a body of water to strike a gastropod, very much like images from the Nuttall and Borgia codices (Codex Nuttall 16, 34, 75, 80; Codex Borgia 12, 53) Two more pages would have followed these ten, to complete the full Venus cycle recorded in the surviving pages.  Style  The radiocarbon date of the codex places it squarely in the Early Postclassic period, when both Tula and Chichen Itza were waning in power and when all of Mesoamerica was in decline. The workmanship of the MCM relates to late paintings at Chichen Itza, in which outlines and underdrawing are only loosely followed by the subsequent final painting. The discovery of ring numbers in the Xultun paintings, dating to 800 CE, provided evidence that ring numbers were in use for centuries, and not unique to the Dresden Codex. The proportions of the human figures are similar to those known from Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic fine orange ceramics, typically with a ringstand support. Saeko Yanigasawa has demonstrated that the style of the MCM most closely relates to that of Mixtec codices, which may have drawn on hybrid works like the MCM, and other scholars have noted that headdresses known from the Mixtec manuscripts are first known in the MCM. The rounded eye, as opposed to the oval characterized by a straight line across the upper side of the eye, is known at Chichen Itza. Also typical of both the MCM and paintings at Chichen Itza is the casual attention to underdrawing; in both, the final painted line deviates from the sketch. The style of the MCM hieroglyphs is simple but competent, consistent and controlled for long columns of day signs. Both the underdrawing and the finished work suggests that a single scribe, using at least two brushes, one brush for thicker, viscous pigments used for the day signs, and a finer instrument to handle the human figures and other elements of each scene.  Exhibition  The MCM was first shown at the Grolier Club from April 20 to June 5, 1971. Recently, the MCM was exhibited at the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a of Mexico City for three weeks in September and October 2018.

The route, which now forms part of Highway 6, was long and travelled in a southeast‚Äìnorthwest direction west of Owen Sound. The route followed an early trail blazed by deputy surveyor Charles Rankin in 1842 that was upgraded to a modern road in the 1920s. Highway 70 was designated in 1965 and renumbered as Highway 6 in 1997. Another Highway 70 existed near Kenora between 1937 and 1959 before being renumbered as Highway 71\\\\. This designation was applied along the newly opened Heenan Highway, shortly after the Department of Highways (DHO) began numbering routes in northern Ontario. However, a series of renumberings in 1960 led to the entire length becoming part of Highway 71\\\\.  Route description  Highway 70 was a short highway that travelled in a northeast‚Äìsouthwest direction between the communities of Springmount, near Owen Sound, and Hepworth. The route, now part of Highway 6, passes through an equal mixture of farmland and forests, aside from the community of Shallow Lake, located at approximately the midpoint of the route. At its southern terminus is the only wrong-way concurrency in Ontario, between Highway 6 and Highway 21\\\\. The road continues south of the intersection between these highways as Grey County Road 18, which serves as a bypass of Owen Sound. At its northern terminus, the route curves to the west and enters Hepworth; Highway 70 ended at the intersection of Queen Street and Bruce Street. From there, Highway 6 continued north through the Bruce Peninsula.  History  = Rainy River‚ÄìKenora = The Highway 70 designation was first used along the Heenan Highway, connecting the Rainy River region to Kenora to provide the first Canadian road link to an area previously accessible only from the United States. In 1922, Kenora MPP Peter Heenan and Dr. McTaggart approached the government to lobby for construction of a road between Nestor Falls and Kenora. Nestor Falls was the northernmost point accessible by road from the Rainy River area. Heenan would become the Minister of Lands and Forests in Mitch Hepburn's cabinet. This provided the impetus for construction to begin in 1934. Unlike previously built roads in the area, the Fort Frances ‚Äì Kenora Highway, as it was known prior to its opening, was constructed through the rugged terrain of the Canadian Shield. Rocks, forests, lakes, muskeg, and insects served as major obstacles during construction of the highway, which progressed from both ends. By late 1935, the only remaining gap in the road was the Sioux Narrows Bridge. Construction on this bridge was underway by March 1936; it was rapidly assembled using Douglas fir from British Columbia as the main structural members. The bridge was completed on June 15, 1936, completing the link between Fort Frances and Kenora. Sioux Narrows Bridge in 1951 On July 1, 1936, premier Mitch Hepburn attended a ceremony in front of the Rainy Lake Hotel in Fort Frances. On a rainy afternoon, at 5:30 p.m., Peter Heenan handed Hepburn a pair of scissors with which to cut the ribbon crossing the road and declare the highway open. Hepburn, addressing the crowd that was gathered, asked \\"What would you say if we call it the Heenan Highway, what would you think of that?\\". The crowd cheered and Hepburn cut the ribbon. The Heenan Highway was assumed by the DHO shortly after its merger with the Department of Northern Development. Following the merger, the DHO begin assigning trunk roads throughout northern Ontario as part of the provincial highway network. The portion lying within Kenora District was designated as Highway 70 on September 1, while the portion within Rainy River District was designated on September 29. The original route of Highway 70 split in two south of Finland; Highway 70 turned east to Off Lake Corner, then south to Emo, while Highway 70A turned west to Black Hawk then south to Barwick. The northern end of the highway was also concurrent with Highway 17 for into Kenora, and the southern end concurrent with Highway 71 for between Emo and Fort Frances. During 1952, the highway was extended south from its split to Highway 71, midway between Barwick and Emo. By 1953, the new road was opened and informally designated as the new route of Highway 70\\\\. The old routes were decommissioned on February 8, and the new route designated on March 10, 1954. Throughout the mid to late 1950s, a new highway was constructed west from Thunder Bay towards Fort Frances. Initially this road was designated as Highway 120\\\\. In 1959, it was instead decided to make this new link a westward extension of Highway 11; a major renumbering took place on April 1, 1960: Highway 11 was established between Rainy River and Fort Frances, Highway 71 was truncated west of the Highway 70 junction, and the entirety of Highway 70 was renumbered as Highway 71. Current Highway 6, and former Highway 70, facing northwest towards Shallow Lake. = Bruce Peninsula = On April 22, 1965, the DHO recycled the Highway 70 designation, providing a shorter route for traffic between the Bruce Peninsula and Owen Sound. The new highway followed an existing Grey County road through Shallow Lake - the Southwest Diagonal. It was surveyed in 1854 by Ontario's deputy surveyor, Charles Rankin, to provide a short route between the undeveloped Sydenham (now Owen Sound) and Hepworth townsites. This route passed through a large swamp and as a result remained an unimproved one lane trail up until the 1920s. By the time the road was designated as a provincial highway in the 1960s, it was a paved two lane route. The route remained in service for just short of 32 years, remaining unchanged aside from minor curve alignment improvements and rehabilitation. On April 1, 1997, the route of Highway 6 south of Hepworth to Highway 21 was decommissioned as a provincial highway. The entire length of Highway 70 was subsequently renumbered as part of Highway 6 to rectify the resulting discontinuity.

In 1963, Harrison's son donated a collection of mostly British and British Commonwealth die proofs engraved by J.A.C. Harrison between 1911 and 1937 to the British Museum and it today forms part of the British Library Philatelic Collections. Biography John Augustus Charles Harrison was born in Manchester on the 5th of August 1872. He was the son of line-engraver, Samuel Harrisonn, and the grandson of John Harrison, a heraldic painter. Two of John‚Äôs three brothers, Thomas and Wilfred, were also engravers. John A.C. Harrison was apprenticed to his father at the age of thirteen, while he attended art classes in Birmingham. At seventeen, Harrison joined the firm of Waterlow Brothers and Layton as an ornamental engraver. By the end of the century, however, Harrison had left their employment and was working as a self-employed engraver. He specialised in the design and production of line-engraved heraldic bookplates, which gained him a wide reputation for his skills. Alongside his career as an engraver, Harrison was also a competent water-colourist and was interested in the stage. Harrison was commissioned by the Royal Mint to engrave the dies of several postage stamps, upon the death of King Edward VII in 1910.

This is an example of copper fanery Fanery is the traditional money used in Madagascar. It exists in silver, copper, nickel and aluminium forms and are found in various sizes. Apart from being used as an instrument, Fanery was also used as jewellery and medication. Prior to 1895 there was no local currency, hence the inhabitants of Madagascar transformed the foreign coins into Fanery.  Definition  The word \\"Fanery\\" has its origins in the local dialects spoken in Southern Madagascar. These differ considerably from the official \\"Malagache\\" dialects spoken by the local tribesmen Of Bara, Antanosy and Mahafaly. They exist in silver, copper, nickel and aluminium and are found in various sizes. Prior to French colonization, mining in Madagascar was non- existent. As a result, metals of all kinds were in extremely short supply, and to manufacture Fanery the makers had to resort to melting the foreign coins (mostly French) that had been introduced into the territory over the previous 200 years.  History  The southernmost tip of Madagascar has an ever- changing landscape of savannahs, deserts and spiny forests. There live the Bara, the Mahafaly, the Antandroy, the Sakalava and the Antanosy to name a few of the local tribes. As long ago as the 16th Century they made their first contacts with foreigners in the form of Portuguese invaders in the Fort Dauphin/Antalagnaro area and the English settlers who arrived in St. Augustin, which is close to the present-day towns of Tulear and Toliara. These Europeans brought various metals for trading purposes, usually in the form of silver Mexican Pesos and later French 5-Franc coins, and these currencies co-existed prior to French Colonial rule. Two forms of traditional money made from imported coins co-existed prior to French colonial rule. In January 1900 French money became the only legal currency in Madagascar. The use of \\"Monnaie Coupee\\" continued for a further five years until 1905 when it was felt that an adequate supply of French coins and notes was in circulation. Because most of the inhabitants believed that money (Malagache : \\"vola\\") also had magical properties, some of these Fanery have survived in the hands of local healers called mpisikidy (or \\"witch doctor\\"), ombiasa (\\"healer\\"), or olona-be-hasina (\\"wise man\\"). They used these to fabricate a talisman or lucky charm, whilst at the same time offering certain shells, magic wood (with supposed healing properties), seeds, beads and also animal parts as a remedy for all kinds of diseases. It is customary that when a person dies that these Fanery are buried with them, with the result that over time these have for the most part vanished and today are exceedingly scarce. It does happen that when silver in the form of old coins becomes available, the traditional silver Fanery gets copied. = Monnaie Coup√©e = Prior to 1895 there was no local currency. The silver coins that came from abroad were often cut into smaller pieces to satisfy the need for smaller denominations. These bits were called \\"Monnaie Coupee\\".N.I.Bulletin, Vol.42, N¬∞8, August 2007 In certain Southern areas the inhabitants preferred to transform the foreign coins into Fanery. This they did both for decorative and practical purposes. For the first time they used also copper coins to make Fanery, and these looked attractive when strung on a necklace. One can be reasonably certain that the \\"Monnaie Coupee\\" and Fanery circulated in the different areas at the same time, possibly also with other forms of payment.  Use of Fanery  Over the past 200 years Fanery have been used for various purposes: = For jewellery = As pendants on necklaces Necklace with fanery = For medicinal purposes = As \\"fanafody\\" or traditional medication In Madagascar for many centuries (and even up to the present day) all forms of money have been used by the Traditional healers. These \\"lucky charms\\" were either worn around the neck or placed on the body parts to be healed. = As an instrument of payment = It can be assumed that Fanery also had a monetary value. The silver coins found in Madagascar usually had a weight of 25 grams which could conveniently be converted into 10-12 silver Fanery. These silver Fanery had a certain value in relation to copper Fanery, but any supposed standard rate of exchange remains unknown. The situation is complicated by the fact that copper Fanery varied greatly in size and hence in weight. Just how much copper Fanery was required to match a silver piece is unknown at this stage. Silver coin and silver fanery As mentioned, original Fanery both in silver and copper have become very scarce today. Places where they may be found are threefold: * On archeological sites such as old grave-yards and holy places. * Some have been found together with other \\"holy objects\\" such as nails, coins, scissors, and cartridges on beaches and in shallow water. These were probably offerings. * Many of the above- mentioned ombiasa or healers tend to carry Fanery with them. They use them to fabricate lucky charms, and together with beads and certain types of wood, they would have something to offer to ward off evil Spirits and counteract diseases. These healers, when asked if they have any Fanery will invariably deny it. They are most reluctant to even show them to Vazahas (white men/foreigners). They tend to regard us as powerful magicians, able to construct such magic things as cars and airplanes, and they fear that in our possession their Fanery could lose its healing properties. Moreover, for much the same reason, anyone wearing a Fanery around their neck will immediately conceal it if they spot a white person approaching. One should note that in the last 70 years, with French coins readily available such as the nickel coins of the Twenties and Thirties and the aluminium coins of the Forties and Fifties, craftsmen have started to fabricate new Fanery. These 20th Century pieces can be found with ombiasa or healers at most of the local markets where medicinal herbs and lucky charms are sold. A collection of fanery collected over a long period of time with the assistance of locals in the remote regions of Betioky, Ampanihy and Bekily, where local beliefs and traditions still prevail, is presented in the photo gallery together with coins from which they were manufactured in the past.

According to the 2000 U.S. Census, Fairview Village has a population of 5,947. Much of the neighborhood is part of a historic district listed on the state and federal registers of historic places. History The neighborhood was a federally funded World War I planned community of approximately 1000 homes located near New York Shipbuilding of Camden, New Jersey, and was intended to provide housing for the shipyard's workers and their families.http://www.yorkshipvillage.com/article/litchfield-1919/index.php New York Shipbuilding had more than tripled in size due to war contracts, and the influx of shipyard workers was overwhelming the Camden housing market. The United States Shipping Board through its Emergency Fleet Corporation used funds from a $50,000,000 appropriation for housing to alleviate a housing shortage threatening its shipbuilding program. Actual construction was managed by the Department of Housing and Transit, United States Shipping Board, Emergency Fleet Corporation which selected Electus Darwin Litchfield as architect. The site chosen was just upstream from the shipyard on the South Branch of Newton Creek. The parcel, then located in Haddon Township, had formerly been the Old Cooper Farmstead. The village's design was influenced by the \\"garden city\\" developments popular in England at the time. Litchfield envisioned Yorkship Village as \\"a place of light rooms and clean yards, with adequate playgrounds and amusement fields; a place of beauty and appropriateness and cleanliness so great that a man returning from his daily toil would receive new strength and recreation; a place where the man who could save a fraction of his income would be able to obtain with it, for himself and for his children, a share of play and education, literature and music, and other uplifting things.\\" Air view of Yorkship Village. Litchfield's plan for Yorkship Village included narrow, winding residential streets (soon to be tree-lined), a central village square, broad green boulevards, and brick duplexes and row homes with both front and back yards. Architecturally, the village is now considered an example of American Federal style. The \\"village\\" character would be further emphasized by physical isolation, since it was bordered on three sides by Newton Creek. Construction began with ground- breaking on May 1, 1918. The United States Shipping Board, Emergency Fleet Corporation bore the estimated $11 million cost of construction, but required the local community to provide utilities, fire hydrants, and fire and police protection. The cost of those services was beyond the means of Haddon Township, which ceded Yorkship Village to the City of Camden on July 8, 1918. At the end of the war the Emergency Fleet Corporation began selling properties with 1,579 houses, 59 apartments, 13 stores, a hotel, a gymnasium and miscellaneous buildings unsold at the start of 1921. By the end of Fiscal Year 1924 all but twelve houses, the sewage system and plant, water system, bridge, public squares and parks had been sold. It became Camden's 14th Ward. Though Yorkship Village was renamed Fairview in 1922, the original elementary school located near the square is still operating as Yorkship School, and all of the original streets are still named for famous naval vessels.

The institution housed thirty-six inmates, a portion of whom are insane patients under the care of I. N. Pierce, superintendent. The Douglas County Poor Farm was appropriated $3,500 annually from the county, in addition to money earned from the farm's production. = Third building = The Hascall House was deemed too small by county commissioners in the 1880s, and in 1886 they began a preliminary process to build the Douglas County Hospital. The establishment of the Omaha Stock Yards and the platting of South Omaha made the land where the poor farm was located desirable for developers. A boom in real estate in the vicinity led commissioners to the idea of platting the east fifty acres of the poor farm and selling the lots to raise the necessary funds for the new county hospital. The commissioners adopted a resolution stating, \\"the proceeds arising from the sale of said lots shall be appropriated to the erection of a suitable building for the care and protection of the county poor and insane.\\" $330,480 was raised, and $133,000 was spent on constructing the hospital. Shoddy workmanship led to a large portion of this building falling apart within months of opening, and forcing the county to rebuild it at a significant cost. Another court case ensued when the county refused to pay the full amount of the original contractor's bill due to the workmanship issues. It also went to the Nebraska Supreme Court, and the county was eventually forced to pay.Wakely, A.C. Omaha: The Gate City, and Douglas County, Nebraska. General Books. p 350. In another trial that went to the Supreme Court of Nebraska, the City of Omaha and Douglas County were forced to issue bonds to pay claims against the sale of the land.

In a racing career that lasted from April 1812 to May 1814 he ran thirteen times and won four races. He recorded his most important success when winning the Derby. Octavius remained in training for two more seasons, his best subsequent performance coming when he won the Epsom Gold Cup as a four-year-old in 1813. At the end of 1814 Octavius was retired to stud where he had moderate success as a sire of winners. Background Octavius was sired by Orville a successful staying racehorse who excelled over extreme distances. At stud he was Champion sire in 1817 and 1822 and sired the Classic winners Emilius (Derby), Charlotte (1000 Guineas), Zo√´ (1000 Guineas) and Ebor (St Leger). Octavius's dam, Marianne, went on to produce Caroline, the winner of the 1820 Epsom Oaks. Octavius was owned during his racing career by his breeder, the banker Robert Ladbroke, a friend of the Duke of York and Lord Egremont, whose horses were trained by Richard Boyce at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1812: three-year-old season= Unraced as a two-year-old, Octavius made his first appearance at the 1812 Newmarket Craven meeting. On 30 March he started at odds of 5/1 in a 100 guinea Sweepstakes over the Abingdon Mile course and won from an unnamed gelding by Beningbrough. Just over two weeks later, Octavius contested the 2000 Guineas and started 4/1 second favourite. He finished third of the seven runners behind Cwrw and Cato. On 14 May at Epsom Octavius was fourth choice in the betting for the Derby at odds of 7/1 in a field of fourteen runners. Ridden by Bill Arnull, Octavius moved up to dispute the lead on the turn into the straight with the favourite Comus and Lord Egremont's unnamed Gohanna colt. Comus dropped back inside the last quarter mile leaving Octavius and the Gohanna colt to contest the finish \\"in desperate style\\", with Octavius prevailing by half a neck. The filly Manuella, who started second favourite, was believed to have been \\"pulled\\" (deliberately prevented from winning) by her jockey Sam Chifney in order to lengthen her odds for The Oaks on the following day. Octavius's next run came on 26 August at Egham Racecourse where he carried top weight of 122 pounds in the Magna Charta Stakes. He started the 2/5 favourite but finished last of the four runners behind the Duke of York's colt Pointers. =1813: four-year-old season= Octavius's first run as a four-year-old came in a division of the Oatlands Stakes at Newmarket on 21 April. Carrying 114 pounds and starting 4/1 second favourite, he finished unplaced behind Mantidamun. At the next Newmarket meeting on 5 May, Octavius started favourite for the Port Stakes over two miles and finished second of the six runners behind Aquarius, with Pointers third. On 3 June Octavius returned to the scene of his most important success to contest the Epsom Gold Cup. He was last of the four runners in the early stages, but moved up to join the leaders on the turn into the straight and recorded his first win in a year by winning the two mile race from Sorcery and Defiance after an \\"extremely spirited\\" race . At Ascot two weeks later Octavius ran twice without success. In the Swinley Stakes he ran a dead heat with the three-year-old Aladdin, but was beaten in a run-off after what the Sporting Magazine described as \\"a fine race\\". On the following day, he was beaten by the six-year-old Offa's Dyke, his only opponent in a one mile Sweepstakes. On 16 July, Octavius ran in his second dead-heat of the summer when he tied with the four-year-old Jesse in a one and a half mile race at Stockbridge Racecourse. On this occasion Ladbroke agreed to divide the prize with Jesse's owner without a deciding heat. =1814: five-year-old season= As in the previous season, Octavius began 1814 with an unsuccessful run in a division of the Oatlands Stakes in April, finishing unplaced behind Pericles. At Newmarket's First Spring meeting on 28 April, he ran in a King's Plate, a three mile staying race in which he carried 154 pounds and finished second to Aquarius. On 26 May Octavius returned to Epsom for the third time, but on this occasion he was unsuccessful, finishing unplaced behind Aquarius and Mantidamun in the Epsom Gold Cup. He was then put up for sale at Tattersalls where he was bought for 630 guineas by Lord Egremont and retired from racing. Stud career Octavius began his breeding career in 1815 at Lord Egremont's stud at Petworth. His stud fee of five and a half guineas made him a cheaper alternative to the other Petworth stallions Gohanna (20 guineas) and Canopus (10 guineas). Octavius was not a great success as a stallion, but he did sire the Ascot Gold Cup winner Sir Huldibras, the good stayer Black-and-all-black (who was black) and Little John, who in turn sired the 1839 Derby winner Frederick. He died at Petworth in 1831.

Early life Prib was born in Neryungri, now Russia, in 1989 into an ethnic German family. The Pribs emigrated to Germany just two years after his birth, settling in F√ºrth, where he enrolled the SpVgg Greuther F√ºrth academy. Club career =Greuther F√ºrth= Prib made it to the Shamrocks‚Ä≤ first team during the 2009‚Äì10 2. Bundesliga season. He missed a major part of the campaign due to torn ankle joint ligament, but he managed to play a total of 11 games anyway. Next season, this number increased to 13, and in the 2011‚Äì12 season he became a regular starter, gaining 27 league appearances and helping his team win the 2. Bundesliga and promote to the top division for the first time in their history. The first top-flight season was, however, unsuccessful as Greuther F√ºrth bottomed the 2012‚Äì13 Bundesliga table, resulting in relegation. In spite of that, Prib managed to stay in the Bundesliga: during the 2013 summer transfer window he signed with Hannover 96 for an estimated fee of ‚Ç¨2.5 million. =Hannover 96= Prib made his debut for the new club on 10 August 2013, starting the initial game of the season against VfL Wolfsburg at home, the fixture die Rote won 2‚Äì0. He scored twice in his 31 league games that season, also receiving 5 yellow cards. His club finished 10th in the Bundesliga. Next year, he scored against Schalke 04 helping his team win their very first match of the 2014‚Äì15 Bundesliga season, this was, however, his only goal in that competition as he injured his meniscus shortly after, reducing his number of league appearances to 20 but helping Hannover avoid relegation. A similar thing happened next season: Prib was ruled out with an injury early in September 2015, missing nine games in a row. The only difference was that the Reds finished last in the table, relegating to 2. Bundesliga gaining only 25 points. Hannover successfully returned to the top flight at the first attempt, promoting directly after finishing second in the 2016‚Äì17 2. Bundesliga. Prib played most of his team's games scoring once against his former club, Greuther F√ºrth. He also received a total of 10 bookings in that campaign.

Shortly after he was diagnosed with cruciate ligament rupture, an injury he picked up during the training. Prib was due to return in April, but was injured again and failed to make a single league appearance. On 3 May 2018, his contract was extended until May 2019.

It was published shortly after she recited her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at President Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration. Journey consists of a series of short essays, often autobiographical, along with two poems, and has been called one of Angelou's \\"wisdom books\\". It is titled after a lyric in the African American spiritual, \\"On My Journey Now.\\" At the time of its publication, Angelou was already well respected and popular as a writer and poet. Like her previous works, Journey received generally positive reviews.  Background  Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now (1993) is Maya Angelou's first book of essays, published shortly after she recited her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at the inauguration of US President Bill Clinton, making her the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's 1961 inauguration. Her recitation resulted in more recognition for her previous works and broadened her appeal \\"across racial, economic, and educational boundaries\\". Journey is, together with the 1997 book Even the Stars Look Lonesome, one of the volumes that writer Hilton Als called Angelou's \\"wisdom book, comprising \\"homilies strung together with autobiographical texts\\". Journey was published during the period between her fifth and sixth autobiographies, All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes (1986) and A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002). Angelou's second book of essays, Even the Stars Look Lonesome, was published in 1997. She had earlier published several volumes of poetry, including the Pulitzer Prize-nominated Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971). Angelou's first personal essays were published in Essence in late 1992. The positive response from her readers and the encouragement of her friend Oprah Winfrey inspired her to write Journey. She later admitted that the public's response was \\"puzzling\\" to her. She also stated that she attempted to be \\"accessible\\" to her readers in the book. Journey appeared on The New York Times bestseller list and had an initial printing of 300,000 copies. The Los Angeles Times, in a report about the 1993 financial struggles of Angelou's publisher, Random House, speculated that the success of Journey partly compensated for the publisher's other losses. By 1993, when Journey was published, Angelou had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. She was, as scholar Joanne Braxton stated, \\"without a doubt ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer\\". She had also become, as reviewer Richard Long stated, \\"a major autobiographical voice of the time\\". Angelou was one of the first African-American female writers to publicly discuss her personal life, and one of the first to use herself as a central character in her books. Writer Julian Mayfield, who called her first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings \\"a work of art that eludes description\\", stated that Angelou's series set a precedent not only for other Black women writers, but for the genre of autobiography as a whole. The book's title, comes from a lyric in the African American spiritual, \\"On My Journey Now,\\" which Angelou called \\"a great song.\\" The lyric also appears in the Civil Rights Anthem, \\"Keep Your Eyes on the Prize.\\"  Overview  Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now consists of 24 \\"journalistic homilies\\" or \\"meditations\\", many of which are autobiographical, that range in number from 63 to a few hundred words. Siona Carpenter of Religion News Service considered Journey as a part of the increase in popularity of motivational and inspirational books written by and for African Americans during the mid-1990s. The book's topics include fashion, entertainment, sensuality, pregnancy, racism, and death. Her character sketches are similar to the descriptions of people, including those of herself, that appear throughout her autobiographies. The book contains two poems, \\"Mrs. V.B.\\" about her mother Vivian Baxter, who was one of the first Black females to join the merchant marine, and an untitled poem about the similarities between all people, despite their racial and cultural differences. Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993  Reviews  As with Angelou's previous works, reviews of Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now were generally positive. Mary Jane Lupton compared the essays in Journey to traditional Asian poetry and to the writings of Confucius. Many reviewers saw similarities between the essays in the book and Angelou's autobiographical writing. Anne Patterson-Rabon, who was emotionally impacted by Angelou's essays, praised Angelou for her effective use of essays to tell her story and to illustrate her points. Lupton compared many of the events and character sketches in this book to descriptions in Angelou's autobiographies. She compared two essays about Angelou's grandmother to the descriptions in Angelou's first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, and the essay \\"Extending the Boundaries\\" to her quarrel with her husband's mistress in The Heart of a Woman. Marigold A. Clark of the Bowling Green, Kentucky Daily News called Journey \\"an autobiography like none other\\". She praised Angelou for using \\"her experiences as examples\\". Genevieve Stuttaford of Publishers Weekly called the essays in Journey \\"quietly inspirational pieces\\". Anne Whitehouse of The New York Times wrote that the book would \\"appeal to readers in search of clear messages with easily digested meanings\\". Patterson-Rabon stated that the book \\"sings\\" like the song from which it got its title. Journey made an emotional impact on Clark, who stated: \\"The reader can almost hear her voice through the written words.\\" Paul D. Colford of the Los Angeles Times said that the essays in the book \\"pass as easily as an evening breeze\\".  Citations   Works cited  * Lupton, Mary Jane (1998). Maya Angelou: A Critical Companion.

History Shepherd's Bush, from an 1841 London map by Davies. Goldhawk Road's name derives from one John Goldhawk, who in the late 14th century held extensive estates in Fulham.Charles James Feret, Fulham Old and New (The Leadenhall Press, London, 1900), Volume III, page 267 Goldhawk Road was of little note until the mid-seventeenth century, when a cottage on the street became the home of one Miles Sindercombe, a disgruntled Roundhead who in 1657 made several attempts to assassinate Oliver Cromwell. Sindercombe planned to ambush the Lord Protector using a specially built machine with muskets fixed to a frame. His plan failed and Sindercombe was sentenced to death. His cottage was demolished in the 1760s.Denny, p.51 A map of London dated 1841 shows Goldhawk Road forming the southern boundary of Shepherd's Bush Green. At that time Shepherd's Bush was still largely undeveloped and chiefly rural in character, with much open farmland compared to fast-developing Hammersmith, and several ponds or small lakes. Scattered buildings are shown, mostly lining the main thoroughfares of Wood Lane, Cumberland Road (now the Uxbridge Road) and Goldhawk Road.Denny, p.49 From 1939 until 1999 Queen Charlotte's Hospital was situated in Goldhawk Road. On 31 January 2018, a water main near the Shepherd's Bush end of the road burst, flooding part of the road. =Railways= Goldhawk Road tube station Railway bridge and entrance to Goldhawk Road station in October 1993 Goldhawk Road tube station is a London Underground station located in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, on the south side of Goldhawk Road, about 250m west of Shepherd's Bush Green. It is on the Hammersmith & City and Circle lines in Travelcard Zone 2. Although the line here was opened in 1864 a station was not opened at this location until 1 April 1914 when Shepherd's Bush station (now Shepherd's Bush Market) was moved from its original location between Uxbridge Road and Goldhawk Road to a location on the north side of Uxbridge Road. Stamford Brook Underground station, though located in the London Borough of Hounslow, also has its main entrance in Goldhawk Road, near the Chiswick end. Future Hammersmith and Fulham Council have released plans, in association with property developers Orion Shepherd's Bush Ltd, to build around 200 flats and houses as part of a large-scale renovation and improvement of Shepherd's Bush Market. The development would involve demolition of a number of Victorian shopfronts, No's 30‚Äì52 Goldhawk Rd, including a Pie and Mash shop at number 48 which has been owned by the same family since 1899.

The native of San Fernando, California, threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Perez signed with the Pirates in 1956 out of Verdugo Hills High School. He won 28 of 39 decisions in the lower and middle levels of minor league baseball during his first two seasons in pro ball, paving the way for his brief trial with the 1958 Pirates. His four-game stint included three well-pitched games, and one poor outing. The disappointing appearance came in his third MLB contest against the Los Angeles Dodgers, newly moved to Perez' native Southern California. On May 2, 1958, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Perez relieved starting pitcher Bennie Daniels in the fourth inning with the Pirates leading 5‚Äì2. Daniels departed with one out and two runners on base. Perez allowed the inherited runners to score, gave up three more runs of his own, and recorded only one out before he was relieved by Curt Raydon. Perez was tagged with the eventual 9‚Äì5 defeat.Retrosheet box score: 1958-05-02 However, in Perez' other three games, encompassing eight full innings, he allowed only two earned runs against the Milwaukee Braves, Cincinnati Redlegs and San Francisco Giants. In all, he worked 8 big-league innings, and gave up nine hits, four bases on balls, and five earned runs. He struck out two. Perez returned to the minors after his final appearance for Pittsburgh against the Giants on May 6, and stayed in the game into the 1961 campaign.

These series have very different themes: the \\"Dark Claw\\" books are a spoof of Star Wars and other such science-fiction stories, starring cats and rodents; the \\"Rex Files\\" (a take-off on the television series The X-Files) feature a duo of canine sleuths named Rex and Franky who investigate various terrifying paranormal events; and the \\"Ginger Ninja\\" books are about a pawball-mad kitten named Ginger who faces typical elementary- school problems such as bullies. Rayner has said that The Ginger Ninja is his favorite book, both because the Ginger Ninja is the character most like him (Rayner himself had bright red hair as a child) and \\"because that was the book where I looked deepest into the darkest regions of my character and managed to come up almost sane at the end\\", as he said in an interview with Word Pool. Despite their different subject matter, all of Rayner's books were designed to be both easy to comprehend and entertaining for children who are learning to read on their own. They feature short sentences, short chapters, and almost comic-book-like illustrations. Explaining what he finds most rewarding about his work, Rayner said in the Word Pool interview, \\"my readers are at the most important stage of reading development, where they can be put off or enthused for life.\\" While he admits that the early-reader genre is often overlooked by critics, \\"children find it for themselves and read my books by the bucket load. That's my reward.\\" Rayner illustrated the MudPuddle Farm series of books written by Michael Morpurgo. In January 2012, 9 million copies of the books were given away with McDonald's Happy Meals in the United Kingdom.http://www.mcdonalds.co.uk/ukhome/Aboutus/Newsroom/news_pages/McDonalds_links_up_with_HarperCollins.html Rayner has been at the forefront of children's authors using technology.

Voelker, writing under the pen name \\"Robert Traver\\". It is based on an actual trilogy of Michigan Supreme Court cases from the 1880s. The final case in the series, Kobogum v. Jackson Iron Co., established in Michigan the general rule that state courts must defer to tribal law in cases involving the internal, domestic relations of American Indians residing within their own territory.  Plot summary  A shy young lawyer, William Poe (Willy), opens up a law practice in Marquette, Michigan in 1873. His first client is Charlotte Kawbawgam, a Chippewa Indian, who wants to sue the Jackson Ore Company for breach of contract. Cassius Wendell (Cash), an aging, alcoholic lawyer with one wooden leg, had been Charlotte‚Äôs original legal adviser but had been holding onto Charlotte‚Äôs claim until she turned of age. Unwilling to take on the responsibility and effort of trying the case he withdraws and foists the case onto Willy. Charlotte‚Äôs mother, Sayee, was Marji‚Äôs second wife. She had died when Charlotte was a child. Ironically, Charlotte was raised by Marji‚Äôs first wife, Blue Heron, who Marji had never divorced. Later, Marji would take yet a third partner, Old Meg. The claim was based on the fact that in 1846 Marji had first shown the Jackson mining company the place containing rich deposits of iron ore that would later become the Jackson Mine. In return, the company granted a minority share of the mine to Marji. Many years later a new group gained control of the company and made it profitable. They refused to honor the contract with Marji but he had retained the original document of the contract, hoping that some day his daughter Charlotte would be able to benefit from his share. Marji goes to work for the mining company and eventually is killed in an accident. Willy interviews several Marquette-area regulars including the old man, Philo T. Everett, the company treasurer, who witnessed the execution of the contract but is on his death bed. He meets the Indian man, Osseo, who also witnessed the signing of the contract and was a long-time friend of Marji Kawbawgam. Osseo also predicted Marji‚Äôs death at the mine, noting that the mine is a sacred and dangerous place for the Chippewa. Cash assists Willy in developing the legal arguments in the case, but often disappears at critical moments because of his addiction to alcohol. Before the trial, much to Willy‚Äôs dismay, Osseo also dies. Willy tries but fails to locate an Indian woman named Cosima, who had also helped raise Charlotte. As the case proceeds to trial, Willy and Charlotte begin a flirtation that will eventually flourish into a romance at the end of the novel. Willy‚Äôs opposing counsel are two men, Henry Harwood, the local counsel for the Jackson Ore Company, and Guy Nesbitt, the company‚Äôs hired gun from New York City. Nesbitt is a legend as a trial attorney. Harwood, wealthy from his steady practice representing the mining company, owns the only passable set of legal books in Marquette and generously offers them the use of his library to Willy and Cash for their research. Strangely, Harwood does little of the work on behalf of the defendant once the trial begins and by the time of the appeal he withdraws from the case. Willy first faces a motion for summary disposition on the pleadings that identifies the key defenses that the company will raise: laches and polygamy. He survives the motion but now realizes the case is much more complex than he first assumed, dealing with a section of constitutional law regarding native American Indians, a subject he knows little about. After taking testimony on the cause of action and the defenses, the circuit judge, C. B. Grant, dismisses the case on the grounds that the state courts cannot rule in favor of the rights of children born in a polygamous marriage. Throughout the trial, the (fictional) Judge Grant grimaces in disgust whenever a witness describes the marriage, divorce, and adoption customs of the Chippewa Indians. During trial Cash learns that the local defense counsel, Harwood, recommended that the company settle the case. After trial is over, Harwood withdraws. Cash believes that Harwood would not have made the settlement recommendation unless there was a serious flaw in the defense‚Äôs strategy. Willy does not find the flaw until he uncovers one law book that Harwood had kept on his desk ‚Äì a book on family law with a section on American Indians. He learns that, under principles of federal Indian law, state courts have no jurisdiction over the internal domestic affairs of Indians and Indian tribes. He focuses his appellate brief on that point. On appeal before the Michigan Supreme Court, Willy finally prevails over Nesbitt and the mining company.

It is often referred to as \\"The Harper's Essay\\". First published in the April 1996 issue of Harper's magazine, the essay concerns the persistence of reading within the context of technological growth and distraction. Franzen recounts his meditations on the state and possibility of the novel form, often against the backdrop of his personal experience, eventually concluding that the novel still has potential cultural agency in the United States, and often gains it by paradoxical drives of both culture and author.  Background  The article was originally titled in reference to Hamlet, but Franzen humorously notes that most interviewers entirely missed the reference. The essay was initially published in the April 1996 issue of Harper's between the publication of Franzen's novels Strong Motion (1992) and The Corrections (2001). Franzen expanded and revised the essay, re-titling it \\"Why Bother?\\", and published it in his 2002 essay collection How to Be Alone. In the introduction to the collection, Franzen explained his changing the title as a response to the many interviewers asking about the essay but failing to understand its intention, believing the essay to be an explicit promise on Franzen's part of a third \\"Big Social Novel\\" featuring a good deal of local detail and observation. Franzen, instead, thought of the essay as a defense of reading and writing literature for its own sake in a modern world, expanding the essay later in response. Franzen noted that the original title was chosen by a Harper's editor hoping for easy recognition with Hamlet's soliloquy, but that interviewers frequently referred to the work as \\"The Harper's Essay\\". The essay makes frequent reference to the Paula Fox novel Desperate Characters, the work of linguistic anthropologist Shirley Brice Heath, Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22, and previous literary manifestos of Philip Roth, Flannery O'Connor and Tom Wolfe.  Content  Franzen recounts his \\"despair about the American novel\\" beginning in 1991 during what he viewed as the media assent to the jingoism surrounding the Gulf War and the presidency of George H. W. Bush. During this time, Franzen finds parallels to his own life's ambiguities surrounding a war to those of the Brooklyn protagonist in the novel Desperate Characters dealing with the despair surrounding the Vietnam War. Franzen also notes the novel's possible interpretation that in such times literary representation may fail to rise to desperate settings, surmising that the novel may precede Phillip Roth's declaiming of the realistic novel in the 1980s. During those years, however, Franzen believed the aesthetic solution was a push towards illogical and surreal representations of contemporary culture, using as an example Joseph Heller, particularly the novel Catch-22. Franzen completed his first novel The Twenty-Seventh City in this style with the hopes that it would spark social change, but despite its being published to warm reviews, the work garnered little attention from the culture at large. Franzen found himself attributing this to the gap presented by magazines and newspapers no longer committing to book reviews in significant numbers due to the market having little use for the individual \\"final\\" product of writers, as opposed to more temporary and dispensable forms of entertainment. Franzen suspected up to the time of the late-Victorians, novels still had the cultural role and expectations of instructing and possibly constructively affronting social sensibilities; electronic media from journalism to music having taken both these roles, with the rise of visual media and its quick delivery forcing all recognition to a very literal level. Franzen rejects the thesis presented by Tom Wolfe in \\"Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast\\" on grounds that fiction based on journalism seldom is given lasting media interest in the culture at large Franzen finds these developments sharply in contrast to the circumstances and rewards of lasting attention promised in Tom Wolfe's literary manifesto, \\"Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast\\". In contrast, Franzen posits that in the current cultural, media, and technological circumstances, major cultural problems are themselves cognitively reduced to surface issues for which immediate cures must be found. Franzen's recognition of these trends, along with the quick rise and cultural saturation of electronic media temporarily left him in despair as to the possibility of universal cultural engagement. During this period of personal disillusionment, Franzen came to be acquainted with Shirley Brice Heath, a linguistic anthropologist from Stanford. Franzen mentions first his astonishment at Heath's research methods, doing interviews in public places including public transit systems, airport waiting areas and resorts seeking what Heath defines as \\"enforced transition zones\\". Heath's interviews generally consist of discovering from individuals reading \\"substantive works of fiction\\" why they are reading, rather than using electronic media to stave off boredom. Heath's research found that those who continue reading this type of fiction frequently modeled on the individual enjoying reading first at a young age. Additionally, Heath found that the reading of substantive fiction is done by those of all educational backgrounds and economic positions. Heath's research divided those who developed the habit of substantively reading between those who modeled the reading of their parents, and those who found themselves social isolates as children from an early age. Those who began reading as social isolates are usually classed as more likely to become professional writers when they mature. Franzen notes that modern literature has frequently featured both writers and protagonists as social isolates, from the exiled characters of James Joyce to the self- isolates of J. D. Salinger. Extending this, he finds that many contemporary American authors have been notorious for their publicly recalcitrant nature, giving the examples of Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, Don DeLillo, William Gaddis, Thomas Pynchon, and Denis Johnson. Ancient Greek Theatre as embodying values of art still present in modern literature In the spring of 1994, while teaching at Swarthmore College, Franzen recalls his realization that the push towards balkanization of fiction‚Äîseeking to place Women's Fiction and Gay Literature at the forefront of the curriculum ‚Äî is not necessarily decided with the best interests of the authors' representative groups in mind, but more often intended as therapeutic against modern malaise, blaming \\"canonical\\" work as \\"Symptoms of Disease\\". Franzen also expresses great worry that the spread of this process will make young writers expect only to write within the context of their particular \\"ethnic or gender identity\\", ironically losing diversity of literature by seeking diverse cultural groups' literature. Franzen also cites some promise in Heath's research, finding that those who frequently read substantive fiction are those who find themselves emancipated from their original cultural heritage, making their reading a source of personal and intellectual integrity. Franzen further cites the work of Anthony Lane suggesting that while the majority of best-selling novels are of low quality, the trend holds true for a good deal of the history of the reading public. However, he does note such exceptions as Norman Mailer's ability to balance publicity with solitary work. Franzen then formulates a long-term opposition to literary culture, beginning with Plato, and extending the trend through to the contemporary arguments that literature is \\"undemocratic\\" and not politically viable. He opposes this to the long history of American literary protagonists who, though solitary, have been celebrated as exemplars of American freedom including Huckleberry Finn, Hazel Motes, and Tyrone Slothrop. Franzen suggests that the writing that shares the most political agency and aesthetic dignity would embody the values of expressive language, and urging the reader to look beyond appearances. He believes both values to be features of modern literature as well as western classics such as Oedipus Rex, but finding modern literature most effective in its tragic opposition to modern optimism. Franzen further defends the notion of literature as \\"depressing\\" by Flannery O'Connor's formulation that frequent reach for the \\"other\\" by reading marks, in fact, the absence of clinical depression. Franzen also notes that while America has always been at least in part, controlled by oppressive commerce, it has also had its victim-conquerors such as Herman Melville, who worked in spite of mental illness to deliver democratic art. Franzen concludes recounting his epiphany at being again able to read and write with a new sense of social responsibility. He advocates the possibility of tragic realism as containing potential for social change. Around this time, he also receives personal correspondence from Don DeLillo encouraging him in the path of writing as both personal freedom, with the‚Äîalbeit weak‚Äîpotential of changing culture in solitude as a permanent gift to writers.  Reception  In the introduction to the essay collection How to Be Alone, Franzen notes that he was frequently asked about the essay in interviews, and that may have aroused more interest than any of his fictional works. In a review of How to Be Alone for The A.V. Club, Andy Battaglia called Franzen's conclusions \\"a lot more heartening than might be expected\\", and found that the collection of essays was made far more interesting by both Franzen's tone of anxiety, as well as the controversies surrounding The Corrections being selected for Oprah's Book Club. Robert Rebein suggests that the original essay marks an intentional turning point in Franzen's style from early postmodern work to that of traditional realism. Rebein further notes that if Franzen's sales numbers are any indication, The Corrections certainly accomplished some degree of the cultural notoriety he desired. Ruth Franklin, in a review of Freedom for The New Republic, found the essay to be unfocused and ultimately inconclusive as to what the goal of the Social Novel, or the novel in general should be. Her review found Franzen's novels as well as his essays to depict a great cultural urgency, but neither find ways of confronting it. In a review of The Corrections for The eXile, John Dolan criticized the novel for not realizing Franzen's ambition as expressed in the essay. Dolan suggested that while Franzen believed himself to be writing in a style influenced by social realism, he was in fact relying on film and television clich√©s in the construction of his novels.

Glycerol kinase is responsible for synthesizing triglycerides and glycerophospholipids in the body. Excess amounts of glycerol can be found in the blood and/ or urine. Hyperglycerolmia occurs more frequently in males. Hyperglycerolemia is listed as a ‚Äúrare disease‚Äù which means it affects less than 200,000 people in the US population, or less than about 1 in 1500 people. Signs and symptoms The Human Phenotype Ontology provided the following list of symptoms and signs for hyperglycerolemia:U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (n.d.), Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center.

People with more severe cases of glycerol kinase deficiency may have a deletion of the GK gene that is large enough to see by routine cytogenetic evaluation.Blau, N., Duran, M., Blaskovics, K.M., & Gibson, K.M. (2012). Physician's guide to the laboratory diagnosis of metabolic diseases. New York, NY: Springer. It has been found an x-linked recessive inheritance pattern of the trait when a study was conducted on a grandfather and grandson. In addition, there is a high prevalence of [diabetes mellitus] in this family.Rose, C. I., & Haines, D. S. (1978). Familial hyperglycerolemia. Journal of Clinical Investigation, 61(1), 163. There is no known prevention for hyperglycerolemia because it is caused by a mutation or deletion of an individual's genetic code. Mechanism Hyperglycerolemia or Glycerol kinase deficiency, is caused by a rare X-linked recessive genetic disorder caused by a mutation or a deletion in the glycerol kinase gene, located at the locus Xp21.3 of the X chromosome between base pairs 30,653,358 to 30,731,461.Genetics Home Reference (n.d.), GK. Retrieved from http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GK Glycerol kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of glycerol by ATP, yielding ADP and glycerol-3-phosphate.Glycerol Kinase (n.d.). Retrieved from http://omim.org/entry/300474 It is more common in males because they only have one X chromosome, whereas females rarely manifest the disease because they have two X chromosomes. If hyperglycerolemia is caused by a mutation in the glycerol kinase gene then it generally causes an isolated glycerol kinase deficiency, resulting in the inability to synthesize triglycerides and glycerophospholipids. If hyperglycerolemia results from a deletion of the glycerol kinase gene then it often is part of a contiguous gene deletion syndrome with associated Duchenne muscular dystrophy and adrenal hypoplasia congenita.Huq, A. M., Lovell, R. S., Ou, C. N., Beaudet, A. L., & Craigen, W. J. (1997). X-linked glycerol kinase deficiency in the mouse leads to growth retardation, altered fat metabolism, autonomous glucocorticoid secretion and neonatal death. Human molecular genetics, 6(11), 1803-1809. Diagnosis Glycerol and glycerol kinase activity analyses are usually not offered by routine general medical laboratories.Arrobas-Velilla, T., Mond√©jar- Garc√≠a, R., G√≥mez-Gerique, J. A., D√≠az, I. C., Mengibar, M. C., de Diego, A. O., & Fabiani-Romero, F. (2013). Pseudo-hypertriglyceridaemia or hyperglycerolemia?. Cl√≠nica e Investigaci√≥n en Arteriosclerosis, 25(3), 123-126. To diagnose hyperglycerolemia, blood and urine can be tested for the amounts of glycerol present. There are three clinical forms of GKD: infantile, juvenile, and adult. The infantile form is associated with severe developmental delay and results in a syndrome with Xp21 gene deletion with congenital adrenal hypoplasia and/or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The infantile diagnosis is made by measuring plasma glycerol and is characterized by glycerol levels between 1.8 and 8.0 mmol/L and glyceroluria more than 360 mmol/24h. To confirm the diagnosis, genetic testing of the Xp21 gene is definitive. Children with GKD have severe hypoglycemic episodes and profound metabolic acidosis, or are completely symptom free. Individuals who are unable to form glucose from the glycerol released during triglyceride catabolism also the hypoglycemic episodes often disappear during adolescence. Patients with the juvenile and adult forms often have no symptoms and are diagnosed fortuitously when a medical professional tests for another medical condition. The juvenile form is an uncommon form characterized by Reye syndrome-like clinical manifestations including episodic vomiting, acidemia, and disorders of consciousness.Orphanet (n.d.), The Portal for Rare Diseases and Orphan Drugs. Retrieved from http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi- bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&Expert;=284411 Treatment In adults, fibrates and statins have been prescribed to treat hyperglycerolemia by lowering blood glycerol levels. Fibrates are a class of drugs that are known as amphipathic carboxylic acids that are often used in combination with Statins. Fibrates work by lowering blood triglyceride concentrations. When combined with statins, the combination will lower LDL cholesterol, lower blood triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol levels.Medicinenet.com (n.d.), Retrieved from http://www.medicinenet.com/fibrates/article.htm, If hyperglycerolemia is found in a young child without any family history of this condition, then it may be difficult to know whether the young child has the symptomatic or benign form of the disorder. Common treatments include: a low-fat diet, IV glucose if necessary, monitor for insulin resistance and diabetes, evaluate for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, adrenal insufficiency & developmental delay. The Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) does not list any treatments at this time. Research According to Clinicaltrials.gov, there are no current studies on hyperglycerolemia. Clinicaltrials.gov is a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Recent research shows patients with high concentrations of blood triglycerides have an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Normally, a blood glycerol test is not ordered. The research was about a child having elevated levels of triglycerides when in fact the child had glycerol kinase deficiency. This condition is known as pseudo- hypertriglyceridemia, a falsely elevated condition of triglycerides.Fabiani, R. F., Berm√∫dez, D. L. V. J., Gonz√°lez, M. C., Gentil, G. J., Oribe, A., & Cruz, C. (2009, July). [Hyperglycerolemia, a pseudo-hypertriglyceridemia: a case report]. In Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain: 2003) (Vol. 71, No. 1, pp. 68-71) Another group treated patients with elevated concentrations of blood triglycerides with little or no effect on reducing the triglycerides. A few laboratories can test for high concentrations of glycerol, and some laboratories can compare a glycerol-blanked triglycerides assay with the routine non-blanked method.Backes, J. M., Dayspring, T., Mieras, T., & Moriarty, P. M. (2012). Pseudohypertriglyceridemia: Two cases of probable glycerol kinase deficiency. Journal of clinical lipidology, 6(5), 469-473.

Kyle Bass (born September 7, 1969) is an American hedge fund manager. He is the founder and principal of Hayman Capital Management, L.P., a Dallas-based hedge fund focused on global events. In 2008, Bass successfully predicted and effectively bet against the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis by purchasing credit default swaps on subprime securities which, in turn, increased in value when the real estate bubble burst. Despite his early success in predicting subprime mortgages, he has received criticism for subsequent poor performance of investments. Bass has made prominent bets based on predictions of debt crisis in Japan and European sovereign debt, and shorted the Chinese yuan premised on a predicted collapse in the Chinese banking system. His fund has also challenged patents held by drug companies and shorted their stocks. His Japanese and European strategies have not been major successes and the Chinese yuan short led to severe losses for his fund in 2017. The drug patent challenge campaign fizzled after several legal setbacks. On June 14, 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that Bass is facing regulatory scrutiny from SEC investigators for potential market manipulation‚Äîan issue that appears to stemming from a controversial trade, executed in late-2015, in which Bass' fund built a short position against the stock price of a publicly traded REIT then accused the REIT of being a ponzi scheme. Bass and Hayman Capital were subsequently sued by the executives of the REIT and the case is currently in the discovery phase of state court proceedings. Bass is known as a staunch rhetorical critic of the Communist Party of China and its policies. However, financial reports filed with the Securities Exchange Commission show that he has accepted substantial investment capital in two of his investment funds from at least one technology company headquartered in China. Early life Bass was born on September 7, 1969, in Miami, Florida, where his father managed the Fontainebleau Hotel. His father later moved the family to Dallas, Texas where he managed the Dallas Convention and Visitors Bureau. Bass attended Texas Christian University on an academic and Division I diving scholarship. Among other accomplishments, Bass was a proud member of the collegiate social fraternity, Kappa Sigma, at Texas Christian University from 1989 to 1991 but parted ways from the fraternity prior to graduation. In 1992, Bass graduated with honors, earning a B.B.A. in finance with a concentration in real estate. Career Before founding Hayman Capital Management in 2005, Bass briefly worked at Prudential Securities from 1992-1994 before joining Bear Stearns in 1994. At Bear Stearns, he rose through the ranks rapidly, becoming a senior managing director at the age of 28 ‚Äì among the youngest in the firm's history to carry such a title. In 2001, he joined Legg Mason, signing a five-year deal to form the firm's first institutional equity office in Texas. Bass told his hiring managers, \\"In five years and one day, I [will] be launching my own firm.\\" While at Legg Mason, Bass advised hedge funds and other institutional clients on special situation investment strategies. In December 2005, when Legg Mason sold the portion of the business where he worked, Bass left Legg Mason and started Hayman Capital Management to serve as the investment manager to a \\"global special situations\\" hedge fund that he planned to launch. Bass launched Hayman Capital Management, L.P. with $33 million in assets under management ‚Äì $5 million he had saved on his own and the balance he had raised from outside investors. Shortly after launching the hedge fund in February 2006, Bass became convinced that there was a residential real-estate bubble in the United States one of the few investors to successfully predict and benefit from the subprime mortgage crisis, bringing him fame in the financial services industry. In 2007, Bass testified as an expert witness before the U.S. House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. During his testimony, he addressed: i) the role of credit rating agencies in the structured finance market and ii) policy measures that could be taken to minimize inherent conflicts of interest between rating agencies and issuers. In 2010, Bass testified before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. During his testimony, he addressed his analysis of the factors that caused the crisis. After enjoying success in predicting the subprime mortgage crisis and moderate success with debt in Greece and Japan, Bass would make a string of poor bets, leading to a dramatic downsizing of his fund. In April 2014, Bass was among a very few defenders of GM for its failure to address a defect that had been tied to 13 deaths. Hayman at the time owned eight million shares of G.M., making it Hayman's single biggest holding, Coming to the defense of GM, Bass said on CNBC that of the 13 passengers who had died owing to the defect, 12 \\"either weren‚Äôt wearing their seatbelt or were under the influence of alcohol.\\" Bass admitted in a late 2014 interview that it had been \\"a tough year\\" for Hayman due to owning a lot of GM stock, which was the fund's biggest position in 2014. After the losing year in 2014, investors pulled out nearly a quarter of Hayman's capital and the firm was forced to liquidate most of its stock holdings. Bass called 2015 one of his fund's worst years. By early 2019, Hayman had $423.6 million in discretionary assets under management, down from $2.3 billion at the end of 2014. Fund performance The long term performance of Hayman Capital's flagship fund is described by the New York Post as \\"small caliber\\". In the period from 2008 to mid-2015, the flagship fund experienced a very modest annualized performance of 1.56%. The flagship fund had a tremendously successful year in 2007, having gained 212%, based on the subprime mortgage meltdown bet that brought fame to Bass. The fund also gained 16% in 2012 based on bets on Greek debt. The fund lost 1.4% in 2014 and suffered its worst year in 2017 with a 19% loss (in contrast to a 19% surge of the S&P; 500) due to Hayman's misplaced short on a collapse in the Chinese yuan. Investment positions =Subprime mortgages= Bass first began formulating his subprime strategy after he met with an investment banker from New York while attending a wedding in Spain where they discussed how and why the Subprime Mezzanine CDO business existed.\\"House of Cards\\" interview CNBC, 2009 After returning to the US, Bass hired several private investigators to determine the ease of obtaining a mortgage. Bass spent a significant amount of time studying the residential mortgage market and performed research to identify which residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) composed of low- quality mortgages were most likely to default. This investment thesis was expressed by purchasing credit default swaps against the securitizations he deemed to be most unstable, which essentially was a manner of shorting the bonds using synthetic instruments. After purchasing the positions for his flagship fund in 2006, Bass raised additional capital for a special fund dedicated exclusively to capitalizing on the opportunity that existed in the market place. Bass managed or advised over $4 billion of positions in subprime RMBS. In December 2007, after a wave of foreclosures had swept across the US, Bass was featured on Bloomberg TV as making a fortune betting against these subprime securities. =Europe and Japanese debt \\"doomsday\\"= After the subprime debt crisis occurred, Bass decided that it was the symptom of a more significant problem with debt and made predictions about debt \\"doomsday\\" in Europe and Japan. In 2009 he warned about the possibility of defaults by major countries over the next 3 years. As of 2010, 10-15% of his portfolio was involved in bets against European and Japanese sovereign debts. He went as far predicted that 2012 would be a \\"doomsday year\\" for Europe and spoke of a looming breakup of the Eurozone, which, he declared, would lead to defaults in Japan and the United States. He stated in June 2012, \\"Europe goes first, then Japan and finally the United States.\\" Bass has since 2012 also predicted a \\"full blown crisis\\" in Japan describing its approach to financing debt as a Ponzi scheme similar to Bernie Madoff's investment scam. Though many experts have disagreed with his analysis. Renren, Inc., a Chinese company headquartered in the Chaoyang District, Beijing, China invested $80 million in Hayman's Japan Macro Opportunities Offshore Partners, LP, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, between November 2011 and January 2014. Renren reported that it received capital distributions of $84.0 million and $69.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and disposed of the investment on August 24, 2015. The Chinese company‚Äôs investment in Hayman‚Äôs Japan Macro Opportunities Offshore Partners, L.P. required Renren to include the Japan Macro Opportunities Master Fund, L.P. audited financials with its Form 20-F filed with the United States Securities & Exchange Commission. The Chinese company included the financials of Hayman‚Äôs Japan Macro Offshore Partner, L.P. as Renren ‚Äúcan exercise significant influence, but not control‚Ä¶‚Äù Cullen Roche criticized Bass's Japan analysis in August 2010, noting that Bass comparing Japan to the EU was an error, since their monetary systems are wildly different. Roche stated \\"people still fail to understand that a nation with monetary sovereignty that is the supplier of currency in a floating exchange rate system never has a problem funding itself.\\" In May 2012, Business Insider agreed, faulting Bass's analysis, since debt-to-GDP ratios do not reflect the interest rate or credit risk of a nation. The Business Insider noted that in a nation that borrows its own currency, public spending finances borrowing. However, Bass reported in his 2016 Investor Letter, that the Japan Macro Opportunities Fund performed well, stating \\"Our first Asia-focused fund, the Japan Macro Opportunities Fund, successfully returned capital to investors after the Japanese yen had depreciated approximately 40% from 2012-2015.\\" Bass has been vocal in public appearances about future calamities stemming from financial meltdown. September 14, 2011, Bass maintained on CNBC that Greece's only way out of its debt mess was a restructuring. Bass noted that despite the strife it would bring to Greece it was the only measure the nation could take. He added that within a year all of Europe would be in default as well. In a speech reported on January 1, 2014, he assured the audience of his confidence that the next few years would be rife with turmoil, including the eruption of major wars. In his speech, he claimed that with the growing debt and inability to pay it off, eventually social unrest will lead to violent outbreaks. Bass finished his speech stating \\"War is coming ‚Äì just as it has throughout history.\\" =Chinese banking collapse= Starting in July 2015, Bass made a multiyear bet against the Chinese yuan based on a predicted banking collapse in China. Bass closed out his position against the Chinese currency in early 2019 when the predicted devaluation of the currency did not occur. Bass argued in 2015 that the Chinese banking system was undercapitalized and its foreign reserves would be insufficient in a crisis. Bass predicted a hard landing for the Chinese economy following a bank crisis and a severe devaluation of the Chinese currency, variously given as \\"somewhere between 15%-20%\\" and \\"30 to 40 percent\\". Hayman suffered its worst year in 2017 with a loss of 19% due to the strengthening of the Chinese yuan. =US Equities= Despite his macro focus, his fund has reported significant equity positions in two companies, Eco-Stim Energy Solutions and NMI Holdings. Drug patent challenge campaign Bass has attempted to profit from filing and publicizing patent challenges against pharmaceutical companies while also betting against their shares. In 2014, Renren, Inc., a Chinese company headquartered in the Chaoyang District, Beijing, China invested $30 million in Bass' pharmaceutical strategy through Hayman Credes Offshore Fund, LP, registered as a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership and claiming Hayman Offshore Management as its General Partner. Renren reported Hayman Credes Offshore Fund, LP in its SEC filings from 2014 through April 2016 as a principal component of the company's \\"long- term investments\\" portfolio. Through its investment in Hayman Credes Offshore Fund, LP, the Chinese company appears to have participated in Bass' challenges of numerous U.S. drugs patents reportedly aimed at driving down the price of U.S. drug company stocks. In its form, 20-F, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for its fiscal year, ended December 31, 2016, Renren Inc. reported, \\"In December 2014, the Company invested $30,000 in Hayman which is a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership and served as a limited partner. The Company recognized its share of loss of $322 and $157 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. From February to April 2016, the Company withdrew all of its investment in Hayman and received total proceeds of $29,521.\\" After 2 years of setbacks in his effort, Bass by 2017 ended his patent challenges. In 2015, Bass organized the Coalition For Affordable Drugs (CFAD) to use the inter partes review (IPR) process to challenge patent validity. When he initiated this practice in January 2015, he claimed that his motive was to encourage competition in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and thus bring down prices. Bass filed a total of 35 patent challenges, in collaboration with Erich Spangenberg who has been called ‚Äúthe world's most notorious patent troll‚Äù, including 33 filed by CFAD and two filed by Bass personally on a not-for-profit basis. In June 2015, Celgene received permission from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to file a motion seeking sanctions against the CFAD for allegedly abusing the patent-review process. The Wall Street Journal noted that this development was ‚Äúbeing closely watched because it raises the possibility that patent officials may put an end‚Äù to Bass's patent-challenge scheme. Celgene also told the patent office, through counsel, that CFAD had threatened to challenge its patents unless Celgene met CFAD‚Äôs demands. In October 2016, Bass prevailed in the case, with USPTO invalidating the two Celgene Corp patents related to its cancer drugs Revlimid, Pomalyst, and Thalomid at issue. However, one year later Celgene was able to convince the Patent Trial and Appeal Board to re-hear the case. Politics =Trump administration= Bass is described by a ProPublica story as a friend of Tommy Hicks Jr, a private investor, who was a hunting buddy to Donald Trump Jr. and had further ties to the Trump administration. According to the investigative story on improper links between Hicks and the Trump administration, Hicks had obtained a hearing for Bass with high level officials at an interagency meeting at the Treasury Department to air views on China. This meeting was at the time Bass held a large short position counting on the fall of the Chinese currency. =Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner= The BBC has described Bass as having a \\"good relationship\\" with Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. In February 2014, Bass said that Argentinian bonds represented a profitable opportunity and called Argentina a most \\"interesting\\" nation for investments. He was virtually alone in this assessment. The IB Times noted that the country had \\"cheated creditors seven times since it gained independence from Spain in 1816,\\" most recently defaulting on its debt in 1989. When the Argentine government defaulted on its debt in July 2014, Bass supported the move and criticized the bondholders, notably Elliott Management and Aurelius Capital, that, with the support of U.S. federal judge Thomas Griesa, had held out for full payment. Echoing Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, he called these creditors \\"vultures,\\" said that they were \\"holding up 42 million people from progress,\\" and were holding Argentina for \\"ransom\\". On August 27, 2014, Bass accused Elliott's Paul Singer of \\"holding poor countries as hostages,\\" prompting The New York Post to comment in an editorial the next day that Bass had \\"sounded more like Argentina's leftist economy minister Axel Kicillof than a US hedge- fund manager.\\" = China = On February 8, 2020, he quarreled with the editor in chief of the Global Times. He tweeted that the \\"chinese virus\\", a reference to SARS-CoV-2, should \\"rampage through the ranks of the GT and the rest of the communist party\\". The editor-in-chief, Hu Xijin said he had an \\"anti-human tendency\\" and ordinary CPC members \\"are ordinary citizens, fathers, husbands, wives, daughters\\". Kyle Bass has refused to apologize for his words, deleted the tweet before doubling down on them and calling Hu a \\"disgrace\\". Philanthropy Bass serves on the board or in an advisory role for a number of charities and organizations. He has served on or is currently serving as a board member of the University of Virginia Darden School of Business Advisory Group for the Richard A. Mayo Center for Asset Management, Texas Department of Public Safety Foundation, Business Executives for National Security, Comeback America Initiative, Troops First Foundation and Capital for Kids, and University of Texas/Texas A&M; Investment Management Company. From August 2010 to May 2019, Bass was a member of the Board of Directors of the University of Texas/Texas A&M; Investment Management Company (UTIMCO), an endowment fund for Texas public universities. On advice of Bass in 2011, the endowment continued to increase its holding in gold to $1 billion and also took physical delivery of the investment in the form of gold bars. In a February 2012 board meeting, Bass insisted the endowment hold onto its gold investment, citing the risks of inflation due to government deficits in the US and EU. Beginning in October 2012, gold entered into a severe slump and by May 2013 the endowment lost $300 million in paper losses according to The Wall Street Journal.

Brooks. It stars Abigail Breslin and Georgie Henley. The film was released on April 11, 2014, and was based on the novel The Class Project: How to Kill a Mother, which itself was based on the real-life murder of Linda Andersen. Plot Sandra Andersen, her younger sister by one year, Elizabeth (aka \\"Beth\\"), and their younger brother, seven-year-old, Robert \\"Bobby\\", live with their alcoholic 44-year-old mother Linda. Linda, every now and again, has boyfriends who are usually abusive towards her and her children, both physically and psychologically. Sandra now is a senior in high school and Beth is a junior, and they cannot take Linda and her alcoholism. They plot to kill their mother, and plan to live with their friends after they kill her because they will get their mother's life insurance money. They tell their friends Justin and Ashley to make reservations at their favorite restaurant while Sandra and Beth get Linda intoxicated, drug her and later drown her in their apartment bathtub. Once they do all of this, Sandra feels guilty while Beth feels excited. Beth then convinces her that everything is going to be better with their mother dead. The two are sent to live with their aunt, and Bobby is sent to live with their long-lost estranged father. No one suspects that Sandra and Beth have anything to do with their mother's death, as everyone just thinks that she drowned in her bathtub while being drunk and on drugs. Sandra and Beth begin to get popular at school after telling their friends that they killed their mother, and no one at school even thinks about reporting them. An older friend of Sandra's begins to believe that Sandra and Beth had something to do with it after Sandra tells him that their mother's death might not have been an accident. He goes to the police and they tell him to wear a wire, pick Sandra up and see if he can find out more about the incident.

Controversy The film was scrutinized by the Toronto community for portraying the teenage murderers through a far too sympathetic lens. Author and journalist Bob Mitchell stated, \\"I don't think the movie dealt with how cold-blooded and calculating they were\\", in an interview about the theater adaptation of his book. Reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 25% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 3.86/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 44 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average favorable reviews\\". Dennis Harvey of Variety criticized the film for being \\"ineffectual and cartoonish\\", and compared it unfavorably to the similarly-themed 1994 film Heavenly Creatures.

It was listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites in 2009 and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. History The first fire station east of the Anacostia River was built in 1898. This station, designed by the Washington, D.C. architectural firm of Averill and Adams, was the fourth built there in 1910. The eclectic style, principally French revival, reflected the desire by the Office of the Municipal Architect to create unique designs for new fire stations. At the time, this part of the District of Columbia was considered a suburban district because it was beyond public water service and the street alarm system. Chemical Company Number 2 was housed here for that reason. The building's hose tower was also used as a lookout post. It joined with the last of the District's Chemical companies in being converted to a regular engine company on January 1, 1921 when it became Engine Company 19. In 1925 it was the last company in the department to switch from horse drawn apparatus to motorized.

Biography  His father was a musician at the court in W√ºrttemberg. At the age of thirteen, without the knowledge of his parents, he applied and was accepted at the Karlsschule, where he studied with the painters Nicolas Guibal and Adolf Friedrich Harper. Originally, he focused on landscape painting. His love of the theater brought him into contact and eventually a friendship with Friedrich Schiller. With the approval of his instructors, at the age of 22, he went to Paris, where he was accepted as a student by Joseph Marie Vien and Claude Joseph Vernet. Later that year, was appointed a court painter to Charles Eugene, Duke of W√ºrttemberg. He returned to Stuttgart after two years. In 1785, with financial support from the court, he was able to undertake further studies in Rome, where he spent time copying the Old Masters. He became a Professor at the Karlsschule in 1790 but, after the death of Duke Charles, the school was disbanded.Wolfgang Kermer: Daten und Bilder zur Geschichte der Staatlichen Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste Stuttgart. Stuttgart: Edition Cantz, 1988. In 1798, Hetsch was able to replace Harper as the Director of the Ducal Picture Gallery; holding that position until 1816. In 1808, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of the Crown, which entitled him to add a non-hereditary \\"von\\" to his name.K√∂niglich W√ºrttembergisches Hof- und Staatshandbuch 1815, Seite 37 In 1787, he married Louise Scholl (1766-1800), the daughter of a church councilor.

It is referred to by the common names star grass and Engelmann's seagrass and grows underwater on shallow sandy or muddy sea floors. It is native to the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Gulf Coast of the United States, the Gulf Coast of Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Trinidad and Tobago. Description Halophila is the only genus of seagrass lacking basal sheaths on the leaf stems. Like other seagrasses, Halophila engelmannii has rhizomes that run along near the surface of sand or mud, with roots at the nodes to anchor them in place. Each leaf stem grows from a node and has a pair of scales halfway up and another pair at the base of the leaf blades. There are 4 to 8 blades on each stem, each of which is up to long and wide. Each blade is oval, has 6 to 8 veins and a finely serrated margin.Halophila engelmannii star grass Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Retrieved 2012-01-28.

It can grow in deeper waters than do some other species of seagrass, at depths down to . It is one of three species of Halophila found in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, the others being Halophila decipiens and Halophila johnsonii. They often form mixed seagrass meadows at greater depths than other seagrasses normally grow.Halophila engelmannii (Star grass) Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce. Retrieved 2012-01-28. Biology Flowering occurs in the early summer when the water temperature reaches at least 22 ¬∞C. Fragments of the plant that become detached are able to grow into new plants. The seagrass meadow acts as habitat and food source for many invertebrates and fish.

With editorial offices at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida, the journal is a scholarly publication and journal of record in Florida history. History Organized on November 26, 1902, and chartered three years later, the Florida Historical Society was the successor to the Historical Society of Florida, formed in 1856. According to its charter, the society's mission was twofold: \\"the collection, arrangement and preservation of all materials pertaining to the history of, or in any manner illustrative of Florida . . . [and to] prepare, edit and publish articles, sketches, biographies, pamphlets, books and documents, descriptive or illustrative of Florida\\". To fulfill the second objective, the Society initiated the Publications of the Florida Historical Society in April 1908, the predecessor to The Florida Historical Quarterly. Both the collections and the publication depended on whether \\"our members and friends will sustain us with such financial aid as may be necessary\\". At the time, annual dues were five dollars, but society officers still had trouble collecting. \\"Don't make it necessary for those who are devoting their time and labor in the interest of the Society, without financial compensation, to have to send a second notification to delinquent members\\", said President F.P. Fleming in 1908. About the Florida Historical Society Today, the Florida Historical Society has grown from its early days in a \\"commodious\\" room of the Jacksonville Public Library to its current home in a renovated U.S. Post Office in Cocoa, Florida. The society has evolved in its mission as well: dedicated to preserving Florida's past through collection and archival maintenance, through scholarly research and publication, and through public history, historic preservation, and youth education.  The Florida Historical Quarterly The Florida Historical Quarterly has likewise evolved. From his office at the University of Florida, Professor Samuel Proctor edited the journal for nearly thirty years, from 1964 to 1993, before handing editorial control over to Professor George E. Pozzetta at the University of South Florida. Less than two years later, however, Pozzetta died, and Proctor returned to the editorship until someone new could be found. In late 1995, Professor Jerrell Schofner succeeded Proctor as interim editor, establishing a partnership between the Florida Historical Society and the University of Central Florida. The following year, Professor Kari Fredrickson assumed editorship for a four-year term. Her interests in social history expanded the breadth of historical topics covered in the publication and further strengthened the journal. In 2000, Craig Thompson Friend became the journal's editor. Under his editorship, the publication added an occasional feature called the \\"Florida Room\\". Named for the enclosed patios where Floridians, forced indoors by heat, mosquitoes, and humidity, entertain guests and casually relax, mingle, and share informal essays, the Florida Room feature is designed to engage readers more directly in recent regional developments. Since 2005, Connie L. Lester, Associate Professor in History, has been the journal's editor. In 2011, the publication added an Assistant Editor, Daniel Murphree, Associate Professor in History. Published four times annually, the journal promotes scholarly research and appreciation for the peoples, places, and diversity of Florida's past. A peer-reviewed journal, the publication has entered the digital world in several ways. It produces a podcast for each issue featuring an interview with one or more authors. The website will also feature images and interactive research. Past issues of the journal are available online through JSTOR and the Publication of Archival, Library & Museum Materials (PALMM). Finally, with the addition of a digital editor, the publication has initiated new research using the journal itself to understand new historiographic paradigms. Throughout its history, the journal has been a central component of the mission of the Florida Historical Society to promote scholarly research and publication. Dr. John B. Boles, editor of the Journal of Southern History, has offered repeated praise for The Florida Historical Quarterly, calling it \\"one of the three best state journals published in the South and one of the very best of its kind published in the nation\\", citing the articles as \\"well-chosen, skillfully edited, [that] reflect the highest academic standards\\".John B. Boles to Edmund F. Kallina, September 10, 2002, and John B. Boles to Rosalind J. Beiler, August 13, 2008, FHQ editorial offices, University of Central Florida, Orlando.

It is one of the illusions Copperfield performed only once in his career. Effect On both sides of the wall, there are two identical cubic platforms, raised from the ground and with one face abetted to the wall. After the first platform is covered by sheets, Copperfield enters it, and his silhouette is shown entering the wall. The sheets are removed, and the platform is indeed empty. On the other side of the wall two assistants are on the second platform and put a sheet against the wall: for a few seconds two hands and a face push against it from the wall. The assistants cover the platform with sheets and leave it. Copperfield's silhouette is shown emerging from the wall, then he throws away the sheets to reveal himself.

It was given by Christian V of (Denmark and) Norway on 15 April 1687 and entered into force on 29 September 1688, as the legal code for the Kingdom of Norway including its dependencies (the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland). Norway was a nominally sovereign kingdom, but politically (although not economically) the weaker part in a personal union with Denmark at the time. The Norwegian Code was largely based on the Danish Code (Danske Lov, DL), promulgated in 1683 and itself mostly based on older Danish laws, but the Norwegian Code had some differences from the Danish Code in some areas, such as inheritance law, agricultural law, law relating to hunting, fisheries and trade, and military issues.Sverre Bagge and Knut Mykland, Norge i dansketiden, Politiken 1987, p. 200 In the 19th and 20th centuries, most of the provisions were gradually repealed as they were replaced by modern laws. The code as such remains in force, and it was last amended on 1 January 1993. As late as the postwar era, the Supreme Courts of Denmark and Norway interpreted identical provisions from the Danish and Norwegian Code respectively; they came to the opposite conclusions regarding the meaning of identical provisions NL 6-10-2 (in force in Norway until 1985) and DL 6-10-2 (still in force in Denmark). The provision is ambiguously worded and regulates compensation for damage caused by livestock and dogs. The Supreme Court of Norway ruled on the meaning of this provision in 1954.Rt. 1954 p. 710Torstein Eckhoff. Rettskildel√¶re, 3rd ed., Oslo, TANO, 1993, Norway's new Criminal Code entered into force in 1842, but crimes committed before that year were punished under the Norwegian Code. The Norwegian Code was last applied in a criminal case in August 1862, when 80-year-old Lorentse Thomasdatter Vaagen admitted to having robbed and killed her friend Gunnil Heggelund in Trondhjem in 1827. She was sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and she died in the same year.Torgrim S√∏rnes. Ondskap. De henrettede i Norge 1815‚Äì1876, p. 234 Parts of the Norwegian Code also remain in force in the former Norwegian dependencies Iceland and the Faroe Islands, which became part of Denmark with the dissolution of the Dano-Norwegian union in 1814. Iceland is today a sovereign state, while the Faroe Islands is a self-governing Danish dependency. Background It is also referred to as Christian V's Norwegian Code, to distinguish it from its predecessor, Christian IV's Norwegian Code, in force from 1604 to 1688. Christian IV's Norwegian Code was largely a translation into Danish of Magnus VI's Norwegian Code, promulgated in 1274 as a unified code of laws to apply for the whole country, including the Faroe Islands and Shetland, and replacing earlier regional laws.

In 1866 he invented the ‚ÄúPaper Rigollot‚Äù, poultice made from black mustard deoiled used to facilitate breathing during respiratory disease. The invention was shown at the Universal Exhibition in 1867. It was adopted by the Paris hospitals, military hospitals and the British and French Navy. In 1872, he directed the poultice plant of Fontenay-sous-Bois.  Family  Paul Jean Rigollot was the son of Gratien, gunsmith, and Marie Philibert. He was the grandson of Paul Rigollot, officer of Health Master Surgeon. He married Sophie Marie Alexia Troyon. They have one daughter who married Auguste Fr√©mont, lawyer and friend of L√©on Gambetta. His sister Pierrette Sophie married Dr. Fran√ßois Bourgaud, who succeeded Paul Rigollot (the grandfather of Paul Jean) as Master Surgeon.  Biography  In 1825, he successfully continued his studies at the School of Pharmacy of Paris. He then returned to his shop in Saint-√âtienne. He invented a gas regulator and a firedamp detector which were not retained by the manufacturers. In 1849, his experiences swallowed up proceeds from the sale of his pharmacy. Penniless, he returned to Paris. During the French coup of 1851, he was imprisoned a few days with the sculptor David d'Angers, who became his friend. In 1853, √âmile-Justin Menier (Menier Chocolate) moved the family pharmacy in Saint-Denis and placed Paul Jean Rigollot. In 1860, the pharmacist Boggio imagined the mustard plaster in sheets, and Menier launched into rubber production: Paul Jean Rigollot worked and improved the sheets by using a rubber adhesive solution. He died in 1873 in Paris. He was buried in Asnois, Ni√®vre, where his bust with the epitaph: ‚ÄúSavant disinterested one aim, to relieve humanity otherwise it was a hundred other celebrities‚Äù. Chocolate has generated much interest among pharmacists, as a tidbit but as an excipient. Paul Jean Rigollot has worked extensively with the firm Menier, was cited in an 1896 book, The Science of Advertising: a huge amount of chocolate that had turned white because of cooling, the sale was compromised. He had the clever idea to print a new ad: ‚ÄúChocolat Menier, the only one who whitens with age‚Äù.

After having worked and studied under architect Kim Swoo Geun of Space Group and architect Yoon Seung Joong of Wondoshi Architects Group (0f which he had been a partner since 1980), he studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London, UK, in 1989/1990. In 1992, he started his own practice H. Min Architect and Associates.

Since then he has continually presented new projects, each one of them containing creative issues, for example, \\"Phenomenological Aesthetics\\", \\"Madang; Specific indeterminate space\\", \\"Architectural Landscape\\", \\"Structuring Emptiness; ethics over aesthetics\\".Structuring Emptiness : Book Review- October 2011.

Most of all, his works have centered on \\"Structuring Emptiness\\",ÎπÑÏõÄÏùò Íµ¨Ï∂ï Structuring Emptiness. ÎèôÎÖò (2005). which stems from Korean traditional architecture. Min's propositions in architecture are continually concerned with \\"Structuring Emptiness\\" which is a design of potentials: as infrastructures of daily lives deeply related to the properties and intimacies of the site it sit on. This idea aims to reach beyond the level of objectification in architecture. Abstracting the geological features of the site, he creates a specific architectural landscape. Alternative to symbolic architecture, this idea presents a way to search for different dimensions of architecture and reach beyond the level of objectification. His works are not only searching for the identity of Korean contemporary architecture but also developing and expanding those ideas to generate a theory of the future.UHSoA Currents 2008: Structuring Emptiness - April 2008.

A Commodore VIC-20 port was published by HesWare in 1983. The player attempts to rescue the citizens of a city from an impending volcanic explosion. The design of the game is inspired by Defender from Williams Electronics, though not a direct clone. The sequel, Protector II, has similar gameplay but is more advanced graphically. Gameplay Protector near the start of the game. The player's spaceship has picked up a citizen and is in the process of carrying them to New Hope, offscreen to the right. The gameplay of Protector is inspired by Defender, with the player controlling a rocket fighter of similar design and the general goal being to pick up civilians from the ground to protect them from the enemy. The game is less action-oriented, however, and contains a more strategic component. Protector has two stages. In the first, the player flies the \\"Needlefighter\\" over a city that is under attack by an indestructible enemy spaceship. The spaceship flies over the city, beaming its citizens up one at a time and then flying to a nearby volcano to drop them in. To save them from this threat, the player must fly over each of the people to pick them up, then carries them past the volcano to the City of New Hope. When all of the survivors have been moved to New Hope, the first stage of the game ends. This causes the enemy spacecraft to disappear. However, this also causes the volcano to erupt. Its lava encroaches on New Hope and destroys its buildings, along with anyone on them. The ending of the first stage also opens a passage protected by \\"laser gates\\". The player now ferries the people from New Hope through the laser-guarded gauntlet to the entrance of an underground fortress. When the last survivor is deposited in the entrance, the game ends. The mission takes place on a single large side-scrolling map, several times wider than the physical display. Smooth scrolling is used to keep the player roughly centred as they fly. If the player's ship hits the ground, buildings or the enemy spacecraft, it tumbles to the ground before being pulled away by an ambulance. There are several levels with increasingly difficult enemies and terrain. Development Potter started programming on the Atari home computers in 1980, after graduating from high school. His first product was a set of four games, Imperial Walker, Nim, Gun Fight, and Auto Racer, sold on consignment at local computer stores. While visiting the Electronic Fantasy store in Cupertino, the manager Dave Stillings, mentioned he might want to get in contact with Crystalware in Gilroy. Potter met with Crystalware's owners, John Bell and his wife Patty. Bell outlined a new game and gave Potter a $4,000 advance on its completion. This took seven sleepless nights, and after delivering it in May 1981, Potter delivered another eleven programs for Crystalware between May and October. That month Potter questioned his royalties, and in return received a letter firing him, but returning the rights to Protector.Years later a game with Bell and Potter's names surfaced with the Epyx label on it, Indiana Jones - Pyramids of Giza. It is assumed to be a game from the Crystalware era that was later sold to Epyx but never released. In November 1981, Potter met with Ihor Wolosenko of Synapse Software, which at that time was being run from Wolosenko's apartment in Berkley. Wolosenko took the time to test and debug the program before putting it back on the market. Its re-launch received much better reviews. Over the next year, Potter released five games for Synapse, Protector, Protector II, Chicken, Nautilus, and Shadow World. Reception John Anderson reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"Protector represents a breakthrough of sorts. The music in the program is excellent, and remains constant throughout the game--with the result of adding much character to its play. When your ship is downed, an ambulance shoots out to drag you away. The overall result is humorous--at least until frustration sets in!\\" Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games in 1983 stated that the Atari 8-bit version of Protectors \\"animation is mirror smooth\\", praising its horizontally scrolling graphics.

The site covers an area of in the region around Lake Tumba in the western Congo Basin in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This is more than twice the size of Belgium or Maryland. The vast area of forest and permanent or seasonal lakes and marshlands has great environmental and economic value. However, a rapidly growing population combined with weak and corrupt governance may be contributing to irreversible destruction. Location The Ramsar wetland area of Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe is bordered to the west by the Ubangi and Congo rivers, which form the boundary with the Republic of the Congo. The Kasai River and its tributary the Fimi River, which drains Lake Mai-Ndombe, define the southern boundary. Within the site, Lake Mai Ngombe is farthest south, with Lake Tumba to the north. Further north again is the city of Mbandaka, on the east bank of the Congo River. The region included in the Ramsar wetlands extends further north in the region between the Ubangi and the Congo, as far as the town of Makanza on the Congo. Environment The Ubangi and Congo rivers join in the Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe region to form a huge area of flooded forest covering more than that varies in size seasonally. When the wetlands around Lake T√©l√© in the Republic of the Congo are included, the area contains the largest body of fresh water in Africa. The two largest areas of open water are the shallow lakes Tumba and Mai Ndombe. Lake Tumba covers about depending on the season, connected via the Irebu channel with the Congo river. Water may flow into or out of the lake through this channel depending on the floods. Lake Tumba has 114 species of fish. Lake Mai Ndombe covers about and is surrounded by flooded forests and swamps. Both lakes support important fisheries. Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe is part of the moist tropical forest of the Congo Basin, which includes over 10,000 plant species. The diverse fauna includes many bird species. It is home to hippopotamus and to three types of crocodile. Forest elephants, forest buffalo and leopards are of particular interest to conservationists. The wetlands are estimated to have 150 species of fish. The brown waters of the flooded forests, with plant fragments suspended in anaerobic conditions, are home to endemic species of fish uniquely adapted to this environment. These include Protopteridae, Polypteridae, Notopteridae, Clariidae, Anabantidae, and Channidae. Objectives Houses on Lake Ma√Ø Ndombe As a party to the Ramsar Convention, the DRC is obliged to identify wetlands of global importance and to ensure that they are used in a sustainable manner. Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe is considered important because the vegetation of the flood basin absorbs water during the rainy season and releases it later, regulating flooding downstream. It helps filter impurities from water that is used by millions of people, and it provides breeding sites for fish that provide food for the inhabitants of cities such as Brazzaville and Kinshasa. The wetlands and forests also serve as a major carbon sink, absorbing and retaining carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Efforts to gain recognition of the wetland began in 2004, with support from the USAID Central African Regional Program for the Environment, the Ramsar Convention and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The WWF took a leading role in developing technical plans. Official recognition was formally announced in Kinshasa in July 2008. The WWF has said it plans to continue working with international partners and with local communities to preserve biodiversity through sustainable development in the landscape. The Lac Tumba- Ledira and Ngiri reserves are contained within the site, supporting research and helping raise awareness. People and economy Mbandaka, at the center of the site Children beside lake Ma√Ø Ndombe The city of Mbandaka, capital of √âquateur province with a population of around 750,000, is near the center of the Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe site. The site also contains several smaller towns, mainly populated by Mongo people. Communities in the area grow cassava, sweet potatoes, sugarcane and bananas for local consumption. They produce palm oil, groundnuts and rice as cash crops, and catch fish for shipment to large cities in the region. The people of the region are extremely poor and suffer from endemic local conflicts as well as food insecurity. 26 police and at least 100 civilians died, and tens of thousands were displaced, in the 2009 Dongo conflict over fishing and farming rights in the northwest of √âquateur. The local population is growing at about 3% per year, one of the highest rates in the world, placing growing stress on natural resources. However, the region is still sparsely populated with 6‚Äì24 inhabitants per square kilometer. About 90% of the people outside the urban centers live on under $1 per day, and few have access to clean water. Maternal and infant mortality rates are high and diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS are prevalent. Governance in the region is weak and corruption is widespread. The central government does not provide funding to the provinces. Land tenure laws are poorly defined and applied. Laws regulating mining, agriculture and forest use are inconsistent and poorly enforced, causing conflict over rights to exploit resources. Logging concessions do not recognise traditional land rights and are causing unsustainable degradation of the forests. Other threats come from the expansion of oil palm plantations, commercial farms and from urbanization. Most of the people have little or no education. They use unsustainable quantities of firewood and charcoal as their main source of energy, and contribute to forest degradation through slash-and-burn cultivation. Fish stocks are declining due to overfishing using fine-mesh nets, including mosquito nets. Illegal bushmeat hunting and trapping to meet demand from the towns and cities is causing wildlife populations to decline. Jos√© Endundo Bononge, DRC Minister of Environment, says: > \\"The enemy of the forest is its misery and poverty‚Ä¶ We cannot maintain and > protect this forest with a miserable people, a poor population, who has no > schools, no health care centres, no drinking water and no electricity\\". Between 75% and 95% of rainfall in the Congo Basin is thought to be recycled as water vapor rises from the forests and marshes and falls again as rain. Rainfall has declined in recent years. It is possible that a vicious cycle is setting in where degradation of the swamps and forest is causing reduced precipitation, which in turn is causing further degradation.

Extensively drug resistant tuberculosis is tuberculosis that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, any fluoroquinilone, and any of the three second line injectable TB drugs (amikacin, capreomycin, and kanamycin). TDR-TB has been identified in three countries; India, Iran, and Italy. The term was first presented in 2006, in which it showed that TB was resistant to many second line drugs and possibly all the medicines used to treat the disease. Lack of testing made it unclear which drugs the TDR-TB were resistant to. The emergence of TDR-TB has been documented in four major publications. However, it is not recognised by the World Health Organization. This is because the term defined as \\"totally drug resistant,\\" has not been applied to the disease of tuberculosis. Certain strains of TB have not been properly tested to be deemed as resistant due to lack of in vitro testing. TDR-TB has resulted from further mutations within the bacterial genome to confer resistance, beyond those seen in XDR- and MDR- TB. Development of resistance is associated with poor management of cases. As of 2011, drug susceptibility testing is done in less than 5% of TB cases globally Without testing to determine drug resistance profiles, MDR- or XDR-TB patients may develop resistance to additional drugs and can continue to spread the disease to others. TDR-TB is relatively poorly documented, as many countries do not test patient samples against a broad enough range of drugs to diagnose such a comprehensive array of resistance. The United Nations' Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases has set up a TDR Tuberculosis Specimen Bank to archive specimens of TDR-TB. There have been a few examples of cases throughout many countries like India, Iran, and Italy. Cases of TDR-TB have also been reported in the United States. The first case was found in a young man from Peru named Oswaldo Juarez. Juarez was in the United States for school and to study the English language. About a year later he was voluntarily sent to A.G. Holley State Hospital. They treated him with unconventional drugs that are not usually used for TB in extremely high doses. He stayed in hospital for over nineteen months, but left cured of TB.

Very little is known about him. Traditional biographies record that he was the abbot of Tongan Monastery on Mount Fengchi near modern Nanchang. The earliest source of information on monks of this era is the Zutang ji (Patriarch's Hall Record), which was completed in 952, but it fails to mention Tongan Daopi as a disciple of his supposed teacher Yunju Daoying. The Zutang ji does, however, record someone with the name Tongan asking a question to Yunju Daoying. The scholar Ui Hakuju has written this could likely refer to Tongan Daopi. He is first explicitly mentioned in the Transmission of the Lamp, which was compiled around 1004. However, in that work, it does not mention Tongan Daopi as having any disciples. The commonly accepted version of his lineage holds that Tongan Guanzhi is Tongan Daopi's successor. However, this comes from Huihong's Sengbao zhuan, which was completed in 1119, much longer after Tongan's death than the other works. The Transmission of the Lamp instead claims that Tongan Guanzhi is the disciple of a Tongan Wei, in turn a student of Jufeng Puman, with Jufeng being an apparently obscure student of the famous Dongshan Liangjie. Both Tongan Wei and Jufeng Puman are listed for the first time in the Transmission of the Lamp, and neither with much information. However, Dayang Jingxuan, who in Huihong's version of the lineage is a descendant of Tonagan Daopi, is recorded in the Transmission of the Lamp as being descended through Jufeng Puman and Tongan Wei. Dayang was close with Wang Shu, one of the compilers of Transmission of the Lamp, suggesting that it is unlikely that an error would have been made therein about his lineage. This suggests that Tongan Guanzhi is much more likely to have been a student of Tongan Wei and not Tongan Daopi as commonly accepted.

It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. In 2015 it was included as a contributing property in the Cedar Rapids Central Business District Commercial Historic District. The building is now known as the Roosevelt Lofts. History The architectural firm of Krenn & Dato designed the building, which opened in 1927. It was known as Cedar Rapids' premiere hotel at the time. The building is 12 stories tall and rises above the ground. The exterior of the structure is clad in brick and features Regency-styled ornamentation that includes medallions, garlanded panels, and a row of finials along the parapet. The lobby and many of the public interior spaces were decorated in the Italian Renaissance Revival style. The hotel was renovated in the 1990s to create rental units while retaining hotel rooms. It was in the midst of a $3 million to $4 million renovation when it was affected along with the rest of downtown Cedar Rapids by the Cedar River flood in the summer of 2008. A total of $14.4 million was then spent on the building to create 96 apartment units, which opened in 2010. Commercial space was created on the first floor.

City librarian Bell Chrisman led the effort to convince the city to seek Carnegie funds. It is one of 17 libraries in Montana and 1,679 in the United States funded by Carnegie. It was built on a Greek Cross plan in Classical Revival style, with Roman Doric columns supporting a triangular pediment at its entrance. The library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 2, 1979. Today, the building houses the law offices of Cok Kinzler, PLLP. Establishment By 1900, the small libraries that had served Bozeman since 1872 were inadequate. Local librarian Bell Chrisman wrote directly to Andrew Carnegie, explaining the need for a new library. Carnegie donated $15,000, and the city of Bozeman pledged annual support and provided land, which at the time happened to be across the street from the red-light district and Chinatown, which had opium dens. Reform-minded citizens with Progressive beliefs, led by Bell Chrisman, intentionally selected the location to rid Bozeman of its disreputable neighborhood. Although the proposed location met considerable opposition, Chrisman and her followers prevailed, and the red-light district and the Chinese population dwindled. The building was designed by Charles S. Haire, an architect from Helena, Montana, and served as a library until 1980 when a new library was completed. The building then housed city offices. By the mid-1990s, the building was in a serious state of disrepair. In 1998, Michael Wheat, now a member of the Montana Supreme Court, and his law partner, Michael Cok, purchased the building for their law offices and undertook extensive renovations which were completed in 1999. Today, the building is often opened for public events, including Historic Preservation Week. According to local preservationist B. Derek Strahn, several other buildings in Bozeman's historic section were renovated in the 1990s and early 2000s, but \\"few have had as great an impact as the restoration and rehabilitation of Bozeman's cherished Carnegie Library.\\" See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in Gallatin County, Montana References Category:Library buildings completed in 1904 Category:Libraries on the National Register of Historic Places in Montana Category:Neoclassical architecture in Montana Category:Carnegie libraries in Montana Category:Buildings and structures in Bozeman, Montana Category:1903 establishments in Montana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Gallatin County, Montana ","title":"Bozeman Carnegie Library"},{"id":"34528689","text":"Disasteroid is the debut studio album of the Indianapolis Christian horror punk band Blaster the Rocketboy, released in 1995.

He later served as head basketball and baseball coach at Oklahoma A&M; University and head basketball coach at Tulane University. Early life Rody grew up in Downs, Kansas, and graduated from Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, Missouri in 1918. At Wentworth, Rody served as a First Lieutenant in Company B. He lettered in baseball and basketball, leading the basketball team to a conference championship and a 9 and 4 record, including a victory over Park College. Athletic career =Player= Rody entered the University of Kansas in the fall of 1918, and earned three letters each in basketball and baseball. As a pitcher on the baseball nine, he helped the team to Missouri Valley Conference championships in both 1921 and 1922. As a senior forward and basketball team captain in 1921-22, Rody led the Jayhawks to a 16-2 record and the Missouri Valley Conference championship, playing under legendary Hall of Fame coach Phog Allen. That season, Rody led the team and conference in scoring with a 14.7 average, and was named first team All Missouri Valley Conference. According to Spalding‚Äôs Official Basketball Guide for 1922, Rody was given the ‚Äúfirst team captaincy‚Äù of the all Missouri Valley Conference team, the forerunner of the conference ‚ÄúMost Valuable Player‚Äù award. Rody was described as ‚Äúthe high point scorer in the Conference, combining goals from the field with shots from the foul line. The Kansas captain was a speed flash, a good shot, a brilliant dribbler, a shifty dodger, side-stepping, pivoting and out-witting his guards frequently. Also, Rody is 'one of the finest and cleanest players in the Valley,' quoting the coach of a rival team. . . Rody led the Kansas team through a strenuous schedule and held up his play nearly all the way. He is worthy of the honor in every way.\\" (pp. 74‚Äì75) The 1921-22 Jayhawk team, which also included future hall of famer Paul Endacott, Adolph Rupp and Charlie T. Black, was retroactively awarded the national championship by the Helms Athletic Foundation, the first such national basketball title for Kansas. Following the completion of his college career, Rody spent three years with the Hillyard Shine Alls, one of the top Amateur Athletic Union basketball teams in the United States, while also playing semi-pro baseball. =Coach= After his stint with the Hillyards, Rody entered the coaching ranks in 1926, heading Central High School's basketball squad in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma for three seasons. In 1929, Rody was named as head basketball and baseball coach of the Oklahoma A&M; Aggies. Rody led the baseball team to a 9 and 3 record in 1930 before the sport was discontinued for the 1931 season due to financial concerns. His Cowboy basketball teams had two losing seasons, with a 1 and 15 record in 1929-30, and a 7 and 9 record in 1930-31. However, the 1931 team's 5 and 3 record in the Missouri Valley Conference earned them a conference co-championship. Rody moved to the Tulane Green Wave the following season and coached two years with a 6 and 10 record in 1931-32 and an 8 and 15 record in 1932-33.

Originating as a bond of ‚Äúbrotherhood‚Äù, the gang soon escalated into one of the most feared gangs of their time with their flash mob style attacks and muggings. Although their reign was for a limited time, they managed to terrorize the streets of New York enough to leave their mark on them, even relevant to today's society. History The Decepticons were a street gang or street organization that thrived from the late 80s through the early 90s. Their members were teenagers and young adults ranging from the age of 15 to early 20s. The gang was most prominent in Brooklyn, but at their peak the group consisted of multiple branches, or legions, all across New York City. In an interview with former Decepticon ‚ÄúGeneral Steele‚Äù it‚Äôs mentioned that there were legions of Decepticons in Clinton Hills, Flatbush, East Flatbush, and Bed Stuy Brooklyn, Harlem, Manhattan and parts of Queens. Steele references in his interview how the Decepticons were all over the place in patches due to the groups upbringing. The legions would initially begin as a formation of a bond of bullied kids who needed strength in numbers. The original group of Decepticons started in Brooklyn, New York with 3 boys from 2 different schools. Two of the boys, who went by the names of Cyclonis, and Rumble went to Bushwick High School, and the other, called Megatron, went to Brooklyn Technical High School. They formed their bond in order to make sure no one would harm them. As those founding fathers found more people with common mindsets in the two schools they went to, their numbers grew and soon after their small group morphed into a feared gang. Impact on society Their presence began to fade in the early 1990s yet the Decepticons indeed left their mark on New York City, and even on culture today. A few members went on to notable rap careers such as Sticky Fingaz, Fredro Starr, Rock and Sean Price. Sticky Fingaz and Fredro Starr were in the rap group Onyx. and Fredro Starr was a prot√©g√© to Jam Master Jay. Sean Price and Rock frequently collaborated on albums such as Price's Monkey Barz and Smiff-N-Wessun‚Äôs Smiff- N-Wessun: Reloaded. Rock even had his songs put into video games: \\"I Am Rock\\" for Need for Speed: Most Wanted and NFL Street 2, and \\"This Is Me\\" for Blitz The League II. Although, while a member of the Decepticons, Rock found himself arrested for assault and an attempted murder charge for allegedly shooting a rival pimp, while he worked as one. Hip-hop artist Jay-Z has made reference to The Decepticons and LoLifes in song. In B.K Anthem Jay says ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt safe on the A-Train/ in G or the F/Decepticons, LoLife niggas/Snatch the polos off your chest.‚Äù  Divisions  The Original Decepticons, or Decepts, were Megatron, from Brooklyn Technical High School, as well as Rumble and Cyclonis, from Bushwick. However, from there, the group quickly expanded and multiplied. Lacking a formal structure, groups would often spring up and claim that they were Decepts. Latin groups of Decepts formed in the Bronx and Queens, therefore expanding the territory that Decepticons occupied. In Brooklyn, local offshoot groups of Decepticons would often sprout up. There were even female counterpart to the Decepticons called the Deceptinettes, whom were said to be equally as mischievous as the men. They had brutal initiation rituals for new members. Contrary to popular belief the Deceptinettes were already a group of friends even before meeting the Decepticons. There was never a time in the history of the Decepticons, that a Deceptinette had to sleep her way into the gang- membership was earned through loyalty and violence.  Motive  As a whole, the Decepticons had no primary goal. They were poor kids living in impoverished neighborhoods who came together in order to try and make the tough situation in which they were dealt easier for one another. Acts of violence would most frequently come in the form of robberies. The gang would converge on the subways and from there hangout on the corners of streets by neighboring schools. If a physically weak looking target approached them, the gang would surround them and swiftly mug them. Another common spot for their robberies were on the subways themselves. Being a very small, crowded, noisy setting, the Decepticons would rush into the room, robbing people of whatever they can and then rushing out like a gust of wind. The Deceptinettes would play games such as ‚ÄúOne Punch Knockout‚Äù for fun. In this game they would assault a random, unsuspecting person to see if they could knock them out with one punch- a pastime thought to have been played by both the girls and the boys.
