It was preceded by The Chance of a Lifetime and followed by Boston Blackie Booked on Suspicion. Blackie is called upon to recover a stolen diamond. The film is noteworthy as the directorial debut of Budd Boetticher, though he is credited under his real name, Oscar Boetticher, Jr. He had been working at Columbia as an assistant director on such films as The Desperadoes and Cover Girl. He had been called in to help complete films but called this his \\"first real picture\\".Budd Boetticher: The Last Interview Wheeler, Winston Dixon. Film Criticism; Meadville Vol. 26, Iss. 3, (Spring 2002): 52-0_3. He helmed four more B-pictures before leaving the studio in 1945. Plot The Blue Star of the Nile is stolen from an exhibition guarded by the police under Inspector Farraday. Under intense pressure from the police commissioner to recover the diamond, Farraday tells reporters, among them Dorothy Anderson, that he is sure Boston Blackie is responsible. However, he does not really believe that; it is only a ruse. When Blackie walks into Farraday's office, the inspector is so desperate he deputizes his old nemesis to get the jewel back, using his own methods. Blackie is certain the robbers had inside help. He finds a wad of gum under some of the furniture at the exhibit hall; it still bears the impression of the diamond. Blackie targets George Daley, the assistant manager, especially after he learns that George had recently bought a large amount of gum. He gets sidetracked when Anderson recognizes him and has him arrested, but Farraday soon lets him out the back way. Daley's sister Eileen finds out that her brother is involved with thieves Paul Martens and Matt Healy, and that he later hid the diamond in her purse. She persuades him to give the jewel to Blackie. However, his former partners show up just after he meets Blackie. In the ensuing scuffle, they kill Daley, and kidnap Blackie and his sidekick, \\"the Runt\\". The crooks figure that, with Blackie missing and unable to clear himself, he will be suspected of both the robbery and the murder. Indeed, Farraday begins to believe just that. Blackie tells his captors that what they have is a fake that he intended to switch with the real diamond, supposedly stored in a vault. Uncertain, they take it to fence Jumbo Madigan to get his expert opinion. Blackie manages to free himself and the Runt, and persuades Madigan to go along with his story. However, when the police surround the place, Martens and Healy realize they have been double crossed, and shoot Madigan, though not fatally. When the cops break in, they do not spot the pair, posing as mannequins. The crooks later return to their apartment. Blackie offers to steal the real diamond. They agree to his arrangement, but keep the Runt as a hostage. Blackie goes to Farraday, who surrounds the building with policemen. Then Blackie and Farraday enter the apartment to negotiate the Runt's release. Martens and Healy make a break for it, but are caught.

Early life Zhao Xi was born in Wan, Nanyang Commandery (present-day Nanyang, Henan). At a young age, he was known for his integrity. When Zhao Xi was 15, his elder cousin, who had no son, was murdered. Zhao Xi harboured the thought of avenging his cousin, so he brought a group of people with him to confront his cousin's killer. The murderer was ill, and Zhao Xi felt that it was inhumane to kill him at that time, so he spared him. When the killer had recovered, he bound himself and came to plead with Zhao Xi. However, Zhao Xi refused to meet him and had him killed. =Service under Gengshi Emperor= In 9 CE, Wang Mang usurped the throne of the Western Han Dynasty and declared himself emperor of the Xin Dynasty. By 23 CE, several revolts had broken out throughout China due to Wang Mang's incompetent rule. Around the time, Liu Xuan, a descendant of the Han imperial clan, was proclaimed \\"Gengshi Emperor\\" by rebels aiming to restore the Han Dynasty. Gengshi's forces were attacking Wuyin (), a city controlled by a certain Li family. Gengshi heard that Zhao Xi had some influence over the Li family, so he invited Zhao to help him persuade the Lis to surrender. When Gengshi met Zhao Xi, he saw that the latter was merely a youth, so he viewed Zhao Xi lightly. When Zhao Xi arrived in Wuyin, the Li family surrendered on their own accord, and Gengshi Emperor granted Zhao Xi the title of \\"Lieutenant General of Five Mights\\" () for his achievement. Zhao Xi was injured when he fought in the Battle of Kunyang against the Xin Dynasty, and later received the title of \\"Marquis Yonggong\\" (). In 25 CE, Gengshi Emperor was defeated and killed by the Chimei, another rebel movement. Zhao Xi protected Gengshi and his subjects, along with their families, and led them through Wu Pass to safety. He instructed young women to smear dirt and mud on their faces to avoid being violated by the rebels if the latter caught up with them. =Service under Emperor Guangwu= Gengshi Emperor was succeeded by Liu Xiu, who became known as Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han Dynasty. When Deng Feng (), one of Guangwu's subjects, betrayed his lord, Zhao Xi wrote a letter to Deng to reprimand him. When the situation in China had become more stable, Emperor Guangwu appointed Zhao Xi as Marquis-Chancellor of Jianyang () and Marquis-Chancellor of Pinglin (). In 41 CE, when Zhao Xi was in office as Prefect of Huai County (), he punished a wealthy landlord Li Zichun and his two grandsons for violating the law. Not long later, he was reassigned to be the Administrator of Pingyuan (). In 50 CE, the women whom Zhao Xi saved at Wu Pass 25 years ago praised him, so Emperor Guangwu summoned him to the imperial court and commissioned him as Minister Coachman (). A year later, Zhao Xi was promoted to Grand Commandant (), received the title of a \\"Secondary Marquis\\" (), and was tasked with inspecting the border. In 56 CE, he accompanied Emperor Guangwu to attend a fengshan () ceremony at Mount Tai. =Service under Emperor Ming= Emperor Guangwu died in 57 CE. In his final edict, he ordered Zhao Xi to assist his successor, Emperor Ming. In 58 CE, Emperor Ming named Zhao Xi \\"Marquis of Jiexiang\\" (). In the spring of 60 CE, Zhao Xi was stripped of his post of Grand Commandant for making an erroneous report on Xue Xiu (), the chancellor of Zhongshan (). In winter that year he replaced Dou Rong () as Minister of the Guards (). In 65 CE, he took over Yu Yan () and served as acting-Grand Commandant. When his mother died of illness, Zhao Xi returned home to mourn, and Emperor Ming attempted to persuade him to remain in court. =Service under Emperor Zhang= During the reign of Emperor Ming's successor Emperor Zhang, Zhao Xi was promoted to Grand Tutor () and oversaw affairs in the imperial secretariat. =Death= Zhao Xi died of illness in 80 CE, during Emperor Zhang's reign, at the age of 84. He was granted a posthumous title, \\"Marquis Zheng\\" (). References * Fan Ye. Book of the Later Han, Volume 26, Biography of Zhao Xi.

History Antone was born in Mobile, Alabama, and attended Tuskegee University, graduating with a degree in electrical engineering in 1983. Following graduation, he started graduate studies in electrical engineering, but moved to the state of Florida in 1984, where he pursued graduate studies in public administration at the University of Central Florida, but did not graduate. Antone worked as a legislative aide to State Senator Buddy Dyer from 1992 to 1999, including serving as his chief of staff. He ran for a seat on the Orange County Commission from the 6th District, but received only 9% of the vote. In 2000, when incumbent State Representative Alzo J. Reddick did not seek re-election, Antone ran to succeed him, facing Gary Siplin, Wardell Sims, Miles Brooks, and David Rucker in the Democratic primary. He earned the endorsement of the Orlando Sentinel, which praised him as the \\"best equipped\\" candidate, but ultimately, he lost to Siplin and Sims, who advanced to a runoff election, winning 27% of the vote. Florida House of Representatives When Siplin, whom Antone had lost to in 2000, decided to run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election, Antone ran to succeed him in the 39th District, which stretched from downtown Orlando to Pine Hills. In the Democratic primary, he faced Tiffany Moore-Russell, Geraldine F. Thompson, and Jon Eason, whom he defeated with 34% of the vote, and advanced to the general election, where he faced Janet Buckles, the Republican nominee. Antone emphasized that, unlike Siplin, he would focus on passing bills into law while serving in the legislature and would not waste his time on \\"feel-good\\" efforts. Antone defeated Buckles easily, winning 75% of the vote. In 2004, when he ran for re-election, he was opposed in the primary election by Tiffany Moore-Russell, once again, and Fritz Seide Jackson. Antone expanded his margin of victory from 2002, and won renomination with 52% of the vote to Moore- Russell's 39% and Jackson's 9%. He faced Thomas J. Kelly, the nominee of the British Reformed Sectarian Party, in the general election, whom he handily defeated with 90% of the vote. Rather than seek re-election in 2006, Antone instead opted to run for a position on the Orange County Commission from the 6th District. He faced Moore-Russell, Juan Lynum, Jackson Marcelin, and Chick Fryar in the primary election, and he placed second to Moore-Russell, with 37% of the vote to her 38%, advancing to the general election. He was endorsed by the Sentinel, which praised his \\"sensible priorities\\" of increasing funding to the Lynx bus system, supporting SunRail, and fund after-school programs for children. However, he narrowly lost to Moore-Russell, winning only 47% of the vote to her 53%. He and David Rucker challenged her in 2010 when she sought re-election, but she defeated him in a landslide in the primary election, winning 61% of the vote to his 26% and Rucker's 13%. When legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Geraldine F. Thompson opted to run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election in the newly created 46th District, so Antone ran to succeed her. He ran on a platform of giving the long-neglected district proper attention \\"in the form of job-training, education funding and services for the elderly.\\" He emerged successful in the Democratic primary, winning 36% of the vote to Pam Powell's 29%, Sean Bradford's 15%, Rosalind Johnson's 13%, and Jason Henry's 8%. In the general election, Antone faced no opposition and he returned to the legislature uncontested.

The theorem is named after Polish mathematician Samuel Eilenberg and Romanian mathematician Tudor Ganea. The theorem was first published in a short paper in 1957 in the Annals of Mathematics.** Definitions Group cohomology: Let G be a group and let X=K(G,1) be the corresponding Eilenberg‚àíMacLane space. Then we have the following singular chain complex which is a free resolution of \\\\mathbb{Z} over the group ring \\\\mathbb{Z}[G] (where \\\\mathbb{Z} is a trivial \\\\mathbb{Z}[G]-module): :\\\\cdots \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\delta_n+1} C_n(E)\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\delta_n} C_{n-1}(E)\\\\rightarrow \\\\cdots \\\\rightarrow C_1(E)\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\delta_1} C_0(E)\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\varepsilon} Z\\\\rightarrow 0, where E is the universal cover of X and C_k(E) is the free abelian group generated by the singular k-chains on E. The group cohomology of the group G with coefficient in a \\\\mathbb{Z}[G]-module M is the cohomology of this chain complex with coefficients in M, and is denoted by H^*(G,M). Cohomological dimension: A group G has cohomological dimension n with coefficients in Z (denoted by \\\\operatorname{cd}_Z(G)) if :n=\\\\sup \\\\\\\\{k : \\\\text{There exists a }Z[G]\\\\text{ module }M\\\\text{ with }H^{k}(G,M) eq 0\\\\\\\\}. Fact: If G has a projective resolution of length at most n, i.e., Z as trivial Z[G] module has a projective resolution of length at most n if and only if H^i_Z(G,M)=0 for all Z-modules M and for all i>n. Therefore we have an alternative definition of cohomological dimension as follows, Cohomological dimension of G with coefficient in Z is the smallest n (possibly infinity) such that G has a projective resolution of length n, i.e., Z has a projective resolution of length n as a trivial Z[G] module. Eilenberg‚àíGanea theorem Let G be a finitely presented group and n\\\\ge 3 be an integer. Suppose the cohomological dimension of G with coefficients in Z is at most n, i.e., \\\\operatorname{cd}_Z(G)\\\\le n. Then there exists an n-dimensional aspherical CW complex X such that the fundamental group of X is G, i.e., \\\\pi_1(X)=G. Converse Converse of this theorem is an consequence of cellular homology, and the fact that every free module is projective. Theorem: Let X be an aspherical n-dimensional CW complex with œÄ1(X) = G, then cdZ(G) ‚â§ n. Related results and conjectures For n = 1 the result is one of the consequences of Stallings theorem about ends of groups.* John R. Stallings, \\"On torsion-free groups with infinitely many ends\\", Annals of Mathematics 88 (1968), 312-334\\\\. Theorem: Every finitely generated group of cohomological dimension one is free. For n=2 the statement is known as Eilenberg‚ÄìGanea conjecture.

Its usage during the Byzantine era is unclear. The small edifice - pulled down in 1930 to open a new road - was a minor example of architecture of the Byzantine early period in Constantinople. Location The structure was located in Istanbul, in the district of Fatih, in the neighborhood of Balabanaƒüa, in the middle of today's Harikzadeler Sokak, the road whose opening caused the demolition of the building.M√ºller-Wiener (1976), p. 98 The edifice lay between the mosque of Laleli and the road that goes from the Mosque of Beyazit to the Gate of Edirne.Janin (1953), p. 558Van Millingen (1912), p. 253 History Nothing is known about the history of this small round building, erected between the fifth and the sixth century, during Byzantine times. According to some scholars it could have been a burial place, while others think that it was the library of a monastery. In the 13th century an almost square burial room was erected, making certain the usage of the building as a mausoleum in the Palaiologan period. Shortly after the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, under Beyazid II, the building was converted into a mosque by Sekbanba≈üƒ± - that is, chief () of the Janissaries - Balaban Aƒüa bin Abdullah. The correspondent endowment () was founded in 1483. The mosque lay in the quarter named Eski Odalar () after the lodging of the Janissaries, and was repeatedly hit by the fires which ravaged the neighborhood in 1660, 1693 and 1718. During the great fire of 1782 the building partially burned and was afterward restored changing its plan. The fire of 1911 severely damaged the edifice, which in 1930 was demolished after a short surveying of the museum department, since it lay in the middle of a planned new road. Description The exterior of the mosque in 1903 The building had originally a round plan with an outer diameter of 11.2 m, and was perhaps surmounted by a dome. On the south side there was a rectangular apse. The interior was hexagonal, and each side was adorned with a rectangular niche. Surveys executed before the demolition revealed window-like openings in the foundation (made of rubble) which hint to the presence of a crypt also during the early phase of the building. The brickwork of the above ground structure was made with freestone interlined with clay bricks. The Palaiologan-era burial chamber, measuring 2.9 m x 3.17 m, was covered with a flat dome. During the conversion into a mosque, the old entrance was closed with masonry because of the erection of the minaret, and a new entrance on the northwest side was opened. In the last phase of its life the edifice had a wooden roof and kept its internal hexagonal plant, with a deeply arched recess on each side, five of them bearing a window and one the entrance gate. Outside the building showed four alternating sides, two circular bearing two windows each and two projecting bays bearing respectively one window and the entrance gate. In front of the building the Ottomans erected a porch. During the demolition in 1930 traces of paintings stemming from the Palaiologan period could be still observed. On that occasion some architectural elements were dismantled and since then have been kept at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum.

This page lists slang words or phrases that originate with military forces, are used exclusively by military personnel or are strongly associated with military organizations. Acronym slang A number of military slang terms are acronyms. These include SNAFU, SUSFU, FUBAR, and similar terms used by various branches of the United States military during World War II. =BOHICA= BOHICA (Bend Over, Here It Comes Again) is the title of a bestselling 1987 book by Scott T. Barnes. The book is the true account of a US ISA covert paramilitary operation, dubbed Operation Grand Eagle, that took place in Laos in 1981 with a small group of Green Berets, ISA operatives, and CIA staff. Later the operation would be the subject of several US Senate hearings, congressional hearings, and a Federal Grand Jury investigation. \\"BOHICA\\" was to be used as the code word on covert communications with the NSA/CIA and ISA HQ. During the mission, it was uncovered that criminals of war were still being held captive in Laos. Two were ordered assassinated and to date have never been rescued, as it was determined they may have been off-the-book CIA operatives smuggling drugs. The Log, the humor magazine written by and for Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy, featured a series of comics entitled \\"The Bohica Brothers\\", dating back to the early 1970s. =FUBAR= FUBAR (Fucked/Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition/Recovery/Any Repair/All Reason), like SNAFU and SUSFU, dates from World War II. The Oxford English Dictionary lists Yank, the Army Weekly magazine (1944, 7 Jan. p. 8) as its earliest citation: \\"The FUBAR squadron. ‚Ä• FUBAR? It means 'Fucked/Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition.\\" Another version of FUBAR, said to have originated in the military, gives its meaning as \\"Fucked Up By Assholes in the Rear\\". This version has at least surface validity in that it is a common belief among enlisted men and women that most problems are created by the military brass (officers, especially those bearing the rank of general, from one to four stars). This version is also most likely to have had its origin in the U.S. Army, where the senior officers command from the rear, as opposed to a navy, where it is not uncommon for admirals to command a fleet from one of the ships at sea, and therefore susceptible to attacks and death by the enemy. Ditto as to air force generals, who do not fly and/or directly command airplanes or even squadrons or air wings. FUBAR had a resurgence in the American lexicon after the term was used in two popular movies: Tango and Cash (1989); and Saving Private Ryan (1998). This particular FUBAR acronym survived WWII and for a time, mainly in the 1970s, found its way into the lexicon of management consultants. Although the word ‚Äúrear‚Äù is not normally used to describe the vantage point of senior corporate executives, their use of the term might have come about as the result of their frequent conclusions that the cause of corporate problems (inefficiencies and ineffectiveness causing poor profitability or a negative bottom line) rested not with rank and file workers, but rather with executives, particularly senior executives ‚Äì the equivalent of senior military officers. Therefore, FUBAR (Fucked Up By Assholes in the Rear) still applied well, even if in reality it could have been rendered as FUBAT or FUBOT (Fucked Up By Assholes at/on the Top). =FUBU= FUBU (Fucked/fouled Up Beyond all Understanding) was also used during World War II. =SNAFU= SNAFU is widely used to stand for the sarcastic expression Situation Normal: All Fucked Up, as a well-known example of military acronym slang. However, the military acronym originally stood for \\"Status Nominal: All Fucked Up.\\" It is sometimes bowdlerized to all fouled up or similar. It means that the situation is bad, but that this is a normal state of affairs. It is typically used in a joking manner to describe something that is working as intended. The acronym is believed to have originated in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. Time magazine used the term in their June 16, 1942 issue: \\"Last week U.S. citizens knew that gasoline rationing and rubber requisitioning were snafu.\\" Most reference works, including the Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, supply an origin date of 1940‚Äì1944, generally attributing it to the United States Army. Rick Atkinson ascribes the origin of SNAFU, FUBAR, and a bevy of other terms to cynical G.I.s ridiculing the Army's penchant for acronyms. Private Snafu is the title character of a series of military instructional films, most of which were written by Theodor \\"Dr. Seuss\\" Geisel, Philip D. Eastman, and Munro Leaf. In modern usage, snafu is sometimes used as an interjection, although it is mostly now used as a noun. Snafu also sometimes refers to a bad situation, mistake, or cause of the trouble. It is more commonly used in modern vernacular to describe running into an error or problem that is large and unexpected. For example, in 2005, The New York Times published an article titled \\"Hospital Staff Cutback Blamed for Test Result Snafu\\". The attribution of SNAFU to the American military is not universally accepted: it has also been attributed to the British, although the Oxford English Dictionary gives its origin and first recorded use as the U.S. military. In 1946, as part of a wider study of military slang, Frederick Elkin noted: \\"...[there] are a few acceptable substitutes, such as 'screw up' or 'mess up', but these do not have the emphasis value of the obscene equivalent.\\" He considered the expression SNAFU to be: \\"...a caricature of Army direction. The soldier resignedly accepts his own less responsible position and expresses his cynicism at the inefficiency of Army authority.\\" He also noted that \\"the expression ‚Ä¶ is coming into general civilian use.\\" =An Imperial FU= An Imperial FU (An Imperial Fuck Up) was used during World War I by soldiers of the outlying British Empire, e.g. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Kenya, Tanganyika, India, in reference to odd/conflicting orders from British authorities. Note that during World War I, the British Empire had an Imperial War Cabinet, and the troops from Australia were called the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), not to be confused with the AEF, the American Expeditionary Forces of WWI, or the Allied Expeditionary Force of WWII. =SUSFU= SUSFU (Situation Unchanged: Still Fucked Up) is closely related to SNAFU. SNAFU and SUSFU were first recorded in American Notes and Queries in their September 13, 1941 issue. =TARFU= TARFU (Totally And Royally Fucked Up or Things Are Really Fucked Up) was also used during World War II. The 1944 U.S. Army animated shorts Three Brothers and Private Snafu Presents Seaman Tarfu In The Navy (both directed by Friz Freleng), feature the characters Private Snafu, Private Fubar, and Seaman Tarfu (with a cameo by Bugs Bunny).

The disaster killed at least 103 people. Incident According to officials, the incident occurred when a packed steamer carrying over 300 passengers was caught in a storm and subsequently capsized. The incident occurred near the Fakiragram village in the Dhubri district, about west of Guwahati. The Superintendent of Police, Pradip Saloi, told The Hindu: \\"The ferry, originating from Dhubri and going towards Hatsingimari, capsized near Fakirganj. We are not sure about the actual number of passengers. We have been told that there were 250‚Äì300 passengers. However, there were reports of many swimming to safety.\\" Reuters reported that a police officer had said that the ferry had neither lifeboats nor life jackets and was overloaded with people and goods. Most of the passengers were farmers and farm families from the local area. A survivor said passengers had begged the skipper to beach the ferry on a sandbar when the storm hit midstream, but he refused. \\"Then the storm became more intense and the boat split into two parts before sinking,\\" Ali was quoted as saying by Channel 4 News. =Death toll= According to India's National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the bodies of 103 victims were recovered by the NDRF personnel and the Border Security Force near Jaleswar. Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said that the death toll was likely to rise. The dead bodies have been kept at the Dhubri Civil Hospital. Response Following the incident, the Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force and the Border Security Force launched rescue efforts. The Government of Assam announced a 150,000 compensation for the victims. State Transport Minister Chandan Brahma said,'Besides, 50,000 would be given to those boat passengers who sustained serious injuries and all those admitted in hospitals would receive free treatment.' He added, 'Anybody found guilty of any violation of rule would not be spared.' The President of India Pratibha Patil expressed grief over the incident, whereas Prime Minister Manmohan Singh assured the Chief Minister of Assam, Tarun Gogoi, that all help and funds for relief for the families of the victims will be provided while announcing the assistance of 200,000 to the next kin of each of the deceased. The Indian Army sent twelve divers for search operations along with army engineers and soldiers. The Army also provided food to the local people, thousands of whom gathered at the spot to help in the rescue efforts.

Buschbeck, an organizer of the Skandalkonzert who allegedly slapped a concertgoer The ''''' (\\"scandal concert\\") was a concert conducted by Arnold Schoenberg, held on 31 March 1913. The concert was held by the Vienna Concert Society in the Great Hall of the Musikverein in Vienna. The concert consisted of music by composers of the Second Viennese School. During the concert, the audience, shocked by the expressionism and experimentalism of the music, began rioting, and the concert ended prematurely. Amid the unrest, concert organizer Erhard Buschbeck was said to have slapped a concertgoer in the face; this would eventually lead to a lawsuit against Buschbeck. The event also led to an alternate name for the Skandalkonzert: Watschenkonzert, from the Austrian German for \\"slap concert\\". Operetta composer Oscar Straus, a witness to the alleged assault, testified that the slap had been the most harmonious sound of the evening. Programme The programme listed: * Anton Webern: Six Pieces for Orchestra, Op. 6. * Alexander von Zemlinsky: Four Orchestral Songs on poems by Maeterlinck (eventually published as Zemlinsky's Op. 13, Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 were performed at the Skandalkonzert). * Arnold Schoenberg: Chamber Symphony No. 1, Op. 9. * Alban Berg: Two of the Five Orchestral Songs on Picture-Postcard Texts by Peter Altenberg, Op. 4 Nos. 2 and 3. Both the lyrical and musical side of this premiere were seen as provocative. * The concert was ended before the scheduled performance of Gustav Mahler's Kindertotenlieder could begin. During Berg's songs the audience called for both the poet and composer to be committed, despite it being public knowledge that Altenberg was already committed to an asylum at the time.Barker, Andrew (1997). \\"Battles of the Mind\\", The Cambridge Companion to Berg, p. 24. Pople, Anthony, ed. . Though not present at the concert, he was granted leave to attend the dress-rehearsal that morning, and three days later he wrote a prose sketch depicting Alma Mahler there.Barker (1997), pp. 26‚Äì27. At the concert it was during Berg's songs that the fighting began. At the trial, Straus commented that the thud of Buschbeck's punch had been the most harmonious sound at the entire concert. For Berg's work the Skandalkonzert had lasting consequences: the songs were not performed again until 1952, and the full score did not appear in print until 1966. History and contemporary echo The first performance of Schoenberg's Gurrelieder was held on 23 February 1913, in the Great Hall of the Musikverein, under the direction of Franz Schreker, and was an overwhelming success. But the composer, offended by the previous conservative attitude of the Viennese public, refused to accept the applause. In return, the audience took revenge a few weeks later in the next concert of contemporary works there.Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, \\"Schoenberg, Arnold\\", vol. 16, p. 705. Press reports from the period mention tumultuous riots: Schoenberg's followers and a student of his and opponents yelling at each other, throwing things, disturbing the performance, destroying furniture, etc. The famous fracas at the premiere of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring took place in Paris two months later, on 29 May 1913.

Mann of the Brookings Institution and Norman J. Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, published by Basic Books. In the work, they detail controversial issues surrounding the United States Congress and determine that the institution has become weakened to the point of being almost completely useless. The general political polarization and specific rise of hard-line ideological views have, in the authors' opinion, created such social division that the nation's federal system as a whole finds itself essentially unable to govern. Specifically, the authors criticize the U.S. Republican Party as becoming captured by a dogmatic right-wing fringe and functioning as \\"an insurgent outlier\\" in terms of the general American political spectrum. The book has received praise from various publications such as The Economist and The Hill. The 2016 paperback version of the book featured a cover stating It's Even Worse Than It Was and included additional comments by the authors remarking upon the past few years after the first edition came out.https://texasgroup.worldcat.org/title/its-even-worse-than-it- looks-how-the-american-constitutional-system-collided-with-the-new-politics- of-extremism/oclc/928780666 Background Norman Ornstein's work at the American Enterprise Institute and Thomas Mann's work at the Brookings Institution had brought them into the public eye before, as well as giving them the respect of other political analysts. They previously collaborated on the well-regarded book The Broken Branch. The two have worked in Washington D.C. for more than forty years, Ornstein in particular having written columns for Roll Call and served as an election analyst for CBS News. According to NPR, \\"they're renowned for their carefully nonpartisan positions.\\" Synopsis The authors analyze the current U.S. Congress, and they conclude that the lawmaking body is now almost completely ineffectual. Two sources of the problem are given. The first is the serious mismatch between the two major parties, the Democrats and the Republicans, in their view. They state that the groups \\"have become as vehemently adversarial as parliamentary parties, and [in] a governing system that, unlike a parliamentary democracy, makes it extremely difficult for majorities to act\\". Mann and Ornstein specifically criticize the right-ward move of the Republican Party, especially the use of administrative and parliamentary tricks to keep from having clear votes on some issues. The authors describe the party as \\"an insurgent outlier-- ideologically extreme; contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime; scornful of compromise; unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition\\".\\"How the Mainstream Press Bungled the Single Biggest Story of the 2012 Campaign\\", Dan Froomkin, Huffington Post, December 7, 2012 Reception and reviews The book was published the same year as the 2012 United States Presidential election. The election campaign brought attention to it as a descriptor of a major aspect of the campaign, the imbalance between the two major parties in the political degrees they went to win elections, and the difficulty the media had in avoiding false equivalence storylines. Prior to the book, the authors were routinely cited as sources by the national press. A mostly favorable review came from The Economist, the publication remarking that Mann and Ornstein have \\"devoted a good deal of thought to ways the system can be rescued and improved\\" to \\"their great credit\\". The book's \\"constructive ideas\\" additionally received praise. The Hill published praise from journalist Juan Williams, who stated that the work \\"fillets the traditional media for perpetuating a principle of false equivalence in its coverage of the two parties... [masking] the GOP's unalloyed march toward the fringes of the right wing\\". He additionally labeled the book \\"[i]nsightful.\\" [T]wo respected centrist scholars, Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann, have written a book that moves past the bland and lazy conventional wisdom. They argue, with a truckload of evidence, that the blame in Washington lies overwhelmingly with Republicans. . . . .Our national politics has turned a strange corner.

Life and career Babitz was born in Hollywood, California, the daughter of Mae, an artist, and Sol Babitz, a classical violinist on contract with 20th Century Fox.Nelson, Steffie, L.A. Woman The Los Angeles Review of Books, December 18, 2011 Her father was of Russian Jewish descent and her mother had Cajun (French) ancestry. Babitz's parents were friends with the composer Igor Stravinsky, who was her godfather. She attended Hollywood High School. In 1963, her first brush with notoriety came through Julian Wasser's iconic photograph of a nude, twenty-year-old Babitz playing chess with the artist Marcel Duchamp, on the occasion of his landmark retrospective at the Pasadena Art Museum. The show was curated by Walter Hopps, with whom Babitz was having an affair at the time. The photograph is described by the Smithsonian Archives of American Art as being ‚Äúamong the key documentary images of American modern art‚Äù. Because of her ideas about sexuality, both in writing and life, much of the press over the years has emphasized her various romantic associations with famous men, including singer/poet Jim Morrison, artists (and brothers) Ed Ruscha and Paul Ruscha, and Hopps, as well as the comedian and writer Steve Martin, the actor Harrison Ford, and the writer Dan Wakefield, among others. Ed Ruscha included her in Five 1965 Girlfriends (Walker Arts Center's Design Journal, 1970). She has often been compared to Edie Sedgwick, Andy Warhol's 1965 proteg√©e at The Factory in New York City. Babitz began her independent career as an artist, working in the music industry for Ahmet Ertegun at Atlantic Records, making album covers. In the late 1960s, she designed album covers for Linda Ronstadt, The Byrds, and Buffalo Springfield. Her most famous cover was a collage for the 1967 album Buffalo Springfield Again. Her articles and short stories have appeared in Rolling Stone, The Village Voice, Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and Esquire magazines. She is the author of several books including Eve's Hollywood; Slow Days, Fast Company; Sex and Rage; Two By Two; and L.A. Woman. Transitioning to her particular blend of fiction and memoir beginning with Eve's Hollywood, Babitz‚Äôs writing of this period is indelibly marked by the cultural scene of Los Angeles during that time, with numerous references and interactions to the artists, musicians, writers, actors, and sundry other iconic figures that made up the scene in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. In 1997, Babitz was severely injured when she accidentally dropped a lit match onto a gauze skirt, which ignited the garment and melted her pantyhose beneath it; ultimately the accident caused life-threatening third-degree burns over half her body. Because she had no health insurance, friends and family organized a fund-raising auction to pay her medical bills. Friends and former lovers donated cash and artworks to help pay for her long recovery. Babitz became somewhat more reclusive after this incident, but was still willing to be interviewed on occasion. For instance, in a 2000 interview with Ron Hogan of Beatrice magazine, Babitz stated, \\"I've got other books to do that I'm working on.\\" When asked by Hogan what those books would be about, Babitz replied: \\"One's fiction and the other's nonfiction. The nonfiction book is about my experiences in the hospital. The other's a fictionalized version of my parents' lives in Los Angeles, my father's Russian Jewish side and my mother's Cajun French side.\\" these books remain unpublished, despite the reissuing of Babitz's memoirs, novels and short story collections, by publishers New York Review Books, Simon & Schuster and Counterpoint Press in recent years. 2019 saw the release of I Used to Be Charming, a collection of Babitz's non-fiction essays published by New York Review Books. Published works Babitz‚Äôs picaresque stories and essays explore a lifelong love-affair with the city of Los Angeles. Her work embodies the permeability between fiction and reality characteristic of the LA imaginary. A playful but brutal honesty permeates much of her work. Writer Deborah Schapiro, in a recent essay on Babitz‚Äôs first book, writes, \\"That worldliness is also in her voice, which is self-assured yet sympathetic, cheeky and voluptuous, but registering just the right amount of irony.\\" Novelists Joseph Heller and Bret Easton Ellis were fans of her work, with the latter writing, \\"In every book she writes, Babitz‚Äôs enthusiasm for L.A. and its subcultures is fully displayed.\\" =Fiction= Publisher information relates to first publication only.

It states that, \\"...separate control centers that are functionally close together (i.e., highly connected in functional cerebral space) will conflict if they are independently engaged in unrelated activity.\\" In other words, when a person attempts to perform multiple tasks associated with functionally close brain structures, interference occurs and performance is affected. The concept of functional cerebral distance is the basis for some research into hostility. According to the Direction Model, anger activates the left prefrontal cortex.Harmon-Jones, E.; Vaughn-Scott, K.; Mohr, S.; Sigelman, J.; & Harmon-Jones, C. (2004). The effect of manipulated sympathy and anger on left and right frontal cortical activity. Emotion, 4, 95‚Äì101. Counting also activates similar functional cerebral space, creating competition between the two activities according to Kinsbourne. This is the basis behind \\"counting to 10\\" when one is feeling angry or frustrated. Kinsbourne's work is also the basis for Capacity Theory, which postulates that diminished right frontal lobe capacity is the cause for overly hostile individuals. This is based on the knowledge that the right frontal lobe is responsible for regulating negative emotion. The capacity model suggests that it is harder for hostile individuals to maintain stable levels of cerebral activation after experiencing physiological and cognitive right frontal stressors.

On the night of April 2, the sheepherder Joe Allemand and four of his associates were encamped along Spring Creek, near the town of Ten Sleep, when a group of seven masked cattlemen attacked them. It remains uncertain as to whether or not an exchange of gunfire took place between the two parties, but evidence suggests that Allemand and two of his men were executed while the remaining two escaped unharmed. Two sheep wagons were also destroyed by fire and about two dozen head of sheep were shot to death. Seven men were arrested for the crime, two of whom turned state's evidence and were acquitted. The rest were found guilty and sent to prison for sentences ranging from three years to life in prison. The conviction of the Tensleep murderers effectively put an end to the killings on the open range and exemplified the arrival of law and order in a region that still retained its rugged frontier environment after the end of the 19th century. Although there continued to be sheep raids in Wyoming into the 1910s, there were no more deaths. Background For decades prior to 1909, sheepmen and cattlemen had been fighting for control of America's vast unsettled grasslands. The conflicts usually began as disputes over grazing rights, but the cattlemen also complained that the sheepmen destroyed the open range and made it unsuitable for cattle. For example, cattlemen claimed that sheepmen let their flocks overgraze, or that the sharp hooves of the sheep were cutting up the grass to a point where it wouldn't grow back. Sheepmen were also said to have polluted the water sources so badly that cattle could not drink from them without becoming sick. Generally, the cattlemen were the stronger of the two factions and they controlled the range by establishing a type of border called \\"deadlines\\" and hiring gunmen to prevent sheepherders from crossing them. Around 1908, the sheep and cattlemen's associations of Wyoming agreed to the establishment of a deadline in Big Horn County. Tensleep Creek made up at least part of the border; west of the creek was cattle country while the area to the east was for the sheepmen. However, not long after the agreement was in effect, the herder Joe Allemand and his partner, Joseph Emge, became some of the first to break it when they began moving their flocks across the deadline to a place near Worland for the winter season. Soon after, other sheepherders followed suit \\"until the division [deadline] was practically no division, and no range was safe to the cattlemen.\\" Together, Allemand and Emge owned three ranches in the area east of the deadline, all near the mouth of Spring Creek and Tensleep Creek. Emge, a German immigrant, was formerly a cattlemen, but he \\"abandoned the business, and went over to the enemy\\" sometime shortly after the turn of the century. According to author George C. Morris, Allemand was well-liked and considered a peaceful man that had been involved in the sheep trade for years, but Emge was more aggressive and probably the one who decided to lead the sheep across cattle country, being that he was the trail master. In this case, Emge was well aware of the consequences of passing through cattle country with a herd of sheep, so, during the first drive, he had a local deputy sheriff accompany him. According to Morris, the deputy prevented the cattlemen from attacking, but when Emge requested assistance for the drive back home he was declined. The sheriff warned Emge to detour around the cattle ranges, but he failed to follow the advice, possibly because taking the detour was a longer journey. Instead of relying on the police, Emge purchased two automatic rifles with 1,000 rounds of ammunition and openly said they were for \\"running the cattlemen off the range.\\" Raid The Allemand-Emge party consisted of five men, including Allemand and Emge, two sheep wagons, several sheep dogs, and between 2,500 and 12,000 head of sheep, depending on varying sources. The other three men were hired hands named Jules Lazier, Allemand's nephew, Pierre Cafferal and Charles \\"Bounce\\" Helmer. The herd was divided into two groups, one on each side of Spring Creek, with a wagon and at least one dog attached to each one. For the first thirty miles or so the journey was uneventful, but, on April 2, the party met up with a pair of friends, who lived nearby, and stopped to have dinner with them. Allemand also telephoned his wife sometime during the drive, to tell her that he would be home soon. According to one source, some of Emge's enemies were listening in on the phone call and were able to plan an attack based on the information. When dinner was over it was already dark, so the party decided to camp for the night and continue on in the morning. The location of the camp was about a half day's ride from the deadline and safety, but also near the Keyes Ranch, where the raiders had assembled. The raiders, who were later identified as George Saban, Herbert Brink, Albert Keyes, Charles Farris, Ed Eaton, Tommy Dixon, and Milton Alexander, rode out from the ranch sometime that night and found the sheepherders' camp soon after. At least half of the group were wealthy cattlemen. George Saban, the leader of the group, was the owner of the Bay State Cattle Company, one of the largest in Wyoming, and already known to the public for having led the lynch mob that raided the Big Horn County jail in 1903, where two prisoners and a deputy sheriff were killed.Officer C.E.Pierce July 19, 1903 ODMP memorial There were two other cattlemen in the area as well, Porter Lamb and Fred Greet, who were camping in a tent within 400 yards of the Allemand-Emge camp, on land that was part of the Lamb Ranch. According to Morris: \\"[Lamb and Greet] were awakened by staccato cracks of automatic rifles and the glimmering starlight made indistinctly visible moving shadows stepping swiftly about in the haze, punctured with spitting flame flashes when the weapons spoke. Ultimately the firing ceased, then followed the flare of burning sheep wagons. A chorus of galloping hoofs- then silence.\\" Lamb and Greet were the ones who first discovered the remains of the sheepherders on the following morning. Morris wrote: \\"When dawn came Lamb and Greet stood aghast at the vendetta vengeance that had been taken. In front of the wagon ruins Allemand lay face upward with bullet holes in his neck and side, to show where deadly soft-nosed missiles took his life. In the charred still-smoking embers were two baked bodies, subsequently identified as Emge, the daring, and Jules Lazier, a herder. 'Bounce' Helmer and Pierre Cafferal, two herders in the wagon on the other side of the creek, escaped through the leniency of the raiders and it is believed their lives were spared because Helmer's father is of the cattlemen and a leader among them.\\" Although some accounts vary, it is generally believed that the group of raiders snuck up to the Allemand-Emge camp, split in two, and then began shooting at the flocks or advancing on the wagons. After that they called on the herders to surrender, but when Allemand came out he was shot down in cold blood. The raiders then fired into the wagons and it was during this time that Emge and Lazier were killed while Cafferal and Helmer were captured and tied up with rope. However, the latter two men were either freed by the raiders later on, as Morris claims, or they were able to untangle the ropes and free themselves, as another source says. Cafferal and Helmer went straight from the camp to alert the police, who organized a posse, which arrived at the crime scene on the next day. Overall, Allemand, Emge, and Lazier were killed along with two of their dogs and twenty-five sheep. The rest of the herd was scattered and both wagons were burned. Cafferal and Helmer had suspicions about who had attacked their camp, but all of the raiders wore masks and therefore could not be positively identified by the survivors' testimony alone. Aftermath The Tensleep Murders shocked the people in the surrounding communities, particularly the sheepmen, so the Wyoming Wool Growers' Association offered a large reward for the capture of the murderers or information that led to it. The Wyoming Wool Growers' put up a bounty $5,000, which was supplemented by $2,000 from the National Wool Growers' Association, $1,000 from Big Horn County, and another $500 from the state of Wyoming. In Morris' words; \\"the sheepmen played upon the cupidity of men and balanced golden gains in rewards against silence and fear of punishment.\\" Sheep raiders had never been convicted in a Wyoming court before so all of the raiders assumed they had nothing to fear. In the days that followed, Brink and Dixon bragged about committing the murders until one of their friends, William \\"Billy\\" Goodrich, informed Sheriff Felix Alston in Basin. Goodrich told the sheriff the identities of all the men involved and he then told either Brink or Dixon that if they wanted to help the rest of the raiders then they had better surrender before the grand jury met later that month. At that point, Keyes and Farris took the advice and surrendered to Sheriff Alston. Then, Alston, Goodrich, Keyes, and Farris had a meeting in Sheridan with Governor Bryant B. Brooks and a few Wyoming attorneys. There, Keyes and Farris made a full confession with the promise that they'd be pardoned and safely escorted out of the state after the trial. None were eligible for the reward. Warrants were issued for the arrest of the other five raiders, Saban, Brink, Eaton, Dixon and Alexander, and they were hastily detained without any trouble on May 3. Around this time, a man named \\"Billy\\" Garrison committed suicide because of his involvement in the case. Like Goodrich, Garrison was one of the men Dixon and Brink bragged to so, instead of testifying against his friends, he rode to a place five miles from his home, the Goodrich Ranch, and shot himself. Garrison's death was officially determined to have been caused by suicide, but there is a possibility that the cattlemen wanted to silence him before a trial could begin. Morris wrote the following: \\"It was a season of suppressed seething that threatened to boil over at any moment. Feeling was intense when it was known that Farris and Keyes had confessed, for that is one of the unpardonable offenses of the range. In the history of Big Horn County only three grand juries have ever been assembled because of the reluctance or refusal of witnesses summoned to give testimony that would be inadmissible in courts of law. That it went hard against the grain is eloquently verified by the suicide of 'Billy' Garrison. He lived at the Goodrich place and had been told things by Brink and Dixon. He perjured himself loyally before the grand jury, then drove to a ranch some five miles distant from the Goodrich home, put his horse up in the barn and shot himself to death. It was his conception of loyalty. Rather than send his friends to death he went to his own bravely.\\" The trial was held in Basin. The remaining five raiders quickly gave in and confessed like Keyes and Farris or pleaded guilty. Brink was the first to be tried. The testimony of Keyes, Farris, and Goodrich convinced the jury that he was almost solely responsible for the deaths. Farris' testimony was actually a direct accusation that Brink shot Allemand. Morris quoted the following from the state's records: \\"I heard Brink shout: 'Show a light and come out,'... A man appeared at the front of the wagon. 'Hands up!' cried Brink. The man's hands were in the air as he came towards us. Then Brink said: 'This is a hell of time o' night to come up with your hands in the air!' There was a shot. Who fired it? Herbert Brink.\\" Brink was sentenced to hang for first degree murder, but it was later reduced to life in prison at the Wyoming State Penitentiary in Rawlins. Saban and Alexander both admitted to second degree murder and were sentenced to twenty- five years in prison while Dixon and Eaton each received three years imprisonment for arson. Morris says that the majority of the people of Wyoming were aligned with the cattlemen so, on November 20, 1909, when the raiders were to begin their sentences, Basin citizens crowded the train station to say goodbye to the raiders and give them gifts, such as blankets. Morris notes that nobody was waiting to greet Farris, Keyes, and Goodrich when they left. All three sold their belongings and headed west with a deputy sheriff, who escorted them to the state border. As for the five prisoners, Eaton died in state custody, Dixon was paroled in 1912, Saban escaped in 1913 and was never recaptured, and Brink and Alexander were paroled in 1914. The conviction of the Tensleep Murderers brought some peace to Wyoming's open range. Because the state's government was finally making convictions, cowboys became reluctant to shoot people over grazing rights, knowing that now they could be held accountable for it. One of the prosecutors in the case, Will Metz, summarized the meaning of the verdicts by saying that \\"it is significant of the beginning of a new era, of a period where lawlessness in any form will be no more tolerated [in Wyoming] than in the more densely settled communities of the east.\\" A monument now marks the site of the raid. In 1911, the area where the murders occurred became part of Washakie County.

An abandoned railroad is a railway line which is no longer used for that purpose. Such lines may be disused railways, closed railways, former railway lines, even derelict railway lines. Some have had all their track and sleepers removed, and others have material remaining from the former use. There are many hundreds of these throughout the world. Thousands of miles of railroads have been abandoned in the United States, much of it in the 40 years from 1965 to 2005. The right of way which has been established for such a line makes it useful for other transport, such as a rail trail. Other uses are possible. For example, in 1936, farmers in Aldrich, Missouri, found various uses for the land and materials of an abandoned railway. The abandoned railway stations on the line may be put to some other use too. Reasons for abandonment Many old lines have stopped making a profit. The decision to abandon a line may be taken by a railway company or by government, as with the Beeching cuts in Great Britain in the 1960s. Railways specially built for mines or other industrial or logistical sites are abandoned if the mine is exhausted or the production ceases. War can also lead to abandonment. In former Finnish Karelia, changes of borders due to World War 2 in 1945 led to several railways being abandoned or even demolished by their taker, the Soviet Union. A railway could become international, and without a border checkpoint, the line would become useless. Also, without connecting traffic, the traffic volume could be too low: evacuation of Finnish Karelia removed the Finnish population and international trade would not have been equally viable as domestic trade. Bizarrely, Finland was obliged to keep the Laurila‚ÄìKelloselk√§ track open as a peace treaty article, although it was never used for international traffic, but only for local lumber transport. Before the war, the track ended in Kemij√§rvi, 270 km from the border, but the Soviet Union demanded Kemij√§rvi to be connected via rail to Soviet Kantalahti. However, when a metal thief stole 1.7 km of track in 2008, the government declared it was no longer required to maintain the track. It was last used in 2010.  In the United States  Railroads have been abandoned in the United States due to historical and economic factors. In the 19th century, the growing industrial regions in the Northeast, the agrarian regions in the South and Midwest, and the expansion of the country westward to the Pacific Ocean all contributed to the explosive growth of railroad companies and their rights-of-way across the entire country. Railroad mileage within the U.S. reached its peak in the mid-1910s, with over 254,000 miles of railways in use.Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970 (1976) table Q398; Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012 (2011) tables 1064, 1068 online Eventually, competing modes of transportation began siphoning away passenger and freight revenues from railroad companies, even as they struggled to earn profits from prices regulated under the Interstate Commerce Act. The Great Depression of the 1930s forced some railroad companies into bankruptcy, creating hundreds of miles of disowned and subsequently abandoned railway properties; other railroad companies found incentive to merge or reorganize, during which excess or redundant rights-of-way were abandoned. These and other factors have implicitly created thousands of miles of abandoned railroad corridors that criss-cross the States. While most lay dormant and are still under the ownership of the abandoning railroad company, some cause political controversies in communities through which they run due to property disputes once the land returns to adjacent landowners; others are converted to rail- trail use, an increasingly popular option that opens once-abandoned corridors up to the public for their leisure while at the same time preserving them for possible future railroad use.Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, Preserving Corridors for Trail Use A few abandoned railways have been rebuilt and used as active railroad routes once again. Abandonments in the United States are controlled under Title 49, Chapter 10, Part 1152 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and are administered by the Surface Transportation Board, an adjudicatory body within the U.S. Department of Transportation. The abandonment process starts when the railroad company submits a notice to the STB about their intent to abandon a railway line; this notice is served 10 days before the formal abandonment petition is filed by the railroad company. Once filed, various timeframes are allotted in order for other interested parties to proffer their requests regarding the abandonment; any intent by a rail-trail advocacy group to convert the right-of-way into a rail-trail (called rail banking) must be submitted within 30 days, while any financial assistance offers to either purchase the property outright or to subsidize rail traffic on the line must be submitted within 50 days.Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, How to Railbank - Abandonment Timeline and Procedure If ultimately approved by the STB, the line will be formally abandoned, or converted to trail use if the railroad and trail advocacy group arrive at an agreement on terms/price of the sale of the property, or operated by the owning railroad (via a subsidy) or by a new owner.

Also known as \\"Slack Season Ta-a Noodles\\", they originated in Tainan, (in southern Taiwan), about 130 years ago. While the general recipe is well known, some of the spices and the proportions of the various ingredients (shrimp flavored soup, shrimp, coriander, and garlic) are well guarded secrets by the different restaurants/stands that serve it. While seemingly a simple snack, foodies from all over the world have given it substantial recognition. The normal serving size is usually small, being considered more of a snack than an entree. It is also on the pricier side (relatively) at around NT$50 ($1.60 USD) for a small bowl. Origin Ta-a noodles are said to originate in the late Qing dynasty, around 1895. During the Tomb Sweeping Festival and summer season (July to September) each year in Taiwan, there are frequent typhoons, rendering fishing too dangerous. These \\"slack seasons\\" were known to fishermen as \\"small months\\" () and the phrase \\"pass the small months\\" () refers to enduring the slack seasons. Hong Yutou (Ê¥™ËäãÈ†≠), a fisherman from Tainan, and descending from fishermen in Zhangzhou, Fujian, began to sell noodles when he was 20 years old. At first it was to earn money during the off-seasons but eventually became his primary occupation. In the beginning, he carried his noodles on shoulder poles () and sold them on the street before setting up a small stall in front of the Tainan Chuisian Temple (), with the Chinese characters () written on lanterns. Hence the name \\"Slack Season Ta-a Noodles\\".

Route description SH-64 begins at a junction with SH-62 and SH-162 in downtown Nezperce. The highway heads east from here, passing Nez Perce Municipal Airport. In eastern Nezperce, the route turns north along Beech Street before leaving the city to the northeast. Outside of Nezperce, the highway heads east through ranchland as a two-lane paved road. The route passes several local roads before curving to the southeast. Along the southeast leg, the road has an unpaved gravel surface for three miles and runs along the side of a mountain. Past this stretch, the highway turns briefly to the east before twisting northward, where it passes through a forested area. The route passes a group of houses before making a sharp turn to the south. From here, the highway follows a curvaceous path into Kamiah. In Kamiah, the road passes southeast through a residential area parallel to U.S. Route 12; while the two highways do not intersect, they are connected by local streets.

(or simply OSDNA) was created in 1996 as an umbrella organization for persons in Diaspora, who are natives of the City of Ogbomosho, Nigeria. The OSDNA is a non-profit 501 (c)(3) volunteer organization whose main purpose or goal is that of ‚Äúdeveloping Ogbomosho land and helping its people‚Äù. History Location of Ogbomosho, in Western Nigeria Ogbomosho natives have long been known as avid travelers.Ayeni, M.A.O. (1983), Patterns, Processes and Problems of Urban development published in, A Geography of Nigerian Development, 2nd Ed., Edited by J.S. Oguntoyinbo, O.O. Areola and M. Filani. Heinemann Educational Books (Nig.) Ltd. As a result of having so many people in Diaspora, Ogbomosho natives, especially those living in North America, felt the need to ‚Äúgive back‚Äù, in order to help alleviate to some extent the impact of brain drain on the city, since so many of them tend to be working age persons, who left to look for jobs elsewhere. Brain drain (the emigration of working age and usually educated persons from a location) tends to be a big problem for developing countries, where jobs are scarce for new graduates. Therefore, any help that can be given back by such emigrants to their countries / hometowns once they have left tends to make a big difference. In fact the World Bank noted that migrant remittance inflows to Nigeria from Nigerians abroad constituted 4.5 percent of the country's entire GDP in 2011, which in raw figures amounted to over 11 billion U.S. dollars. Already aware of the impact of remittances even as early as 1972, the first Ogbomosho volunteer chapter was formed in New York City that year. The following year, in 1973, another chapter was formed by Ogbomosho natives living in Washington, D.C. with the same goal of pooling their resources together in order to help develop the city they left behind. To date, several local chapters have been formed in many U.S. cities / states, including, Miami, FL; Dallas and Houston, TX; Atlanta, GA; Missouri; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL, and even in Toronto, Canada. These chapters have their own presidents and executives to help to coordinate meetings and donations. According to R.K. Udo (1983),Udo, Reuben K. (1983), Internal Migrations & Development published in, A Geography of Nigerian Development, 2nd Ed., Edited by J.S. Oguntoyinbo, O.O. Areola and M. Filani. Heinemann Educational Books (Nig.) Ltd. the formation of volunteer organizations by emigrants for the sole purpose of helping to develop a city or town, is not a new phenomenon among Nigerians. This has been going on for decades, among several ethnicities even internally, within Nigeria, when people started to leave their hometowns or villages for larger cities, to find work. However, in 1996, the various Ogbomosho chapters in North America decided to form an umbrella organization with the belief that, \\"collectively, we can, through the various member organizations contribute more to the goal of developing Ogbomosho land at a stronger and faster pace than individuals' efforts.\\" The organization has a constitution and the OSDNA has its own President and executives who serve a 2-year term. Members pay dues that are then used in development projects. OSDNA currently has several hundred members. Meetings and Projects of the OSDNA Example of OSDNA Development Project: boreholes The OSDNA usually meets once a year in a major U.S. or Canadian city for their main conference / convention, usually around Labor Day weekend. Meetings include discussions on how to help develop the City of Ogbomosho, and which projects to sponsor. Major past projects include the installation of boreholes in various parts of Ogbomosho in order to provide potable drinking water for city residents. The organization also provides several full ride scholarships to students annually, and donations (computers, books, etc.) to the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) in Ogbomosho. Other projects include the donation of various items and equipment to the Ogbomosho Baptist Medical Center / Hospital, Motherless Children Home, Blind Center, and Leprosy Center.

USDA NRCS Plant Guide. is a species of grass known by the common names blue maidencane, Muhlenberg maidencane, and goobergrass. It is native to the southeastern United States.Amphicarpum muehlenbergianum. NatureServe. This perennial grass has decumbent stems that spread along the ground and root where stem nodes come in contact with the substrate. It grows from a rhizome. The stems may reach a meter in length. The leaves are evenly distributed along the stem. The firm, blue-green leaf blades are up to 10 centimeters long by 1 centimeter wide, and are lance-shaped, widest distal to the bases. The leaf blade margins are cartilaginous, becoming white in color when dry. The plant has open flowers on the stem inflorescence and cleistogamous, unopening flowers which grow underground on white, self- pollinating spikelets. In its natural habitat this species grows in pine woods and savannas, as well as wetlands. It can grow in shallow pools and on shorelines. It does not grow in deeper, stagnant water bodies. It has a thick rhizomatous root network that is good for resisting erosion in wet areas, so it can be used in wetland restoration projects. It is tolerant of some shade. Associated wild plants include creeping bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus) in flatwoods habitat, as well as wiregrass (Aristida stricta), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), bottlebrush threeawn (Aristida spiciformis), hairy blustem (Andropogon longiberbis), and bluejoint panicum (Panicum tenerum). The grass also makes a good forage for cattle and wild ungulates. It may produce 4000 pounds per acre of palatable forage.

Although Tradeston had consistently voted for Corbett, he did not consistently stand under the same label. In 1885 he stood as a Liberal against a Conservative. In 1886 following a split in the Liberal party he stood as a Liberal Unionist against a Liberal. Thereafter this was the normal contest until 1910. He had re-joined the Liberal party in 1908 but he did not win the official Liberal nomination in January 1910. This time standing as an Independent Liberal he scraped a victory against both Liberal and Conservative candidates. Then at the last general election, standing as the official Liberal candidate he won comfortably. The local Liberal association finally settled on J. D. White to defend the seat. He had been Liberal MP for Dunbartonshire before standing down at the last election. They had considered James Hogge and Junior Minister Charles Masterman, and settled on Masterman before he withdrew to contest the 1911 Bethnal Green South West by- election.Liberal Nationalisms: Empire, State, and Civil Society in Scotland and Quebec By James Kennedy The new Unionist candidate was Conservative John Henry Watts, who had opposed James Keir Hardie at Merthyr Tydfil at the general election. The turnout was substantially down in the general election, meaning that while White won the seat for the Liberals with a massive swing of 17.6%, he received fewer votes than Corbett had. Due to the outbreak of war, the subsequent general election did not take place until 1918. The Unionist Henderson was the endorsed candidate of the Coalition Government, and won comfortably.

Thomas was born in Tarrytown, New York and became a truck driver, jewelry maker and carpenter. Inspired by the Sermon on the Mount, he became a pilgrim and began traveling the world in the interests of world peace. In 1978, having tried to swim across the Suez Canal on his way to Israel, Thomas spent eight months in an Egyptian prison. Later, in response to United States foreign policy, he destroyed his passport while trying to renounce his American citizenship in London. The British authorities returned him to the United States in 1980. In 1981, Thomas traveled to Washington, D.C. and spent several months at Mitch Snyder's Community for Creative Non-Violence. On June 3, he launched the White House Peace Vigil in Lafayette Square. A couple of months later, in August 1981, he was joined by Concepcion Picciotto and then, in April 1984, by Ellen Benjamin. The following month, on May 6, 1984, Thomas and Ellen were married at a Quaker wedding. During the first three years of the vigil, the Park Police had arrested Thomas sixteen times. The charges ranged from illegal camping to disorderly conduct. In subsequent years, Thomas and Ellen protested with numerous other activists, including representatives from the Catholic Worker and Plowshares movements. Thomas died on January 23, 2009, aged 61, of pulmonary disease. Thomas and the White House Peace Vigil inspired Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton to introduce the Nuclear Disarmament and Economic Conversion Act to Congress in 1994. It would require the United States to disable and dismantle its nuclear weapons ‚Äì once all other nations possessing nuclear weapons did likewise ‚Äì and redirect the funds saved into renewable energy and social projects. Since 1994, Norton has continued to introduce revised or renewed versions of the bill. In March 2011, for example, following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan, it was reintroduced under the name of the \\"Nuclear Weapons Abolition and Economic and Energy Conversion Act\\". The Oracles of Pennsylvania Avenue, a 2012 TV documentary commissioned by the Al Jazeera Documentary Channel, recounts the lives of Thomas, Ellen, Concepcion Picciotto and Norman Mayer. Thomas started the White House Peace Vigil, the longest-running peace vigil in US history, in 1981.

His duties included the development of precision instruments, of machines and of drills for the St.Gothard tunnel. He also attempted to collaborate with Raoul Pictet in order to develop machines for producing cold. After a two-months internship at Thomas Edison's workshop in New York, he even launched himself into electric lighting. Turrettini's main achievement was the creation of hydroelectric power stations in Geneva, which were the most powerful of the time. In 1891, Turrettini became a member of the International Niagara Commission.  References  Paquier, Serge, \\"Turrettini, Th√©odore\\", in Dictionnaire Historique de la Suisse (in French).

Early life and education Armstrong was born in Waverley, Sydney on 1 May 1888. She was the fourth daughter of Irish-born William Harvey Armstrong and Tasmanian-born Jeanie (n√©e Williams). She matriculated in French and Latin in 1905 and entered Sydney University to study arts, following her two older sisters, Ina Beatrice and Helen Daphne. She graduated BA with first class honours in English in 1910. Millicent's sister, Helen, with whom she would collaborate on plays and a novel, graduated with first class honours in French, English and German in 1902. War experiences In 1914 Armstrong travelled to England to pursue a writing career but became involved in World War I work almost immediately. She served as a hospital orderly in both England and France: in England during the first two years of the war, and then in France with the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service for the latter two and half years.Miss Millicent Armstrong. The Green Room Pictorial, 1 March 1924.p. 18. She won the Croix de guerre for bravery in rescuing wounded soldiers while under fire. It was during her time as a nurse at the Hospital Auxiliaire d'Armee No. 30 in France that, 'I first tried my hand on plays ‚Äì partly in French and partly in English, acted in one or other of the wards by the staff and any of the blesses who were well enough to join in the fun, for the amusement of the rest of the hospital. Never were audiences more kindly and easy to entertain! Anything went down with them, from wildest melodrama to pantomime and variety shows.'The Green Room Pictorial, 1 March 1924.p. 18. Life as a farmer In 1919, after the war, Armstrong returned to Australia. In 1921 she took up a soldier settlement block of land in Clear Hills, Gunning, New South Wales . The farm which was 1028 acres had previously belonged to her sister Ina's husband. It adjoined land later acquired by her sister, Helen. They farmed vegetables, flowers, pigs and wool together but faced indebtedness and many of the difficulties that others who had acquired land through the Soldier Settlement scheme faced. After Helen's death in 1939, Millicent became a grazier in Kirkdale, Yarra, near Goulburn. By 1953, she was living in the city of Goulburn where she died in 1973.Blackmore, Kate, 'Armstrong, Millicent Sylvia (1888‚Äì1973)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 1 May 2012 Writing career Millicent Armstrong wrote plays and an unpublished novel, Five Pretty Sisters, with her sister, Helen.Manuscript collection reference at the National Library of Australia. http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9244948?q=Millicent+armstrong&c;=collection None of her wartime writing survives, but the plays she wrote in Australia were well received and prize-winning. Eleven plays survive and some have been republished in collections. Armstrong's first post-war play was Fire, which won third prize in the Sydney Daily Telegraph playwriting competition in 1923. In the same year, Drought, a play about a Macedonian immigrant farmer committing suicide just before a destructive drought ends, won the Rupert Brooke Prize, which had been instituted in 1919 by the Old Collegians Association of the Presbyterian Ladies College of Melbourne in commemoration of peace. The play was chosen from over 100 submissions, winning the award for the best one act play written by an Australian or New Zealander. It was produced at the Playhouse, Melbourne, in June 1924. In 1934 it was one of three prize winners in the International One-Act Play Theatre's 1934 competition and was produced at St Martin's Theatre, London on 3 June 1934. Drought was also broadcast from London by the BBC on 11 December 1934 and 3KZ (Melbourne) 10 May 1938.AustLit work record. http://www.austlit.edu.au/run?ex=ShowWork&workId;=CU4T The play was published in London by Harrap, 1934: Prize One Act Plays and then in a collection of Armstrong's plays, Plays in One Act in 1958. Also published in Plays in One Act are Thomas, first produced by the Armidale Theatre Club, Armidale, New South Wales in 1959; and Penny Dreadful which was first produced by the Diamond Valley Drama Group at the Arrow Theatre, Melbourne, 8 August 1961. The play At Dusk was published in the 1937 collection Best Australian One-Act Plays editing by Tom Inglis-Moore and William Moore. A sinisterly dramatic play about two sisters who live in the Australian bush, one of whom dies of fright after encountering a vicious man from her past, is described as 'plunder[ing] the 'frontier mentality' which usually saw women scripted as saviours rather than victims of intolerably discriminatory situations.'Pfisterer, Susan and Carolyn Pickett. Playing with Ideas: Australian women playwrights from the suffragettes to the sixties (1999). At Dusk had a rich performance history and was produced by the Sydney Drama Society on 23 July 1938, by the Sydney Players' Club in 1939, the Maryborough Arts Society (5 June 1954) and at the Napier Street Theatre, South Melbourne, c.1993. It was toured by Phoenix Productions in 1956 (dir. Musgrave Horner), among other productions. Armstrong's other plays include: * The Mood Sets (1958) *Goblin Gold (c. 1938) * Windward (unknown date) * Nina (c. 1936) The Unfortunate Archibalds (1931) was written with Millicent's sister Helen.

When he was 12 years old, his father died, and he and his family moved to Paris. After earning a Bachelor of Arts degree and entering the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, he started studying music, particularly piano and composition, at the conservatory; he was a big fan of jazz. The onset of World War II changed Andr√©ota's life dramatically. He spent part of the period of the German occupation of France in Marseille, which became the setting for his first novel after the war, Hors Jeu (lit. \\"Offside\\"), published by Grasset in 1947. He then wrote and published Evangeline (1948), which he dedicated to his friend, writer Michel Perrin, and Attentat √† la pudeur (lit. \\"Indecent Assault\\") in 1949. These two autobiographical novels inspired him to move in another direction. He then became a screenwriter, doing adaptations and dialogues. He wrote approximately 40 films, collaborating with famous directors. In 1968, while continuing to write for the stage, he returned to literature.

He had three sisters and one brother. By his autobiography, his father Platon Andreyevich Andreyev was a hairdresser and his mother Elizaveta Mihailovna was a laundress. But this is not true. It was dangerous to show noble or merchant origin in the 1920s and 1930s. In fact, Platon Andreyevich was a rather successful merchant and had barbershop, laundry and tea room. At 1902 Platon Andreyevich was documented as a merchant of the second guild and had a two- store brick house at 1-Moskovskaya street in Serpukhov. He had bought or built this house in the late nineteenth. Nikolay Andreyev was educated at Serpukhov modern school () and his siters at a gymnasium. Father hoped that Nikolay will take his business. But the father's dreams will never come to pass. Nikolay had been from childhood attracted by painting and drawing, and later by photography. Besides that, he played clarinet and flute. Nikolay especially liked flute and had several ancient silver flutes. Nikolay performed musical compositions of Gluck, Vivaldi and Bach. Other hobbies of Nikolay Andreyev were ballroom dances and motor-cycle races. At 1911 on a ballroom dances contest organized by Firefighters Society of Serpukhov () he took the first place and valuable desk set. Nikolay had a BMW motorcycle. After graduating from modern school and conflicting with his father, Nikolay Andreyev left father's home and launched his own photographer's studio in the old part of Serpukhov, near modern Lunacharskogo street. His photographic business was successful and gave financial independence to him.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system.Winston Churchill: a biographical companion By Chris Wrigley Vacancy The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, Charles Masterman had been the Liberal MP here since gaining the seat from the Conservatives in 1906. However, his December 1910 re-election was later declared void after his defeated Conservative opponent had petitioned the courts. This meant a repeat election was required.The Condition of England Masterman's agent had been found guilty of corrupt practices. The Counsel for Masterman admitted that the expenses had exceeded the legal limit, and that the agent, who was in bad health, had failed to check the accounts. The counsel for the petitioner (the defeated Conservative candidate), while contending that it was impossible to avoid bringing the petition, in view of the illegal proceeding which had been shown, publicly stated that no imputation bad been made against Masterman's integrity, honour, or conduct. In giving judgment the Judges fully concurred with these observations, but declared that it was impossible to give relief and excuse the irregularities disclosed.The Spectator, 24 June 1911 Electoral history In the eight electoral contests since the seat was created in 1885 the Liberal had won five times and the Conservatives three. In each case, the seat had gone to the party who subsequently formed the government. Masterman had comfortably retained his seat at the last general election; Masterman Candidates *Masterman was not allowed to defend his seat.

For the most part these treaties came into existence following the two World Wars and the body of law continues to be added to and amended. History The events of World War I and World War II had a profound effect on international law due to the widespread denial of civil rights and liberties on the basis of racial, religious, and political discrimination. The systematic use of violence, including murder and ultimately genocide, the use of slave labor, abuse and murder of prisoners of war, deportations, and confiscation of property forced changes to the status quo. Over the proceeding decades, large scale changes began to occur in all areas of international law, and prisoners‚Äô rights were no exception. Now, there are international instruments * the European Convention on Human Rights, * the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Further there are recommendations which lay down codes by which prisoners should be dealt with. Foremost amongst them are * the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, * the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, * the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment * the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. * the European Prison Rules. Third Geneva Convention The Third Geneva Convention defines humanitarian protections for prisoners of war. Prisoners of war are defined as: Prisoners of war may not renounce rights secured by the Conventions. Those rights include the rights to humane treatment which prohibits specifically violence causing death or seriously endangering health, or physical mutilation or scientific or medical experiments, protection from acts of intimidation, insults and public curiosity, protection from reprisals, exercise, protection from physical or mental torture, adequate physical and psychological treatment, to keep personal items including money, to be evacuated if the territory in which they are held becomes too dangerous, to adequate food, water, shelter and clothing, sanitary living conditions, religious freedom, and to complain. Detaining powers have the right to use appropriate force in the event of escape or a riot, to require prisoners to given their name and rank, and to utilize prisoners for labor as long the work doesn't have to do with the war effort. The 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War was adopted in 1929 but was significantly revised and replaced by the Third Geneva Convention in 1949. The United Nations Security Council is the final international tribunal for all issues relating to the Geneva Conventions. All signatories to the UN Charter, of which there are 193, are bound by the Geneva Conventions. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights came into force 23 March 1976. Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that any person deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and dignity. The article imposes a requirement of separation of prisoners in pre-trial detention from those already convicted of crimes, as well as a specific obligation to separate accused juvenile prisoners from adults and bring them before trial speedily. There is also a requirement that the focus of prisons should be reform and rehabilitation, not punishment. These provisions apply to those in prisons, hospitals (particularly psychiatric hospitals), detention facilities, correction facilities or any other facility in which a person is deprived of their liberty. The article complements article 7 of the Covenant, which bans torture or other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, by guaranteeing those deprived of their liberty with the same conditions as that set for free persons. UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners came into force in 1955. The standards set out by the UN are not legally binding but offer guidelines in international and municipal law with respect to any person held in any form of custody. They are generally regarded as being good principle and practice for the management of custodial facilities. The document sets out standards for those in custody which covers registration, personal hygiene, clothing and bedding, food, exercise and sport, medical services, discipline and punishment, instruments of restraint, information to and complaints by prisoners, contact with the outside world, books, religion, retentions of prisoners‚Äô property, notification of death, illness, transfer, removal of prisoners, institutional personnel and inspection of facilities. It also sets out guidelines for prisoners under sentence which further includes treatment, classification and individualisation, privileges, work, educations and recreations, and social relations and after-care. There are also special provisions for insane and mentally abnormal prisoners, prisoners under arrest or awaiting trial, civil prisoners and persons arrested or detained without charge. European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment The European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment entered into force on 1 March 2002. The Convention establishes the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Committee). The Committee is permitted to visit all places of detention, defined by the convention as \\"any place within its jurisdiction where persons are deprived of their liberty by a public authority.\\" Once a state government is notified of the intention of the Committee to carry out a visit it is required to allow access to the territory with the right to free travel without restriction, full information of the facility in question, unlimited access to the facility and free movement within it, the right to interview any person being held within the facility, communicate freely with any person whom it believes can supply relevant information and access to any other information which the Committee feels is necessary to carry out its task. All information gathered is confidential. In exceptional circumstances a state may make representations based on grounds of national defence, public safety, serious disorder in custodial facilities against a visit to a certain place or at a certain time. After each visit a report is drawn up with any possible suggestions to the state in question. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities entered into force on 30 March 2007 and has 154 state parties. The Convention‚Äôs purpose is to \\"promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.\\" Persons with disabilities are defined as those \\"who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.\\"\\" Article 13 of the Convention relates to access to justice for persons with disability. It provides that in order to \\"ensure effective access to justice for persons with disabilities, States Parties shall promote appropriate training for those working in the field of administration of justice, including police and prison staff.\\" Breaches of prisoners' rights in international law =United States of America= Guantanamo Bay The American government has been accused of many breaches of prisoners‚Äô rights in international law. The most publicized case is the detention facility it maintains in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The American government claimed that the facility was not covered by the Geneva Conventions protecting prisoners of war as the detainees were ‚Äòenemy combatants‚Äô. Regardless of the status accorded to detainees, international law still prohibits torture. It is now clear that the CIA allowed water boarding which is a breach of international law which prohibits cruel, humiliating or degrading treatment. Afghanistan In Afghanistan, US soldiers are accused of abusing prisoners in a secret prison in Bagram Air Base. The prisoners held there were exposed to extreme temperatures, not given adequate food, bedding, or natural light and religious duties were interfered with. There are also claims of abuse in Shebarghan prison in northern Afghanistan for which America is jointly responsible with the Afghan government. Shebarghan prison is claimed to be overcrowded with inadequate bathing and ablution facilities, as well as lack of food and medical care. Iraq In 2003, accusations started to emerge of prisoner abuse in Abu Ghraib prison. US soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison serving there were accused of beating prisoners, forcing prisoners to strip, forcing prisoners to masturbate, threatening prisoners with dogs, smearing prisoners with faeces, making prisoners simulate sex and form naked piles. There was also accusations that prisoners were raped, sodomised and beaten to death.

Exploration of the Amazon At the time of the \\"contest√© franco-br√©silien\\" boundary dispute between colonial France and Brazil, Coudreau worked in the service of Governors of the states of Brazil, mapping the Amazon's tributaries and identifying possible resources for farmers and foresters. On behalf of the State of Par√°, Coudreau was charged with exploring the Trombetas river, shortly after he married Octavie Coudreau. Their first expedition in 1899 ended tragically, as detailed in the book Voyage au Trombetas begun by Henri Coudreau, describing their voyage up the Trombetas tributary of the north bank of the Amazon. He was already sick and exhausted by the years spent in what he called the \\"green hell\\". Suffering from malarial fever, he died in his wife's arms on 10 November 1899. Aided by his traveling companions, she made a coffin from the planks of the boat and prepared a burial on a promontory overlooking lake Tapagem. After Henri Coudreau's death, Octavie continued the exploration work begun by her husband for seven years. She later wrote the final chapters of the book, following the repatriation of his remains to Angoul√™me in France.

The measures involved can be passive such as obfuscation to make reverse engineering difficult or active tamper- detection techniques which aim to make a program malfunction or not operate at all if modified. It is essentially tamper resistance implemented in the software domain. It shares certain aspects but also differs from related technologies like copy protection and trusted hardware, though it is often used in combination with them. Anti-tampering technology typically makes the software somewhat larger and also has a performance impact. There are no provably secure software anti-tampering methods; thus, the field is an arms race between attackers and software anti-tampering technologies. Tampering can be malicious, to gain control over some aspect of the software with an unauthorized modification that alters the computer program code and behaviour. Examples include installing rootkits and backdoors, disabling security monitoring, subverting authentication, malicious code injection for the purposes of data theft or to achieve higher user privileges, altering control flow and communication, license code bypassing for the purpose of software piracy, code interference to extract data or algorithms and counterfeiting. Software applications are vulnerable to the effects of tampering and code changes throughout their lifecycle from development and deployment to operation and maintenance. Anti-tamper protection can be applied as either internally or externally to the application being protected. External anti- tampering is normally accomplished by monitoring the software to detect tampering. This type of defense is commonly expressed as malware scanners and anti-virus applications. Internal anti-tampering is used to turn an application into its own security system and is generally done with specific code within the software that will detect tampering as it happens. This type of tamper proofing defense may take the form of runtime integrity checks such as cyclic redundancy checksums, anti-debugging measures, encryption or obfuscation. Execution inside a virtual machine has become a common anti- tamper method used in recent years for commercial software; it is used for example in StarForce and SecuROM. Some anti-tamper software uses white-box cryptography, so cryptographic keys are not revealed even when cryptographic computations are being observed in complete detail in a debugger. A more recent research trend is tamper-tolerant software, which aims to correct the effects of tampering and allow the program to continue as if unmodified. A simple (and easily defeated) scheme of this kind was used in the Diablo II video game, which stored its critical player data in two copies at different memory locations and if one was modified externally, the game used the lower value. Anti-tamper software is used in many types of software products including: embedded systems, financial applications, software for mobile devices, network-appliance systems, anti-cheating in games, military, license management software, and digital rights management (DRM) systems. Some general-purpose packages have been developed which can wrap existing code with minimal programing effort; for example the SecuROM and similar kits used in the gaming industry, though they have the downside that semi-generic attacking tools also exist to counter them. Malicious software itself can and has been observed using anti-tampering techniques, for example the Mariposa botnet.

The bells are rung full circle (mouth uppermost to mouth uppermost), being held up by a rope and wheel until a note is required. History =Early history= The campanile of San Zeno Maggiore In The History of Verona Ludovico Moscardo records that on the 21 November 622 the bell towers of the city rang to announce the death of Bishop Mauro. It is not known how many towers and bells, but clearly by that date Verona had a tradition of ringing. In the following century the bell \\"the storm\\" (\\"dei temporali\\") was cast. It is of octagonal shape and thought to be one of the oldest such castings in Europe. It is now preserved in the San Zeno Museum in Verona. The earliest technical information on the casting of Veronese bells is by the master Gislimerio in 1149. He described the casting of the bells for San Zeno Maggiore. Gislimerio was the first of fifty bell founders which worked in Verona over the centuries. Initially the shape of the bells were empirical, however from around 1200 studies were done to determine the best shape. The results were then shared across the continent. Other castings were made in 1065 for San Fermo, 1081 for San Massimo and 1172 for San Salvar. Up until the 14th century the best bell founders were from Venice, due to its more advanced industry, but there were skilled veronese founders too. Master Jacopo considered by some to be one of the best of the time. In 1370 he cast the bell for the Gardello tower. It is wide and it weighs about 18 quintals or (35-2-24) The tower is a clock tower unattached to a church. The 1370 clock was one of the first striking clocks in the world. The bell is now in the Castelvecchio Museum. In the 15th century when Verona was given to Venice there were few native Veronese foundry workers and therefore itinerant workmen worked for the Veronese masters. Bells for San Zeno were made by German workmen and that for the castle of Malcesine by Spaniards. A Frenchman, Mr. Michel, started a company in Verona that continued until the 19th century. He studied the sound of the bells, designing a shape which created a pleasant and tuneful sound. His successors, such as Checcherle and Bonaventurini, continued the development and started to apply decorations making the bells into works of art. Particularly skilled founder was Gasparino which made in 1444 one bell for Santa Maria della Scala, still rung actually. In this century, wonderful belltowers were built up such as Santa Anastasia. In the 16th century the number of bells in some towers increased. The first rings of five or six bells were in four churches: San Zeno, Santa Maria in Organo, Santa Maria della Scala and Santa Anastasia. All four were monasteries where the monks rang the bells themselves. In 1557 the Bonaventurini foundry cast the (82-3-24) \\"Rengo\\" civic bell which is still in good condition today. Reinassence style belltowers are San Nazaro and Santa Maria in Organo. During the 17th century the Da Levo family and their students (one of whom was Pesenti) were casting diatonically tuned bells. Common arrangements were the major chord (doh-me- soh-doh', for example C E G C'), the Gloria (doh-ray-fah, for example C D F) or the subdominant (doh-far-doh', for example C F C'). Significant churches equipped installations were Madonna di Campagna, San Bernardino, San Nicol√≤ all'Arena and the Cathedral. At the latter the bell ringers were lay musicians living in the city western suburbs who were paid with a reduction in the rent of arable land. The first evidence of wheels and counterbalances dates from this period; from which it is supposed that the bells were starting to be rung in sequence, rather than swung randomly. The Da Levo family specialised in making small and medium size fully decorated bells. In 1653 Pesenti cast the (116-0-8) civic bell of Bergamo, which is still in use today. Pupils of Pesenti were De Rossi, Poni, Larducci and Micheletti (dead 1804). In the mid-18th century another three interesting rings were installed. One was made by Crespi foundry for the Monastery of San Fermo, another by Antonio Larducci for Santa Lucia which was the last one made in the French-Veronese Renaissance style. In 1776 Professor Giuseppe Ruffini cast a ring for San Giorgio in Braida. Crespi and Ruffini introduced the \\"Manieristica\\" shape to Verona. This new shape had originated in the 16th century in the Alps and it became the basis for shapes still used today. The San Giorgio in Braida bells are notable works of art both for decoration and musical precision. =Development of Veronese style ringing= San Giorgio in Braida, birthplace of the Veronese system of ringing In San Giorgio in Braida the new bells were hung in such a way that the new style of ringing could develop. The bells are hung for full circle ringing where each bell is swung from balanced mouth uppermost through 360 degrees to again balanced mouth uppermost. This method of ringing permits a precise control of the time that the bell sounds and hence allows music. It is not clear whether hanging the bells in this way was independently developed at San Giorgio or whether the method was imported from England where bells are also hung for full circle ringing. Local farmers who attended church services and had an aptitude for music were chosen to ring and look after maintenance of the bells of San Giorgio. They developed the art of ringing concerti. The new style of music was not appreciated by Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, but was loved by Pope Pius VI who listened to it in February 1782. The ringers were paid for their efforts with food given to them at the start of autumn (fall): \\"polenta, salame e vino rosso\\" (polenta, salami and red wine). The ringing was quite onerous, on holy days they had to get up very early for the Ave Maria, then play again for the principal mass, the afternoon and evening service and finally at night for the vespers. They eventually used to sell the food, receiving an amount of about current 130 euro per year. At around the same time the bells of Santa Maria in Organo were modified, probably to allow them to play concerti. Many of the churches of Verona started to follow this example and the original ringers of San Giorgio in Braida were sent to organize the bands and train the new players. The campanile of Verona Cathedral The next tower to be converted was Santissima Trinit√† in 1803. Next Chievo (1808) and then later the Cathedral, Santi Apostoli, Santo Stefano, San Salvatore Corte Regia and Santa Anastasia. The ringers at Santa Anastasia were a group who worked on the floating mills on the river Adige, behind the apse of the basilica. This demand for new bells led to four bell foundries, managed by the students of Ruffini: Partilora-Selegari, Chiappani and son, and the two Cavadini companies. Santa Anastasia The only significant adverse effect was the extinction of the older technique of bell ringing as a Carillon. This tradition came from the masters like Vincenzi and Gardoni, some of whom decided to change technique by starting to ring the bells with their new method. An example is Giacomo Milossi (a student of Gardoni) whose skill was praised in a sonnet commemorating the bells of Santa Anastasia. In 1820 the church group from Tomba arrived to give a peal, followed by another wonderful peal in the bell tower of San Tomaso Becket, Quinzano e Parona. The priest at the Stimate brought together a band of ringers under the tutelage of Modesto Cainer. Writing in his memoirs he describes the precise methods of playing a concert in rounds with the sacred bronze bell. The Partilora-Selegari foundry equipped the bell towers of San Lorenzo and San Massimo which were the first in the region to have eight bells, each of which required yet another ringing team. In 1846 the Cavadini company installed a new ring in San Giovanni in Valle and three years later in San Nazaro. New groups of players were created which tried to compete with the ringers of San Giorgio. At the same time the towers predisposed to the technique of playing in rounds had increased, for example San Michele, Santa Maria del Paradiso, San Paolo, Poiano e Avesa, each tower having new ringers' societies. In this period bellringers in the city centre were about 150, most of whom resided in the suburbs. The only remaining supplier of bells after 1850 was Luigi Cavadini, whose company continued until 1974. With the reconstruction of the biggest bell of S. Trinit√†, some young people from the area created a group of concert players which was then absorbed by San Giorgio, at the time directed by the Peroni brothers and Giacomo Tomasini. The same thing happened to Molinari's group. In 1882 the bells of Scalzi and Santa Eufemia were increased in size and number. =20th century= In the church of Santa Maria della Scala a new group was started directed at first by Pietro Sancassani (1881‚Äì1972) and then by future maestros Alberti, Oliboni and Signorato. In 1902 in S. Rocco another peal was cast and another ringing society was born. In 1903 a new bell tower installation was created in C√† di David, where for the inauguration there was the first competition of bell ringing. This event was organized in a way so that all the teams of the city and also from the suburbs like Chievo and Santa Lucia, had to adhere to the oldest and most prestigious: San Giorgio in Braida. The team of San Giorgio won the competition despite the allegation that the other teams cheated, this event started the rivalry between the city players and those of the province. The San Bernardino Church acquired their bells in 1907. San Tomaso In the 1914 some of the young ringers of San Giorgio decided to form their own group directed by Sancassani in Santo Stefano and San Tommaso churches, giving themselves the name \\"Audace\\" (which means the \\"Brave\\"). Ten years later the players of San Giorgio and those of San Paolo united and renamed the group \\"Societ√† Campanaria Santa Anastasia in Verona\\", as the tower increased the number of bells from 6 to 9. The new president was Mario Carregari (1911‚Äì1997). During this time, the Audace group was able to transfer to the Cathedral assuming the name of the church. At the same time as the first world war, they started a thirty-year rivalry between the two groups. The only un-warlike group was the Santi Apostoli who didn't last very long. This rivalry had the positive effect of leading to further installations: San Leonardo, the imposing San Nicol√≤ all'Arena, Filippini, San Luca, Misericordia, and the Cathedral. The cathedral has nine bells in the major scale the biggest of which now weighs . The bell is the largest bell hung for full circle ringing in the world and with its headstock the rotating mass is over . The tower of San Tommaso all'Isolo was the first in the region to have ten bells. The rivalry was all the more intense because in each team there were the most important men, directors, composers, players, maintenance workers, and experts in bells. The battle was also fought with sheet music composition, creating new sounds, pauses, chords and triplets. The company of the teacher Sancassani, more or less, was the winner of the long conflict, but the turbulent spirit of the Audace team didn't leave the members, even if there weren't any more young people. The arguments changed by the day: an unsuccessful competition, disagreement about the management of the money, a proposal made to the other team, a social office not renewed. Every little thing created disagreement because the team was made up of players from San Michele, Tomba, C√† di David, Montorio and San Massimo. From this society, managed by Accordini and Biondani, other groups were created: the Santo Stefano, the Santa Maria in Organo (called the \\"Rebel\\") and the team of Sabaini-S.Eufemia which stopped spontaneously. During the second world war some of the Veronese bells were destroyed. When the players returned home they all decided to join together with the old San Giorgio team (now Santa Anastasia). Fortunately they were able to give demonstrations in documentaries and exhibitions all over Italy and enjoy the popularity. After the war they gave a bell ringing concert in Borgo Nuovo, Santa Toscana, Tombetta, Palazzina, Golosine, San Giuseppe fuori Le Mura and Borgo Trieste. Since the fifties, modernity has taken control of Verona lifestyle and the society started to lose interest in church and in bellringing art. It was fashionable for priests to ring the bells electrically which prevented the players from continuing their tradition. In 1983, the creation of a regional bell ringing association managed to gradually turn around the decline, but not in the city of Verona itself, where the downwards trend continued for another twenty years. Bellringing today In 1998 the ringing school of St. George was re- opened and in 2010 an event, that had always been dreamed of, took place. The ringers of the city and the suburbs wanted to unite to create a single group (which was the project of M¬∞ Sancassani ninety years before), who apart from ringing decided to look together for new members and for a major publicization of the art. A lot of energy was invested in historical, technical, scientific research and the restoring of disused bell towers. The bell ringing community of Verona was completely revolutionised and things quickly got better. It was like the old time: churches were inspired to install other bells, because of this the smallest Veronese ring was created in San Carlo. Even though imminent extinction had only just been avoided they had never seen such enthusiasm. The old San Giorgio society which had been renamed Santa Anastasia after the first world war now incorporated other teams and changed the name to Scuola Campanaria Verona in S.Anastasia (Bellringing school of Verona based in S.Anastasia church). In the Veneto region there are about 2,500 bell ringers of the Veronese method, united in local teams, more than half of which are members of the \\"Associazone Suonatori di Campane a Systema Veronese\\" (ASCSV) or association of bell ringers of the Veronese method. Today new technologically advanced systems, allow the possibility of playing the bells both electrically and manually. However many bell towers have not yet installed the new system and are obliged to continue to use the old electric only system. The electric system needs very expensive maintenance and can damage the towers. Bells The great bell of the new ring in Verona Cathedral. Cast in 2003 it weighs 4566 kg and is the largest bell in the world hung for full circle ringing. The bells are cast from 75% copper and 25% tin bell metal using traditional methods of a loam covered core and outer cope. Complex decoration of a religious nature is applied to the mould. The towers are tall with the bells installed at the top. The bells may swing through the tower openings and the sound is much louder than enclosed bell chambers. The clappers are wired on with a safety rope, a broken or detached clapper must not become a missile in the streets surrounding the tower. A heavy counterbalanced headstock reduces the forces on the tower and leads to a slower turning bell. The headstock carries a steel wheel with the rope attached at 3 o'clock rather than the higher 2 o'clock attachment in the English style. No stays or sliders are supplied, the bell must be held at balance when not ringing. The rope is steel which removes the problem of stretch when the bells are rung from ground floor ringing chambers. Being less flexible than natural fibres the steel rope is attached to the wheel with a toggle mechanism rather than being led through a garter hole. The rope is terminated in a natural hemp rope where it is handled. The ropes are plain without the sally associated with English style hanging. Since the bells are called according to music, the ringers do not need to see each other as a circle. The ropes fall therefore wherever is most convenient for the bell hangers. Performances Since there is no provision for the bells to be retained in the up position, each piece or concerto starts with the bells being raised. The bells are either raised sequentially with each bell joining in the rounds in turn, or just pulled up all at once. The Maestro, or conductor, calls out each bell or bells to ring. The Maestro does not handle a bell and will read from music. They play slowly moving tunes, not the continuous change ringing of the English tradition. The Maestro calls out the bells, including two and three bell chords. Each bell uses whichever stroke is available, the ringers holding the bells on balance when not required. The concerto ends with a flourish of chords. Once the concerto is complete the bells are rung down all at the same time, sometimes with the ringers leaving the tower whilst the bells just sort themselves out.

ATVOD was founded following a European Union directive on the regulation of audiovisual media. It was responsible for regulating on-demand services such as ITV Player and Channel 4's All 4, as well as paid-for content on websites which are deemed to be \\"tv-like\\". ATVOD's role with regard to VOD ended on 31 December 2015, when the function was taken over by Ofcom directly.  Origins  The Audiovisual Media Services Directive 2007 (2007/65/EU) of the European Union was implemented into UK law through Part 4A of the Communications Act 2003. The Directive updated the Television Without Frontiers Directive 1989 (89/552/EEC) to cover the extension of traditional television regulation to TV-like VOD. This directive was implemented in the UK on 19 December 2009 with regulations amending the Communications Act 2003. As a result, Ofcom consulted with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport about proposals for the creation of a regulator for UK-based VOD. ATVOD, formerly the Association for Television On-Demand, had originally been created as a self-regulatory industry body with the support and encouragement of the Government. It was chosen to be Ofcom's co-regulator of UK-based VOD in editorial matters and the Advertising Standards Authority was chosen to be Ofcom's co-regulator of UK-based VOD in advertising matters. This arrangement was given legal force when the government issued the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2010 which came into force on 18 March 2010. The Communications Act 2003 was further revised giving ATVOD greater enforcement powers in relation to VOD services. Minimum editorial and advertising standards were drawn up and published.  Regulation  Legislation enabled ATVOD to regulate \\"On-Demand Programme Services\\" (ODPS) as the body designated by Ofcom. A service was considered an ODPS if it met the following criteria: * The principal purpose of the service was the provision of programmes, and * the form and content of such programmes were comparable to those normally included in television programme services. * The programmes were offered by the service \\"on-demand\\". That is, they could be selected by a user, and viewed at a time chosen by the user. * The programmes were received by the user through an electronic communications network (including terrestrial broadcast, satellite broadcast, cable network or via Internet Protocol). * There was a person who exercised editorial responsibility in selecting and organising the programmes, and * That person made the service available for use by the public generally, and * That person was under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom as defined by the AVMSD. Any person who intended to provide an ODPS : * Had to give advance notification to ATVOD; * Had to pay a fee to ATVOD; * Had to retain a copy of all content for 42 days from the date it was last made publicly available; * Could not provide material which incited hatred based on race, sex, religion or nationality, nor provide material which might seriously impair the physical, mental or moral development of under eighteens; * Had to abide by rules on advertising, sponsorship, and product placement, but which Ofcom decided would be regulated by the Advertising Standards Authority rather than ATVOD. The question as to which services fell under ATVOD's regulation was tested on an ongoing basis. Appeals against ATVOD's decisions were referred to Ofcom. Ofcom ruled that YouTube content did not fall under ATVOD's remit. However, in February 2014 ATVOD determined that the feature film streaming and downloading service provided by Sainsbury's Entertainment did fall under its remit. In contrast, an Ofcom decision in August 2014 determined that The Urban Chick Supremacy Cell, a small-time website providing paid-for bondage and sadomasochistic content, did not constitute TV on-demand. Sanctions against those who failed to comply with these regulations included fines of up to ¬£250,000, suspension of service and criminal prosecution.  Adult websites  In practice the majority of ATVOD's work consisted of regulating UK websites that hosted videos to ensure that services containing adult content could not be accessed by users under 18. In September 2013 it ran a seminar for small businesses to explain VOD regulations. Its Chief Executive Peter Johnson said: ‚ÄúAsking visitors to a website to click an ‚ÄòI am 18‚Äô button or enter a date of birth or use a debit card is not sufficient ‚Äì if they are going to offer explicit sex material they must know that their customers are 18, just as they would in the ‚Äòoffline‚Äô world.‚Äù ATVOD believed that websites should require the user to supply valid credit card details or other personal information that can be cross-referenced with the electoral roll or another ID database, thus establishing the user's identity. Credit card age-verification alone was unfeasible since children over the age of fourteen but under eighteen could be added to an adult guarantor's account as an additional cardholder. Failure by commercial websites to obtain proof that the user was over 18 before allowing access to adult content was considered by ATVOD to be a breach of the Obscene Publications Act 1959. Johnson considered it possible that the act restricted the activities of adult websites based outside the UK if their content was downloaded within the UK. Johnson has also confirmed that in the case of non-pay sites containing user-uploaded material it was the uploader that was legally responsible rather than the service provider. ATVOD only had the jurisdiction to take action against websites that were based in the UK. Consequently, in 2013 the regulator proposed the introduction of a new licensing system. Licences would have only been granted to websites that had suitable age checks in place. Unlicensed websites would have had their payments from UK customers blocked. Talks between ATVOD and financial institutions including the Payments Council, the British Bankers Association and the UK Cards Association took place in October 2013. Subsequently, ATVOD provided the UK Government and the European Commission with detailed briefings on policy options. In March 2014 ATVOD proposed that legislation should be enacted before the 2015 United Kingdom general election, to forbid credit and debit card operators from processing payments from UK customers to unlicensed websites. This was not done, although the opposition Labour Party expressed support for such legislation. The ASACP described ATVOD's proposed age verification measures as \\"overbroad\\" and expressed concern that any consequent legislation could be \\"overly broad in its definition of adult entertainment content\\". In November 2014 the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 amended the Communications Act 2003 to set out statutory and legal obligations for media distributors of on-demand content. The regulations define the content that can legally be distributed under an R18 certificate and make it a criminal offence to not adequately restrict access to such content to those aged over 18. Further proposals were put forward by the Conservative Party in advance of the 2015 UK general election to give an independent regulator such as ATVOD the legal power to compel internet service providers to block sites which failed to include effective age verification. Provisions regarding the creation of an age-verification regulator and the blocking of non-compliant sites subsequently formed part of the Digital Economy Act 2017. However, the implementation of the proposed UK Internet age verification system was cancelled by the UK government in 2019.  Enforcement  In 2012‚Äì13 ATVOD took action against 16 services deemed to be in contravention of the regulations. Ten of these made changes to bring them into compliance and three closed voluntarily. One website was shut down by an Ofcom order after ignoring an ATVOD enforcement notice issued against it. Two services run by Playboy TV UK received fines from Ofcom totalling ¬£100,000. Parts of Playboy TV UK's operations were subsequently moved to Canada, from which it continued to provide services to UK consumers without being regulated by ATVOD. Consultation and Research In 2013 ATVOD conducted a survey into how easy the public think it is for under-18s to access hardcore pornography on the Internet and whether the public think that regulation to prevent such access is important. ATVOD subsequently organised a conference for representatives from the UK's adult entertainment industry and children's charities in conjunction with Queen Mary University of London. The conference, entitled For Adults Only? ‚Äì Protecting Children From Online Porn, met to discuss measures on how to stop young people accessing pornography online. Industry representatives the Association of Sites Advocating Child Protection and the Free Speech Coalition called for a public education campaign instead of blanket censorship, such as ISP blocking, based on the findings of their own report Protecting Children in the Digital Age. Campaign group Sex & Censorship questioned the presumption of the conference, pointing out that there is no evidence that online pornography is harmful and that inappropriate regulation could be counter-productive to child safety. In 2014 ATVOD published the results of research carried out in December 2013, tracking the actions of 45,000 UK internet users under the age of 18. Of those sampled, 10% of under-18s, 6% of under-16s, and 3% of under-12s who used the Internet during that month accessed an adult internet service at some point.

Concerns were raised about the small sample size associated with users aged under 12. Nielsen Netview, the marketing agency that carried out the survey, commented that: \\"The sample size for 6‚Äì11 year-olds on the panel is very low. Figures for this age range are still reported, but they are always issued with a 'health warning' as being potentially too unstable to accurately project audience size.\\" ATVOD confirmed that: \\"Sample sizes for the youngest children (6‚Äì11) are relatively small and figures for this age group should be treated with caution as they may exhibit large changes month to month...

Biography  In 1966, she became a press spokesperson for the Socialist German Student Union (\\"Sozialistische Deutsche Studentenbund\\" / SDS). After completing her degree in Applied Economics (\\"Volkswirtschaft\\"), in 1970 she travelled in the Middle-East. During the 1970s she took a lectureship in \\"International Relations\\" at Frankfurt University. During this time she maintained contacts with various terrorist groups. On 26 November 1974 Brigitte Heinrich was arrested. This was part of \\"Aktion Winterreise\\", a nationwide raid in fifteen towns and cities, which targeted RAF supporters in the aftermath of the murder of Berlin Court President G√ºnter von Drenkmann by members of the 2 June Movement. Heinrich was arrested on suspicion of \\"illegal trafficking in weapons and explosives\\". All those arrested were released after two weeks, possibly apart from Heinrich. Sources differ over whether she was released after a couple of weeks like the others but then re-arrested soon afterwards, or whether, unlike the others, she remained in investigative custody at this point. Heinrich vehemently protested her innocence and some months later became seriously ill. She was released \\"for reasons of health\\" before the prosecuting authorities had completed their work on her case. She returned to Frankfurt University where for several years she combined with her other work the presidency of the student parliament. In 1978 she published a pamphlet in Italian in Milan in the form of a \\"diary from the dungeon\\" in which she presented \\"Aktion Winterreise\\" as an act of state persecution of intellectuals in Germany, of which she had been a victim.Heinrich, Diario del Carcere, 1975: operazione Winterreise e persecuzione degli intellettuali in Germania, Mailand 1978, zitiert nach Petra Terhoeven: Deutscher Herbst in Europa. Oldenbourg, M√ºnchen 2014, p. 440. There are indications that during her time in Milan in the late 1970s Heinich was in close contact with members of the Red Brigade terrorist groups. By 1980 Brigitte Heinrich had developed a significant media profile, and between 1980 or 1981 and 1984 she worked as a regular journalist for the Berlin-based Tageszeitung (daily newspaper). One of her colleagues at the newspaper was the radical lawyer Klaus Croissant. It was also in 1980 that Brigitte Heinrich finally faced trial. She received a 21 month prison sentence \\"for weapons smuggling\\". The context for her trial was her involvement in a German-Italian-Swiss \\"anarchist\\" network which was headed up by her friend, the German-Italian alleged terrorist Petra Krause. Possibly on account of her excellent media contacts, and the widespread belief on the radical left that prison conditions for West German \\"political prisoners\\" were exceptionally grim, Heinrich's imprisonment became something of a 'cause c√©l√®bre'. Several sources strongly hint that it was because of this that she served her sentence under conditions of \\"semi-freedom\\", described by one source as a \\"daytime release\\", which enabled her to continue providing contributions to the Tageszeitung while returning to prison at nights. Her sentence was completed at the end of 1983, and she accepted the offer of a place on the party list of the Green Party for the European parliamentary election in June 1984. Reflecting the fringe position which the party then occupied on the West German political spectrum, her name was placed second on the list and she accordingly became one of the seven German Green Party members of the parliament, retaining her seat till her sudden death in 1987. She died as the result of a heart attack two days before the end of the year. Her funeral took place on 6 January 1988 in the principal chamber of the Frankfurt Main Cemetery and was attended by members and representatives from a range of left-wing groups from many countries. = Agent of the East German security services = Following reunification in 1990 researchers gained access to a vast archive of the carefully compiled documentation produced between 1950 and 1989 by the East Germany Ministry for State Security \\"(Stasi)\\". It was discovered that since the early part of 1981 Heinrich had been passing information to the East German security services. She was identified in Stasi records under the code names \\"IM Taler\\" and also, after 1983 as \\"Beate Sch√§fer\\". While they worked together on the Tageszeitung Brigitte Heinrich and Klaus Croissant also teamed up together in their personal lives. In this connection Heinrich was recruited, apparently by Croissant, as a Stasi informer. She worked for Hauptabteilung XXII (\\"Main department 12\\") which concerned itself with \\"observing\\" terrorism in West Germany. It was only after she died that it became known to authorities in the west that she had received her orders through Klaus Croissant and transmitted her reports to Stasi handlers in East Berlin through him. It is not clear from sources how the Hessischer regional branch of the Green Party came to nominate Brigitte Heinrich as a candidate for the 1984 European parliamentary election, but it is clear from sources that emerged subsequently that she only accepted the nomination after discussion with Stasi handlers. As a member of the European parliament Heinrich became important not just to the Stasi's \\"Hauptabteilung XXII\\" but also to its National Intelligence Directorate (\\"Hauptverwaltung Aufkl√§rung\\" / HVA). The HVA was East Germany's intelligence service with respect to West Germany. Most intelligence activity conducted on behalf of Warsaw Pact governments and Western Europe was tightly controlled from Moscow by the KGB. With respect to West Germany, however, it was far more effective to conduct espionage from East Germany because the extent of the shared language and kinships, culture and histories of East and West Germany meant that the pool of potential sympathizers, informants and secret intelligence operatives was immeasurably vast. As \\"Beate Sch√§fer\\" she was able to report, after May 1984, on the discussions between the national sub-groups of the parliament's Green group. The HVA were keen that she should become influential within the parliamentary Green faction and accordingly insisted that she distance herself from the \\"militant activist scene\\" in West Germany. In this way she might become more than a conventional \\"Stasi informant\\". As an influential voice of the left she would be able to influence detailed discussions within the European parliament and its committees in ways that aligned more closely with East German government objectives. From Stasi records it is apparent that \\"from 29 November 1984 Dr. Croissant and Brigitte Heinich unconditionally separated themselves from the terrorist scene\\". Heinrich was instructed to raise her profile in the Green Party and in the increasingly important \\"peace movement\\". By the time of her sudden death at the end of December 1987 it appears that she was succeeding. Through Croissant she had submitted detailed reports to her handlers containing a multiplicity of detail about meetings involving the \\"rainbow coalition\\" within the European parliament and involving the party's Bundestag group in the West German capital. She had also attended at least eight meetings with senior HVA officers .

Nevertheless, the citizens of these cities enjoyed certain rights under Roman law, like the commercium and the conubium. In the Greek East, many of the Greek city-states (poleis) were formally liberated and granted some form of formal guarantee of their autonomy.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy Edward Pickersgill, the sitting Liberal MP for Bethnal Green South West, resigned from the House of Commons in July 1911; in order to take up a post as a stipendary magistrate. Electoral history Pickersgill had been the MP for Bethnal Green South West since 1906, having previously represented the seat from its creation in 1885 until 1900. During the six-year period where Pickersgill did not represent the seat, it was represented by a Conservative. At the previous general election in December 1910, Pickersgill had been comfortably re-elected with a majority of 682 votes. Pickersgill Candidates Following Pickersgill's re-election in December 1910, he had informed his local Liberal Association that he planned to leave politics to become a magistrate. In anticipation of Pickersgill's resignation, the local association selected Percy Harris as their candidate. Harris had previously stood as a Liberal Party candidate for parliament elsewhere on two occasions. However, he was a local man who had represented the constituency on the London County Council since 1907. Charles Masterman had been Liberal MP for West Ham North until he was forced out by the courts early in 1911 when his December 1910 victory was declared void. Despite this disruption to his parliamentary status, he had continued in the government post of Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. During this period, he was responsible for the passage through parliament of the National Insurance Act 1911. The Liberal Party leadership was keen to get Masterman back into parliament as soon as possible. They told Pickersgill that his appointment as a magistrate was conditional upon him supporting Masterman rather than Harris as his successor. The party leadership and Pickergill put pressure on Harris to withdraw as candidate in favour of Masterman, which he did.Forty Years in and out of Parliament by Sir Percy HarrisDictionary of Liberal Biography Eric Hoffgaard, who had been the Conservative Party candidate at the previous general election, was again selected to contest the seat. An Australian-born socialist John Scurr made it a three-way fight. When Masterman was selected as the official Liberal candidate, some of Harris' supporters decided to campaign in support of Scurr. Campaign Polling Day was fixed for the 29 July. Result The Liberals retained the seat and managed to gain a slightly increased majority: Masterman Aftermath In February 1914, Masterman was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and required to resign and fight another by-election and this time was defeated.

The Wrekin Terrane is one of five inferred fault bounded terranes that make up the basement rocks of the southern United Kingdom. The other notable geological terranes are the Charnwood Terrane, Fenland Terrane, Cymru Terrane and the Monian Composite Terrane.P. J. Brenchley, P. F. Rawson The Geology of England and Wales, 2006, 2nd Ed The Wrekin Terrane is bounded to the west by the Welsh Borderland Fault System and to the east by the Malvern Lineament. The geological terrane to the west is the Cymru Terrane and to the east is Charnwood Terrane. The majority of rocks in the area are associated with the outcrops that are evident at the faulted boundaries.J. N. Carney, J. M. Horak, et al., Precambrian Rocks of England and Wales, Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Geological Conservation Review Series 20 Intrusive geology The older rocks of the terrane rest in the Precambrian with younger Cambrian rocks resting unconformably upon them. The Precambrian rocks are noted to be calc-alkaline plutonic intrusions dated to approximately 700-600 Ma (Phase 1 to Phase 2 Neoproterozoic). These have associated (younger) volcanics that dominate the overlying sedimentary rocks that date between 570 and 560 Ma. The signatures of the rocks are interpreted as having an intra-plate geochemical signature that may be attributed to arc- rifting. The diachronous formations of the bedded Uriconian and Coomb Volcanic Formation.Pharaoh, T.C., Gibbons, W., Precambrian Rocks in England and Wales south of the Menai Strait Fault System, 1987 A Revised Correlation of the Precambrian Rocks in the British Isles Metamorphic rock is thought to underlie the Wrekin Terrane and is inferred from the outcrops associated with the Malvern Hills where outcrops of metasedimentary schist and gneiss are noted at Gullet Quarry (southern Malvern Hills). There are also outcrops of gneiss at Primrose Hill on the Welsh Borderland Fault System. =Stanner Hanter= The Stanner-Hanter Complex outcrops in the terrane, the complex is a magmatic intrusion (non-preserved) with a four-stage cross cutting history where acidic and basic rocks have been intermingled and hybridised with an interpreted age of 702 Ma +/-8 Ma (Stanner Hill Granophyre).R. S. Thorpe, Possible subduction zone origin for two Precambrian calc-alkaline plutonic complexes from southern Britain., 2000, Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, Vol. 83, 3663‚Äì3668 =Malvern Complex= On the other side of the terrane the Malvern Complex is composed of diorite and tonalite plutons that have been altered by Proterozoic metamorphism (modifying the original igneous textures) by still exhibit calc-alkaline, magmatic arc geochemical signatures. The date of emplacement is interpreted to be 677 Ma +/- 2 Ma with upper greenschist-lower amphibolite metamorphic cooling ages of c.650 Ma although crustal recycling is inferred from the presence of inherited zircon of 1598 Ma +/- 32 Ma. The later phases of intrusion are noted within the Wrekin Range where the Uriconian rhyolite is cross cut with the Neoproterozoic Ercall Granophyre. Granophyric Intrusion at The Ercall. Volcano-sedimentary geology The sedimentary record in the area varies between volcaniclastic and siliciclastic deposition, the latter being present in the Longmnyd area and the former being representative of the Stanner-Hanter and Malvern Complex. Depositional facies include the Uriconian and the Longmyndian sequences. The relationship between the two is complex with some suggestion that the two are coeval and faulted as well as two unconformable strata. The former (coeval but different depositional facies) is supported by U-Pb Zircon dating from the Longmyndian bentonites. However, this is not definitive.R. A. Strachan, R. D. Nance, R. D. Dallmeyer, R. S. D'Lemos, J. B. Murphy, G. R. Watt, Late Precambrian techtonothermal evolution of the Malvern Complex, 1996, Journal of the Geological Society, London, 144, 753‚Äì764 =Uriconian= The Uriconian sedimentary geology is mainly composed of bimodal (acidic, intermediate and basic) intra-plate volcanics with only minimal influence from subduction. The interpreted overview of the depositional environment is that of a trans- tensional arc caused by oblique subduction. The sediments of the Uriconian are indicated to have been deposited rapidly with such volcanism being dated (U-Pb Zircon) at 566+/-2 Ma (Note the Uriconian is cross-cut by the Late Precambrian Ercall Granophyre dated 560+/-1 Ma.) The sequence is dominated by pyroclastic deposits, breccias and welded tuffs which is suggestive of a former volcanic centre being in close proximity and deposition in a subaerial environment. alt=Uriconian Volcaniclastic Sequence at Photograph of Uriconian Sediments from the Forest Glen car park at The Wrekin =Coomb Volcanic Formation= The Coomb Volcanic Formation occupies much of the south-west of the Wrekin Terrane and its associated inliers. The sequence is the most recent suite of Neoproterozoic rocks identified in southern Britain. The formation consists of over 1000 m of sediments deposited in a subaqueous environment (in contrast to the subaerial Uriconian). Explosive ash-flow tuffs mark the initial phase of deposition followed by rhyolite flows and domes. Bimodal deposition followed with lavas, minor intrusions, ash-flows and volcaniclastic rocks with some ash-flows exhibiting Ediacaran body fossils.J. C. W. Cope, An Ediacara type fauna from South Wales 1977, Nature, London 264,624 The geochemistry notes that fractional crystallisation process within the magma chamber links the lavas with the tuffs and gives intra-plate as well as subduction geochemical signatures. =Warren House Formation= The Malvern Hills represent another depositional environment for Late Neoproterozoic sedimentation with the Warren House Formation being in thrust contact with the Malvern Complex. The Warren House Formation is composed of pillow basalts, intermediate lavas, altered rhyolites and welded and non-welded acid tuffs with evidence to suggest that they are linked via fractional crystallisation. U-Pb zircon dating gives an age of 566 Ma+/-2 Ma. The geochemical signature from this sequence is contrasting to that of the rest of the Wrekin Terrane being of a volcanic arc formed on oceanic or on thin, immature continental crust. =Longmyndian Supergroup= The Supergroup consists of c.6000 m of sedimentary rocks with varying facies from basinal and distal turbidite to deltaic and fluviatile successions which exhibits a generally regressive sequence. The Longmyndian is separated into two main depositionally distinguishable units: the Stretton Group and the Wentnor Group. The succession is geographically positioned between the Pontesford-Linley Fault System and the Church Stretton Fault System which has been folded, possibly during the late Neoproterozoic, and is inferred to gently plunge to the south. The succession is predominantly siliciclastic but with minor intrusions noted. A basal age (from a bentonite horizon) of the Stretton Group is given as 555.9 Ma+/-3.5 Ma.W. Compston, A. E. Wright, P. Toghill, Dating the Late Precambrian volcanicity of England and Wales. 2002, Journal of the Geological Society of London. 159 323‚Äì339. =Palaeontology= The Wrekin Terrane contains abundant evidence of Ediacara fauna which include the body fossil taxa Beltanelliformis brunsae and B. minutae.

The plan uses a distinctive street network with repeating squares of residential blocks, commercial blocks, and small green parks to create integrated, walkable neighborhoods. James Edward Oglethorpe founded the Georgia Colony, and the town of Savannah, in 1732. The new Georgia colony was authorized under a grant from George II to a group constituted by Oglethorpe as the Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America, or simply the Georgia Trustees. Oglethorpe's plan for settlement of the new colony had been in the works since 1730, three years before the founding of Savannah. The multifaceted plan sought to achieve several goals through interrelated policy and design elements, including the spacing of towns, the layout of towns and eventually their surrounding counties, equitable allocation of land, and limits to growth to preserve a sustainable agrarian economy.Wilson, The Oglethorpe Plan, 37-44. Historical significance The Oglethorpe Plan was an embodiment of all of the major themes of the Enlightenment, including science, humanism, and secular government. Georgia became the only American colony infused at its creation with Enlightenment ideals: the last of the Thirteen Colonies, it would become the first to embody the principles later embraced by the Founders. Remnants of the Oglethorpe Plan exist today in Savannah, showcasing a town plan that retains the vibrancy of ideas behind its conception. At the heart of Oglethorpe‚Äôs comprehensive and multi-faceted plan there was a vision of social equity and civic virtue. The mechanisms supporting that vision, including yeoman governance, equitable land allocation, stable land tenure, prohibition of slavery, and secular administration, were among the ideas debated during the British Enlightenment. Many of those ideals have been carried forward, and are found today in Savannah‚Äôs Tricentennial Plan and other policy documents.Wilson, The Oglethorpe Plan, 134-35, 189-192.Fries, The Urban Idea in Colonial America, 138-46. Sources for the Oglethorpe Plan The Grand Model for the Province of Carolina was cited by the Georgia Trustees as a source of their plan for Georgia, although with the major difference that it would have neither aristocracy nor slavery. Oglethorpe wrote that the plan was conceived with \\"toleration\\" and \\"wholesome regulations.\\"James Oglethorpe, \\"A New and Accurate Account\\" Benjamin Martyn, the Trustees secretary, wrote, \\"We are indebted to the Lord Shaftsbury, and that truly wise man Mr. Locke, for the excellent laws which they drew up for the first settlement of Carolina.\\"\\"Reasons for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America,\\" written by Benjamin Martyn for the Trustees in 1732. Other sources are speculative, since they were not cited by Oglethorpe or the Trustees. Such possible inspirations include classical planning concepts dating to Vitruvius and Roman colonial planning (e.g., Timgad), Renaissance concepts of the ideal city, and later plans such as the Vauban plan of Neuf-Brisach.Reps, Making of Urban America, 195-202.Wilson, 38-40 Notable comments Sketch of Savannah's Town Plan showing four cellular wards, each containing eight city blocks around a square (four residential blocks in the corners, each split by a narrow lane, plus four smaller commercial blocks east and west of the square) Many prominent planners and urban theorists have commented on various attributes of the Oglethorpe Plan, particularly the layout of Savannah. The quotes cited below are only a few of many laudatory comments. \\"The famous Oglethorpe plan for Savannah ‚Ä¶ made a unique use of the square in the design, nothing like it having appeared in a town plan before or since. Here, in Savannah, the square by frequent repetition becomes an integral part of the street pattern and creates a series of rhythmically placed openings which give a wonderful sense of space in a solidly built townscape.\\" ‚ÄìPaul ZuckerZucker, Paul.

Jackson and Phinizy Spalding, 101-51. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984. 101. Such comments nearly always apply to the ward layout found in the Savannah historic district, where the city preserved and elaborated on the original town plan laid out by Oglethorpe. Though seldom mentioned, notable vestiges of the Oglethorpe Plan can be found in the land use pattern surrounding Savannah; in the cities of Darien, Georgia; Brunswick, Georgia; and at Fort Frederica National Monument on St. Simons Island, Georgia.Wilson, The Oglethorpe Plan, 153-57. Implementation Savannah map of 1818 showing continuation of the ward design with minor modifications Oglethorpe developed a town plan in which the basic design unit was the ward. Wards were composed of four tything (residential) blocks and four trust (civic) blocks, arrayed around a central square. The tything blocks contained ten houses, which was the basic organizational unit for administration, farming, and defense. Each tything was assigned a square mile tract outside town for farming, with each family farming a forty-five acre plot within that tract. The tything trained together for militia duty, a necessity on the frontier. Families were also assigned five-acre kitchen gardens near town. Oglethorpe‚Äôs town plan was initially developed for Savannah, which grew largely in accordance with the original design. The same basic plan was intended for replication in towns throughout the colony; however, the original design survives in few towns. Recently, Brunswick, Georgia, adopted a version of the design modeled after the Trustee periodWilson, The Oglethorpe Plan, 153-54. The City of Savannah has preserved the ward design within its National Historic Landmark District. Oglethorpe originally laid out six wards in Savannah. The design proved remarkably adaptable as the city grew, and city officials perpetuated the same basic model for more than a century. Ultimately, twenty-four wards were laid out in general accordance with the original design, filling most of the original square-mile town common.Wilson, The Oglethorpe Plan, 134-50. The city‚Äôs modern street grid outside of the historic district follows much of the original system of rights-of-way established under the Oglethorpe Plan for the gardens, farms, and villages that made up the Savannah region. Legacy =Relevance of the plan today= Many of the principles found in the Oglethorpe Plan are as relevant today as the democratic principles articulated at the dawn of the American Revolution. Urban theorists have duly acknowledged Oglethorpe‚Äôs remarkable design legacy in Savannah, but most have said little about the plan‚Äôs larger purpose of fostering social equity. Urban planners and designers in Savannah have rediscovered Oglethorpe‚Äôs principles of integrated town planning, incorporating them in the city‚Äôs comprehensive plan and various implementing ordinances. The city‚Äôs success in doing so now stands as a model inviting wider application.Tricentennial Plan, \\"Community Agenda.\\" The plan is fundamentally different from modern town or community plans by allowing for growth in small, interlocking units, or wards, of approximately 10 acres (4 hectares). The exact size of a ward will vary depending on the width of streets that bound it. In Savannah, streets between wards vary from 45 feet to 120 feet, including sidewalks and landscaped medians. While the size of a ward may vary, it is important to keep it within about 15 percent of Oglethorpe‚Äôs original layout. In following this standard automobile traffic is naturally limited to speeds of about 20 mph (30 km/h), the threshold for pedestrian comfort in a mixed-modal, shared space environment. Another way in which the plan is fundamentally different from most designs today is in maximizing lot coverage on buildable lots while minimizing the open space requirement on those lots. Minimizing or eliminating these standards can be done because open space is provided in the public realm. A ward contains approximately 50% developable area and 50% public area (depending on the width of bounding streets), and because the public area is shared space streets contribute to open space both aesthetically and functionally.Wilson, Thomas and Patrick Shay. \\"Oglethorpe and Savannah: A Historic Plan has Modern Applications.\\" Planning. March, 2014, 30-35. =Influence in contemporary planning= The Savannah town plan has been praised profusely, as mentioned earlier, but no recent or contemporary replicas of it exist either in infill or suburban developments, even in Savannah's own districts that lie beyond the original square mile commons. Its cellular ward system has been cited as a unique example of fractal, or \\"organic\\", city growth in which each ward cell is a microcosm of the entire city.Batty, Michael; Longley, Paul (1994). Fractal Cities: A Geometry of Form and Function, Academic Press; Its recognized and praised advantages have recently been incorporated in a planning model, which is also cellular, that shows the influence of the Oglethorpe plan ‚Äì the Fused Grid. Diagrammatic and approved plans, based on this model reflect the Savannah plan principle of organizing buildable space around open space. In this reformulated expression of it, which accommodates contemporary planning, technological and cultural priorities, Oglethorpe‚Äôs Town Plan could find a renewed appreciation and wider replication.

A wide range of datasets are naturally organized in matrix form. One example is the movie-ratings matrix, as appears in the Netflix problem: Given a ratings matrix in which each entry (i,j) represents the rating of movie j by customer i, if customer i has watched movie j and is otherwise missing, we would like to predict the remaining entries in order to make good recommendations to customers on what to watch next. Another example is the term-document matrix: The frequencies of words used in a collection of documents can be represented as a matrix, where each entry corresponds to the number of times the associated term appears in the indicated document. Without any restrictions on the number of degrees of freedom in the completed matrix this problem is underdetermined since the hidden entries could be assigned arbitrary values. Thus matrix completion often seeks to find the lowest rank matrix or, if the rank of the completed matrix is known, a matrix of rank r that matches the known entries. The illustration shows that a partially revealed rank-1 matrix (on the left) can be completed with zero-error (on the right) since all the rows with missing entries should be the same as the third row. In the case of the Netflix problem the ratings matrix is expected to be low-rank since user preferences can often be described by a few factors, such as the movie genre and time of release. Other applications include computer vision, where missing pixels in images need to be reconstructed, detecting the global positioning of sensors in a network from partial distance information, and multiclass learning. The matrix completion problem is in general NP-hard, but under additional assumptions there are efficient algorithms that achieve exact reconstruction with high probability. In statistical learning point of view, the matrix completion problem is an application of matrix regularization which is a generalization of vector regularization. For example, in the low- rank matrix completion problem one may apply the regularization penalty taking the form of a nuclear norm R(X) = \\\\lambda\\\\X\\\\_*  Low rank matrix completion  One of the variants of the matrix completion problem is to find the lowest rank matrix X which matches the matrix M, which we wish to recover, for all entries in the set E of observed entries. The mathematical formulation of this problem is as follows: :\\\\begin{align} & \\\\underset{X}{\\\\text{min}} & \\\\text{rank} (X)  & \\\\text{subject to} & X_{ij} = M_{ij} & \\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall i,j \\\\in E \\\\end{align} Cand√®s and Recht proved that with assumptions on the sampling of the observed entries and sufficiently many sampled entries this problem has a unique solution with high probability. An equivalent formulation, given that the matrix M to be recovered is known to be of rank r, is to solve for X where X_{ij} = M_{ij} \\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall i,j \\\\in E = Assumptions = A number of assumptions on the sampling of the observed entries and the number of sampled entries are frequently made to simplify the analysis and to ensure the problem is not underdetermined.  Uniform sampling of observed entries  To make the analysis tractable, it is often assumed that the set E of observed entries and fixed cardinality is sampled uniformly at random from the collection of all subsets of entries of cardinality E. To further simplify the analysis, it is instead assumed that E is constructed by Bernoulli sampling, i.e. that each entry is observed with probability p . If p is set to \\\\frac{N}{mn} where N is the desired expected cardinality of E, and m,\\\\;n are the dimensions of the matrix (let m < n without loss of generality), E is within O(n \\\\log n) of N with high probability, thus Bernoulli sampling is a good approximation for uniform sampling. Another simplification is to assume that entries are sampled independently and with replacement.  Lower bound on number of observed entries  Suppose the m by n matrix M (with m < n) we are trying to recover has rank r. There is an information theoretic lower bound on how many entries must be observed before M can be uniquely reconstructed. The set of m by n matrices with rank less than or equal to r is an algebraic variety in {\\\\mathbb C}^{m\\\\times n}with dimension (n+m)r - r^2. Using this result, one can show that at least 4nr - 4r^2 entries must be observed for matrix completion in {\\\\mathbb C}^{n \\\\times n} to have a unique solution when r \\\\leq n/2 . Secondly, there must be at least one observed entry per row and column of M. The Singular Value Decomposition of M is given by U\\\\Sigma V^\\\\dagger. If row i is unobserved, it is easy to see the i^{\\\\text{th}} right singular vector of M, v_i, can be changed to some arbitrary value and still yield a matrix matching M over the set of observed entries. Similarly, if column j is unobserved, the j^{\\\\text{th}} left singular vector of M, u_i can be arbitrary. If we assume Bernoulli sampling of the set of observed entries, the Coupon collector effect implies that entries on the order of O(n\\\\log n) must be observed to ensure that there is an observation from each row and column with high probability. Combining the necessary conditions and assuming that r \\\\ll m, n (a valid assumption for many practical applications), the lower bound on the number of observed entries required to prevent the problem of matrix completion from being underdetermined is on the order of nr\\\\log n .  Incoherence  The concept of incoherence arose in compressed sensing. It is introduced in the context of matrix completion to ensure the singular vectors of M are not too \\"sparse\\" in the sense that all coordinates of each singular vector are of comparable magnitude instead of just a few coordinates having significantly larger magnitudes. The standard basis vectors are then undesirable as singular vectors, and the vector \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1  1  \\\\vdots  1 \\\\end{bmatrix} in \\\\mathbb{R}^n is desirable. As an example of what could go wrong if the singular vectors are sufficiently \\"sparse\\", consider the m by n matrix \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0  \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} with singular value decomposition I_m \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0  \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} I_n. Almost all the entries of M must be sampled before it can be reconstructed. Cand√®s and Recht define the coherence of a matrix U with column space an r-dimensional subspace of \\\\mathbb{R}^n as \\\\mu (U) = \\\\frac{n}{r} \\\\max_{i < n} \\\\P_U e_i\\\\^2 , where P_U is the orthogonal projection onto U . Incoherence then asserts that given the singular value decomposition U\\\\Sigma V^\\\\dagger of the m by n matrix M, # \\\\mu (U), \\\\; \\\\mu (V) \\\\leq \\\\mu_0 # The entries of \\\\sum_k u_k v_k ^\\\\dagger have magnitudes upper bounded by \\\\mu_1 \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{r}{mn}} for some \\\\mu_0, \\\\; \\\\mu_1.  Low rank matrix completion with noise  In real world application, one often observe only a few entries corrupted at least by a small amount of noise. For example, in the Netflix problem, the ratings are uncertain. Cand√®s and Plan showed that it is possible to fill in the many missing entries of large low-rank matrices from just a few noisy samples by nuclear norm minimization. The noisy model assumes that we observe Y_{ij} = M_{ij} + Z_{ij}, (i,j) \\\\in \\\\Omega, where {Z_{ij}:(i,j) \\\\in \\\\Omega} is a noise term. Note that the noise can be either stochastic or deterministic. Alternatively the model can be expressed as P_\\\\Omega(Y) = P_\\\\Omega(M) + P_\\\\Omega(Z), where Z is an n \\\\times n matrix with entries Z_{ij} for (i,j) \\\\in \\\\Omega assuming that \\\\P_\\\\Omega(Z)\\\\_F\\\\leq\\\\delta for some \\\\delta > 0 .To recover the incomplete matrix, we try to solve the following optimization problem: \\\\begin{align} & \\\\underset{X}{\\\\text{min}} & \\\\X\\\\_*  & \\\\text{subject to} & \\\\P_\\\\Omega(X-Y)\\\\_F \\\\leq \\\\delta \\\\end{align} Among all matrices consistent with the data, find the one with minimum nuclear norm. Cand√®s and Plan have shown that this reconstruction is accurate. They have proved that when perfect noiseless recovery occurs, then matrix completion is stable vis a vis perturbations. The error is proportional to the noise level \\\\delta. Therefore, when the noise level is small, the error is small. Here the matrix completion problem does not obey the restricted isometry property (RIP). For matrices, the RIP would assume that the sampling operator obeys (1-\\\\delta)\\\\X\\\\^2_F \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\P_\\\\Omega(X)\\\\^2_F \\\\leq (1+\\\\delta)\\\\X\\\\^2_F for all matrices X with sufficiently small rank and \\\\delta<1 sufficiently small. The methods are also applicable to sparse signal recovery problems in which the RIP does not hold.  High rank matrix completion  The high rank matrix completion in general is NP-Hard. However, with certain assumptions, some incomplete high rank matrix or even full rank matrix can be completed. Eriksson, Balzano and Nowak have considered the problem of completing a matrix with the assumption that the columns of the matrix belong to a union of multiple low-rank subspaces. Since the columns belong to a union of subspaces, the problem may be viewed as a missing-data version of the subspace clustering problem. Let X be an n \\\\times N matrix whose (complete) columns lie in a union of at most k subspaces, each of rank \\\\leq r < n, and assume N \\\\gg kn. Eriksson, Balzano and Nowak showed that under mild assumptions each column of X can be perfectly recovered with high probability from an incomplete version so long as at least CrN\\\\log^2(n) entries of X are observed uniformly at random, with C>1 a constant depending on the usual incoherence conditions, the geometrical arrangement of subspaces, and the distribution of columns over the subspaces. The algorithm involves several steps : (1) local neighborhoods; (2) local subspaces; (3) subspace refinement; (4) full matrix completion. This method can be applied to Internet distance matrix completion and topology identification.  Algorithms  Various matrix completion algorithms has been proposed. These includes convex relaxation-based algorithm, gradient-based algorithm, and alternating minimization-based algorithm. = Convex relaxation = The rank minimization problem is NP-hard. One approach, proposed by Cand√®s and Recht, is to form a convex relaxation of the problem and minimize the nuclear norm \\\\M\\\\_* (which gives the sum of the singular values of M) instead of \\\\text{rank}(M) (which counts the number of non zero singular values of M). This is analogous to minimizing the L1-norm rather than the L0-norm for vectors. The convex relaxation can be solved using semidefinite programming (SDP) by noticing that the optimization problem is equivalent to \\\\begin{align} & \\\\underset{W_1, W_2}{\\\\text{min}} & & \\\\text{trace} (W_1) + \\\\text{trace} (W_2)  & \\\\text{subject to} & & X_{ij} = M_{ij} \\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall i,j \\\\in E & & & \\\\begin{bmatrix} W_1 & X  X^T & W_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\succeq 0 \\\\end{align} The complexity of using SDP to solve the convex relaxation is O(\\\\text{max}(m,n)^4). State of the art solvers like SDP3 can only handle matrices of size up to 100 by 100 An alternative first order method that approximately solves the convex relaxation is the Singular Value Thresholding Algorithm introduced by Cai, Cand√®s and Shen. Cand√®s and Recht show, using the study of random variables on Banach spaces, that if the number of observed entries is on the order of \\\\max{\\\\\\\\{\\\\mu_1^2, \\\\sqrt{\\\\mu_0}\\\\mu_1, \\\\mu_0 n^{0.25}\\\\\\\\}}nr \\\\log n (assume without loss of generality m < n), the rank minimization problem has a unique solution which also happens to be the solution of its convex relaxation with probability 1-\\\\frac{c}{n^3} for some constant c. If the rank of M is small ( r \\\\leq \\\\frac{n^{0.2}}{\\\\mu_0}), the size of the set of observations reduces to the order of \\\\mu_0 n^{1.2} r \\\\log n. These results are near optimal, since the minimum number of entries that must be observed for the matrix completion problem to not be underdetermined is on the order of nr \\\\log n. This result has been improved by Cand√®s and Tao. They achieve bounds that differ from the optimal bounds only by polylogarithmic factors by strengthening the assumptions. Instead of the incoherence property, they assume the strong incoherence property with parameter \\\\mu_3. This property states that: #  \\\\langle e_a, P_U e_{a'} \\\\rangle - \\\\frac{r}{m} 1_{a = a'}  \\\\leq \\\\mu_3 \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{r}}{m} for a, a' \\\\leq m and  \\\\langle e_b, P_U e_{b'} \\\\rangle - \\\\frac{r}{n} 1_{b = b'}  \\\\leq \\\\mu_3 \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{r}}{n} for b, b' \\\\leq n # The entries of \\\\sum_i u_i v_i^\\\\dagger are bounded in magnitude by \\\\mu_3 \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{r}{mn}} Intuitively, strong incoherence of a matrix U asserts that the orthogonal projections of standard basis vectors to U has magnitudes that have high likelihood if the singular vectors were distributed randomly. Cand√®s and Tao find that when r is O(1) and the number of observed entries is on the order of \\\\mu_3^4 n(\\\\log n)^2, the rank minimization problem has a unique solution which also happens to be the solution of its convex relaxation with probability 1-\\\\frac{c}{n^3} for some constant c. For arbitrary r, the number of observed entries sufficient for this assertion hold true is on the order of \\\\mu_3^2 nr (\\\\log n)^6 = Gradient descent = Keshavan, Montanari and Oh consider a variant of matrix completion where the rank of the m by n matrix M, which is to be recovered, is known to be r. They assume Bernoulli sampling of entries, constant aspect ratio \\\\frac{m}{n}, bounded magnitude of entries of M (let the upper bound be M_{\\\\text{max}}), and constant condition number \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_1}{\\\\sigma_r} (where \\\\sigma_1 and \\\\sigma_r are the largest and smallest singular values of M respectively). Further, they assume the two incoherence conditions are satisfied with \\\\mu_0 and \\\\mu_1 \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_1}{\\\\sigma_r} where \\\\mu_0 and \\\\mu_1 are constants. Let M^E be a matrix that matches M on the set E of observed entries and is 0 elsewhere. They then propose the following algorithm: # Trim M^E by removing all observations from columns with degree larger than \\\\frac{2E}{n} by setting the entries in the columns to 0. Similarly remove all observations from rows with degree larger than \\\\frac{2E}{n}. # Project M^E onto its first r principal components. Call the resulting matrix \\\\text{Tr}(M^E). # Solve \\\\min_{X,Y} \\\\min_{S \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{r \\\\times r}} \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i,j \\\\in E} (M_{ij} - (XSY^\\\\dagger)_{ij})^2 + \\\\rho G(X,Y) where G(X,Y) is some regularization function by gradient descent with line search. Initialize X,\\\\;Y at X_0,\\\\;Y_0 where \\\\text{Tr}(M_E) = X_0 S_0 Y_0^\\\\dagger. Set G(X,Y) as some function forcing X, \\\\; Y to remain incoherent throughout gradient descent if X_0 and Y_0 are incoherent. # Return the matrix XSY^\\\\dagger. Steps 1 and 2 of the algorithm yield a matrix \\\\text{Tr}(M^E) very close to the true matrix M (as measured by the root mean square error (RMSE) with high probability. In particular, with probability 1-\\\\frac{1}{n^3}, \\\\frac{1}{mnM_{\\\\text{max}}^2} \\\\ M - \\\\text{Tr}(M^E) \\\\_F^2 \\\\leq C \\\\frac{r}{mE} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m}{n}} for some constant C. \\\\ \\\\cdot \\\\_F denotes the Frobenius norm. Note that the full suite of assumptions is not needed for this result to hold. The incoherence condition, for example, only comes into play in exact reconstruction. Finally, although trimming may seem counter intuitive as it involves throwing out information, it ensures projecting M^E onto its first r principal components gives more information about the underlying matrix M than about the observed entries. In Step 3, the space of candidate matrices X,\\\\;Y can be reduced by noticing that the inner minimization problem has the same solution for (X,Y) as for (XQ,YR) where Q and R are orthonormal r by r matrices. Then gradient descent can be performed over the cross product of two Grassman manifolds. If r \\\\ll m,\\\\;n and the observed entry set is in the order of nr\\\\log n, the matrix returned by Step 3 is exactly M. Then the algorithm is order optimal, since we know that for the matrix completion problem to not be underdetermined the number of entries must be in the order of nr\\\\log n. = Alternating least squares minimization = Alternating minimization represents a widely applicable and empirically successful approach for finding low-rank matrices that best fit the given data. For example, for the problem of low-rank matrix completion, this method is believed to be one of the most accurate and efficient, and formed a major component of the winning entry in the Netflix problem. In the alternating minimization approach, the low-rank target matrix is written in a bilinear form: X= UV^T; the algorithm then alternates between finding the best U and the best V. While the overall problem is non-convex, each sub-problem is typically convex and can be solved efficiently. Jain, Netrapalli and Sanghavi have given one of the first guarantees for performance of alternating minimization for both matrix completion and matrix sensing. The alternating minimization algorithm can be viewed as an approximate way to solve the following non-convex problem: \\\\begin{align} & \\\\underset{U, V \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times k}}{\\\\text{min}} & \\\\P_\\\\Omega(UV^T)-P_\\\\Omega(M)\\\\^2_F  \\\\end{align} The AltMinComplete Algorithm proposed by Jain, Netrapalli and Sanghavi is listed here: # Input: observed set \\\\Omega, values P_\\\\Omega(M) # Partition \\\\Omega into 2T+1 subsets \\\\Omega_0,\\\\cdots,\\\\Omega_{2T} with each element of \\\\Omega belonging to one of the \\\\Omega_t with equal probability (sampling with replacement) # \\\\hat{U}^0 = SVD(\\\\frac{1}{p}P_{\\\\Omega_0}(M), k) i.e., top-k left singular vectors of \\\\frac{1}{p}P_{\\\\Omega_0}(M) # Clipping: Set all elements of \\\\hat{U}^0 that have magnitude greater than \\\\frac{2\\\\mu\\\\sqrt{k}}{\\\\sqrt{n}} to zero and orthonormalize the columns of \\\\hat{U}^0 # for t = 0, \\\\cdots, T-1 do # \\\\quad \\\\hat{V}^{t+1}\\\\leftarrow \\\\text{argmin}_{V\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times k}}\\\\P_{\\\\Omega_{t+1}}(\\\\hat{U}V^T-M)\\\\^2_F # \\\\quad \\\\hat{U}^{t+1}\\\\leftarrow \\\\text{argmin}_{U\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{m\\\\times k}}\\\\P_{\\\\Omega_{T+t+1}}(U(\\\\hat{V}^{t+1})^T-M)\\\\^2_F # end for # Return X= \\\\hat{U}^T(\\\\hat{V}^T)^T They showed that by observing \\\\Omega = O((\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_1^*}{\\\\sigma_k^*})^6k^7\\\\log n \\\\log (k \\\\M\\\\_F/\\\\epsilon)) random entries of an incoherent matrix M, AltMinComplete algorithm can recover M in O(\\\\log(1/\\\\epsilon)) steps. In terms of sample complexity (\\\\Omega), theoretically, Alternating Minimization may require a bigger \\\\Omega than Convex Relaxation. However empirically it seems not the case which implies that the sample complexity bounds can be further tightened. In terms of time complexity, they showed that AltMinComplete needs time O(\\\\Omegak^2\\\\log(1/\\\\epsilon)). It is worth noting that, although convex relaxation based methods have rigorous analysis, alternating minimization based algorithms are more successful in practice.  Applications  Several applications of matrix completion are summarized by Cand√®s and Plan as follows: =Collaborative filtering= Collaborative filtering is the task of making automatic predictions about the interests of a user by collecting taste information from many users. Companies like Apple, Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Netflix are trying to predict their user preferences from partial knowledge. In these kind of matrix completion problem, the unknown full matrix is often considered low rank because only a few factors typically contribute to an individual's tastes or preference. =System identification= In control, one would like to fit a discrete-time linear time-invariant state- space model \\\\begin{align} x(t+1)&=Ax(t)+Bu(t) y(t)&=Cx(t)+Du(t) \\\\end{align} to a sequence of inputs u(t) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^m and outputs y(t) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^p, t = 0, \\\\ldots, N. The vector x(t) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n is the state of the system at time t and n is the order of the system model. From the input/output pair, one would like to recover the matrices A,B,C,D and the initial state x(0). This problem can also be viewed as a low-rank matrix completion problem. =Internet of things (IoT) localization= The localization (or global positioning) problem emerges naturally in IoT sensor networks. The problem is to recover the sensor map in Euclidean space from a local or partial set of pairwise distances. Thus it is a matrix completion problem with rank two if the sensors are located in a 2-D plane and three if they are in a 3-D space.

R (2002) Elliptic calderas in the Ethiopian Rift: control of pre-existing structures. Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research. 119:189‚Äì203 Three Silicic phases and then a basalt phase. The most recent basalt phase is dated around 1820. This date corresponds to local legends of the eruption and the lack of vegetation growth on the lava flows provides evidence of this eruption. Geology Kone, also called Gariboldi, is made up of seven nested calderas, lava flows and basaltic cinder cones. (Not to be confused with the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt in Northern America.) There are two fault lines that have caused the volcanic activity within Kone, normal faults, which are part of the Wonji fault belt and ring fractures. The normal faults cause magma to rise inducing the volcanic activity. The ring fractures have caused the calderas collapse. Both of these faults have caused activity within Kone's recent history. The calderas widths can range from 1.5 to 5 km. There are many rock types identified at Kone and they are divided into five main groups, trachytes, comenditic rhyolites, ignimbrites, pumices, syenite inclusions and basalts. Trachytes and comenditic rhyolites form the main volume of the rock in the Complex. The ignimbrites have formed massive green sheets ranging in thickness from 15 cm to 25 m. The pumice deposits over the ground are common within Kone's Volcanic Complex and range in thickness from 50 cm to 20 m. Most of the pumice is found interlocked with the ignimbrites. There have been three basalt lava types identified at Kone,Cole, J.W. (1969) Gariboldi Volcanic Complex, Ethiopia. Bulletin of Volcanology. 33:566‚Äì578 aphyric basalt, olivine basalt and a third basalt which contains large phenocrysts of olivine, augite and plagioclase. These different rock types provide evidence for different eruptive phases. Kone is unusual due to the number of calderas in the Volcanic Complex, Fentale contains only one calderas in comparison. Renaming Satellite image of Kone volcanic complex Kone's name is a recent addition taken from a local tribal word. The historical name of Kone was Gariboldi. Named according to local legend after an engineer who was responsible for building a road through two of the collapsed calderas. Thereby connecting Addis Ababa to Djibouti during the Italian occupation of Ethiopia during the 1940s.

The legal realm is divided broadly into substantive and procedural law. Substantive law is that law which defines the contents of rights and obligations between legal subjects; procedural law regulates how those rights and obligations are enforced. These rules govern how a lawsuit or case may be commenced, and what kind of service of process is required, along with the types of pleadings or statements of case, motions or applications, and orders allowed in civil cases, the timing and manner of depositions and discovery or disclosure, the conduct of trials, the process for judgment, various available remedies, and how the courts and clerks are to function.  Sources  The sources of civil procedure in South Africa are to be found in the Magistrates' Courts ActAct 32 of 1944. and Rules,GN R740 in GG 33487 of 23 August 2010. the Superior Courts Act (which repealed and replaced the Supreme Court Act), the Uniform Rules of Court, jurisprudence, court practice rules and other legislation. Notice ought also to be taken of the Seventeenth Constitutional Amendment Bill.Bill 6 of 2011. Since its establishment in 1985, the Rules Board alone has competence to make rules for courts. = Constitution = The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, as the supreme law of the Republic, provides the overarching framework for civil procedure; the Constitution has been responsible for significant changes to civil procedure since its inception in the 1990s, as in, for example, debt collection matters,Coetzee v Government of the Republic of South Africa; Matiso and Others v Commanding Officer, Port Elizabeth Prison, and Others 1995 (4) SA 631 (CC). access to the courtss 38. and prescription, in particular with respect to litigation against the state. Section 8 applies Chapter 2 of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, to \\"all law\\". Therefore, litigation cannot be conducted without considering section 36 of the Constitution, the limitations clause; and several Chapter 2 rights directly relate to the law of civil procedure: the right to equality before the law (section 9), to freedom and security (12), to property (25), to have access to adequate housing (26), and the right to have access to courts (34).  Courts  = System = The South African court system comprises the lower courts, including indigenous courts, and other judicial and quasi-judicial bodies established by legislation; the superior courts, which the Superior Courts Act defines as the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court of Appeal, and the High Courts; and special courts such as the Small Claims Court, the Labour Court, the Competition Appeal Court, the Tax Courts, the Land Claims Court, and the Electoral Court. Different procedures apply in different courts. There is only a slight distinction between the procedures of the High Court and those in the Magistrate's Court; save where otherwise indicated, it is safe to assume that the form and content of the proceedings is the same. It is important to note, however, that both courts have their own empowering statutes and court rules. The Act, in each case, sets out what kinds of disputes may be heard by each court, and the rules prescribe how the disputes will be brought before court: that is to say, the form of pleadings and time limits.  Magistrate's Court  The magistrate's courts are the lower courts in South Africa. These are so-called \\"creatures of statute\\", governed by and created under the Magistrates' Courts Act, and therefore do not have inherent jurisdiction. This means that they may only hear matters prescribed by the Act. There are two kinds: the district Magistrate's Court and the Regional Magistrate's Court. The Republic of South Africa is divided into magisterial districts and regional divisions, and each has a magistrates' court. The Regional Court was previously only a criminal court; however, since August 2010, it has also had civil jurisdiction. Matters in the magistrate's court are presided over by a magistrate under the leadership of a Chief magistrate. Section 4(3) of the Magistrates' Courts Act provides that all processes issued in a magistrates' court apply throughout the country. In terms of the Seventeenth Constitutional Amendment Bill, the Magistrate's Court would be renamed the \\"Lower Court,\\" and the presiding magistrates known as \\"Judges of the Lower Court,\\" who would be appointed by the Judicial Service Commission. It is anticipated that both the Seventeenth Constitutional Amendment Bill and the Superior Courts Bill will be promulgated in 2012.  High Court  The term \\"High Court\\" is misleading, because it suggests that there is only one, whereas in reality there are many, divided into provincial (CPD, ECD, NCD, TPD, NCP, OPD) and local divisions (WLD, DCLD, SECLD). The High Court enjoys \\"inherent jurisdiction\\", which means that it derives its powers from common law (although statutory law does modify these powers). It is due to this inherent jurisdiction that the High Court may hear any matter, whereas lower courts are more limited. Inherent jurisdiction will be exercised in order to prevent abuse of the law, which ultimately exists to properly facilitate the administration of justice. Inherent jurisdiction was subsumed under section 173 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa: courts now cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond the ambit of the Constitution. Matters in the High Court are presided over by judges under the leadership of the Judge President. Administration is led by the office of the Registrar of the High Court, whose duties are similar to those of the clerk of the court.  Supreme Court of Appeal  The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA), located in Bloemfontein, is the highest court in appeal cases with no constitutional basis. Matters in the SCA are presided over by judges under the leadership of the President of the Supreme Court of Appeal. In terms of the amendments proposed in the Seventeenth Constitutional Amendment Bill, the Constitutional Court would become the highest court in respect of all matters (not just those in which a constitutional point is raised), so that leave to appeal any decision of a high court would be granted directly to the Constitutional Court if this is deemed to be in the interest of justice. The SCA would continue to exist; indeed, its workload would be enhanced, in that it would have to deal also with appeals from courts of similar status to that of a High Court, such as the Competition's Court and the Labour Court.  Constitutional Court  This is the highest court in constitutional matters. It is located in Johannesburg and is presided over by judges under the leadership of the Chief Justice. = Personnel = Owing to the volume of administrative work involved in court matters, each court has a comprehensive system of administration. The key officer in civil matters is the Clerk or Registrar of the Court. This official undertakes such administrative duties as issuing summonses, receiving pleadings, compiling court rolls and keeping records, and also has the task of noting judgments in certain matters. In practice, the roles of Clerk and Registrar are often covered by the same person, who wears different hats depending on whether she administers lower-court or regional-court matters. The sheriff of the court (known formerly as the messenger of court) is a creature of statute, created by the Sheriff's Act,Act 90 of 1986. which came into force in 1990. Her jurisdiction is specific, and her duties are set out in section 14 of the Magistrates' Courts Act and in the Rules. She has the power to deliver and serve court documents and judgments, to execute writs and to conduct arrests. Whereas the clerk or registrar plays a mostly administrative role, the sheriff is charged with more practical matters. Finally, there are legal representatives and presiding officers.  Pre-litigation  A civil dispute may be and usually is divided into three stages: * pre-litigation; * litigation; and * post-litigation. The pre-litigation stage involves certain preliminary enquiries: into, for example, whether there is in fact a case, the kind of action to be taken, the identity of the person against whom it is to be pursued, for how much, by whom, and in which court‚Äîeverything, that is, which must occur prior to the point at which a dispute is actually referred to a court. It may also involve correspondence with an opponent and the sending of a letter of demand. = Cause of action = One of the first questions to be asked is on what basis the claim is founded; what, in other words, is the cause of action? The cause of action is essential in identifying the elements which must be proved to be successful with the claim.Pete et al 2006, p. 3. It is therefore an enquiry into substantive law, assisting in the determination of the appropriate civil procedure to be followed. Examples include breach of contract and damages in delict. The best way to deal with a matter is to identify the cause of action with as much particularity as possible. In the case of breach of contract, for example, one should identify the type of breach, be it misrepresentation or mora debitoris or something else. A set of facts may disclose multiple causes of action: In the case of a motor-vehicle collision in which a breadwinner dies, a claimant may sue both for damage to the vehicle and for loss of support. = Locus standi = Before a party may sue in a court of law, he has to prove that he has title to sue. This is determined by two questions: # whether a particular person or juristic person is the right party to sue; and # whether that person has the ability or capacity to sue.  Grounds  Under the common law, a litigant had title to sue if he could show that he had a direct and substantial interest in the matter. The requirements were as follows: * the plaintiff must have had an adequate interest, not merely a technical one; * the interest must not have been too far removed; * the interest must have been actual, not abstract or academic; and * the interest must have been current, not hypothetical. In actions based on the Bill of Rights, the grounds on which a litigant may have locus standi are listed in section 38, in terms of which the following may litigate: * anyone acting in his own interest;s 38(1)(a). * anyone acting on behalf of another person who cannot act in his own name;s 38(1)(b). * anyone acting as a member of, or in the interest of, a group or a class of persons;s38(1)(c). * anyone acting in the public interest;s 38(1)(d). and * an association acting in the interest of its members.s 38(1)(e).  Capacity  Someone may be the right person to litigate, but he may still lack capacity to sue. Capacity determines a litigant's title not only to sue, but also to be sued. The general rule is that natural and juristic persons have the capacity to sue. There are, however, certain exceptions: * minors; * insane persons; * prodigals; and * insolvents. It is important also to note the special position of the following: * judges; * diplomats; * fugitives from justice; * trusts; and * partnerships.See Pete and Hulme, pp. 14‚Äì37.  Jurisdiction  Once a person has decided what is his cause of action, and who is going to institute the claim, he can determine out of which court to sue. The general principle in jurisdiction is that the plaintiff has the choice, because he is dominus litis. There are various factors which may affect where a case will be heard: * residence; * cause of action; * the place where the dispute arose; * the quantum and nature of the claim; * consent; * location of the property; and * other factors. Very often there will be more than one court with jurisdiction. In such a case the plaintiff may simply choose out of which court to sue. He must ensure, however, that he minimises his own cost. Jurisdiction is dealt with in the Magistrates' Courts Acts 28. and the Supreme Court Act.s 19. = Residence = In terms of section 28 of the Magistrates' Courts Act, a court has jurisdiction over all persons residing within its jurisdiction as well as all property situated within its jurisdiction. It is evident from this section that the court has jurisdiction over the following: * any person who resides, is employed in or carries on business within the district, where \\"person\\" includes the state, body corporate, municipalities, and corporations, and where the key is permanence, so that a person employed for a short period, or visiting a place for a short period, cannot be said to \\"reside\\" there; * any partnership with its business premises in the area, or whose members reside in the district,s 28(1)(b). which allows one, in spite of the common law,See above. to sue a partnership in its name;Eckard's 2005, p. 21. and * any person in respect of proceedings incidental to any action or proceeding instituted in the court by such person himself,s 28(1)(c). which deals with the case where a plaintiff sues out of the wrong court and is met by a counterclaim. The plaintiff in convention can only continue in that wrong court if his claim is incidental‚Äîi.e. arises out of the same facts‚Äîas the original claim.Eckard's 2005, p. 22. = Cause of action = Section 28 also confers jurisdiction over any person, regardless of residence or employment, if the cause of action arose entirely within the jurisdiction of the court.s 28(1)(d). = Where the dispute arose = The court has jurisdiction in terms of section 28 over any party to interpleader proceedings if * the execution creditor and every claimant to the subject matter reside, carry out business or are employed within the area; * the subject matter have been attached by the court; and * all parties consent.s 28(1)(e). Interpleader proceedings occur when one party intervenes in execution proceedings, usually because property attached while in the possession of the other party belongs to him. The interpleader summons is issued therefore to try to prevent the sheriff from selling off property that belongs to the first party. = Quantum and nature of the claim = The district magistrate's court may only hear a matter with a quantum of up to R200,000. The regional court may hear matters with a quantum of up to R400,000. One may not sue for more than these amounts in these courts; nor may one institute a claim whose judgment value is more than these amounts.s 29(1)(a). The court may hear the following cases: * delivery or transfer of immoveable or moveable property; * claims for ejectment;s29(1)(b). * actions for the determination of a right of way;s 29(1)(c). * claims based on liquid documents or mortgage bonds;s 29(1)(d). * actions arising out of a credit agreement;s29(1)(e). * actions arising out of section 16 of the Matrimonial Property Act;s29(1)(f). * actions including application for the liquidation of a close corporation;s 29(1)(g). and * other actions where the quantum is below the stated figure.s 29(1)(h). There are certain matters which cannot be heard in the magistrate's court. These are dealt with in section 46 of the Act and include * matters concerning the validity or interpretation of a will or other testamentary document; * matters in which the status of a person is affected; * matters in which is sought a decree of perpetual silence; and * matters involving specific performance without the alternative of damages, except ** the rendering of an account in which the claim does not exceed the prescribed monetary jurisdiction; and ** delivery or transfer of property, moveable or immoveable, where the value of the property does not exceed the prescribed amount. = Consent = The court has jurisdiction over any defendant who appears and does not object to its jurisdiction. A defendant who fails to object to jurisdiction in his plea is deemed to have consented to jurisdiction. Note, however, that there may be some exceptions,William Spilhaus & Co (MB) (Pty) Ltd v Marx 1963 (4) SA 994 (C). and that such a defendant may only consent to jurisdiction over his person and cannot consent where the court lacks jurisdiction in any event. :) = Location of property = Any person who owns immoveable property situated within the area of jurisdiction of the court, where such action is in respect of that property or a mortgage bond over that property, is subject to the jurisdiction of the court. = Other factors = Section 30bis deals with court orders for the attachment of property or person to found jurisdiction. This usually occurs where the defendant resides outside the Republic and there is another basis for the court's jurisdiction. = Jurisdiction in the High Court = The Constitution, in section 169, permits High Courts to hear any matter save * cases that can be heard only by the Constitutional Court; and * cases which have been assigned by an act of parliament to another court with a status similar to that of the High Court. Otherwise the High Court enjoys jurisdiction over all persons residing and all causes of action arising within its area of jurisdiction. There are three common grounds of jurisdiction in the High Court: # domicile (ratio domicilii); # cause of action (ratione res gestae); and # property situated within the court's area (ratione rei sitae). High Court jurisdiction is founded on the doctrine of effectiveness, which refers to the principle that a claimant must sue out of the court which will be most effective in giving a judgment: that is, the court which is best positioned to enforce the judgment.Pete and Hulme, p. 74. = Demand = In certain cases, a demand is required as a prerequisite for litigation, failing which a cause of action cannot arise and any action instituted will be premature. The rules of substantive law determine whether or not a demand is an essential element of the cause of action; generally speaking, a demand is required in two instances: # to complete a cause of action; and # where legislation requires it. A demand can be made orally or in writing. The purpose of the demand is to inform the prospective defendant/respondent: * that a particular legal representative acts on behalf of the prospective plaintiff/applicant; * about the nature and content of the claim; * that payment or performance is being requested; * about the time period within which action is required; and * about the consequences of failure to comply with the demand in order to convince the person to meet their obligations and thus avoid litigation.  Litigation  Once the pre-litigation issues have been settled, the formal litigation process begins. This stage involves * the exchange of documents; * time limits; * compliance with court rules and procedures; and, finally, * the trial or hearing. In civil procedure, there are two ways to litigate: # action (or summons) proceedings, which are brought by means of a summons; and # application (or motion) proceedings, which are launched by means of notice of motion. If the incorrect form of litigation is used, the court may refuse to hear the case or to hear it in its present form, or may allow it to be heard but penalise the party which used the incorrect form when it issues an order for costs. = Courts = Action proceedings are heard in so-called \\"trial court\\". During the trial, parties endeavour to prove the basic facts formulated in the pleadings, by means of witnesses who appear in person and who provide oral, documentary, or real evidence. These witnesses are examined in chief, cross-examined, and re-examined. After all evidence has been led, argument is addressed to the court on the pleadings and on the evidence, and judgment is then delivered. Application proceedings are heard in so-called \\"motion court\\". There are two main types of applications, opposed applications and unopposed applications. Unopposed applications are more common and often only last a few minutes each, so they make up most of the court's roll. Opposed applications are set down separately for hearing, days in advance, and are heard after the unopposed matters have been dealt with. The applicant and respondent confine themselves to arguing only the issues \\"on the papers\\", meaning that the arguments are limited to legal submissions; the procedure resembles the closing argument stage that normally occurs at the end of a trial action. = Actions = A summons has been defined as \\"a court process in which the defendant is called upon to enter appearance to defend the action within a stipulated time and to answer the claim of the plaintiff, and in which he is warned of the consequences of failure to do so.\\"Eckard's 2005, p. 77. Action proceedings are characterised by a clear distinction between the pleading stage, and the trial and evidence stage.  Pleadings  The pleadings consist of ‚Äò‚Äòprinted or written statements‚Äô‚Äô. Except where a party is appearing in person, he or she does not draft or sign the pleadings; this is done by the legal representative. What follows is a series of documentary exchanges, called pleadings, between the parties akin to a conversation on paper. Each party's legal representative sets out the material facts of their complaint or defence, as the case may be, in summary form. This effectively means that conclusions of fact are pleaded. Because pleadings consist of simple statements and do not disclose evidence, they are not affirmed under oath. The procedure is strictly regulated by the rules of court, not least with respect to the time limits that have to be observed. Failure to comply with the rules of court can be fatal for a case. Once the process of pleading is completed, the action is set down for trial, where the parties will attempt to prove, with evidence, what is averred in the pleadings. = Summons = Summons proceedings are characterised by a clear distinction between the pleading stage and the trial stage. There are three types of summons: # a simple or ordinary summons; # a combined summons; and # a provisional sentence summons. A simple summons is a document which contains the basis (the particulars of the claim) for the plaintiff's action in the body of the summons. The simple summons is the High Court equivalent of the ordinary summons in the Magistrate's Court. A combined summons, on the other hand, has a more detailed and separate document containing the particulars of claim and is annexed to the summons. As a general rule, the simple summons is used where the claim is for a debt or a liquidated demand.See Rule 5(2)(a) of the Magistrates' Courts Act. \\"Liquidated\\" means that it is a claim for a fixed, certain or ascertained amount or thing (Supreme Diamonds (Pty) Ltd v Du Bois Regent Neckwear Manufacturing Co (Pty) Ltd v Ehrke 1979 (3) SA 444 (W)). There are certain matters for which a combined summons is prescribed: for example, in divorce matters.See Rule 19(3) of the Southern Divorce Court Rules. In the High Court, however, it is customary only to use a simple summons when one is certain that it is appropriate to do so. A provisional sentence summons is one whereby a creditor in possession of a liquid document may sue speedily. If the debtor cannot dispute the validity of the liquid document, a provisional judgment will be entered against him. Only once he has paid the judgment debt as security will the debtor be able to enter into the merits of the case. In a recent Constitutional Court decision, it was held that various aspects of the provisional summons procedure were inconsistent with the Constitution. The contents of the summons are set out in Rules 5 and 7 of the Magistrates' Courts Act. Similar provisions are contained in Rule 17 of the Uniform Rules of Court. The summons consists of the following: * a warning; * a form of consent to judgment; * a form of appearance to defend; * a notice drawing attention to section 109 of the Act; * a notice drawing attention to sections 57, 58, 65A and 65D of Act; * the address at which plaintiff will receive service of all process; * a signature; * citations of parties; * averment of jurisdiction; * particulars of Claim; and * a prayer.Eckard's 2005, p. 81. The summons is usually signed by an attorney, or by the plaintiff personally if he is not represented. Once it has been drafted, it must be issued by the clerk of the court or the registrar, who places a stamp on the document and gives it a case number. Rule 10 of the previous court rules provided for the lapsing of a summons after twelve months if service has not taken place by then. No such provision appears in the amended court rules. = Particulars of claim = The rules of court prescribe both the form of the particulars as well as the content. It is only from the particulars that one can see the basis of the action as well as the relief sought. The particulars of claim, then, sets out the facts that give rise to the claim as well as what the plaintiff wants the court to decide. In a simple summons, the particulars appear in abbreviated form, often in one line.For example, \\"The claim is for goods sold and delivered.\\" Prior to the new Magistrates' Court Rules, a defendant who wished to find out more did so by delivering to the plaintiff a request for further particulars in terms of Rule 16 of the Magistrates' Courts Act. No such rule exists in the High Court, and Rule 16 has now also been replaced by Rule 15, which refers to a declaration. The declaration is a separate document in which the Plaintiff must set out his particulars of claim in the same precise manner as he would in a combined summons. Rule 6 of the Magistrates' Courts Act, and Rule 18 of the Uniform Rules, set out the form and content of pleadings in general. With respect to the form, particulars of claim must be divided into separate paragraphs and numbered consecutively with each averment appearing in a separate paragraph.Rule 6(3).Rule 18(3). With regards to the content, it must contain the following: * a heading;Rule 6(2).Rule 18(2). * a statement of the facts on which the claim is based;Rule 6(4).Rule 18(4). * jurisdiction; * a cause of action; and * a prayer. Rule 6 of the new Magistrates' Court Rules and Rule 18 of the High Court have specific rules regarding certain categories of cases, namely * damages; * contractual matters; and * matrimonial matters. Failure to comply with these rules will result in the pleading's being irregular. = Service of the summons = Once the summons has been issued by the registrar or clerk of the court, it may be served. Service of court process is undertaken by the sheriff. In practice, the attorney takes the original summons with any annexures, together with one copy for the defendant (or as many copies as there are defendants) to the sheriff. The sheriff will deliver the document to the defendant. There are prescribed forms of service that are permitted by law. The following general terms apply to the service of documents: * Service must be effected by the specific sheriff appointed to operate in that particular jurisdiction. * Service may not be effected on a Sunday or a public holiday (with some exceptions). * Service must be effected without undue delay. * Any person obstructing the sheriff in the carrying out of his duties is guilty of an offence. On arrival at the defendant's house, the Sheriff hands to the defendant a copy of the process and is required to show him the original and to explain the meaning of the document. The defendant will often sign on the back page of the process to acknowledge receipt thereof. The Sheriff is required then to submit to the attorney a return of service (if he is successful) or a return of non-service (if he is unsuccessful). Rule 9 of the Magistrate's Court, and Rule 4(1)(a) of the High Court, make provision for the methods of service. These include * personal Service; * service upon an agent; * service on another at the residence or place of businessThis term refers to the place at which the defendant is self- employed, not at which he is employed by another (Smith v Smith 1947 (1) SA 474 (W)). of the defendant; * service at the defendant's place of employment; * service at the defendant's domicilium citandi et executandi; * service by affixing; and * service via registered post (which applies only to the Magistrate's Court). Where a party is unable to serve in any of the following conventional ways, the Magistrate's and High Court rules make provision for service via substituted service and edictal citation. The former is where the instituting party applies to the court to grant some other form of service: for example, via newspaper. The latter is frequently used in service of process on a defendant who is resident outside the Republic. = Default judgment = Once the summons, with all annexures, has been served on the defendant, and the required time period for a response has lapsed without such a response, a party can apply for judgment. This is judgment on the basis that the defendant is in default. Default judgment is entered or given in the absence of the party against whom it is made.Eckard's 2005, p. 115. It frequently occurs when a defendant has failed to file his notice of intention to defend, but it can also be entered against the plaintiff. In terms of the rules, default judgment is granted in the following circumstances: * when there is a failure to deliver a notice of intention to defend at all;MC rule 12(1)(a).HC rule 31 (2)(a). * when there is a failure to deliver a notice of intention to defend timeously;MC rule 12.HC rule 31. * when the notice of intention to defend, although delivered, is defective;MC rule 12(2)(a). and * when there is a failure to deliver a plea timeously or at all.MC rule 12(1)(b)(i). The consequences of each depend on which of the above circumstances applies: * In the case of a failure to deliver a notice of intention to defend at all, the plaintiff will only be granted his request for default judgment where the summons is in order and there has been proper service. * Magistrates' Courts Rule 13(5) provides that a late notice of intention to defend will still be effective provided that it is sent before default judgment has been granted. If the notice is sent before judgment is granted, but after request for default judgment has been lodged, the plaintiff is entitled to costs. Rule 19 (5) of the Uniform Rules of court provides for costs to be awarded in a similar situation. * As regards delivery of a defective notice of intention to defend, Rule 12(2)(a) sets out the meaning of the term \\"defective.\\" In this case, the plaintiff is required to give the defendant a chance to rectify the defect within five days, failing which default judgment will not be granted. * As for failure to deliver a plea timeously or at all, there are several circumstances under which a defendant can be in default of a plea. In such case Magistrates' Courts rule 12(1)(b) and High Court rule 31(5)(a) require that the plaintiff afford the defendant a chance to do so by delivering a notice calling on the defendant to file his plea; otherwise he will be barred. This document is called a notice of bar. A request for default judgment must be in writingMC Rule 12(1)(a).HC Rule 31(5)(a). and lodged with the clerk or registrar of the court. The request is sent to the registrar. If the defendant has not filed an appearance to defend, there is no need to send a copy of this request to the defendant. A request thus consists of the following documents: * a request for default judgment; * the original summons; and * a return of service. The request must set out that the papers are in order as well as the grounds on which the request is being brought. Ordinarily a default judgment may be granted administratively. This means the clerk or registrar is permitted to grant the judgment, provided that the papers are in order. In matters where the claim is not for a debt or a liquidated demand, default judgment can only be obtained after either giving oral evidence before court or providing same by way of affidavit.MC rule 12(4). When faced with a request, a magistrate or clerk can do one of the following:MC 12(7).HG rule 31 (5)(b). * grant judgment; * refuse judgment; * call for evidence; * make any other order as he deems fit. = Notice of intention to defend = If the defendant decides to oppose the action as set out in the summons, he is required to deliver a notice setting out his intention within ten days of receipt of the summons (or twenty days in the case of the state). The document sets out the defendant's intention to defend the action, as well as the address at which he will receive all further documents in the proceedings. The appearance should indicate the physical, postal, email and fax number of the defendant, provided that the physical address is within fifteen kilometres (MC) and eight kilometres (HC) of the court house.MC rule 13(3)(a).HC rule 19(3). The document must be signed by the defendant or his legal representative. The notice should also indicate the manner in which the defendant prefers all further pleadings and documents to be exchanged.MC rule 13(3)(b). The notice is delivered to the plaintiff by either physically delivering it to his address, or via registered mail. There is no requirement to send the document through the sheriff. The word \\"deliver\\" entails that a copy of the document is served on the opposite party and the original filed with the clerk of the court.Eckard's 2005, p. 131. In the event of a notice to defend being filed, a plaintiff may, under certain circumstances, file an application for summary judgment. = Further particulars = Prior to the amendment of the MC rules, Rules 15 and 16 made provision for a defendant, requesting further particulars to the cause of action, to clarify any issues in the particulars of claim to plead to the case before him. This rule has now been removed and replaced with one which deals with proving a declaration and further particulars for the purposes of a trial. The High Court rule was also removed many years ago. = Declaration = Should a plaintiff elect to issue a simple summons (HC) or ordinary summons (MC), and the defendant decides to defend the matter by filing his notice of intention to defend, the plaintiff is then obliged to file a declaration. The declaration is similar to the particulars of claim filed in a combined summons and must therefore contain all the essential averments of the cause of action. It will set out in detail the nature of the claim, the conclusions of law that the plaintiff is entitled to make from the facts, and a prayer setting out the relief to be claimed.Rule 15(2). If the plaintiff's claim consists of a number of claims, each claim should be dealt with separately in the details referred to above. Rule 15(1) instructs a plaintiff to deliver the declaration within fifteen days of the date of the receipt of the notice of intention to defend. Should the plaintiff fail to do so, a defendant may, in writing, request the plaintiff to deliver such declaration within five days.Rule 15(3). Should the plaintiff fail to deliver the declaration, the defendant may set the action down for hearing on a further day days' notice to the plaintiff; in the event of the plaintiff's being in default to rectify his default or to appear on the date, the defendant may apply for absolution of the instance or judgment.Rule 15(4). = Defence = Where a defendant is faced with a summons, he has two choices‚Äîeither # to defend on a substantive basis by raising an objection to the merits of the case; or # to defend on a technical basis by objecting to the form and manner of the summons. Where a defence is on the merits, the defendant files a plea; where the defence is on a technicality, the defendant either files an exception or an application to strike out. = Exception = Previously, a defendant in the MC filed an exception where he wished to raise an objection based on one of the following listed grounds: * Summons does not disclose a cause of action.Rule 17(2)(a). * Summons is vague and embarrassing.Rule 17(2)(b) * The pleading does not comply with the rules of court.Rule 17(2)(c). * Summons has not been properly served.Rule 17(2)(d). * The copy of the summons served on the defendant differs substantially from the original.Rule 17(2)(e). All of the above are technical aspects of the summons that are apparent ex facie (on the face of) the document. The amended MC rules only make provision for exception on the first two grounds.MC rule 19. This is brought in line with the HC rules, which provide for exception on the first two grounds.HC rule 23. The rationale of the exception is that a defendant cannot be expected to file his defence if he is prejudiced somehow. The aim of the exception is thus to have the summons dismissed and do away with the action in its entirety. The exception must be raised within 10 days of receipt of the notice of intention to defend. The exception is taken by way of a notice of motion without an affidavit. It sets out the basis of the exception, as exactly which aspect of the summons that the exception is levelled against as well as the grounds for the exception. Where the exception is taken on the grounds that the summons is vague and embarrassing, the defendant is required to state that he has given the plaintiff a chance to rectify the cause of complaint. A prayer appears at the end of the notice of exception in which the defendant requests the court to uphold the exception and dismiss the claim. If an exception is not raised timeously, the defendant may not raise it at a later stage unless he has the leave of the court. The exception may not generally be raised during the trial. Once the notice of exception has been filed on the plaintiff, the exception has to be enrolled for hearing. This is usually done on ten days' notice (MC) and five days' notice (HC). A formal hearing thus proceeds where the party raising the exception (the excipient) has the onus of proof. The excipient must prove not only that the summons is defective but also that he will suffer prejudice if the court does not uphold his exception. If the exception is upheld, the plaintiff may be ordered to rectify his papers or court may dismiss the plaintiff's claim. In such a case, this only amounts to final judgment if the plaintiff does not then apply for leave to amend his papers. If the court dismisses the exception, the defendant is then required to file his plea within ten days. It is important to note the difference between a special plea and an exception. = Application to strike out = The second ground on which an objection can be levelled against a summons is the application to strike out. Previously in the MC, a defendant raised this defence on three grounds:Rule 17(6)(a). * The pleading contained averments that were mutually inconsistent and had not been made in the alternative. * The pleading contained averments that were argumentative, irrelevant and superfluous in nature. * The pleading contained contradictory matter. This section has now been brought in line with the HC rules, which provide for an application to strike out to be brought on the following grounds:MC rule 19(2).HC rule 23(2). * The pleading contains statements that are scandalous, vexatious or irrelevant. * The applicant will be prejudiced in the conduct of his claim or defence if the offending statements are not struck out. The aim of the application is to delete the offending portions of the pleading. The form of the notice of application to strike out is very similar to the notice of exception. The notice points out the grounds on which the application is being made as well the exact section or sections of the pleading against which the application is being brought. The application is then heard in the same way as the exception. = Plea = One way of defending oneself against a claim is to give one's own version of events. This is called the plea. It is the document in which the defendant answers the allegations raised by the plaintiff. The plea is generally delivered within twenty days after delivery of the notice of intention to defend. It is also delivered in other circumstances. In terms of MC Rule 17 and HC Rule 22, when drafting a plea a party must answer every material allegation. Where a party does not deal directly with an allegation, it will be deemed to be admitted. In the plea, a party must * admit the allegations; * deny the allegations; or * confess and avoid the allegations. The plea is contained in one document. = Special plea = Where a party wishes to raise some technical defect about the summons, this is done by filing either an exception or an application to strike out. These defects are those which are apparent on the face of the pleading. A party may, however, wish to raise an objection based on a defect that does not appear from the face of the pleadings, in which case he will raise a special plea. A special plea may be raised on the following listed grounds: * prescription; * lack of jurisdiction; * lis pendens; * locus standi; * res judicata; * settlement; * arbitration; * costs in a previous suit between the same parties still outstanding; and * non-joinder and misjoinder. Where a party fails to raise the above issues, the court assumes that the party condones the other party's failures in those respects. The plea (usually referred to as the plea over the merits) and the special plea appear in the same document. Although a successful special plea has the effect of dismissing the action, it is not frequently set down before the trial. On the trial date, the court will simply deal with the special plea before it proceeds to the plea on the merits. There is no specific reference to a special plea in either the MC rules or the HC rules. It is well established in South African law, though. = Counterclaim = In a plea, a party simply answers the allegations raised by the plaintiff. It frequently occurs, however, that the defendant has a counterclaim. The rules provide that a party may file a counterclaim against the plaintiff. A counterclaim is often called a claim in reconvention. The same rules apply as those in the claim in convention.MC Rule 20. The plea and counterclaim are set out in the same document or in two separate documents, filed and served at the same time. = Replication and the plea in reconvention = After a defendant has filed a plea, the plaintiff may file a replication (or reply) if he wishes to plead new facts in answer to a defendant's plea. If the plaintiff merely denies everything stated by the defendant in his plea, no reply is necessary.MC Rule 21. If a defendant filed a claim in reconvention (called a counterclaim), the plaintiff will be obliged to file a plea to such a counterclaim, which is similar to the defendant's plea to the claim in convention (the plaintiff's claim). = Close of pleadings = Rule 21 (MC) indicates specifically when pleadings are considered closed. This is called litis contestatio, and it means that the litigants have reached finality in regard to all the allegations of fact forming the basis of the claim and defence. Once the pleadings are closed, a plaintiff or defendant may apply for a trial date.  Procedures After Pleading are closed  = Pre-trial pleadings = Various documents are exchanged before the matter is ready to proceed to trial. The three most important are * the discovery of documents;Rule 23 MC. * the pre-trial conference;Rule 25 MC. and * further particulars for the purpose of the trial.Rule 16 MC. Rule 23 (MC) and Rule 35 (HC) deal with the discovery of documents. Both are substantial and indicative of the importance of this step prior to proceeding to trial. Both plaintiff and defendant will normally provide each other with a request to discover. This notice will contain portions consisting of Rule 23 (1), (6) and (11) of the MC, and Rule 35 of the HC. It requests either party to discover‚Äîthat is, set out in a list‚Äîall the documents, correspondence, etc., which they have available, and to make these items available to the other party. A party receiving such a request must respond by filing a discovery affidavitRule 23 (2) (a). within a certain period. On receipt thereof, the receiving party may request copies of any or all documents listed therein. The purpose of discovery is to ensure that an opponent is not caught by surprise at trial. Any document not discovered may normally not be used at trial unless by consent or on application to court. While the issues will have been resolved, to a large extent, prior to the close of pleadings, it may be possible to reach consensus on some further issues that were placed in dispute before the close of pleadings or were not dealt with in the pleadings. This is normally done at a pre trial conference. Rule 25 (MC) and Rule 37 (HC) deal with this question. Rule 37 lists the issues that should be raised at the conference: * the date, place and duration of the conference; * any prejudice; * the settlement proposals; * any aspect to be referred to mediation, etc.; * transfer to another court; * issues in terms of rule 33(4); * admissions; * duty to begin; * agreement regarding producing proof by affidavit; * who is responsible for the copy and preparation of documents; and * documents to be utilised as evidence without duty to prove. Although it is generally thought to be advisable that all these aspects be covered in a pre-trial conference in the magistrate's court, the rule does not specify this. The pre-trial conference is normally attended by the parties' legal representatives. In some courts, the registrar will refuse to award a trial date until the pre-trial conference has been held. While many legal representatives do not take this rule seriously, and merely go through the formalities so as to move to the trial date, this is not recommended. The old Rule 15 and 16 (MC) dealt with the obtaining of further particulars before pleading to the plaintiff's case. Because this rule has been removed, a defendant no longer has the benefit of asking questions to clarify certain aspects of the plaintiff's claim at this early stage of the case. The new Rule 16 (MC) and Rule 21 (HC) have been introduced to assist with this. In terms of Rule 16(2), a party may ask only such further particulars as are strictly necessary to prepare for trial. This must be done at least twenty days before trial. Should a party fail to deliver such particulars timeously or sufficiently, the party so requesting may apply to court * for their delivery; * for the dismissal of the action; or to strike out the defence. The question of an award for costs, because of unnecessary use of the rule, is also considered.Rule 16(5). This is, for various reasons, an important tool. It is recommended that the request be drafted as long as possible before the trial, as failure to comply may result in various interlocutory applications, which may take time. Every effort must be taken to ensure that all these procedures are completed well before the trial date, as a postponement of the trial could have disastrous consequences for both parties. Once the process of pleading is completed, the action goes to trial.  Variation and rescission of judgment  Normally, once the court has given a final order or judgment, the matter is closed. The original court may not revisit the matter; it is functus officio. Under certain exceptional circumstances, however, a court may alter or cancel its judgment. = High Court = Judgments may be varied in two ways in the High Courts: * in terms of their common law; or * in terms of rule 42 of the High Courts Rules. The High Courts have authority at common law to \\"supplement, clarify or correct\\" their own judgments. This would seem to overlap with their inherent jurisdiction to regulate their own proceedings in the interests of justice. Using this power, they have varied their judgments * to include accessory or consequential matters that the court overlooked or failed to grant; * to clarify obscurities or ambiguities or uncertainties in the judgment (although it may not in so doing alter the substance of the judgment or the material findings or outcome of the case); * to correct clerical or arithmetical or other errors; and * to correct, alter or supplement a costs order. Rule 42(1) supplements the common law by providing for certain instances in which the court may, either mero motu or on application by one of the parties, set aside or vary one of its judgments or orders. The element that is more or less common to all the instances of variation or rescission under this rule is that of error. The rule provides for variation in the following instances: * in respect of an order or judgment granted erroneously in the absence of an affected party (as often happens, for example, with default judgments); * in respect of an ambiguity or patent error or omission; and * in respect of an order or judgment granted as a result of a mistake common to the parties. Default judgment may be rescinded in the High Court in the following ways: * in terms of the common law in the case of ** fraud; ** justus error; ** the discovery of new documents; and ** default judgment (if sufficient cause is shown); * in terms of rule 42(1) (just discussed), when there has been an error of some kind; and * in terms of rule 31(2)(b), in respect of default judgments on unliquidated claims in terms of rule 31(2)(a). Default judgments on liquidated claims must be rescinded in terms either of the common law or of rule 42(1). = Magistrate's Court = Section 36 of the Magistrate's Court Act refers to the \\"rescission\\" of a judgment. The expression ‚Äòsetting aside‚Äô of a judgment is, however, often encountered as a synonym and is well established in practice.Eckard's 2005, p. 126. Rescission of a judgment is in issue not only in cases in which default judgment has been granted, but also in cases in which application is made for the rescission of a summary judgment,For an instance in which application was made (without success) to set aside a summary judgment, see Duncan t/a San Sales v Herbor Investments (Pty) Ltd 1974(2) SA 214 (T).In Tlholoe v Maury (Edms) Bpk h/a Franelle Gordyn Boutique 1988 (3) SA 922 (O), the court decided that a summary judgment granted in the absence of the defendant and his legal representative constituted a default judgment which could be rescinded in terms of s 36(a).See also Sundra Hardeware v Mactro Plumbing 1989 (1) SA 474 (T). as well as in cases in which judgment has been granted in the absence of a defendant in terms of rule 60(3), where the defendant has not supplied further particulars requested of him.Cabral v Bank van die Oranje-Vrystaat Bpk 1986 (4) SA 768 (T). Section 36 is similar to High Court rule 42(1), providing that the court may, on application, rescind or vary * any judgment it has granted in the absence of the person against whom it was granted;s 36(1)(a). * any judgment it has granted which was void ab initio or obtained by fraud or mistake common to the parties;s 36(1)(b). and * any judgment in respect of which no appeal lies.s 36(1)(d). While it may not do any of the above in the absence of an application from any person affected by the judgment, it may, mero motu, correct patent errors in any judgment in respect of which no appeal is pending.s 36(1)(c). If a plaintiff in whose favour a default judgment has been granted has agreed in writing that the judgment be rescinded or varied, a court must rescind or vary such judgment on application by any person affected by it.s 36(2). It does not matter, therefore, whether a default judgment has been obtained as a result of the failure of the defendant to enter appearance to defend, or as a result of the failure of the defendant to plead.Meyer v Beyleveld NO & another 1958 (4) SA 539 (T) at 542D. Rule 49 was the subject of extensive amendment in 1997. Earlier cases must be used with caution in the interpretation of the new rule.Grant v Plumbers (Pty) Ltd 1949 (2) SA 470 (O).Silber v Ozen Wholesalers (Pty) Ltd 1954 (2) SA 345 (A).De Witts Auto Body Repairs (Pty) Ltd v Fedgen Insurance Co Ltd 1994 (4) SA 705 (E). In certain important respects, the new rule appears to revise the position as set out in the old cases.Eckard's 2005, p. 127. Apart from applications for the rescission of default judgments, the procedure by means of which a party will make an application for the rescission or variation of a judgment in the Magistrates' Courts is set out in rule 49(7), which requires that such applications be * brought on notice to all parties; and * supported by an affidavit or affidavits setting out the grounds on which the applicant seeks rescission or variation. If the rescission or variation is sought on the ground that the judgment is void ab origine, or was obtained by fraud or mistake, rule 49(8) provides that the application must be served and filed within one year after the applicant first had knowledge of such voidness, fraud or mistake. The most common type of application for rescission, however, is an application for rescission of a default judgment. In terms of rule 49(1), a party seeking to rescind or vary a default judgment has twenty court days, from the date on which the judgment came to his knowledge, to serve and file the application for rescission. Rule 49(2) provides that an applicant is presumed to have had knowledge of the default judgment ten days after the date on which it was granted, unless the applicant proves otherwise. This sub-rule places an onus on the applicant to rebut the presumption and to prove that he has brought the application within the twenty-day period. Notice of the application must be given to all parties to the proceedings. The defendant is required to show good cause why the judgment should be rescinded; alternatively, the court must be satisfied that there is good reason to do so. The court has a discretion in this regard.\\"The court may, upon good cause shown or if it is satisfied that there is good reason to do so, rescind or vary the default judgment on such terms as it may deem fit\\" (rule 49(1)). Emphasis added. The application may be made by any party, or any person affected thereby. The applicant is not necessarily the defendant in default. It may be, for instance, that there has been non-joinder. A person may seek to set aside the judgment because he is materially affected by it. The rule appears to lay down two different but related grounds upon which a court may grant rescission. The first is \\"upon good cause shown;\\" the second is \\"if it is satisfied that there is good reason to do so.\\"Philips t/a Southern Cross Optical v SA Vision Care (Pty) Ltd 2000 (2) SA 1007 (C) at 1013.  Good cause  \\"Good cause\\" has never been properly defined, but it incorporates both an investigation into the existence of a prima facie defence, and whether or not the defendant was in wilful default. In the cases on the previous rule, \\"good cause\\" was held to include * a reasonable explanation for the default; * the existence of a bona fide defence; and * evidence that the application is made bona fide. The first two of these requirements are set out in the new rule 49(3), which provides that the application must be supported by an affidavit setting out the reasons for the defendant's absence or default, and the grounds of the defendant's defence to the claim. It has been argued that \\"the previous case law still applies in regard to this sub-rule, since 'good cause' would only be shown if the explanation was reasonable, and the defence bona fide.\\"Eckard's 2005, p. 127. The requirement of absence of wilful default has become more problematic. Rule 49(4) deals with the situation in which a defendant wishes to rescind the judgment when he does not wish to proceed with the proceedings: that is, when he is prepared to make arrangements to satisfy the judgment. It is in these circumstances that the new sub-rule requires an applicant to show that he or she was not in wilful default and that the judgment was satisfied, or arrangements were made to satisfy the judgment, within a reasonable time after it came to his or her knowledge. \\"Does this mean,\\" asks Torquil Paterson, > that it is only in these circumstances that the absence of wilful default is > a requirement? This matter appears still to be moot. It is submitted that > the absence of wilful default applies to all applications, and that it still > remains part of demonstrating \\"good cause.\\" > It is also submitted that in the circumstances of rule 49(4) the onus of > demonstrating the absence of wilful default will rest on the > applicant.Eckard's 2005, p. 128. With regard to the previous rule, it was held that the onus of demonstrating that the applicant was in wilful default rested on the respondent: \\"Whether this is still the case appears to be moot.\\" Generally, then, rescission may not be granted if the defendant * is in wilful default; and * cannot show a prima facie defence. This means that, to show good cause, the defendant in his affidavit must explain the reasons for his absence or default and show the existence of a prima facie defence as well as satisfy the court that his default was not wilful.Jones and Buckle point out that, while the lack of wilful default is no longer an element in the enquiry in its own right, since the 1997 amendment of this rule, it remains one of the considerations to take into account when the court considers the existence of good cause. See Jones and Buckle, Vol II, The Rules, Rule 49-9.  Good reason  The second possibility is that the applicant may show that there is \\"good reason\\" to rescind the judgment. The court may rescind the judgment, that is, \\"if it is satisfied that there is good reason to do so.\\" Paterson writes that, > while this requirement overlaps with that of 'good cause,' it should be > given an independent meaning. It is submitted that the ‚Äògood reason‚Äô relates > to a wider discretion than that contained in good cause relating to the > general equities of the situation.Eckard's 2005, p. 128. The prejudice to both parties will be considered together with all the other factors set out above.Mnandi Property Development CC v Beimore Development CC 1999 (4) SA 462 (W) at 466A. Although \\"good reason\\" appears to set a lower standard than the requirements of good cause, it has been held that it does not so much lower the requirements for the applicant as extend the discretion of the magistrate. Where the applicant fails to show good cause, the magistrate may nevertheless grant rescission mero motu, in the interests of justice, if exceptional circumstances warrant it.Wright v Westelike Provinsie Kelders Bpk 2001 (4) SA 1165 (C) at 1181H-1182A.A somewhat different conclusion was reached in Phillips t/a Southern Cross Optical v SA Vision Care (Pty) Ltd 2000 (2) SA 1007 (C) at 1013A-H, where Van Reenen J indicated that the criterion was now \\"less stringent,\\" but these remarks were obiter. A magistrate has a discretion in the case of rescission, and is not obliged to grant it. The defendant's bona fides, whether or not the default was wilful, and the existence of a prima facie defence are all taken into account in exercising that discretion, the most important aspect being that of the existence of a prima fade defence.  Situations  Four different situations may arise: # The defendant is bringing the application to rescind the default judgment and wants to defend the matter.Rule 49(3). This is the most common situation. It may occur, for instance, that for some reason, the defendant did not receive the summons. The next thing he knew the sheriff was at his door telling him that judgment had been taken against him. He consults an attorney, telling him that he has a good defence to the matter and would definitely have entered an appearance to defend if he had known about the summons.Other grounds for rescission may also be brought in terms of rule 49(3), of course, such as the judgment's being void ab origine, in which case the applicant must still comply with the provisions of rule 49(3) by presenting proof of the existence of a valid and bona fide defence to the claim. See Leo Manufacturing CC v Robor Industrial (Pty) Ltd t/a Robor Stewarts & Lloyds 2007 (2) SA 1 (SCA) at 49. In this case the application must be supported by an affidavit, in which must be set out the reasons for the defendant's absence or default. This is where the defendant deals with the aspect of wilful default. The defendant sets out facts to show why he is in default, and must show that the default was not wilful. If any of the three elements discussed previously are absent, the defendant cannot beheld to be in wilful default. The onus of proving wilfulness is on the respondent in the application. The affidavit must also set out the grounds of the defendant's defence to the claim. This is perhaps the most important part of the affidavit. The defendant must set forth allegations of fact which give rise to a defence. He need not deal fully with the merits, but sufficient facts must be alleged to show that a prima facie case exists. # The defendant is bringing the application to rescind the default judgment, but does not wish to defend the proceedings.Rule 49(4). This happens where the defendant would have been happy to pay if he had known about he summons. As soon as he finds out about the judgment he makes arrangements to pay, but by that time he already has a judgment against his name. He now wants to remove the judgment. There is no need to show good cause in this situation, but the defendant must satisfy the court that he was not in wilful default,In this case the absence of wilful default is a specific requirement. and that the judgment was satisfied or arrangements were made to satisfy the judgment within a reasonable time after it came to his knowledge. # The plaintiff agrees in writing that the default judgment be rescinded or varied.Rule 49(5).In Venter v Standard Bank of South Africa [1999] 3 All SA 278 (W), Joffe J was held that this provision was ultra vires the Act (283E). This decision was not followed by Josman and Van Reenen JJ in RFS Catering Supplies v Barnard Bigara Enterprises CC 2002 (1) SA 896 (C). There are therefore competing decisions in different divisions of the High Court. \\"With respect,\\" writes Paterson, \\"the Cape decision is to be preferred\\" (Eckard's 2005, p.128). This will usually be the case where the defendant has paid off the judgment debt and now wants the judgment rescinded so that he can take his name off the list of judgment debtors that credit bureaus might have. As long as a debtor's name appears on the list, he will find it difficult to obtain credit. Either the plaintiff, the defendant or any other person affected by such judgment may make the request for rescission or variation. Note that, until a 2010 amendment to rule 49(5), this was not an official application to court, but a request which would have been dealt with administratively by the court. The rule has now been amended to align with section 36(2) of the Magistrates‚Äô Courts Act, with the result that the word \\"request\\" has been replaced with the word \\"apply.\\" It would therefore seem that the correct procedure is by way of application, rather than a notice dealt with in chambers. In terms of rule 49(5)(b), an application of this nature may be made at any time after the plaintiff has agreed in writing to the rescission or variation of the judgment. Notice of the application must be given to all parties. Written proof of the plaintiff's consent to the rescission must accompany the application. # The application for rescission of the default judgment is being made by a person other than those referred to in 1, 2 or 3 above.Rule 49(6). This is a catch-all clause for rescission of default judgments. The application must be supported by affidavit, and set out the reasons why the applicant seeks rescission of the default judgment. = Summary of rescission of default judgment = In the High Court,Rule 42(1).Rule 31(2)(b). the defendant, seeking rescission of a default judgment, * must not be in wilful default; and * must have a bona fide defence with a prima facie prospect of success. In the Magistrate's Court,s 36.rule 49(1). rescission of a default judgment will be granted * if there is good reason;This makes the discretion of the Magistrate's Court wider than that of the High Court. or * on good cause shown.This is the same test as in the High Court. It is important to note that rescission is not available in respect of provisional sentences or summary judgments. = Applications = Application proceedings, also known as motion proceedings, are based on the exchange of affidavits. The party bringing the application is known as the applicant; the party opposing the application, if any, is known as the respondent. In application proceedings, the equivalent documents to pleadings are called \\"processes\\"; these processes not only formulate the factual dispute but also offer the evidence in support of the factual allegations. Processes are drafted in the form of affidavits, which are written statements sworn under oath or affirmation, and may have extra documents attached as annexures, which further support the evidence adduced. In contrast to summons proceedings, there is no distinction between the pleading stage and the trial stage in application proceedings. In essence, application procedure condenses the action process; the pleadings as well as the evidence are contained in the applications papers which go before the court. Application procedure is therefore reserved for matters in which the court can reach a decision on the documents before it, without resorting to the oral evidence of witnesses because the parties do not dispute the material facts of the case.  Form  An application will generally consist of * a notice of motion; and * one or more supporting affidavits. = Notice of motion = The notice of motion must be in general accordance with Form 2(a) of the First Schedule to the Rules. This form is often referred to as the ‚Äúlong-form notice of motion.‚Äù It serves to inform the court and the respondent that a specific type of application will be made on a specified date, at a specified time at a specified court, and that the legal relief mentioned therein will be requested. = Affidavit = The purpose of an affidavit is to record certain facts under oath, which the court will then consider in determining whether or not to grant the application. There is no standard form prescribed for the affidavit. Its contents will vary widely, depending on Motion court the nature of the specific application. There are certain basic principles which apply to all affidavits. The following information should appear in all supporting affidavits: * the names and addresses of the applicant and the respondent; * the fact that the applicant has locus standi; * the fact that the court has jurisdiction;This must at least be implied by the facts. * the material facts on which the claim is based (facta probanda), as well as the evidence which the deponent wishes to place before the court (facta probantia);The law, however, is not to be set out. and * a request to the court to grant the relief as prayed for in the notice of motion. The affidavit is framed in the first person. The deponent will generally state that its contents are true. If the applicant refers to documentary evidence in the supporting affidavit, such documents must be attached to the affidavit. Being a document containing evidence, the substantive law of evidence applies as much to an affidavit as to viva voce evidence.It is often useful to approach an affidavit in the same way as one would approach the oral evidence of a witness testifying to the facts. Where the applicant refers in the supporting affidavit to communications by other persons, such reference must be affirmed by obtaining confirmatory affidavits from the said persons, and attaching it to the supporting affidavit. Such attachment is necessary in order to comply with the evidentiary rule against hearsay. Only admissible evidence should be contained in the affidavit.  Procedure  The applicant commences proceedings by issuing a notice of motion, which serves to advise the respondent of the applicant's claim and the relief which the applicant seeks. The notice of motion is usually accompanied by a founding affidavit. Sometimes one or more supporting affidavits or relevant documentation are attached to the affidavit. If the application is not opposed, the facts, as set out in the documents, are accepted. The only question that must be answered then is whether a case can be made for granting the requested order. The respondent who wishes to oppose the application must deliver an opposing affidavit (or answering affidavit) in which he answers the allegations of fact contained in the founding affidavit. If necessary, the applicant may then deliver a replying affidavit, in order to address and respond to any allegations contained in the opposing affidavit. Affidavits consist not only of the applicant's affidavit but also of the supporting affidavits of witnesses, and set out the facts of the claim, defence, and all supporting evidence. These are all in the possession of the motion court when the case appears before it. Consequently, on the date of the hearing of the application, the parties‚Äô legal representatives argue \\"on the papers\\". Only in exceptional cases will oral evidence be heard. Magistrates‚Äô Courts do not provide for a general application procedure, and only recognise specific instances in which applications may be brought.Rule 55. In the High Court, however, the application procedure is widely used.Rule 6.  High Court  = General rule = In any claim, the decision to be made up front is whether to proceed by way of action or application procedure. In Room Hire v Jeppe Street Mansions, it was decided that, as a general rule, the choice between the procedures depends on whether a bona fide material dispute of fact should have been anticipated by the party launching the proceedings. When such a dispute is anticipated, a trial action should be instituted; otherwise motion proceedings are permissible in order to avoid the delay and expense involved in trials. It follows, from this general rule, that motion proceedings should not be instituted in respect of * unliquidated claims; * matters in which it is anticipated that a material dispute of fact will arise; or * claims for divorce. Notwithstanding the rule regarding anticipated disputes of fact, there are certain types of proceeding in which applications should always be used: * insolvency proceedings; * where a party seeks urgent relief; or * where legislation so dictates. Between these two extremes, the party suing has the choice between an action and an application; his only limitation in regard to an application is the anticipation of a real dispute on any material question of fact. This principle is valid only for an application for final relief (such as an application for the payment of money, or for the vindication of an article) or for a final interdict. The party suing (the applicant) is dominus litis; he chooses the procedure to be used. It must be appreciated that it is inherently unfair on the respondent to be brought to court in an application * where there are disputes of fact; * when he has the prospect of a final judgment being granted against him; and * when he does not have the opportunity of giving viva voce evidence before a judge who is trained in the art of evaluating that evidence and observing his demeanour. = Disputes of fact = According to the Room Hire case, a dispute of fact might arise in the following situations: * where the respondent denies all the material allegations made by the various deponents on behalf of the applicant, and furnishes positive evidence by deponents or witnesses to the contrary; * \\"confession and avoidance,\\" where the respondent admits the allegations (or evidence) in the applicant's founding or supporting affidavit, but raises other facts which in turn are denied by the applicant; * where the respondent concedes that he has no knowledge of the main facts alleged by the applicant, but denies them and orders the applicant to the proof thereof, and furnishes (or undertakes to furnish) evidence to indicate that the applicant or the applicant's deponents are prejudiced, incredible or otherwise unreliable, and that certain facts upon which the applicant or the deponents rely to prove the main facts are also unreliable; or * where the respondent states that he can lead no evidence himself, or by others, to dispute the truth of the applicant's allegations, but puts the applicant to the proof thereof by oral evidence subject to cross-examination. = Resolving a dispute of fact = Bearing in mind the disadvantage to which the respondent is put in an application for final relief, a court is not permitted, where there are genuine disputes of fact on material issues, to decide the matter on a mere balance of probabilities, as would be done in an action. The test is more stringent: The applicant will only succeed if the facts as stated by the respondent, together with those facts in the applicant's affidavit which have been admitted by the respondent, justify the order sought. The matter is therefore decided essentially on the respondent's version. A court will not permit a respondent to defeat the applicant's application by a mere denial in general terms. In suitable cases, it will adopt a ‚Äúrobust, common sense approach‚Äù to disputes of fact. Where, however, the court is unable to decide the application on the papers, generally there are three avenues open to it: # HCR 6(5)(g) provides that, where an application cannot properly be decided on affidavit, a motion court may dismiss the application or make such an order as is necessary to ensure a just and expeditious decision. # The court may direct that oral evidence be heard on specified issues with a view to resolving any dispute of fact. To that end, it may order any deponent to appear personally, or grant leave for the deponent or any witness. # It may refer the matter to trial with appropriate directions as to pleadings or the definition of issues.  Dismissal of the application  If it appears that the applicant must reasonably have foreseen that a material dispute of fact would arise at the time the application was brought, but the applicant nevertheless proceeded by way of application, the court may dismiss the application with costs. This is perhaps the most drastic course of action open to the court. Even in such a circumstance, the court is not obliged to dismiss the application. It has a discretion to decide on one of the other steps mentioned below, and in addition to penalise the applicant with a costs order.  Presentation of oral evidence  In terms of HCR 6(5)(g), the court may order that oral evidence be heard to decide a specific factual dispute. This procedure is applicable only where the dispute is of limited or narrow scope, not where it is extensive and complicated. If the court is of the opinion that it is proper to hear oral evidence in terms of HCR 6(5)(g), the court may determine which persons to call as witnesses; it may also determine the issues in respect of which oral evidence must be presented. Apart from calling the deponents of the affidavits to give oral evidence, the court may also order that any other person be called as a witness.  Referral to trial  If the factual dispute is extensive or complicated, the court may refer the matter to trial. The result is that the application is converted into a trial action, where oral evidence may be led. The court may give such direction regarding the pleadings and the determination of the issues as it deems proper. For example, the court may order that the notice of motion serve as a summons, and that other pleadings be delivered. The matter will proceed as if it had been started as an action. The affidavits here will play no role in the ultimate decision, other than perhaps with regard to credibility. The customary order made when referring an application to trial would typically read as follows: # The application is referred to trial. # The notice of motion shall stand as a simple summons. # The notice of intention to oppose shall stand as a notice of intention to defend. # The applicant shall deliver a declaration within twenty days of this order. # Thereafter the rules relating to actions shall apply. # The costs to date shall be reserved for determination by the trial court (or shall be paid by the applicant). = Notice to respondent = It is a fundamental policy that the respondent ought to be afforded the opportunity of placing his version before the court, and of being heard. Therefore, unless there are exceptional circumstances, the notice of motion and the founding affidavit (together with all annexures) must be served on the respondent in the manner provided for in the Rules. There are exceptions to this general rule.  Exceptions to the general rules  = Form of notice of motion =  Petitions  Rule 6(1) refers to petitions; reference thereto is also to be found in legislation. Petitions were abolished by the Petition Proceedings Replacement Act.Act 35 of 1976. For practical purposes they exist only as the form used for applications in the Supreme Court of Appeal. Petitions are written in the third person: ‚ÄúYour petitioner respectfully submits that he...‚Äù  Ex parte applications  An ex parte or unilateral application is an application in which the applicant is the only party before the court. As a rule, in fact, when only one person is before the court as a litigant, the application procedure is always appropriate, as the possibility of a dispute of fact does not exist. The ex parte application may be used in the following cases: * when the applicant is the only person with an interest in the case (for example, where application is made for the voluntary surrender of an insolvent estate, or for admission as an attorney or advocate); * when the application is merely a preliminary step in the matter (for example, where application is made to sue by means of substituted service); and * where urgent or immediate relief is required, and where notice to the respondent, and the delay which such notice may occasion, would result in prejudice to the applicant (for example, where the applicant applies to attach a vehicle in the other party's possession which the other party plans to remove from the country). In accordance with the audi alteram partem principle, and as a general rule, justice and fairness demand that the court should not make an order against any person unless the affected person has received proper notice of the legal relief sought. The ex parte application represents a departure from this rule. The courts will examine such an application very carefully, that the interests of affected persons may be properly safeguarded. There are two important principles for ensuring fairness to the party against whom relief is sought in terms of an ex parte application: # The applicant is obliged to observe the utmost good faith in placing all material facts before the court. If the court makes an order pursuant to an ex parte application, and it subsequently emerges that material facts, which might have influenced the decision of the court, were not disclosed, the court has the discretion to set the order aside on the grounds of non-disclosure. This applies irrespective of whether the failure to disclose was mala fide or negligent. # If another person's interests stand to be affected by an order in an ex parte application, the court will not grant a final order without giving the respondent the opportunity to present a defence. The court will merely grant a provisional order with a return date, known as a rule nisi. After the order has been provisionally granted, it is then served on the respondent. The rule nisi calls on the respondent to appear before the court on a certain date to furnish reasons for the provisional order not to be confirmed and made final. The respondent must then deliver an answering affidavit, unless the respondent relies solely on a point of law. The audi alteram partem rule is therefore complied with by affording the affected party the opportunity to state a case on the return day.  Interlocutory applications  Interlocutory applications, and other applications incidental to pending proceedings, are brought on notice (notice here does not mean \\"notice of motion\\"), usually supported by an affidavit. Service of such an application need not be effected by the sheriff; it is usually effected by the attorney's messenger. In practice, Form 2 is adapted for this purpose by reflecting on it both the applicant and the respondent, and by addressing it to both the Registrar and the respondent.  Urgent applications  In certain circumstances, a party may need to obtain relief on an urgent basis; proper compliance with the rules and time limits may not be possible. Consequently, HCR 6(12) provides that the court may dispense with the forms and service provided for in the rules, and may dispose of the matter at such a time and place, and in such manner and in accordance with such procedure (which shall, as far as practicable, be in terms of the rules), as it deems fit. It is important to note that, when a matter is urgent, it will always be appropriate to proceed by way of application, at least to obtain temporary relief‚Äîeven though a dispute of fact is anticipated. Luna Meubel v Makin is the leading case on the question of how and when an urgent application may be brought. The court highlighted the requirement in HCR 6(12)(a) that the procedure for an urgent application must, as far as practicable, comply with the rules. The court found that HCR 6(12) does not permit practitioners to select any day of the week, or any time of the day (or night), to demand a hearing. Urgency involves # primarily, the abridgement of time periods prescribed by the rules; and, # secondarily, the departure from established filing and sitting times of the court. The court held that the following factors, listed in ascending order of urgency, must be borne in mind: * When the matter is too urgent for the respondent to be allowed the usual ten court days prescribed by HCR 6(5)(b), from date of service of notice of the application to date of hearing, the ten-day period may be ignored. The application must still be set down for hearing on a motion day; the papers must still be filed with the registrar of the court sufficiently early for it to come onto the following week's motion roll. * Only if the matter is so urgent that the applicant cannot set the matter down for hearing on the court's weekly motion day, and give the registrar the prescribed period of notice of the hearing, may the applicant set the matter down for hearing on the next motion day while giving the registrar a shorter period of notice. * The matter may be set down for hearing on the next court day only if the urgency is such that the applicant dare not wait even for the next motion day. It must be set down at the normal time of 10:00, or for the same day if the court has not yet adjourned. * Only if, once the court has adjourned for the day, the applicant cannot possibly wait for the hearing until the next court day, at the normal time at which the court sits, may the matter be set down forthwith for hearing at any reasonably convenient time, in consultation with the registrar‚Äîeven if that is at night or during a weekend. The court explained that practitioners should carefully analyse the facts of each case to determine, for the purposes of setting the case down for hearing, whether a greater or lesser degree of relaxation of the rules is required. The degree of relaxation should not be greater than the exigency of the case demands; it must be commensurate therewith. The applicant must make out a case in the founding affidavit to justify the particular extent of the departure from the norm. = Application notwithstanding existence of factual dispute = Notwithstanding a factual dispute, foreseen or foreseeable, the situation may demand that the applicant be afforded urgent relief in the face of a factual dispute. For example, an applicant whose life is threatened may approach a court for an interim interdict restraining the respondent from assaulting him, despite the fact that the applicant foresees that the respondent in an answering affidavit will deny having made the threat. The relief sought in such a case is not final, but merely interim. It may be corrected or reversed at a later stage, and is invariably granted pendente lite. For this reason, the test is not as stringent as when final relief is sought; in fact, it favours the applicant. There are other examples of applications which do not claim final relief, such as applications for rescission and provisional sentence. It is not, then, for every case in which a factual dispute arises that motion proceedings are excluded. = Notice and service = Although the general rule requires that notice of an application be given to the respondent, there may be exceptional circumstances where notice will thwart the object of the application. An applicant may contend, for example, that the respondent is in wrongful possession of the applicant's motor vehicle, and has threatened to destroy it in the event of the applicant's proceeding to court for its recovery. In such a case, the applicant would contend that, having received notice of the application, the respondent might very well destroy or dispose of the vehicle without a trace, prior to the applicant's obtaining an order from the court for the return of the vehicle. The applicant will accordingly seek an order on an interim basis, directing that, pending the determination of the application, the vehicle be preserved. There are instances, then, where the circumstances may justify the court in dispensing with service.  Appointment of curator  If it is suspected that a person may be of unsound mind, and as such incapable of managing his own affairs, proceedings may be instituted for a declaration by the court to that effect, and for the appointment of curators to his person and property (curator personae). The court may also on application declare a person to be a prodigal, and appoint a curator to his estate (curator bonis). There are three main classes or categories of persons who must be assisted by curators ad litem in actions or proceedings brought by or against them: # lunatics (including any persons who, by reason of mental disability or disorder, cannot manage his own affairs); # minors who have no guardians; and # interdicted or declared prodigals. = Persons of unsound mind =  Who may institute proceedings?  Proceedings are initiated by application to court by any person (a relative, for example, or a guardian; in certain circumstances, a friend) who has locus standi and an interest in the matter. The State may bring an application for reimbursement of future expenses incurred in the maintenance of a person who is detained in a public asylum.  When application to court for appointment of a curator is unnecessary  If a person is incapable of managing his own affairs, and the estimated value of his property does not exceed R100,000, a judge may, on application, appoint a curator bonis. The Administration of Estates Act lays down that the Master may, by notice published in the Gazette, call upon the relatives of the person concerned to attend before him for the purpose of recommending the appointment as curator of a person or any number of specified persons. The notice may be dispensed with if the value of the property does not exceed R5,000.  When court proceedings must be instituted  If proceedings are initiated under the Mental Health Act, application must be made to the provincial or local division of the Supreme Court with jurisdiction. If the application is made under the common law, application may be made to the court in whose area of jurisdiction the patient was domiciled, at the time of his becoming mentally ill.  How proceedings must be initiated  Rule 57(1) provides that any person who desires to make an application to the court for an order declaring another person (‚Äúthe patient‚Äù) to be of an unsound mind, and as such incapable of managing his own affairs, and appointing a curator to the person or property of the patient, must in the first instance apply to court for the appointment of a curator ad litem to the patient. The rule shows clearly that the appointment of such curator is aimed at a declaratory order. It is the request for this order which distinguishes the procedure from that under the common law, where the person concerned suffers from a physical disability only. An application to court for the appointment of a curator ad litem to a patient must be brought ex parte, and must set forth fully * the grounds on which the applicant claims locus standi to make the application; * the grounds on which the court is alleged to have jurisdiction; * the patient's age and sex, full particulars of his means, and information as to his general state of physical health; * the relationship (if any) between the patient and the application, and the duration and intimacy of their association (if any); * the facts and circumstances relied upon to show that the patient is of unsound mind and incapable of managing his affairs; and * the name, occupation and address of the respective persons suggested as curators to the patient's person and/or property, and a statement that these persons have been approached and have intimated that, if appointed, they would be willing to act in those capacities. The application must, as far as possible, be supported by the following: # There must be an affidavit by at least one person to whom the patient is well-known, containing such facts and information as are within the deponent's own knowledge concerning the patient's mental condition. If the deponent is related to the patient or has any personal interest in the terms of any order sought, full details of that relationship or interest must be set forth in the affidavit. # There must be affidavits by at least two medical practitioners, one of whom must be an alienist, who have conducted recent examinations of the patient with a view to ascertaining and reporting on his mental condition. The affidavits must state all the facts observed by their opinions in regard to the nature, extent, and probable duration of any mental disorder or defect so observed, and their reasons for those opinions; and whether or not the patient is in their opinion incapable of managing his affairs. The medical practitioners must, as far as possible, be persons unrelated to the patient, and without any personal interest in the terms of any order sought.  Post-litigation  Even though the trial has by now run its course, the dispute is not yet resolved. There are two outstanding issues still to be decided: firstly, the question of enforcement and then that of costs. The legal representatives may still need to execute on the judgment, either by serving documents via the sheriff or by managing the logistical arrangements for payment. They must also settle the issue of the final figure of the legal costs. This involves the winning party drafting a bill of costs, which will be taxed. Only once the judgement debt and costs awarded have been settled‚Äîthat is to say, paid by the losing party‚Äîcan it be said that the matter is over. = Enforcement of judgments = Obtaining judgment in one's favour is not necessarily the final step in the litigation process. In many cases the party against whom the judgment is granted (the ‚Äújudgment debtor‚Äù) will willingly comply with the judgment by, for example, paying an amount of money or performing a specific act in accordance with the terms of the judgment. It may happen, however, that the debtor is recalcitrant and unwilling to comply with a judgment. In such a case, it will be necessary to distinguish between a judgment in terms of which the court orders the judgment debtor to perform some act, known as a judgment ad factum praestandum, and a judgment which orders the judgment debtor to pay a sum of money, known as a judgment ad pecuniam solvendam (like an order to pay damages arising out of a delict). The remedy of the creditor is to follow a process known as ‚Äúexecution,‚Äù which is set out in specific rules of the High Court and Magistrate's Court. Such procedures provide a mechanism by which court orders may be enforced, and ensure the effectiveness and integrity of the process of judicial decision-making. In general terms, the process of execution entails the attachment and sale by public auction, by the sheriff of the court, of the property of the judgment debtor in order to realise money and thereby satisfy a money judgment. The property may be moveable, immovable or incorporeal. This procedure amounts to an individual debt-collecting (execution) procedure, since it can operate effectively only where the debtor has sufficient assets to meet the amount of the judgment debt. If the debtor cannot pay the debt and has no executable assets, the debtor is technically insolvent. In such an instance, creditors will have to revert to other debt- collecting devices, such as an application for the sequestration of the estate of the debtor, in the case of a natural person (as provided by the Insolvency Act), or an application for the liquidation or winding-up of the judgment debtor, in the case of a juristic person (as provided by the Companies Act or the Close Corporation Act). The following requirements must be complied with before it may be said that execution has been levied: * the issue of a valid writ of execution; * the attachment of the judgment debtor's property by the sheriff, unless the debtor pays the amount of the writ and costs; and * the sale by the sheriff, through public auction, of the property attached. An attachment of property is subject to and qualified by the recent Constitutional Court decision in Jaftha v Schoeman, which holds that the attachment process in the Magistrate's Court, specifically section 66, is unconstitutional in so far as it does not provide for judicial supervision over the attachment of immovable property. In particular, the Constitutional Court found that any legal process or measure which removes from persons their pre-existing access to adequate housing is unconstitutional, because it limits unjustifiably the right to housing as defined in section 26(1) of the Constitution. In order to overcome the problem, the Constitutional Court proposes a remedy based on judicial oversight of the execution process: namely, that a magistrate must carefully consider the facts of each case in order to determine (before a writ of attachment in respect to immovable property is issued in terms of section 66) whether the execution will be reasonable and justifiable in the circumstances. In later cases, the effect of the Jaftha decision was considered with regard to execution following default judgment in terms of HCR 31(5), as well as execution of immovable property in the High Court in terms of HCR 45. With regard to HCR 31(5), the SCA held that the Registrar may continue to grant default judgment declaring specially hypothecated immovable property executable in cases where such judgment is applied for based on a debt flowing from the mortgage bond over the property. Although a full bench of the WLD has ruled that the Jaftha case would affect HCR 45(1), and that judicial supervision of this procedure had to be read into this rule, the SCA in Standard Bank v Saunderson found it unnecessary to do so. These decisions will influence future development of the execution process relating to residential property. The procedures described below must be read with the Constitutional Court's remedy in mind. It is important to bear in mind that, where the formalities set out in the HCR and MCR are not complied with, ultimately the sale in execution may be void.  Property that may be attached in execution  The primary principle in execution is that it can be carried out only once judgment is granted, and then only by means of the issue of a warrant of execution. Generally execution takes place first against the defendant's movables, and thereafter against any immovable property.  Movable, immovable and incorporeal property  As a general rule, the judgment creditor is entitled to as much of the property of the judgment debtor as satisfies the judgment, plus costs. The property attached may be either movable property, immovable property or incorporeal property, although the mode of attachment of each is different. Execution will take place first against the debtor's movables, and only thereafter against any immovable property. Therefore, where a writ against the movables of the judgment debtor is issued and served, and insufficient attachable movables are found, the writ must be re-issued against the debtor's immovable property. Immovable property may, however, be declared to be specifically executable at the time of judgment where there is a prayer to that effect. In such a case, the immovable property may be attached in the first instance without the necessity of attempting first to execute against moveable property. This often occurs in the context of provisional-sentence proceedings. The property must belong to the judgment debtor. In the context of movable and immovable property, this means that ownership in the property must vest in the debtor. Therefore, even in circumstances where property has been sold by the debtor to a third party, but ownership has not yet been transferred, because delivery has not yet taken place, the property will still be subject to attachment. Where the ownership in the movable or immovable property vests in the debtor, but a third party has a real right in respect of that property, such as a pledge (in the case of movable property) or a mortgage (in the case of immovable property), as a general rule that property may nevertheless be attached and sold in execution, subject to certain conditions. The third party, however, will have a preferential right to the proceeds. Incorporeal property, whether movable or immovable, may also be attached. Such property may take the form of a lease, a bill of exchange, a promissory note, a bond or other security for the payment of money. It may also take the form of an interest in a partnership, shares in a company, or a member's interest in a close corporation. Any debts which are owed or accruing from a third person to the judgment debtor may be attached and executed upon by way of a garnishee order. In terms of such an order, the third person, known as the ‚Äúgarnishee,‚Äù will be ordered to pay the debt, or part thereof, to the judgment creditor, rather than to the judgment debtor. A specific procedure is laid down for obtaining execution in this manner. Money or bank notes, as a form of moveable property, may also be seized.  Property exempt from attachment and execution  Certain property belonging to the judgment debtor may not be attached and sold in execution. Section 39 of the Supreme Court Act, and section 67 of the Magistrates' Courts Act, which are framed in identical terms, provide that the following items are exempt from attachment and execution: * necessary beds and bedding and wearing apparel of the person against whom execution is levied, or any member of his family; * necessary furniture, other than beds, and household utensils, insofar as they do not exceed in value the amount determined by the Minister; * stock, tools and agricultural implements of a farmer, insofar as they do not exceed in value the amount determined by the Minister; * any food or drink sufficient to meet the needs of such person, and the members of his family, for one month; * tools and implements of trade, insofar as they do not exceed in value the amount determined by the Minister; * professional books, documents or instruments necessarily used by the debtor in his profession, insofar as they do not exceed in value the amount determined by the Minister; and * arms and ammunition of which the debtor, in terms of any law, is required to have possession as part of his equipment. The limit set by the minister is R2,000. The provisos to section 39 of the SCA, and section 67 of the Magistrates' Courts Act, state that the court may, in exceptional circumstances, and on such conditions as it may determine, increase this amount at its discretion. There are certain other limitations. Section 3 of the State Liability Act provides that no execution, attachment or like process shall be issued against a State defendant or respondent in any such action or proceedings, or against any property of the State, but the amount, if any, which may be required to satisfy any judgment or order given or made against the nominal defendant or respondent in any such action or proceedings may be paid out of the National Revenue Fund. Section 2 of the Statutory Pensions Protection Act provides that no pension, right to a pension or any contributions made by any person towards a pension, shall be liable to be attached or subjected to any form of execution under a judgment of a court. On the other hand, section 26(4) of the Maintenance Act provides (notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any law) that any pension, annuity, gratuity or compassionate allowance or other similar benefit shall be liable to be attached or subjected to execution under any warrant of execution. A limitation also exists in terms of the gratuity or benefit paid under the Occupational Diseases and Mines and Works Act, and movable or immovable property purchased with such gratuity or benefit.  Writ or warrant of execution  The first step in the procedure for attachment and execution is the valid issue of a document known in the practice of the High Court as a ‚Äúwrit of execution,‚Äù and in the Magistrate's Court as a ‚Äúwarrant of execution.‚Äù Although the terminology is different, the purpose of the documents is essentially the same. A writ or warrant of execution is issued by the registrar of the High Court or the clerk of the Magistrate's Court. It instructs the sheriff of the court to attach and sell, by public sale, so much of the judgment debtor's property as is necessary to satisfy the judgment debt, plus the costs of the execution process. Thereafter, it is handed to the sheriff to execute. A writ or warrant may be issued only after judgment. It is therefore a prerequisite for the issue of a writ or warrant that there be a judgment against the debtor. In the High Court, there does not appear to be any rule prescribing when, after judgment, a writ may be issued. It would also appear that there is no prerequisite at common law that the creditor should wait a reasonable time after judgment before issuing a writ so as to give the debtor an opportunity to satisfy the judgment. In the Magistrate's Court, the only time requirement appears in MCR 36(7), which provides that a warrant of execution shall not be given before the day following that on which the judgment is given without leave of the court applied for at the time of granting the judgment. = High Court = In the High Court, the form of the writ of execution differs, depending on whether it pertains to movable property or to immovable property: * HCR 45(1) provides that, where the writ pertains to movables, the writ must be as near as possible in accordance with Form 18 of the First Schedule. * Where the writ pertains to immovable property, HCR 46(2) provides that it must be as near as possible in accordance with Form 20 of the First Schedule. The writ must contain a full description of the nature and situation, including the address, of the immovable property, to enable it to be traced and identified by the sheriff. = Magistrate's Court = MCR 36(1) provides that the process for the execution of any judgment for ejectment, the delivery of property (movable or immovable), or the payment of money, shall be by warrant issued and signed by the clerk of the court and addressed to the sheriff. Three different forms of warrant are provided for in Annexure 1. The form of the warrant depends on the type of judgment granted: * Where the court makes an order of ejectment, the warrant will be in accordance with Annexure 1, Form 30. * Where the court makes an order for the delivery of goods, the warrant will be in accordance with Annexure 1, Form 31. * Where the court makes an order for the payment of money, execution shall take place against the property of the debtor; in such a case, the warrant will be in accordance with Annexure 1, Form 32. = Attachment and execution against movables = MCR 41(1)(a) provides that, upon receipt of the warrant, the sheriff must proceed to the home or place of employment of the debtor, and request satisfaction of the writ. With regard to the attachment of the property, certain specific provisions of the rules of the Magistrates' Courts bear mention: * The sheriff must show the original warrant to the debtor, and must leave a copy thereof on the premises. Although this is not specifically provided for in the High Court, the practice there is the same. * Where the sheriff is in doubt as to the validity of any attachment, the sheriff may require the party suing out the process in execution to provide security in the form of indemnification. In particular, security must be granted where the judgment creditor is executing a judgment under circumstances where summons has not been served on the defendant personally, unless the defendant has entered an appearance to defend or the notice of attachment has been given to the debtor personally. The position in the High Court is different: The sheriff will attach the property. Where, however, any claim is made by another person to any property seized, the sheriff will, before taking the property into custody, request the execution creditor to provide indemnity to the sheriff's satisfaction against any loss or damage incurred as a result of the seizure. Where no indemnity is given, the sheriff may follow the interpleader proceedings set out in HCR 58. In such a case, the sheriff will have the rights of an applicant; an execution creditor will have the rights of a claimant. * Even if the property is insufficient to satisfy the debt fully, the sheriff must nevertheless proceed to attach and make an inventory and valuation of those items in part-execution of the warrant. Although this is not specifically provided for in the High Court, the practice is the same; the sheriff will attach property even if it is insufficient to satisfy the judgment in full. * If necessary for purposes of execution of the warrant, the sheriff may open any door on any premises, or of any piece of furniture, even if such opening is refused, and even if there is nobody present representing the judgment debtor. If necessary, the sheriff may use force for such purpose. Although this is not specifically provided for in the High Court, the practice is the same. * As soon as the sheriff has complied with the requirements of MCR 41(1) to (3)‚Äîthat is, by exhibiting the original warrant and making an inventory and valuation of the property to be attached‚Äîthe inventoried goods will be deemed to have been judicially attached. * The sheriff must hand a signed copy of the inventory to the execution debtor, or leave a copy of the inventory on the premises. The inventory must be annexed to a notice of attachment. In the High Court, the practice is not significantly different. After attachment of the items, the sheriff must notify the execution creditor of such attachment by sending the return and the inventory to the execution creditor or his attorney. As a general rule, the sheriff must leave the movable property, other than money, specie or documents, on the premises and in the possession of the execution debtor. The property may be removed in two circumstances: # Where, upon issue of the warrant of execution, the execution creditor or his attorney is able to satisfy the clerk of the court of the desirability of removing the property immediately, the property may be removed. The clerk will endorse the warrant with permission for immediate removal. The attorney will then, when sending the warrant to the sheriff, also send a letter to the sheriff with instructions to remove immediately the articles to be attached. # Where there is no such instruction, the execution creditor or his attorney, after receiving notification of the attachment, may instruct the sheriff in writing either to remove the property to a place of security or leave it upon the premises in the charge and custody of the debtor or another person acting on the sheriff's behalf. In the Magistrate's Court, there is no equivalent to HCR 45(5), which sets out the mechanism by which property attached and inventoried may be left on the premises if the execution debtor, together with some person of sufficient means acting as a surety, undertakes that such property will be produced on the day appointed for the sale. In the Magistrate's Court, the general rule is that property is left on the premises until the sheriff receives an instruction to remove it. An attachment over movables is valid for four months, calculated from the date of attachment. The execution creditor's attorney must obtain a date for sale from the sheriff. The date of the sale must be at least fifteen days after the attachment. The property must be sold at or near the place where it was attached, or to which it has been removed. The property will then be sold by the sheriff through public auction, or with the approval of the magistrate, by an auctioneer or other person so appointed by the sheriff. Thereafter, it is the responsibility of the creditor, after consultation with the sheriff, to prepare a notice of sale, and to send two copies thereof to the sheriff, so that one copy may be affixed to the notice board or door of the court, and the other copy near the place where the sale is to take place. This must be done ten days before the sale. If the sheriff is of the opinion that the items are worth more than R3,000, the sheriff will require the creditor to publish the notice of sale in a local newspaper. The advertisement must be published at least ten days prior to the sale. A copy of the edition of the paper wherein the advertisement is published must be furnished to the sheriff at least one day prior to the sale. On completion of the sale, the sheriff must attach to the return a ‚Äúvendue roll,‚Äù showing details of the property sold, the prices realised, the names and addresses of the purchasers (where known), and an account of the distribution of the proceeds.  Attachment and execution against immovable property  In the case of immovable property, the warrant of execution must be delivered to the sheriff of the district in which the immovable property is situated. The sheriff effects the attachment by serving the notice of attachment and the warrant of execution on * the owner of the property; * the registrar of deeds; * all registered holders of bonds (other than the execution creditor) registered against the property attached; * the occupier of the property, if the property is in the occupation of some person other than the owner; and * the local authority in whose area the property is situated. Unlike the provision in the HCR, which requires service by registered letter addressed to the intended recipient, the MCR require service in the same manner as a summons. The sheriff will then send the original warrant of execution, together with the return of service, to the creditor's attorney. After the attachment, the sheriff must ascertain and record whether the said property is subject to any claim preferent to that of the creditor. If that is the case, the sheriff must notify the creditor of the existence of any such claim. Having received such notification, the creditor is obliged, in terms of section 66(2) of the Magistrates' Courts Act, to cause a notice of the intended sale in execution to be served personally upon the preferent creditor; alternatively, the execution creditor must make application to the Magistrate's Court of the district in which the property is situated in order to obtain a direction as to what steps must be taken to bring the intended sale to the notice of the preferent creditor.The notice must be in accordance with Annexure 1, Form 34. Section 66(2) also provides that no immovable property subject to any preferent claim shall be sold in execution unless * the proceeds of the sale are sufficient to satisfy the claim of such preferent creditor in full; or * the preferent creditor confirms the sale in writing, in which event the preferent creditor shall be deemed to have agreed to accept such proceeds in full settlement of his claim. The sheriff will then set a day and a place for the sale of the property. The date of the sale must be at least a month after the service of the notice of attachment. The sale must take place in front of the courthouse in the district in which the attached property is situated, or at such place as the magistrate may determine. The sale must be by public auction without reserve. The property must, subject to the provisions of section 66(2) of the Magistrates' Courts Act, and to the other conditions of sale, be sold to the highest bidder. Therefore, unlike the position in the High Court, no reserve price may be stipulated, as preferent creditors are protected by the provisions of section 66(2). It is not necessary for the property to be sold by the sheriff. The execution creditor, or any person having an interest in the proper realisation of the property, may by notice to the sheriff, within fifteen days after attachment, and subject to certain conditions, require that such property be sold by an auctioneer in the ordinary course of business, and may in such notice nominate the auctioneer to be employed. Thereafter, it is the responsibility of the execution creditor to prepare a notice of sale and the conditions of sale. Such a notice of sale must contain * a brief description of the property; * its situation; * the time and place of the sale; and * the material conditions of sale. Thereafter the execution creditor must publish the notice of sale in a newspaper circulating in the district in which the property is situated, as well as in the Government Gazette not less than five days, and not more than fifteen days, before the date of sale. A photocopy of each of the published notices must be furnished to the sheriff as proof of publication. At least ten days prior to the sale, the sheriff must * send, by registered post, a copy of the notice of sale to each judgment creditor who has caused the immovable property to be attached, and to each mortgagee whose address is known; and * affix one copy of the notice of sale on the notice board of the Magistrate's Court of the district in which the property is situated. At least twenty days prior to the sale, the execution creditor prepares the conditions of sale, which must include a condition for payment by the purchaser of any interest due to a preferent creditor from the sale of the property to the date of transfer. The execution creditor will then deliver two copies of the conditions of sale to the sheriff, and one copy to each person entitled to notice of the sale. Any interested party may then apply for a modification of such conditions of sale. After the sale, the sheriff prepares a plan of distribution of the proceeds of the sale. After the property is transferred, and the plan of distribution of the proceeds has lain open for inspection, the necessary pay-outs are made to the creditors in accordance with the plan of distribution. An attachment in respect of immovables is valid for one year from the date of attachment. = Interpleader proceedings = It may happen that a third party, other than a judgment debtor, lays claim to property seized by the sheriff. As has already been explained, the sheriff will proceed with the attachment notwithstanding the fact that a third-party claimant alleges ownership of the property. In such an event, an interpleader may be the most appropriate course of action. In Bernstein v Visser, the court explained that an interpleader is a form of procedure available to a person who is in custody of property to which the custodian lays no claim by right, but to which two or more other persons lay claim. The custodian may, in terms of an interpleader, oblige any two persons laying claim to the property to fight out their claims among themselves, without putting the custodian to the expense and trouble of an action or actions. Although not unique to the execution process, the interpleader occurs most frequently in this context because it provides an obvious mechanism by which the sheriff as custodian, who has seized or is about to seize property as part of the execution process, is spared the risk of becoming involved in conflicting claims which may potentially arise in the exercise of his statutory duty. When considering the relevant rules of the High Court, and the appropriate section and rules of the Magistrate's Court, one should not lose sight of the fact that interpleader proceedings may occur in a context other than execution. In the High Court, interpleader proceedings are dealt with in terms of HCR 58, and in the Magistrate's Court in terms of section 69 of the Magistrates' Courts Act, read with MCR 39 and 44. Although the form of process is slightly different, the procedure is similar. = Magistrates' Courts = Where a third-party claimant lays claim to property attached or about to be attached by the sheriff, or to any proceeds of property so attached and sold in execution, the sheriff must give notice of such claim to the execution creditor. The execution creditor has ten days after the receipt of the notice in which to admit the claim, in which event the execution creditor will not be liable for any costs, fees or expenses afterwards incurred, and the sheriff may withdraw from possession of the property concerned. Where the execution creditor does not admit the claim, the sheriff must sue out an interpleader summons in terms of section 69 of the Magistrates' Courts Act, read with MCR 44. Section 69 of the Magistrates' Courts Act makes provision for interpleader proceedings in two different circumstances. Two different forms for interpleader summons are provided for in Annexure 1 to the rules of the Magistrate's Court, in order to provide for each circumstance: # Section 69(1) makes specific provision for interpleader proceedings in the context of property attached or about to be attached in execution under the process of any court. Interpleader summons must be in accordance with Annexure 1, Form 35. # Section 69(2) is the general provision which provides for interpleader proceedings in all other cases where two or more persons make adverse claims to any property in the custody or possession of a third party. In such a case the summons must be in accordance with Annexure 1, Form 36. A similar structure, providing for a specific interpleader process,MCR 44(2). and for a general interpleader process,MCR 44(1). emerges from MCR 44. The former, in MCR 44(2), is the most relevant for present purposes. MCR 44(2) provides that, where the third-party claimant makes a claim in respect of property attached by the sheriff, and the execution creditor has not admitted the claim within the ten-day period referred to above, the sheriff must sue out an interpleader summons in the prescribed form, calling on the third-party claimant and the execution creditor to appear on the date specified in the summons, to have the claim adjudicated upon. The third-party claimant must, not less than ten days before the date of the hearing specified in the summons, lodge with the sheriff an affidavit in triplicate, setting forth the particulars of the claim and the grounds thereof. The sheriff will then forward a copy of the affidavit to the execution creditor, and another copy to the execution debtor. On the date of the hearing, the parties must appear in court. The court will adjudicate the dispute between the claimants. It may * order the third-party claimant to state, orally or in writing, on oath or otherwise (as the court may deem expedient), the nature and particulars of the claim; * order that the matters in issue be tried on a day to be appointed for that purpose; or * try the matters in dispute in a summary manner. Where the matter is tried, the normal rules of a trial action apply. The court may make such order as to any additional expenses of execution occasioned by the claim, and for payment of costs incurred by the application or sheriff, as may be just. If a third-party claimant fails to appear in court on the stipulated day, or fails to deliver an affidavit in the stipulated time, or within such further period as the court may allow, or appears but fails to comply with any order made by the court after an appearance, the court may make an order barring the third party from making any further claim in respect of the subject matter of the dispute. From a practical point of view, it is usually advisable to proceed by way of the interpleader. When in doubt, however, it might be best to proceed instead with a section 65 procedure. = Debt collection = The decision of Coetzee v Government declared the imprisonment provisions in section 65 of the MCA to be unconstitutional, with effect from September 22, 1995. The Act provides for several means whereby a creditor may exact payment of his debt. The process of execution after gaining a judgment is costly and time-consuming. Because the majority of cases involve the payment of accounts for goods provided, or for services rendered, and for which the defendant has no valid defence, the Act provides in sections 55 to 60 a procedure whereby judgment may be obtained in this kind of instance without first issuing a summons and following the full summons procedure. The Act also provides in section 65 for a procedure whereby debtors may be summonsed before the court to face an inquiry into their failure to pay the debt. Following such an inquiry, the court may issue various orders: * an order to pay the debt in whole or in instalments; * a writ of execution; or * an emoluments-attachment order. Prior to the decision in Coetzee, the sanction for non-compliance on the part of the debtor was imprisonment, which was described as ‚Äúimprisonment for contempt of court.‚Äù Sachs J, in his judgment in Coetzee, described this as a misnomer. This form of imprisonment, when it related to failure to pay or the inability to pay debts, was nothing more than a disguised extension of civil imprisonment for debt, which had been abolished by the Abolition of Civil Imprisonment Act of 1977. Didcott J commented, obiter, that he could see circumstances in which imprisonment for failure to pay a debt could be defended. The decision explicitly does not impugn other provisions which do allow imprisonment for failure to pay debts of certain categories, such as maintenance orders. The decision abolished the committal procedure of section 65 as being contrary to the right to freedom of the person. It found particularly that the procedure could not be defended as a justifiable limitation on that right, because the provisions were unreasonable on the grounds of ‚Äúoverbreadth.‚Äù The court held that the committal procedure was separable from the remainder of the section, and that, therefore, only references to the committal procedure were excised from the section. The result of Coetzee is that the procedure of section 65 has had its teeth drawn. What remains is the inquiry into the financial status of the debtor and the possibility of orders being made as a result of that inquiry. A creditor will no longer be able to obtain a writ of imprisonment on failure of the debtor to attend such an inquiry. Where a debtor deliberately refuses to co-operate with the courts regarding his refusal to pay a debt, even a proper judgment debt, the creditor who finds that the normal process of execution yields no dividends will have to resort to an administration order in terms of section 74, or to full-scale sequestration. As noted by Sachs J in Coetzee, the small debtor without means will no longer be faced with imprisonment, from which he can only be rescued by family or friends. Further, creditors will no longer be able to extend credit on the basis that the debt can be exacted through fear of imprisonment. Credit should be extended only to those who are creditworthy, and to those who provide proper security.  Recovery of debts in terms of Chapter VIII of the Act  Chapter VIII provides a procedure whereby a creditor may obtain judgment without the issue of a summons. If the debtor admits liability, the creditor may proceed to gain an order against the debtor. If the creditor proceeds by way of summons, and the debtor consents to judgment, certain provisions also provide for obtaining an appropriate judgment. = Section 56 = Section 56 provides that a registered letter of demand may be sent by the attorney acting for a creditor to a debtor who is liable for the payment of the debt (‚Äúany liquidated sum of money due‚Äù) claimed in the letter. Section 56 further provides that, should the debtor pay the debt upon receipt of the letter, the creditor shall be entitled to recover the fees and costs prescribed in the rules for a registered letter of demand, provided that the amount of such fees and costs was stated in the letter of demand. No specific format is prescribed for the letter of demand; this is unlike the position in regard to summons. In terms of section 56, the letter of demand must be sent by registered post by an attorney to the debtor. In terms of rule 4B, the letter must contain particulars of the nature and amount of the claim. = Section 57 = Section 57 provides * that the defendant may admit his liability to the plaintiff; * that he may offer to pay the debt in instalments; and * that he may agree to allow the plaintiff to apply for judgment against him, and for a court order in accordance with his offer to pay the amount due by him in instalments. = Section 58 = In contrast, section 58 provides for an unconditional consent to judgment, coupled with a consent to an order of court for the payment of the debt in instalments. Both * where a defendant admits liability in terms of section 57 and undertakes to pay the debt, in instalments or otherwise; and * where a defendant in terms of section 58 consents to judgment, or to judgment and an order for the payment of the judgment debt in instalments, the defendant may take the steps set out above after he has been summonsed, or after he has received a letter of demand in terms of section 56.  Section 65 procedure  Where there has been judgment for the payment of a sum of money, and the judgment debtor has made a written offer to pay in instalments, and where such offer is accepted by the judgment creditor or his attorney, the judgment creditor may apply to the clerk of the court for an order that the debtor pay such amount in accordance with the offer. Such an order is deemed to be an order for the purpose of launching the following procedures: = Notice to summon debtor to appear before court = The debtor may be summoned to appear before the court if the judgment or order has not been complied with for a period of ten days from * the date on which it was given; * the date on which an instalment became payable; or * the expiry of a period of suspension ordered in terms of section 48(e). The notice calling upon the debtor to appear before the courting chambers must be in a printed form. It must indicate the date of judgment or order, as well as the amount of the judgment and the balance of the capital, interest, costs and collection fees which the defendant has undertaken to pay in terms of section 57(1)(c), and which remains due on the date of issue or reissue of the notice. This notice is supported by an affidavit (or affirmation) by the judgment creditor or a certificate by his attorney in which the following averments are made: * the date of the judgment or the date of the expiry of the period of suspension under section 48(e) of the Act, as the case may be; * that the judgment or order has remained unsatisfied for a period of ten days from the date on which it was given or became payable, or from the expiry of the period of suspension in terms of section 48(e); * in what respect the judgment debtor has failed to comply with the judgment or order referred to in section 65A(1) of the Act, the amount in arrears and outstanding balance on the date on which the notice is issued; * that the judgment debtor has been advised by registered letter of the terms of the judgment, or of the expiry of the period of suspension under section 48(e) of the Act, as the case may be, and of the consequences of his failure to satisfy the judgment, and that a period of ten days has elapsed since the date on which the letter was posted; and * that the court is not barred by the provisions of the National Credit Act from making an order. When the original judgment or order for payment of the judgment debt, referred to in section 65A(1), has been given in any court other than the court of the district in which the inquiry is held, the clerk of the court may not issue the notice calling on the debtor to appear before the court until a certified copy of the judgment has been lodged with him. Any alteration in the notice to the debtor must be initialed by the judgment creditor or his attorney, and by the clerk of the court before issue or reissue. The clerk may not issue the section 65A notice until it is shown, from the minutes of the proceedings, that the debtor was present or represented when judgment was given, or a warrant of execution was served on the debtor personally‚Äîunless the judgment creditor or his attorney demonstrates that the debtor has been notified by registered letter of the terms of the judgment or of the expiry of the period of suspension ordered under section 48(e), and a period of ten days has elapsed since the posting of the letter. A new section 65A(6) provides that, where the court is satisfied that the debtor has knowledge of the notice in section 65A(1), and has failed to appear, or where the debtor fails to appear on a postponement date, or where he has failed to remain in attendance, the court may issue a warrant of arrest to bring the debtor before a competent court to conduct an enquiry in terms of section 65A(1). Section 65A(8) provides that a person so arrested should, as soon as reasonably possible, be brought before the court within the district which that person was arrested. He may be detained at a police station pending the court appearance. Instead of arresting the debtor (but only if the creditor consents), the sheriff may hand the debtor a notice calling upon him to attend court. A willful refusal or failure to appear in terms of a notice in terms of section 65A(1) or (8) constitutes an offence, making the debtor liable to a fine or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding three months. Section65A(10) provides details of the procedure to be followed when the court inquires into the failure of a debtor to attend. Section 65A makes provision throughout for the summonsing of a juristic person, represented by a director or officer. = Procedure when debtor appears before court in camera = When the debtor appears before the court in camera on the return day mentioned in the notice, he gives evidence under oath or affirmation as to his financial position. The court permits examination or cross-examination of the judgment debtor in relation to all matters affecting his financial position and his ability to pay the judgment debt and costs, and also in relation to his failure to do so. The court hears such further evidence as may be adduced (orally or by affidavit, or in such other manner as the court may deem just), and as is material to the determination of the judgment debtor's financial position, his ability to pay the judgment debt and his failure to do so. Witnesses may be summoned for the purpose of giving such evidence. The Act prescribes the factors which the court must take into consideration in determining the ability of the debtor to pay the debt due. These factors are * the nature of his income; * the amounts needed by him for his necessary expenses and those of the persons dependent upon him; and * the amount in periodical payments that he is obliged to make in terms of an order of court, agreement or otherwise in respect of his other commitments The court may, in its discretion, refuse to take account of periodical payments that a judgment debtor has undertaken to make in terms of instalment sale transactions for the purchase of goods not exempted from attachment, or goods which, in the opinion of the court, cannot be regarded as household requirements. If, at the hearing, the court is satisfied that the judgment debtor has movable or immovable property which may be attached and sold in order to satisfy the judgment debt, or part of it, the court may * authorise the issuing of a warrant of execution against such movable or immovable property, or such part of it as the court may deem fit; or * authorise the issuing of such a warrant, together with an order for the payment of the judgment debt, in periodical instalments in terms of section 73. If it appears to the court that there is a debt due to the judgment debtor which may be attached in terms of section 72, the court may authorise the attachment of that debt in terms of that section. If it is apparent from the evidence that, after receipt of the notice to appear in court in terms of section 65A(1), the judgment debtor made a written offer to pay the judgment debt in instalments or otherwise, or that the debtor is able to pay the debt in reasonable instalments, the court may order him to pay the judgment debt and costs in specified instalments, and may also authorise the issuing of an emoluments attachment order. The further hearing of the matter is thereupon postponed. The proceedings may again be placed on the roll by the judgment creditor or his attorney by notice delivered or posted at least ten days before the day appointed in such notice for the hearing. The court may in any event postpone the proceedings at any time in the presence of the judgment debtor or, in the case of a juristic person, in the presence of the director or officer of the debtor, to such date as the court may determine. When postponing the proceedings, the court informs the judgment debtor or the director or officer in question of the provisions of section 65E(1)(c), and may order the judgment debtor, etc., to produce such documents as the court may specify at the hearing on the date determined by the court. The court may, in addition, stipulate such conditions as it deems fit. As far as the costs of the appearance at the hearing in chambers are concerned, the rule applies that the judgment debtor will be ordered to pay the costs unless it appears at the hearing that the debtor has made an offer to settle the judgment debt in instalments that the court considers reasonable, or unless it appears that he has notified the judgment creditor that he was not able to make an offer, and the court finds this to be true. If it emerges that the creditor refused the offer, the court may order the judgment creditor to pay those costs, including the loss of wages suffered by the debtor through having to appear in court in connection with the proceedings. The court may suspend, amend or rescind its order. If the debtor or his representative was not present in court at the time the order was made, the judgment creditor or his attorney is obliged to advise him forthwith, by registered post, of the terms of the order and of the consequences of his failure to satisfy it. = Section 65 and administration orders = The court may postpone the hearing in terms of section 65A(1) if the judgment debtor lodges with the court an application for an administration order prior to or at the time of the hearing. If a debtor has not lodged an application for an administration order with the court before or at the time of the hearing of the section 65 proceedings, and it appears at the hearing that the judgment debtor has other debts also, the court considers whether all of the judgment debtor's debts should be treated collectively. If the court is of the opinion that they should be so treated, it may, with a view to granting the administration order, postpone further hearing of the proceedings to a date determined by the court, and order the judgment debtor * to submit to the court a full statement of his affairs; and * to cause a copy of the statement to be delivered to each of his creditors at least three days before the date appointed for the further hearing. If it appears that the judgment debtor's total debts do not exceed R50,000, the court may grant the administration order in respect of his estate, and stay further proceedings, but may grant the judgment creditor the costs already incurred in connection with such proceedings.  Emoluments attachment orders  A distinction must be drawn between a garnishee order and an emoluments attachment order: * A garnishee order is a method used to attach a debt due to the judgment debtor. * An emoluments attachment order is regarded as part of the procedure for the collection of debt. In this instance, the court orders the judgment debtor's employer to make regular monthly deductions from the debtor's salary, and to pay them to the judgment creditor. An emoluments-attachment order will only be granted if * the debtor has consented thereto in writing, or the court has so authorised; or * the judgment creditor has sent a registered letter to the debtor at his last known address, informing him of the judgment debt and the amount outstanding, and that an emoluments attachment order will be issued ten days from the posting of the letter. The judgment creditor must place an affidavit before the court setting out the outstanding amount of the judgment, and how the specific instalment and cash have accumulated from the date of the judgment, and the balance owing. When the judgment creditor issues an emoluments attachment order out of any court other than the one in which the judgment was obtained, a certified copy of the judgment against the debtor must accompany the affidavit. If the court authorises the issuing of an emoluments-attachment order in terms of section 65J(1), the order must be issued in the form prescribed by the rules, and must contain sufficient information, including the identity number, work number or date of birth of the judgment debtor, to enable the garnishee to identify the judgment debtor. The emoluments-attachment order must be signed by the judgment creditor or his attorney, and by the clerk of the court, and served on the garnishee (the employer) by the sheriff in the manner prescribed. The order is executed against the garnishee as if it were a court judgment, subject to the right of the garnishee and the debtor, or any other interested party, to dispute the existence or validity of the order or the correctness of the balance claimed. The deductions are made monthly, commencing at the end of the month following that in which the emoluments attachment order was served upon the garnishee. The garnishee is entitled to commission of up to five per cent of all amounts paid over by him in terms of the order. This commission is deducted from the amount paid to the creditor. If it is shown that the debtor, after satisfaction of the order, will not have sufficient means for his own and his dependants‚Äô maintenance, the court will rescind the order or amend it in such a way as to affect only the balance of the debtor's emoluments over and above such sufficient means. The court may in any event, on good cause shown, suspend or amend or rescind the emoluments attachment order on such conditions as it may deem just. Should the debtor leave the service of the garnishee before the debt has been paid in full, he must forthwith advise the creditor of the name and address of his new employer. The creditor may cause a certified copy of the order to be served on the new employer, together with a certificate specifying the balance outstanding on account of the debt. The new employer is thereupon bound by the order, subject to his right to dispute the existence or validity of the order and the correctness of the balance claimed. Whenever any debtor to whom an emoluments order relates leaves the service of the garnishee before the debt has been paid in full, and becomes self-employed or is employed by someone else, he is, pending the service of the emoluments order upon his new employer, again obliged to comply with the order made by the court in terms of section 65J(1)(a) or (b), which provides in essence that he must pay the debt and costs in specific instalments as set out in the order.  Debt-collecting procedure in regard to certain classes of debtor  = Debtors against whom judgment has been granted in the High Court = Section 65M provides that, where judgment for the payment of money has been given by a division of the High Court, the judgment creditor may file with the clerk of the court a certified copy of that judgment and an affidavit specifying the amount still owing and how it has been arrived at. The judgment then has all the effects of a judgment of that Magistrate's Court, even though the amount of the judgment may exceed the jurisdiction of the court. The procedure generally followed for the collection of debts in the Magistrates‚Äô Courts is thereafter followed in collecting that amount. In terms of section 65M, the debtor is entitled to dispute the correctness of the amount specified in the affidavit. = Juristic persons = Section 65A(1) provides that, where a judgment debtor is a juristic person, either a director or an officer of the juristic person may be called upon as a representative of the juristic person, in his personal capacity, to appear before the court to show cause why he should not be ordered to pay the judgment debt in instalments. Wherever the legislation alludes to a ‚Äújudgment debtor,‚Äù it refers also to the director or officer of the juristic person. For all practical purposes, the juristic person is placed in the same position with regard to section 65 proceedings as a debtor who is a natural person. The court may, at the request of the debtor, at any stage of the proceedings, if the director or officer ceases to be a director or officer of the juristic person, or absconds, replace the director or officer with any other person who at the time of the replacement is a director or officer of the juristic person; the proceedings then continue as if there has been no replacement.  Administration orders  In terms of section 74 of the MCA, an application for an administration order is described as a modified form of insolvency proceedings, and provides for debt relief for debtors whose debts amount to less than R50,000. In principle the procedure provides for a rescheduling of a debtor's debt without sequestrating the debtor's estate. In terms of this order, a court will assist the debtor by appointing an administrator to take control of the debtor's financial affairs, and to manage the payment of debts due to creditors. In terms of the order, the debtor has an obligation to make regular payments to the administrator. After deducting necessary expenses and a specified remuneration determined by tariff, the administrator will in turn make a regular distribution in weekly or monthly instalments, or otherwise out of such received payments to all creditors. = Application for administration order = In terms of section 74(1)(a), where a debtor possesses a regular income, and where the burden of debt is reasonably manageable, the debtor may obtain an administration order from the court of the district in which he resides, carries on business or is employed, in the following circumstances: * where he is unable immediately to satisfy a judgment obtained against him in court; * where no judgment has yet been obtained against the debtor, but he has insufficient cash on hand to meet his financial obligations, and in addition lacks sufficient realisable assets capable of satisfying his debts. Additionally, in terms of section 65I, an administration order may be granted against a debtor who applied for such an order during a section 65 in camera inquiry into the debtor's financial position. The application for an administration order enjoys preference, so the court will suspend the section 65 in camera hearing until the application for an administration order has been disposed of. The procedure for applying for an administration order is based on an application, together with a prescribed statement of affairs, in which the debtor affirms on oath that the names of the creditors and the amounts owed to them, and all other statements or declarations made in the statement, are true. The application is lodged with the clerk and delivered personally, or by registered post, to the creditors at least three calendar days before the hearing. The true basis for the application is that the debtor is unable to pay his debts as they become due. The clerk must, in accordance with the Act, assist an illiterate debtor in preparing the application. In practice, it is usual for an attorney to assist the debtor in preparing the application. = Hearing of the application = The application is heard before a magistrate in a section 65 court, and in the presence of the debtor or an appointed legal representative, as well as the creditors and their respective legal representatives. All the debts listed in the statement of affairs are deemed to be proved, subject to any amendments the court may make, except where a creditor objects to a listed debt, or the court rejects or requires the debt to be substantiated by evidence. Similarly, when the debtor objects to a creditor's claim, the court will require the creditor to prove the claim. The court, or any creditor or legal representative, may question the debtor with regard to * assets and liabilities; * present and future income, including the income of a spouse; * standard of living and the possibility of economising; and * any other relevant matter. = Contents of administration order = The content of an administration order takes a prescribed form. It must set out * that the debtor's estate has been placed under administration; * that an administrator has been appointed; and * the amount the debtor is obliged to pay. The order must specifically state a weekly or monthly amount to be paid over to the administrator by the debtor. This amount is calculated in terms of section 74C(2) by taking into account the difference between the future income of the debtor and certain prescribed ‚Äúnecessary expenses.‚Äù Unless the court or the Act provides otherwise, the cost of the application in terms of section 74(1) becomes a first claim against the moneys controlled by the administrator. In futuro debts‚Äîthat is to say, debts which become due and payable in the future, including mortgage bonds and assets subject to credit agreements‚Äîare excluded from the administration order. This means that the court will exclude a certain amount of money from the weekly or monthly payments made to the administrator for the purpose of allowing the debtor to make periodical payments in terms of a credit instalment sale agreement or existing maintenance or mortgage-bond obligations. Where the administration order provides for the payment of instalments out of future income, the court shall authorise the issue of an emoluments or garnishee attachment order to facilitate payments by the debtor. = Costs = The term ‚Äúlegal costs‚Äù refers to the costs that are payable in respect of the fees of any legal practitioner who has acted on behalf of a party, and any expenses incurred in respect of such items as telephone calls, faxes, photocopies or payments to the sheriff of the court for service of a document. These costs are payable by a client to his attorney * in terms of an account rendered by the attorney to the client; or * in terms of an agreement between the two. Each party is responsible to its own attorney for payment of the attorney's fees, and for payment of monies disbursed by the attorney on behalf of the client, including the fees of any advocate who may have been briefed in the matter‚Äîirrespective of whether the client won or lost the case. In civil matters, each party usually claims an order for recovery from the other party of the costs paid to his own attorney. Therefore, in almost every civil matter, the court is required, when granting judgment, to consider * whether an order in respect of costs should be made; and, * if so, what the order should be. As a result of the Contingency Fees Act, it is now possible for attorneys to charge on a contingency basis. The attorney and client may agree that the attorney will charge the client only if he succeeds in the case. If the client loses, he is not charged for fees by his own attorney. Owing to the risk involved, the Act allows the attorney to charge a larger amount than he would be entitled to charge if the matter were conducted on a normal basis. In terms of section 83(6) and (7) of the Attorney's Act, a practising attorney may not share his professional fees with anyone other than another practising attorney. The allowance to the other attorney may not, directly or indirectly, exceed a third of the fees charged. An unqualified person may not receive remuneration from a practitioner for work done where he is not permitted by law to carry out such work.  General principles  The court which hears a matter has a wide discretion as to costs, but it is expected that the court will exercise this discretion in accordance with well- established principles. The most important of these principles is that, where a party has been substantially successful in bringing or defending a claim, that party is generally entitled to have a costs order made in his favour against the party who was unsuccessful. This principle is often expressed by the saying that ‚Äúthe costs follow the outcome of the case.‚Äù The result of such an order is that the losing party will have to pay a substantial portion of the costs incurred by the winning party, along with his or her own costs. Other principles which the civil courts frequently apply, in conjunction with this main principle, are * that a successful party may be deprived of costs if there is good reason for this; * that matters which are separate and distinct usually carry their own costs; * that judgment on the merits is usually a prerequisite for a costs order, but that orders made in respect of interlocutory procedures may include an appropriate costs order; * that small or partial successes may carry an appropriate or commensurate award of costs; * that a successful application for the granting of an indulgence does not carry a costs order; * that a party who unnecessarily causes costs must bear those costs; and * that, in exceptional circumstances, a party may be ordered to pay costs on a more punitive scale than would normally have applied (an attorney-and-client scale, for example, instead of party-and-party scale). A party may, in exceptional circumstances, be ordered to pay his counterparty's cost. Such circumstances include fraud, dishonesty, reckless, malicious or frivolous motives and grave misconduct. It is clear from the principles above that equity is an important consideration. In recent years, the Constitutional Court, the Land Claims Court and the Labour Courts have adopted a new principle: that persons should not be deterred from enforcing their rights because they fear that they will have to pay their opponent's costs, on top of their own, if they do not succeed. In Hlatshwayo v Hein, the Land Claims Court held that is does not see itself as being bound to follow the usual approach of the superior courts in awarding costs. It will give due weight to the constitutional obligation to promote the fundamental right of access to the courts in such a way that legitimate litigants will not be deterred, for fear of an adverse costs order, from approaching the court to have disputes settled. In the High Courts and the Magistrates‚Äô Courts, the principle that the loser pays the winner's costs is still applied in almost all cases. In the Constitutional Court, the Land Claims Court and the Labour Courts, judgments are often given with no order as to costs, or with an order that each party should pay its own costs. Rule 41(1) of the Divorce Courts provides that parties to divorce proceedings in these courts should pay their own costs, unless there is good reason for the court to order otherwise. Another well- established principle is that, because the making of an order of costs involves the exercise of a judicial discretion, a court of appeal will not readily interfere with an order of costs made by the court of first instance. In Attorney-General, Eastern Cape v Blom, it was held that the power of interference on appeal is limited to cases * of vitiation by misdirection or irregularity; or * marked by the absence of grounds on which a court, acting reasonably, could have made the order in question. A court may also reconsider an award of costs if the question of costs, or of the particular award, was not argued before it, without the need for the principles of rescission to be applied.  Terminology  = Party-and-party costs = Party-and- party costs are those which are necessarily incurred for the purposes of litigation (charged according to the tariff set out in the Rules of Court). This does not include all costs; only those which were necessary and properly incurred in order to obtain justice and to protect the client's rights. Where a court simply makes an order of costs against one party in favour of another, this is deemed to be a party-and-party order of costs. For example, Cameron institutes a claim against Rodney. The court eventually decides in Cameron's favour. This means that Rodney will have to pay the account of Cameron's attorney in respect of all costs that were necessary in order to obtain justice and to protect Cameron's rights. If Cameron telephoned his attorney to inquire about the progress of the case more often than was reasonably necessary, he will not be able to recover the costs of those telephone calls from Rodney. = Attorney-and-client costs = An attorney-and-client order of costs entitles the party in whose favour it is made to recover more from the opposing party than he would be able to recover on a party-and-party order of costs. In a broad sense, attorney-and-client costs include all costs that the attorney is entitled to recover from the client. In a narrow sense, they include those costs and charges and expenses, between attorney and client, which ordinarily the client cannot recover from the other party. If, for example, a court granted judgment in favour of Armand against Corbin, with costs on the attorney-and-client scale, Armand would be entitled to recover from Corbin all the costs that Armand's attorney would justifiably have been able to recover from Armand. Attorney-and-client orders are often made because the losing party agreed to pay such costs in an agreement prior to litigation. A court may also make an attorney-and-client order to penalise a party which the court believes has acted improperly. = Attorney-and-own-client costs = Attorney-and-own-client costs are the remuneration to which an attorney is entitled, in terms of an agreement or mandate with the client which stipulates that the attorney is to be remunerated according to a predetermined rate (hourly, for example). This order of costs therefore entitles the party in whose favour it is made to recover even more than could be recovered in terms of an attorney-and-client costs award. Magistrates‚Äô Courts are not entitled to grant attorney-and-own-client costs. If a court granted judgment in Debbie's favour, against Margo, with costs on the attorney-and-own-client scale, and Debbie and her attorney agreed that the attorney could charge, for example, an hourly fee for consultations, which is twice as high as that prescribed by the tariff, Margo will have to pay that agreed fee. = Costs de bonis propriis = This is an order that the costs be paid by the attorney, instead of by the client. A court will make this kind of order where it believes that it was the attorney's fault that certain legal costs were incurred. A court may also order costs de bonis propiis against a person who acts in a representative capacity, such as an executor of a deceased estate, or a trustee of an insolvent estate. Such costs are usually granted if there is a substantial deviation from the responsibilities of the person's office‚Äîwhere, for example, the person has acted mala fide, negligently or unreasonably. = Wasted costs = Costs are ‚Äúwasted‚Äù when the services for which those costs are charged are of no use to the parties to the action. Where, for example, a party sets a matter down for trial, and then postpones the matter, the relevant notice of set-down is a useless procedure, and the costs related to it are wasted costs. = Costs reserved = A costs- reserved order entails that the issue of which of the parties is to pay the costs of a particular procedure will be decided at a later stage, usually at the end of the matter, when the court can adjudicate the issue in the light of everything that has occurred in course of the proceedings. The court usually reserves cost for argument and determination by a trial court when the liability for costs of an interim application would be more effectively determined by the trial court. = Costs in the cause = This means that the costs of preliminary or interlocutory proceedings are included in the total costs of the court case. The party who must pay the costs in respect of the main case then also carries the costs of the preliminary or interlocutory procedure in respect of which costs were made costs in the cause. = Costs of the day = This refers to costs occasioned to a party in respect of proceedings that occurred on a specific day, usually wasted costs occasioned by a postponement. = All costs = Such an order refers to party-and- party costs, unless the court indicates otherwise. = No costs order = Where a court expressly indicates ‚Äúno order as to costs,‚Äù each party is liable for its own costs. Where the High Court fails to deal with costs at all, it is not finalised. Any one of the parties may then approach the court for a costs order. Where no order is made as to costs in the Magistrates‚Äô Courts, such costs will be costs in the action.  Taxation of bills of cost  A bill of costs is an itemised account reflecting all the charges, including fees and disbursements, made by an attorney. The fees charged in a party-and-party bill of costs must be in accordance with the tariff of fees and charges set out in the schedule to the Rules of Court. Briefly, a bill of costs should indicate * the date on which the work was done; * the item in respect of which costs are charged (which items must be listed in chronological order, and should be numbered); * the number of folios or pages involved, and the period of time spent in relation to each item; * a precise description of each item; and * fees for each item, charged in accordance with the applicable tariff. The party who has been ordered to pay costs requires the party who is claiming the costs to have the bill taxed by the taxing master of the court. Before a bill of costs may be taxed, the party who has drafted the bill must request a date for taxation from the taxing master. After such a date has been allocated, the party who drafted the bill must send a notice of taxation to the other party, to inform him where and when the taxation will occur. Both parties are entitled to be present at the taxation, and to put argument to the taxing master in favour of or against the charges being taxed. HCR 70(4) provides that the taxing master shall not proceed to the taxation of any bill of costs unless he is satisfied that the party liable to pay has received due notice as to the time and place of such taxation, together with notice that he is entitled to be present. Such notice is not necessary, however, * when the party against whom costs have been awarded has not appeared at the hearing, either in person or through his legal representation; * if the person liable to pay costs has consented in writing to taxation in his absence; or * for the taxation of writ and post-writ bills. In this regard, MCR 33(16) provides that, where costs or expenses are awarded to any party by the court (otherwise than by a judgment in default of the defendant's entry of appearance to defend, or on the defendant's consent to judgment before the time for such appearance has expired), the party to whom such costs or expenses have been awarded must deliver a bill of such costs or expenses. Such party must give at least five days‚Äô notice of taxation for an hour to be fixed, generally or specially, by the clerk of the court, and may include in such bill all payments that have necessarily and properly been made by him. During the taxation, the attorney of the party against whom the costs order was granted, and who is thus liable to pay the account, will bring to the attention of the taxing officer all items that in his opinion should not appear on such account. For example, it may be argued that unnecessary telephone calls were made. The attorney who submitted the bill will then have to furnish reasons to the taxing master why those telephone calls were made, and furnish proof thereof by notes of telephone conversations on file.For this reason, it is important that an attorney keep meticulous records on the client‚Äôs file of all work done. When the taxation of the bill is finalised, the taxing master allocates the amount that is payable in terms of the taxed bill of costs, puts his stamp on it, and signs it. This ‚Äúendorsement‚Äù is known as the taxing master's allocatur. The taxed bill then has the effect of a court order; if the party who is liable for payment of same fails to pay the bill of costs, payment may be enforced by means of a warrant of execution. Review of taxation is provided for by HCR 48 and MCR 35.  Costs and tariffs  = High Court = HCR 67 indicates which fees are payable to the court, while HCR 68 indicates which tariffs are applicable to the sheriff. HCR 69 sets out the maximum fees for advocates on the party-and-party scale in certain matters. HCR 70 provides for taxation, and provides the tariff for fees that may be charged by attorneys. The latter tariff is divided into the following parts: * Part A: consultations, appearances, conferences and inspections * Part B: drafting and drawing * Part C: attendance and perusal * Part D: miscellaneous (including the making of copies, telephone calls and faxes) * Part E: charges in connection with the bill of costs * Part F: execution = Magistrate's Court = In the Magistrate's Court, costs and fees are provided for by sections 80 and 81 of the Magistrates' Courts Act, MCR 33, 34 and 35, as well as the scale of costs and fees contained in Tables A and B of Annexure 2 of the MCRs.  Action versus application proceedings  There are two different forms which proceedings may take: action or trial proceedings and application or motion proceedings. The key difference is that application proceedings are used only where there is no material dispute as to the facts.Room Hire Co (Pty) Ltd v Jeppe Street Mansions (Pty) Ltd 1949 (3) SA 1155 (T). = Application proceedings = Since there is no material dispute of fact, in application proceedings the case proceeds largely on a dispute of law; witnesses are normally not called. Evidence is presented on paper and not viva voce. The case usually involves two legal representatives, who appear before a presiding officer and present their respective arguments based on facts which have already been recorded by either party in an affidavit. Having thus put his version of events on paper, the client need not appear in person. Application proceedings commence with a notice of motion, together with a founding affidavit. Parties to these proceedings are called the applicant and the respondent. = Action proceedings = Action proceedings are trials as we know them. They involve the calling of witnesses, who give their evidence orally before the court. At the end of the case, the legal representatives will sum up the evidence and argue which way the court should decide. There are usually multiple disputes of fact; as such, the court is required to weigh up the evidence and rule as to which version is the more probable. Action proceedings commence with a summons followed by an exchange of pleadings based on the facts. The parties are referred to as the plaintiff and the defendant.  Appeals and reviews  Appeals are based on the grounds that the decision by the trial court was wrong in fact or law. An appeal relates to the substantive correctness of a decision: that is, to findings of fact and law. A review relates to procedural fairness.  Additional procedures  = Settlement =  Offers or tenders to settle during litigation  = High Court = Offers of settlement in the High Courts are covered by rule 34, which distinguishes between two types of claim: * money claims, in which there is an offer, unconditional or without prejudice, of payment of money by the defendant (34(1)); and * performance claims, in which there is a tender, unconditional or without prejudice, of specific performance by the defendant (34(2)). If it made as an \\"offer of compromise\\" without prejudice, and the plaintiff accepts, the whole claim is extinguished. The difference between an \\"unconditional\\" offer or tender, on the one hand, and an offer or tender \\"without prejudice,\\" on the other, may be illustrated as follows: * Unconditional: \\"I admit that I owe you that particular part of your claim and I am prepared to pay it. I deny that I owe you the rest of your claim, and you're welcome to take the risk of suing me for it if you want to.\\" * Without prejudice: \\"I don't think your claim is valid, but I don't want to be tied up in litigation over it. Why not accept partial payment in full and final settlement of your claim, and call it quits?\\" An offer or tender without prejudice may only be brought to the court's attention after judgment if it is relevant to costs. If done earlier, it may result in an adverse costs order against party doing so, even if that party is successful. There is no such prohibition in respect of unconditional offers or tenders. Whether an offer is unconditional or without prejudice can affect the costs award if the court grants judgment in favour of plaintiff for less than the amount of the offer. = Magistrate's Court = Rule 18 of the new Magistrates' Courts Rules has essentially replicated rule 34 of the High Courts Rules. The defendant may make an unconditional payment into the court with an admission of liability, in which case the matter then terminates. The plaintiff is only entitled to costs up to that point. The defendant is not a judgment debtor. Alternatively, the defendant may make a compromise offer of settlement without admission of liability or without prejudice. If the plaintiff rejects this, the defendant can pay amount into the court in \\"final settlement.\\" If the plaintiff does not accept payment, this cannot be disclosed to the court until the end of the trial. If judgment is for less than the amount paid in, the court will order payment to the plaintiff in terms of the award. If judgment is for the defendant, not the plaintiff, the plaintiff must make payment into the court of the defendant's costs since payment. = Tactical considerations = A compromise offer of settlement is a valuable tactical weapon to achieve settlement of the matter. If the plaintiff rejects it, he must be sure that the court will grant judgment for more than the offer, or risk an adverse costs order. = Provisional sentence = This is an extraordinary, hybrid and speedy procedure, whereby a plaintiff in possession of a liquid document may obtain quick judgment against a defendant for the amount payable on the face of a liquid document. The procedure is initiated by means of a summons (as in an action procedure). At the preliminary stage, however, it proceeds by way of affidavits (as in an application procedure), and is converted back into an action procedure only once the defendant enters into the principal case. It is speedy because it allows the plaintiff's claim to be adjudicated upon before trial, and because it accelerates the process of granting judgment (although the judgment at this early stage is merely provisional). The procedure has two advantages for the plaintiff: # As a speedy process, it allows for the prompt recovery of a monetary debt from the defendant. # It places an onus on the defendant at the preliminary sage to establish a defence by satisfying the court, on a balance of probabilities, that the defendant should not be made to pay the amount claimed by the plaintiff, and that the probability of success in the principal case does not favour the plaintiff. The defendant must raise his defence by way of an affidavit, to which the plaintiff may respond with a replying affidavit. A provisional sentence simply entails that the judgment obtained by the plaintiff at this early stage is provisional and cannot prevent the defendant from proceeding to the principal case. The defendant may choose to satisfy the provisional judgment and subsequently, within two months, and by notification to the plaintiff, enter into the principal case. The primary principle behind the provisional-sentence procedure is that the court will grant judgment to the plaintiff on the basis of a presumption of indebtedness, founded on the legal validity of the liquid document before the court. The court is thus provisionally satisfied that the plaintiff will succeed in the principal case. The purpose of a provisional sentence is therefore to bring the proceedings to a speedy end, especially when the defendant does not have a defence to the plaintiff's liquid claim. A provisional sentence must not be confused with a summary judgment. Both are sui generis remedies. Each has its own limited scope of application and specific rules of procedure. Summary judgment may be granted in four situations: # where there is a liquid document; # in claims for ejectment; # in claims for the delivery of specified movable property; and # for liquid amounts of money.  Liquid document  The plaintiff's ability to make use of the provisional-sentence procedure rests on the evidentiary value of the liquid document. On its face, this document must raise a presumption of indebtedness against the defendant. A liquid document has been defined as a written instrument in which the debtor or an authorised agent, by means of a signature appearing on the face of the document, acknowledges an unconditional liability for the payment of a fixed and certain amount of money. The document must speak for itself; the acknowledgement of indebtedness must be so clear and certain on the face (ex facie) of the document that no extrinsic evidence (evidence aliunde) is required to prove the amount.  Procedure  = Commencement = The plaintiff must issue a summons in accordance with Form 3 of the First Schedule to the High Court Rules. The summons must comply with the usual requirements for a summons, in respect of the plaintiff's and the defendant's personal details, and must provide an address for service within eight kilometres of the court. If the plaintiff is legally represented, the summons must be signed by an attorney. Only copies that are true in all material respects are to be attached to the summons; one need not attach the original of the liquid document on which the claim is founded. Provisional sentence may be refused, or the proceedings postponed, if an improper copy is annexed to the summons. The originals are handed to the court at the application hearing. The summons must appoint a day, not less than ten days after the service of the summons, on which the defendant is required to appear in court. When the matter is opposed, it must be set down for a High-Court hearing by the plaintiff before noon on the court day but one preceding the day on which it is to be heard. In the Magistrate's Court, the matter must be set down no later than three days before the day on which it will be heard. The plaintiff may amend a provisional summons in the same way and in terms of the same criteria as any other summons. A provisional-sentence summons contains the following particulars: * an averment calling on the defendant to pay the amount or to appear, personally or with representation, before the court to admit or deny liability; * allowance for the defendant to file an affidavit setting out a defence; * set-down of a day for the defendant's appearance in court; * a clear and sufficient averment setting out the cause of action; * an averment calling on the defendant to admit or deny his or the agent's signature; and * information as to the consequences of a failure to pay the amount claimed, and as to the right to demand security from the plaintiff if the defendant does not pay the claimed amount. = Defendant = The defendant may admit liability for the amount claimed, in which case the court may grant final judgment in favour of the plaintiff. There are two alternative choices available to the defendant should he decide to oppose the matter and deny liability: # The defendant may deliver an opposing affidavit. In the High Court, the affidavit must be delivered not later than noon on the day but one preceding the court day on which the application will be heard; in the Magistrate's Court, not later than three days before the day upon on it will be heard. The affidavit must set out the grounds on which liability is disputed or contain an admission or denial with respect to the personal signature or the authority or signature of the agent on the face of the liquid document. # The defendant may appear in court on the day named in the summons, personally or through a legal representative, and deny liability. = Plaintiff = Should the defendant choose to defend the matter by filing an opposing affidavit, the plaintiff must be afforded a reasonable opportunity of replying thereto. The application for judgment will be postponed, and the plaintiff will be entitled to file a replying affidavit which canvasses all the points raised in the defendant's opposing affidavit. The court may at its discretion, but in exceptional circumstances only, allow for a third set of affidavits. = Onus of proof = The plaintiff and the defendant bear distinct and separate onuses of proof in respect of different issues at the provisional-sentence stage. Initially, the plaintiff need not prove anything; he may prima facie discharge the primary onus by the mere averment in the summons that the plaintiff is the holder of a liquid document bearing the defendant's signature or that of an authorised agent of the defendant. If the defendant disputes the validity of the liquid document, by denying the authenticity of the signature or the agent's signature or authority, or by averring that a simple condition must be fulfilled before payment can take place, the onus lies with the plaintiff to prove, on a balance of probabilities, the validity of the document or the fulfilment of the simple condition. The reason why the onus lies with the plaintiff here is that the plaintiff's right to have provisional sentence granted is founded entirely on the presumption of the authenticity and legal validity of the liquid document. The defendant bears the onus of showing that the probabilities of success in the principal case lie in his or her favour, and that the probability of success in the principal case is against the plaintiff. Even when the defendant raises a defence which is unconnected with the liquid document, the onus remains the same. The defendant's onus must be discharged on the facts set out in his or her affidavit. Unless exceptional circumstances exist, the court will grant provisional sentence. = Hearing = At the hearing, the plaintiff and the defendant, or their legal representatives, adduce arguments before a motion court. These arguments are based on the allegations and averments raised in the summons, the defendant's opposing affidavit and the plaintiff's replying affidavit. The plaintiff delivers to the court the original liquid document on which the action is based and moves for judgment on it. The plaintiff's onus of proving the authenticity of the defendant's signature may be decided on the papers alone, or the court may allow the plaintiff to discharge the onus by calling for oral evidence. The court has the authority to hear oral evidence in respect of the authenticity of the defendant's signature or the agent's signature or authority. The court's authority is limited to these specific instances; it may not call for viva voce evidence of other issues. The court may exercise the power to call for oral evidence only in exceptional circumstances, having regard to the nature and purpose of the provisional-sentence proceeding.  Further procedure when provisional sentence is refused  Provisional sentence will be refused when the plaintiff fails to discharge his onus of proof on a balance of probabilities, or when the defendant succeeds in discharging his onus of convincing the court that the probabilities of success in the principal case are against the plaintiff. The matter is then converted into a trial action, in which the rules of pleading and conduct of a trial will apply. The matter proceeds to trial in the usual way, with the court ordering the provisional summons to stand as a normal summons and the defendant to file a plea within a stated time. It is preferable for the court to order the delivery of a plea by the defendant; otherwise the proceeding may come to an end. During this conversion process, the court has discretion to award such an order as to costs as it may deem just.  Further procedure when provisional sentence is granted  Provisional sentence will be granted when the plaintiff succeeds in discharging his onus of proof on a balance of probabilities, or when the defendant fails to establish a defence on a balance of probabilities. The plaintiff is entitled to immediate payment of the judgment amount and taxed costs. If the defendant does not pay the capital amount, the plaintiff may issue a warrant of execution against the defendant's property. The judgment is only provisional; it does not prevent the defendant from electing to enter into the principal case and obtaining a reversal of the provisional-sentence judgment. A defendant who chooses to proceed to trial may call upon the plaintiff, once the judgment amount has been paid, to furnish security to the satisfaction of the registrar or the clerk. In practice, the parties usually agree that the capital amount due in terms of the judgment will be paid directly to the registrar or clerk by the defendant, to be held as security. The object of the security is to ensure that, should the defendant succeed in the principal case, the defendant will receive repayment of the amount which was paid out in terms of the provisional judgment. A plaintiff who fails to provide security is not entitled to provisional relief; he must proceed to the principal case and request a grant of final judgment. The defendant is not entitled to take any further procedural steps until he has satisfied the provisional judgment or the plaintiff has failed to furnish security when called upon to do so. Any step taken in breach of these rules will be irregular and liable to be set aside. The defendant may select either of the following two procedural options: # The defendant who intends to proceed to trial and enter the principal case must give notice to the plaintiff within two months from the date of the provisional judgment. He must file a plea within ten days of such notice. The provisional summons is subsequently converted into a High-Court combined summons or a Magistrate's-Court ordinary summons, as the case may be. # Alternatively, the defendant may choose not to proceed to trial, either by failing to deliver a notice of intention to enter the principal case, or by failing to file a plea within the required time periods. If the defendant does not request condonation for such a failure, or if the court refuses such condonation, the provisional sentence becomes the final judgment. Security lapses when a provisional judgment becomes final. The court is empowered to extend these time periods despite the fact that the judgment has become final. A stay of execution may be granted in exceptional circumstances; a final judgment may even occasionally be rescinded.  Principal case  The onus of proof is an important principle. It largely determines whether or not the matter will proceed to the principal case. If the court is of the opinion that the probabilities of success are not in favour of either party, or are only in favour of the plaintiff, it is established practice to grant provisional sentence. The reason why a defendant enters into the principal case is normally that the defendant will enjoy the benefit of being able to lead oral evidence without the limitations imposed by a provisional-sentence proceeding, as well as the benefit of cross-examining the plaintiff's witnesses, which benefit is not available in a provisional- sentence proceeding. In addition, the onus of proof at the trial is usually borne by the plaintiff, in terms of the rule that \\"he who makes the averment or asserts the claim must prove it,\\" whereas during the provisional-sentence procedure the onus is on the defendant to satisfy the court that he will succeed in the principal case. The defendant may therefore find that a trial gives him an advantage over the plaintiff. Nevertheless, in practice, few defendants continue to the principal case. The vast majority of provisional- sentence orders therefore become final judgments.  Fairness  See Western Bank v Pretorius and Barclays Western Bank v Pretorius.

Thomas Tredgold (1788‚Äì1829) was an English engineer and author, known for his early work on railroad construction. His definition of civil engineering formed the basis of the charter of the Institution of Civil Engineers.  Biography  He was born at Brandon, County Durham, on 22 August 1788. After some elementary education at the village school, he was apprenticed at 14 to a cabinet-maker in Durham. He remained with him six years, studying also mathematics, architecture, and perspective. In 1808, after his apprenticeship had expired, he went to Scotland, where he worked for five years as a joiner and journeyman carpenter. Later Tredgold went to London, where he entered the office of his uncle William Atkinson the architect, with whom he lived for six years, and whom he served for longer. He read on architecture and engineering; and taught himself French. In 1823, the demands of his writing led Tredgold to resign his position in Atkinson's office. He died on 28 January 1829, and was buried in St. John's Wood chapel cemetery. =Family= Tredgold left a widow, three daughters, and a son Thomas, who held the post of engineer in the office of stamps of the East India Company at Calcutta, where he died on 4 May 1853. Works In 1820, Tredgold published Elementary Principles of Carpentry (London), on making floors, roofs, bridges, and other structures. He appended an essay on the nature and properties of timber. Apart from Peter Barlow's Essay on the Strength of Timber and other Materials in 1817, Tredgold's work was the first serious attempt in England to deal practically and scientifically with the data of resistance; before his time engineers relied mainly on the formul√¶ and results found in Count Buffon and Peter van Musschenbroek's Physic√¶ Experimentales et Geometric√¶ (Leyden, 1729); some of Tredgold's results were taken from Gabriel Pierre Martin Dumont's Parall√®le de plans des plus belles salles de spectacles d'ltalie et de France (Paris, 1767). Several editions of Tredgold's work were published, one by Edward Wyndham Tarn appearing in 1886 (London). This work was followed in 1822 by A Practical Essay on the Strength of Cast Iron and other Metals (London; 5th edit., by Eaton Hodgkinson, London, 1860‚Äì1), which is mainly founded on the work of Thomas Young. Tredgold lacked the mathematics of the theory of elasticity; he was inaccurate, and often obscure. In 1824, Tredgold published Principles of Warming and Ventilating Public Buildings (London), which reached a second edition in the same year (3rd edit., with appendix by Bramah, 1836). In 1825 appeared A Practical Treatise on Railroads and Carriages (London; 2nd edit. London, 1835), which was followed by a pamphlet addressed to William Huskisson as President of the Board of Trade, Remarks on Steam Navigation and its Protection, Regulation, and Encouragement (London, 1825), with suggestions for the prevention of accidents. His last major work, The Steam Engine, appeared in 1827 (London). A new enlarged edition, by Westley Stoker Barker Woolhouse, was published in 1838 (London). James Hann assisted Woodhouse, and a third edition appeared in 1850‚Äì3 (London), with contributions in particular by John Seaward and Edward Woods. A French translation was made by Fran√ßois No√´l Mellet (1838, Paris). Tredgold also edited John Smeaton's Hydraulic Tracts (1826; 2nd edit. 1837), added notes and articles to Robertson Buchanan's Practical Essays on millwork (ed. George Rennie, London, 1841), and revised Peter Nicholson's New Practical Builder (London, 1861). He contributed the articles on joinery and stone masonry to the supplement of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (ed. 1824), and contributed technical articles to the Philosophical Magazine and to Thomas Thomson's Annals of Philosophy. Legacy in civil engineering Tredgold gave an influential definition of civil engineering, on which the charter of the Institution of Civil Engineers based itself in 1828: > A Society for the general advancement of Mechanical Science, and more > particularly for promoting the acquisition of that species of knowledge > which constitutes the profession of a Civil Engineer; being the art of > directing the great sources of power in Nature for the use and convenience > of man, as the means of production and of traffic in states, both for > external and internal trade, as applied in the construction of roads, > bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation, and docks, for internal > intercourse and exchange; and in the construction of ports harbours, moles, > breakwaters, and lighthouses, and in the art of navigation by artificial > power, for the purposes of commerce; and in the construction and adaptation > of machinery, and in the drainage of cities and towns.

Two exploratory oil wells have been drilled there as it is estimated to have oil reserves of 6-8 billion barrels. Chevron intends to drill a third well in 2012. Introduction The Orphan Basin is located adjacent to the Grand Banks and the Flemish Cap Taking its name from a nearby geographical feature of the Atlantic Ocean known as the Orphan Knoll, the Orphan Basin lies just to north and is contiguous to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. A wide Mesozoic rift zone, the basin spans 160,000 square kilometres and has been studied and explored by the oil & gas companies ExxonMobil, Chevron, Imperial Oil, and Shell Canada. The presence of Late Jurassic sedimentary formations (i.e. source rock) similar to those found in the fruitful nearby Jeanne d'Arc Basin make this of particular interest to oil exploration. In contrast to this, by 2004 the area still remained one of the least explored Mesozoic Atlantic oceanic basins. The basin is divided into three areas for exploration purposes based on ocean water depth, namely: Shallow Water (200‚Äì500 metres), Intermediate Water (500‚Äì1500 metres), and Deepwater (1500‚Äì3000 metres). These areas span west to east. History of exploration The first attempt at exploration of the western, shallow water region of the basin began in 1969 with Shell Canada. Seven subsequent exploration wells were drilled between 1974 and 1985 by various oil companies. However, these wells failed to penetrate the critical Late Jurassic section which had been so successful in the discovery of oil-rich source rock for adjacent basins. As of 2012, Chevron holds a 65% operational stake in the Orphan Basin. This stake also consists of an operational license covering 6,040 square kilometres. The company has already drilled two wells with plans to drill a third in late 2012. Geological setting and environment Due to its geographical position on the continental margin of Newfoundland, the Orphan Basin received significant proglacial deposits during the late Quaternary period, mostly from ice crossing the continental shelf. The Labrador Current also played a role, allowing icebergs and proglacial plumes to provide sediment from more distant sources. The western slope of the basin has been recognized as four separate areas based on geomorphology, namely: the North Slope, the slope off Trinity Trough, the South Slope, and the slope off Sackville Spur. The area has had several events combining extensive tectonic activity with the possibility of halokinesis. This has given rise to the development of hydrocarbon traps in the Mesozoic region of the basin. These traps are attractive for potential development by the oil & gas industry. =Climatology and biology= The climate of the basin is akin to that of the northern Grand Banks, with mean temperatures ranging from -5 ¬∞C to 16 ¬∞C. The month of August sees the warmest temperatures and February the coldest. As with the island of Newfoundland, the area is strongly influenced by weather systems that are passing through. These systems, often intense, attribute to an overall dynamic climate. High winds of gale force (and above) and fog often afflict the basin. Typical components of the ecosystem of the Orphan Basin are diverse and include sea birds, sea turtles, fish, marine mammals and others. The area is home to a list of threatened and endangered species, including the Atlantic cod, blue whale, leatherback sea turtle, and northern bottlenose whale. Environmental impact of exploration A variety of specific issues have been highlighted with respect to the environmental impact of oil exploration in the area. Noise disturbance from seismic surveys may have negative effects on the marine mammal and fish populations. This can lead to detrimental effects on fisheries, including the crab fishery, the most lucrative fishery for the province of Newfoundland. A large area of exploration in the basin is in deep-water, where delicate deep-sea corals and chemosynthetic organisms may reside. The pulses from seismic surveys and airguns involved in the exploration process may alter swimming patterns of fish and interfere with the underwater communication of certain species of marine life. Diving sea birds may also be affected. High levels of noise from other related anthropogenic sources such as boats and drilling operations may mask the detection of weaker biologically important sounds of marine mammals. Chemical wastes discharged during drilling operations are also of environmental concern. Among these, but not limited to, are greywater, blackwater, bilge water and ballast water. Accidental events such spills of diesel fuel during vessel loading/unloading and oil or gas during blowouts also raise concerns for environmental damage. Routine exploration and drilling activity in the basin can most likely be conducted without much impact to the surrounding environment if activities are kept at a minimum and sensitive areas are avoided. If an oil spill akin to that of the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico (2010) occurred in the basin, the environmental repercussions could be even worse. The Deepwater spill was due to the failure of the blowout preventer - a failure which may be attributed to the great depth of the well. The current Chevron well in the basin is almost twice as deep as the Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf, possibly posing increased risk for blowout preventer failure. Methane hydrate crystals, which form in low temperatures and high pressure, formed and prevented early attempts to plug the Gulf well. This pressure is doubled in the basin due to the increased ocean depth. Any rigs to drill a relief well in the event of similar spill in the basin would have to be brought in from other areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico. This increased wait time for a relief well to be drilled as well as the typically harsh weather conditions of the North Atlantic would make a spill in this region particularly difficult.

The land was given, it is believed, on condition that a red rose was given to the Bishop of Lichfield (if demanded) each year on St John Baptist's Day, 24 June. It is not known when this custom ceased but it was revived in 1987 and the Bishop is now invited that day to receive 10 red roses, one for each resident. The front of Dr Milley's Hospital in Beacon Street, Lichfield. The hospital is named after Thomas Milley, a Canon residentiary of Lichfield Cathedral, who re-endowed and probably rebuilt the Hospital between 1502 and 1504. At that time it housed 15 poor women. Parts of the present building date back to 1652 (beams in upstairs corridor dated by dendrochronology) by which time the accommodation provided for only 10 residents. In the early 1900s the building was in such a bad state of repair that the Trustees wished to demolish all of it. The Charity Commissioners refused permission and in 1906-7 part of the building was demolished and the rest restored, leaving accommodation for 8 residents. Each woman had one room for all her needs, water had to be carried from the supply at the end of the passage and when finished with returned and tipped down the sink. One bathroom and a communal laundry room were not provided until 1967. It was extensively refurbished in the 1980s and the Hospital now provides for 10 residents, 6 in self-contained flats and 4 in studio apartments. Each has their own kitchen and bathroom. There is also a common room, laundry, drying area and garden. There is a Chaplain who holds regular services in the Chapel. This is in the oldest part of the building, above the porch. It is possible the large beam in the entrance hall below dates back to the 1504 building.

Background The Third Concerto was commissioned by the pianist Benno Moiseiwitsch, who had been an early champion of Medtner.Presto Classical Privately, Medtner said that the first movement was inspired by Mikhail Lermontov's ballad Rusalka, about a water-nymph whose seductive advances fail to arouse a sleeping knight. He extended Lermontov's poem for the remaining movements: The knight (personifying the human spirit) awakens and sings a song that turns into a hymn, symbolizing his triumph over temptation and his achievement of redemption and eternal life.Toronto Symphony Orchestra Medtner and his wife Anna were living in London when the Blitz began in earnest in September 1940. His devoted champion, the English pianist Edna Iles, had moved to her parents' home in the Birmingham suburb of Moseley, and the Medtners came to stay there too. After the house was bombed, they moved with the Ileses to the Worcestershire village of Wythall. Later they moved to a secluded house near Wootton Wawen, not far from Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire. It was in this succession of rural surroundings that the Third Concerto was finished. One day, Medtner gave Edna Iles the manuscript of the first movement, telling her he had never before revealed a part of a work before it was complete. The two practised the work on two pianos, and when it was complete, he presented her with the entire score.Hyperion Records The Medtners returned to London in April 1943. He dedicated the Third Concerto to Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar Bahadur, the Maharajah of Mysore, an Indian prince who had supported Medtner and founded the Medtner Society, devoted to the recording of all his major works with the composer himself playing the piano parts. The dedication was inscribed \\"with deep gratitude for the appreciation and furtherance of my work\\".Hyperion Records The premiere of the Third Concerto took place in the Royal Albert Hall on 19 February 1944, with Sir Adrian Boult conducting, and the composer at the piano.Lawrence BudmenMartyn, Barrie (1995). Nicolas Medtner: His Life and Music. Aldershot: Scolar Press. . p.243. He continued to make recordings until his health failed two years before his 1951 death, but 1944 was the last year in which he performed in public, and this occasion was one of his last appearances.Music Web International After his death, the Third Concerto was played in a tribute concert conducted by Anatole Fistoulari; at Anna Medtner's request, the New Zealand-born pianist Colin Horsley (who also posthumously premiered the Piano Quintet) was the soloist.David CF Wright, A Lost Generation of Pianists The Ukrainian pianist Dmitry Paperno, who was aged only 22 when Medtner died, was offered the opportunity by Medtner's widow of giving the Russian premiere of the Third Concerto, but turned it down. Composition The work is sub-titled \\"Ballade\\", and is constructed as one movement sub-divided into three sub-movements, although the central Interludium is very short, lasting less than two minutes. The whole work lasts about 36 minutes. * I: Con moto largamento ‚Äì Allegretto con moto (16‚Äô) * II: Interludium. Allegro, molto sostenuto, misterioso (al rigore di tempo) (2‚Äô) * III: Finale.

Born in Watford, England he started his career at Brentford in 1978 where he spent ten seasons playing in the lower divisions before switching to Sheffield United with whom he enjoyed his most successful period, gaining two promotions and playing in the top flight. He returned to Brentford for a further two seasons before injuries prompted him to retire. A spell on the coaching staff at Brentford was followed by a period as assistant manager at Brighton & Hove Albion where he was twice installed as caretaker manager during his tenure. Playing career =Brentford= Booker was initially spotted by Watford whilst playing for Saturday side Bedmond Social and they invited him to attend a couple of training sessions before he also caught the eye of Brentford and was offered a trial. Despite being a midfielder he was played as a striker in his trial game and duly scored two goals prompting Brentford to offer him a deal. After agreeing a 'fee' with Bedmond, which saw the non-league side receive a set of tracksuits, Booker signed for the Bees and made his Football League debut two days later on 14 October 1978, ironically against his home-town club of Watford. After a short loan to Conference side Barnet where he netted a couple of goals, he returned to Brentford and duly scored a hat-trick in his first game back. From this point he became a stalwart of the Brentford first team and would be virtually ever present for the next ten seasons at Griffin Park eventually making over 250 appearances for the Bees. Noted for his versatility, by the time Booker was voted the Bees Player of the Season in 1982 he had played in every position apart from goalkeeper. Booker's time at Brentford was marred when he suffered a cruciate ligament injury in 1986 which kept him out of the side for nearly 18 months with the surgeons claiming he would never be able to play again. He returned to fitness and played a few first team games but was now deemed surplus to requirements and offered a testimonial game and a free transfer. =Sheffield United= Booker was considering quitting football, taking the money from the benefit game that Brentford had offered him and putting the money into a window cleaning business. His final contract with Brentford had given him the option of a free transfer should he choose it, in recognition of ten years good service to the club, but it was still something of a surprise when Dave Bassett offered him the chance to move to Sheffield United in 1988 having monitored his progress for a number of years. Blades midfielder Simon Webster had broken his leg and United needed someone to replace him so club physio Derek French, who had played with Booker back in his Bedmond days, contacted him to see if he was interested in a move North. Within 24 hours Booker had signed for the Blades. Over thirty years old, with a recurring knee injury and seemingly with his best years behind him Booker proved an inspired signing, as he became the linchpin of the side that rose through the divisions to reach the top flight in 1990. A cult hero with the Bramall Lane fans Booker endeared himself with his gutsy performances and genuine affection for the club and its fans who he would happily spend hours chatting with. On one occasion a ten-year-old fan wrote to the club asking if Booker could come to dinner at his house ‚Äì a request which he duly obliged, staying for two hours. Booker continued to be a key player in Division One before injuries finally started to take their toll and he was allowed to return to Brentford in 1991. =Return to Brentford= Signing a three-year deal with The Bees, nearly five years after they had deemed him surplus to requirements, Booker suffered a difficult return. A squad player he was part of the side that were crowned Division Three champions in 1992 but then suffered an immediate relegation the following year. Booker's knee problems had returned as well, and he was forced to retire in 1993 on his doctor's advice. Booker was inducted into the Brentford Hall of Fame in November 2014. Managerial career After drifting out of football for a while Booker eventually took up a coaching post at Brentford in 1994 before being offered the position of assistant manager to Micky Adams at Brighton & Hove Albion in 2000. When Adams left after the side were promoted Booker was made joint caretaker manager along with Martin Hinshelwood before the arrival of Steve Coppell. Remaining at the club he was again called upon to act as caretaker manager in 2003 after Coppell quit to join Reading. New manager Mark McGhee retained Booker as his assistant and the pair remained in charge until McGhee was sacked following a poor start to the 2006‚Äì07 season. After a spell managing village side Pease Pottage FC, Booker returned to Brighton along with Micky Adams in 2008 to take up the position of reserve team coach. Booker now works as a driving instructor and summariser on Brighton & Hove Albion's match commentary. Personal life Booker left school at 16 to begin a four-year apprenticeship in an upholstery warehouse whilst playing Saturday football. During his first game for Brentford he was marked by Watford defender Ian Bolton who would eventually join him at Brentford and ironically end up as his brother-in-law. Following his retirement from playing Booker made occasional appearances as match summariser on BBC Radio Sheffield and married former Southern FM breakfast show host Nicky Keig-Shevlin in 2008. In July 2017, a biographical book of Booker's life, written with his support, was published. OOH-AAH: The Bob Booker Story .

This mechanism is composed of three important parts: The crank which is the rotating disc, the slider which slides inside the tube and the connecting rod which joins the parts together. As the slider moves to the right the connecting rod pushes the wheel round for the first 180 degrees of wheel rotation. When the slider begins to move back into the tube, the connecting rod pulls the wheel round to complete the rotation.

Early playing career McBride started playing the guitar when he was ten. By age 15 he entered Guitarist Magazine‚Äôs Young Guitarist of The Year, a performance competition staged that year at Wembley Conference Centre, which he won. Less than a year later, a few months after his sixteenth birthday, McBride was recruited by the Belfast-based metal band Sweet Savage, which reformed in 1994 without their founding guitarist, Vivian Campbell (Dio, Def Leppard), who McBride replaced. He toured with the band and recorded two albums, Killing Time 1996 and Rune 1998. After leaving Sweet Savage in 1998, he joined fellow Irishman Andrew Strong, who made his name in the 1991 cult film The Commitments and went on to establish a singing career. Playing with Strong was in stark contrast to Sweet Savage, involving mostly of soul, R&B; and some pop songs. The change of musical style was a useful learning experience and closer in style to the rock and blues artists that had inspired McBride to start playing the guitar. He spent six years touring with Strong before leaving to pursue the idea of a solo career. In 2008 McBride released his debut album, Rich Man Falling on Nugene Records, a boutique label with a specialisation in guitarists and blues-based artists. The album contains covers of Be My Friend originally by Free (band) and the Jimi Hendrix song Power of Soul. His 2010 sophomore release Since Then (Nugene Records) gained him nominations in the British Blues Awards. By this time he had opened shows in the UK and Ireland for Jeff Beck, Joe Bonamassa and US slide guitarist Derek Trucks. In autumn 2010 he toured the UK supporting one of his early guitar heroes, Joe Satriani. In 2011 he played major festivals including Glastonbury Festival, and other gatherings including a special guest spot at Don Airey‚Äôs Soul & Blues Festival in 2011 and 2013. During a tour of the UK in 2011 each show was recorded. This resulted in McBride‚Äôs third CD release Nine Lives (Nugene Records), so called because there are nine in-concert tracks. The album also contains four solo acoustic tracks, one of which is an acoustic rendition of the title track of his 2008 release Rich Man Falling. A video of this track, cut to 1930s film footage, soon appeared on YouTube. In 2012 he released \\"Crossing The Line\\" (Nugene Records) an album of mostly original work plus the Blood, Sweat & Tears song \\"Go Down Gambin\\". The album was recorded in Belfast N.Ireland and Maryland USA and mixed in New York by veteran producer/engineer Peter Denenberg. This album made several \\"best of\\" annual charts including that of Classic Rock magazine. In 2016, McBride joined the classic rock band \\"Snakecharmer\\" replacing Micky Moody and recorded their new album \\"Second Skin\\" released in May, 2017 touring with them ever since. Endorsements and teaching As a teenage guitarist McBride caught the ear of the world‚Äôs leading independent guitar builder Paul Reed Smith, and to this day McBride is a PRS Guitars-endorsed artist, a role that has taken him to music events around Europe and to The PRS Experience, an event held annually at the PRS Guitars factory in Maryland USA, where McBride has played alongside such names as Santana and Buddy Guy. He also endorses Victory amplifiers and Rotosound Strings. He is a visiting tutor at the Dublin school of BIMM (Brighton Institute of Modern Music) and has also been a guest tutor at the International Guitar Foundation summer school and at BIMM in Bristol.

He supported Francois Bayrou in the 2007 French presidential election, and joined Bayrou's campaign team with a view to influence its economic programme.Nomination de six vice-pr√©sidents, Mouvement d√©mocrate , Democratic Movement In the 2008 French municipal elections Peyrelevade led the Democratic Movement party (MoDem) list in the 16th arrondissement of Paris - he polled 8.64% of votes in the first round, ranking fourth after the lists of Claude Goasguen (UMP), 51.71%; Jean-Yves Mano (PS), 17.08%; and David Alphand (Miscellaneous right), 13.22%.R√©sultats des √©lections municipales du 9 mars, Le Figaro.fr He was elected through the list and became a borough councilor, and on 13 June 2008 was appointed a vice president of MoDem. He resigned from the board of the 16th arrondissement, and all positions within MoDem, on 6 January 2009. He no longer has partisan ties but is an active participant of the left-leaning Terra Nova think tank. In an opinion published in Le Figaro in 2009,Le Figaro, 14 November 2009 he advocated a separation between deposit and investment banks - believing banks to be a true public service which should be managed as such - and a regulation of the financial system to prevent further financial crises. On 7 September 2011 Peyrelevade supported the candidacy of Fran√ßois Hollande in the 2011 Socialist Party presidential primary. However, during the 17 September 2011 MoDem summer conference, and in radio interviews, he said he would support Manuel Valls in the first round of voting, and probably Francois Hollande in the second.\\"Jean Peyrelevade votera Valls √† la primaire socialiste\\", Leparisien.fr, 17 September 2011 On 5 January 2012 he stated that he had changed his mind in his support for Fran√ßois Hollande, saying candidate \\"Bayrou's speech is more consistent, clearer\\".\\"J'ai chang√© d'avis\\", Tumblr.com‚ÄùJean Peyrelevade : Il faut une p√©riode de mod√©ration salariale‚Äù, Lepoint.fr, 17 January 2012. Retrieved 26 May 2013 In 2012 Peyrelevade stated that France needed a period of wage moderation to re-vitalize the economy. He believes that the 35-hour working week introduced by President Lionel Jospin in 2000 was destructive of French competitiveness within the Eurozone, while \\"Germans were seriously putting their affairs in order\\". Although he saw improvements during the Premiership of √âdouard Balladur (1993‚Äì95) and Dominique de Villepin (2005-07), he feels that not enough progress was made in lowering taxes to boost demand. Nicolas Sarkozy, he felt, had \\"all the time to address these issues\\" but didn't. Peyrelevade promotes re-industrialisation, innovation, increased spending on research and promotion of private enterprise. He believes that French employment law keeps wages high relative to other countries, discouraging employment at a time of unemployment. He sees the high cost of social protection as an economic burden, and would reduce these costs while lowering taxes on households. Although Peyrelevade had personal sympathy for 2012 President Fran√ßois Hollande, he was sceptical of his dialogue with the French Green party who advocate a 32-hour working week with a refusal to contemplate austerity and high productivity.  Corporate career  While being associated with left-wing governments Peyrelevade was considered competent by the business community, and was appointed and confirmed head of large state-controlled companies: Chairman of the Suez Company from 1983 to 1986; Stern Bank from 1986 to 1988; the Union des assurances de Paris from 1988 to 1993; and Credit Lyonnais from 1993 to 2003. In 1985, on behalf of the French authorities, Peyrelevade was responsible for negotiating agreement on the establishment of Disneyland Paris. Peyrelevade became chairman of the French Government-controlled bank Cr√©dit Lyonnais in 1993. Previously, in 1991, the bank had acquired the then insolvent and now- defunct Californian insurance company Executive Life. Banks in the US at the time were legally barred from buying insurers. In 2006 the bank and Peyrelevade were charged in the federal court of Los Angeles with two felonies concerning false statements to the Federal Reserve. For failing to alert the authorities of the acquisition, Peyrelevade, through a plea bargain with the court, was banned from entering the US for three years and fined $500,000.\\"Jean Peyrelevade\\", Los Angeles Times, 1994 - 2008.

Marketers need to monitor price premiums as early indicators of competitive pricing strategies. Changes in price premiums can also be signs of product shortages, excess inventories, or other changes in the relationships between supply and demand. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 54 percent responded that they found the \\"price premium\\" metric very useful.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. . The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project.  Purpose  Although there are several useful benchmarks with which a manager can compare a brand's price, they all attempt to measure the 'average price' in the marketplace. By comparing a brand's price with a market average, managers can gain valuable insight into its strength, especially if they view these findings in the context of volume and market share changes. Indeed, price premium ‚Äì also known as relative price ‚Äì is a commonly used metric among marketers and senior managers. Fully 63% of firms report the relative prices of their products to their boards, according to a recent survey conducted in the US, UK, Germany, Japan, and France.Barwise, Patrick, and John U. Farley (2003). Which Marketing Metrics Are Used and Where? Marketing Science Institute, (03-111), working paper, Series issues two 03-002.  Construction  Price premium (%) = [Brand A price ($) - Benchmark price ($)] / Benchmark price ($) In calculating price premium, managers must first specify a benchmark price. Typically, the price of the brand in question will be included in this benchmark, and all prices in the benchmark will be for an equivalent volume of product (for example, price per liter). There are at least four commonly used benchmarks: = The price of a specified competitor or competitors = :This is the simplest calculation of price premium and involves the comparison of a brand‚Äôs price to that of a specified direct competitor. When assessing a brand‚Äôs price premium vis √† vis multiple competitors, managers can use as their benchmark the average price of a selected group of those competitors. = Average price paid: The unit-sales weighted average price in the category = :Another useful benchmark is the average price that customers pay for brands in a given category. This average can be calculated in at least two ways: (1) as the ratio of total category revenue to total category unit sales, or (2) as the unit-share weighted average price in the category. The market Average Price Paid includes the brand under consideration. Changes in unit shares will affect the average price paid. If a low-price brand steals shares from a higher-priced rival, the average price paid will decline. This would cause a firm‚Äôs price premium (calculated using the average price paid as a benchmark) to rise, even if its absolute price did not change. Similarly, if a brand is priced at a premium, that premium will decline as it gains share. The reason: a market share gain by a premium-priced brand will cause the overall average price paid in its market to rise. This, in turn, will reduce the price differential between that brand and the market average. . . . To calculate the price premium using the average price paid benchmark, managers can also divide a brand‚Äôs share of the market in value terms by its share in volume terms. If value and volume market shares are equal, there is no premium. If value share is greater than volume share, then there is a positive price premium. = Average price charged: The simple (unweighted) average price in the category = :Calculation of the average price paid requires knowledge of the sales or shares of each competitor. A much simpler benchmark is the average price charged ‚Äì the simple unweighted average price of the brands in the category. This benchmark requires knowledge only of prices. As a consequence, the price premium calculated using this benchmark is not affected by changes in unit shares. For this reason, this benchmark serves a slightly different purpose. It captures the way a brand‚Äôs price compares to prices set by its competitors, without regard to customers‚Äô reactions to those prices. It also treats all competitors equally in the calculation of the benchmark price. Large and small competitors are weighted equally when calculating average price charged. = Average price displayed: The display-weighted average price in the category = :One benchmark conceptually situated between average price paid and average price charged is the average price displayed. Marketing managers who seek a benchmark that captures differences in the scale and strength of brands‚Äô distribution might weight each brand‚Äôs price in proportion to a numerical measure of distribution. Typical measures of distribution strength include numeric distribution, ACV (%), and PCV (%).

Vacancy Alfred Emmott had been Liberal MP for dual member Oldham since gaining a seat from the Conservatives in 1899. He was appointed Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies by H. H. Asquith and the following month he was raised to the peerage as Baron Emmott, of Oldham in the County Palatine of Lancaster. Electoral history This was the result at the previous General Election; Candidates The Liberal candidate chosen to defend the seat was Arthur Stanley. He had been Liberal MP for Eddisbury, Cheshire until losing to the Conservastives in January 1910. He had lost there again in December 1910. His sister, Venetia Stanley, was a close correspondent of the Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal party, H. H. Asquith. The Conservative candidate was Edmund Bartley-Denniss who had stood here in December 1910. His only connection with the area was the fact that his father-in-law had recently been Mayor of Oldham. The Labour party, who had never previously stood a candidate here, intervened in the contest, choosing William Cornforth Robinson as their candidate. He was General Secretary of the Amalgamated Association of Beamers, Twisters and Drawers and President of the United Textile Factory Workers Association. His candidature was significant given the large number of textile workers resident in the constituency. Since 1906, most dual member constituencies in industrialised towns had seen one Liberal and one Labour candidate run in harness against two Unionists. Oldham had been an exception to this with two Liberals running. The Labour Party national leadership were therefore keen to see this practice extended to Oldham and were happy to back the locally chosen Labour candidate. Campaign Polling Day was set for 13 November. Result The Conservatives gained the seat. The Labour intervention had proved crucial in denying the Liberal victory. Bartley-Denniss Arthur Stanley Aftermath A General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the autumn of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. (Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place.) Despite Labour finishing third, their candidate had done well enough to support a claim to run in tandem with a Liberal in future, which is why only one Liberal candidate was in place.

It is carried out by an opera manager, also called a general manager, managing director, or intendant (UK English). A multifaceted task, it involves managing an opera company, primarily the singers and musicians who perform the operas, but in many cases also involves managing the opera house in which the company performs. Background Opera is a multi- faceted art form involving high fixed costs and requiring complex approaches to management. In addition to the singers and musicians who form the core of the company, its production requires scenery and costumes and sometimes dancers and non-singing actors. Fixed costs in today's opera organizations‚Äîkeeping many of the singers and musicians on year-round contracts, and if managing their own theatre, the cost of workers needed to create and maintain the sets and costumes as well as the cost of maintaining and running the building‚Äîcombined with the costs of individual productions, make opera the most expensive of the performing arts.Towse, Ruth (2011). \\"Opera and Ballet\\", p. 313 in Ruth Towse (ed.) A Handbook of Cultural Economics. Edward Elgar Publishing. However, even in the 19th century when opera was largely run by individual impresarios rather than large organisations, opera management as a profession was characterised as \\"a devouror of the fortunes of the victims it has tempted by its seductions\\".The Reader (6 August 1864). \\"The Opera Season at Covent Garden\\", p. 175. Musicologists and opera composers have noted that today ‚ÄúMarketing and private sector support are generally regarded as necessary despite the fact that many opera companies must simultaneously strive to attain public funding as ‚Äòhigh art‚Äô that embodies universally valuable cultural heritage.‚ÄùHebert, D.

Frederick Gye, who turned the Royal Italian Opera in Covent Garden into one of London's premiere opera houses in the 19th century, and who shaped the careers of many famous singers, described opera management as a \\"dreadful business\\".Dideriksen, Gabriella and Ringel, Matthew (1995). \\"Frederick Gye and 'The Dreadful Business of Opera Management'\\", 19th-Century Music, Vol. 19, No. 1 (Summer 1995), pp. 3‚Äì30. Venice and the development of opera as a business The earliest operas were privately performed and financed by the noble families who commissioned them, often to mark great court occasions. One such example was Marco da Gagliano's La Flora, performed in 1628 at the Medici Palace in Florence to celebrate the marriage of Margherita de' Medici and Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma. Grand Duchess Maria Maddalena, the wife of Cosimo II de' Medici and the mother of the bride, took an active role in the planning of the production. She secured the services of the musicians and singers, attended the rehearsals, and according to musicologist Kelley Harness, may well have contributed to the development of the plot as well.Harness, Kelley Ann (2006). Echoes of Women's Voices: Music, Art, and Female Patronage in Early Modern Florence, p. 175. University of Chicago Press. Publicly performed operas first appeared in Venice during the Carnival season of 1637. This was facilitated by the large number of public theatres already present in the city which originally served for the production of plays. They were built by noble families such as the Grimani, Tron, and Vendramin. The rebuilt Teatro San Cassiano, sponsored by the Tron family, was the first in the world specifically devoted to opera. Performances of L'Andromeda in 1637 by librettist Benedetto Ferrari and composer Francesco Manelli marked the theatre's first commercially produced opera.Ringer, Mark (2006). Opera's First Master: The Musical Dramas of Claudio Monteverdi, pp. 130‚Äì131. Amadeus Press. . In the majority of cases the patrician Venetian owners profited from their theatres by renting them out to others who produced and managed the opera performances. The key figure in the actual production of the operas was the impresario, who assembled the singers, musicians and creative team and made the business and artistic decisions. Sometimes the impresarios were hired by the theatre renters and their backers. On other occasions the impresario was also one of the investors and the renter of the theatre. The cassier (cashier) was in charge the financial side of the production, including handling the payments and receipts. While the cassier was sometimes a separate member of the management team, in many instances the impresario also acted as the cassier.Glixon, Beth Lise and Glixon, Jonathan Emmanuel (2006). Inventing the Business of Opera: The Impresario and His World in Seventeenth-Century Venice, p. 4. Oxford University Press.

Born in Bandung, West Java, to a schoolteacher and his musician wife, Astria began singing in 1975 while the family was stationed in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. After several years of participating in festivals and taking vocal training, in 1984 Astria was signed to AMK Records. Although her first album flopped, she found success with her second and third albums, Jarum Neraka and Tangan-Tangan Setan. Bruce Emond of The Jakarta Post described her as \\"one of the biggest [Indonesian] music stars of the late 1980s\\", while guitarist-cum-songwriter Ian Antono called her \\"the best female pop rock singer Indonesia has ever seen\\". Two of her songs, \\"Jarum Neraka\\" and \\"Tangan-Tangan Setan\\" (both 1985), were listed as among the best Indonesian songs of all time by Rolling Stone Indonesia in 2009 Biography =Early life and career= Dewi was born on October 18, 1967 in Bandung to Tatang Kosasih Wirahadimaja, a schoolteacher, and Andrina Heryati, a traditional musician; she was the couple's only daughter, and fourth of five children. Dewi was known as a tomboy in her youth and is of Sundanese descent. In 1972, her father was sent to head the Indonesian school at the Indonesian embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Dewi, although of the age to begin kindergarten, was enrolled in the first grade. She reportedly had trouble initially, as her family spoke Sundanese at home, and thus she had difficulty understanding the Indonesian-language lessons. Dewi sang in public for the first time at Independence Day ceremonies on 17 August 1975. When this was received well, she began singing at different formal occasions, by request of her father. The family returned to Bandung in 1975, and Dewi enrolled at Halimun Public Elementary School. She continued to perform and receive vocal coaching, and by the end of elementary school had already competed in the Children's Pop Singing Festival (). While still at State Junior High School 13 ‚Äì where she caught several times skipping school and not paying her school fees ‚Äì Dewi competed in the Teenage Pop Singing Festival (). Although she intended to be a singer, her father wanted her to find another occupation. In 1981, Wirahadimaja died. On his deathbed, he gave Dewi his blessings for her to become a singer; she had just received her first honorarium for performing, Rp. 25,000 for performing Ahmad Albar's \\"Balada Sejuta Wajah\\" (\\"Ballad of A Million Faces\\"). Her father's death left her family financially destitute, which led to Dewi moving to her grandmother's house. She gave her first rock performance with the Ronners at the Rally Rock Jakarta-Bandung in Jakarta. =Professional career= In 1984, Dewi was signed to AMK Records; to be more commercial, she adopted the stage name Nicky Astria. She soon released Semua dari Cinta (Everything from Love), which featured songs by Tarida Hutauruk and Jelly Tobing. The album, which had somewhat pop sound, was poorly received. She was later introduced to several prominent musical figures, including guitarist-cum-songwriter Ian Antono, who served as producer and helped her further her career. She was managed by her brother Bucky for the first several years of her career. Astria second album, Jarum Neraka (Pin from Hell), was released in 1985. It had more of a rock feel and sold over 350,000 copies, making it the first Indonesian rock album to do so. It was followed by Tangan- Tangan Setan (Hands of Satan), also in 1985; this third album brought her mainstream success. Astria's success led to numerous new female rockers entering the industry, after three previous female rockers had left several years earlier. Although her elder brother Dicky insisted she attend university, Astria focused on her musical career. Every year from 1985 to 1987, Astria won the BASF Award for Best Female Rock Singer. In the late 1980s Astria toured with fellow female rockers Nike Ardilla and Anggun, often sharing a room despite the press depicting them as rivals. Astria performed in the Tokyo Music Festival in 1988, singing one of her songs and participating in a rendition of the Japanese-language song \\"Hana\\". In 1989, Astria released a rearranged version of \\"Jarum Neraka\\", the titular song of her second album. Towards the end of the 1980s, she acted in Biarkan Aku Cemburu (Let Me Be Jealous), after being invited by her neighbour Eddy D. Iskandar. In 1999, Astria recorded a duet with Chrisye, entitled \\"Khayalku\\" (\\"My Imagination\\"), for the rearranged version of the 1977 album Badai Pasti Berlalu. In 2001, she was one of four musicians who established the Bandung School of Higher Musical Learning (), which teaches both music and business aspects of the music industry. Two years later, during a promotional tour for her recent album Maafkan (Forgive), a fan was killed in a fight at a concert in Cirebon. Legacy Two of Astria's songs were listed by Rolling Stone Indonesia in their 2009 List of the 150 Best Indonesian Songs of All Time. \\"Jarum Neraka\\", from the album of the same name, was ranked 54th, while \\"Tangan-Tangan Setan\\", from the album of the same name, was ranked 57th. Ian Antono described her as \\"the best female pop rock singer Indonesia has ever seen\\".. Personal life Astria's first marriage was to Satria Kamal, the son of a politician, in 1992. The couple had two children before their divorce in the early 2000s. Astria then married Hendra Priyadi, the owner of a music studio, in 2003. The couple divorced a year later. She married Gunanta Afrina in 2005; the couple have one child together. Astria is a Muslim.

Purpose Although sales or market share can indicate how well a firm is performing currently, satisfaction is perhaps the best indicator of how likely it is that the firm‚Äôs customers will make further purchases in the future. Willingness to recommend is a key metric relating to customer satisfaction. Construction Willingness to recommend is calculated as the percentage of surveyed customers who indicate that they would recommend a brand to friends, or as the average strength of their willingness if the survey allows for a range of degrees of willingness. The usual measures of willingness to recommend involve a survey with a set of statements using a Likert Technique or scale. The customer is asked to indicate how willing they are to make a recommendation (of a brand, service, etc.) to others. Their willingness is generally measured on a five-point scale. Both the wording of the question and the wording of the scale item responses may vary widely among surveyors. Willingness data can also be collected on a 7-point or 10-point scale. Methodologies Perhaps the best known measure of willingness to recommend is the Net Promoter Score (NPS) first introduced by Fred Reichheld. No willingness to recommend methodology has been independently audited by the Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) according to MMAP (Marketing Metric Audit Protocol).

The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project. __TOC__  Purpose  When projecting sales for relatively new products, marketers typically use a system of trial and repeat calculations to anticipate sales in future periods. This works on the principle that everyone buying the product will either be a new customer (a 'trier') or a repeat customer. By adding new and repeat customers in any period, we can establish the penetration of a product in the marketplace. It is challenging, however, to project sales to a large population on the basis of simulated test markets, or even full-fledged regional rollouts. Marketers have developed various solutions to increase the speed and reduce the cost of test marketing, such as stocking a store with products (or mock-ups of new products) or giving customers money to buy the products of their choice. These simulate real shopping conditions but require specific models to estimate full-market volume on the basis of test results.  Construction  Volume projections combine trial volume and repeat volume, that is: :Total volume (#) = Trial volume (#) + Repeat volume (#)  References  * Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E.

This typically includes advertising and non-price promotion. It sometimes includes sales force spending and may also include price promotions. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 52 percent responded that they found the \\"marketing spending\\" metric very useful.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. . The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project. To predict how selling costs change with sales, a firm must distinguish between fixed selling costs and variable selling costs. Recognizing the difference between fixed and variable selling costs can help firms account for the relative risks associated with alternative sales strategies. In general, strategies that incur variable selling costs are less risky because variable selling costs will remain lower in the event that sales fail to meet expectations.  Purpose  This metric's purpose is to forecast marketing spending and assess budgeting risk. Marketing costs are often a major part of a firm‚Äôs overall discretionary expenditures. As such, they are important determinants of short-term profits. Of course, marketing and selling budgets can also be viewed as investments in acquiring and maintaining customers. From either perspective, however, it is useful to distinguish between fixed marketing costs and variable marketing costs. That is, managers must recognize which marketing costs will hold steady, and which will change with sales. Generally, this classification will require a \\"line-item by line- item\\" review of the entire marketing budget. Rather than varying with unit sales, total variable selling costs are more likely to vary directly with the monetary value of the units sold ‚Äì that is, with revenue. Thus, it is more likely that variable selling costs will be expressed as a percentage of revenue, rather than a certain monetary amount per unit. The classification of selling costs as fixed or variable will depend on an organization‚Äôs structure and on the specific decisions of management. A number of items, however, typically fall into one category or the other ‚Äì with the proviso that their status as fixed or variable can be time specific. In the long run, all costs eventually become variable. Over typical planning periods of a quarter or a year, fixed marketing costs might include: * Sales force salaries and support. * Major advertising campaigns, including production costs. * Marketing staff. * Sales promotion material, such as point-of-purchase sales aids, coupon production, and distribution costs. * Cooperative advertising allowances based on prior-period sales. Variable marketing costs might include: * Sales commissions paid to sales force, brokers or manufacturer representatives. * Sales bonuses contingent on reaching sales goals. * Off-invoice and performance allowances to trade, which are tied to current volume. * Early payment terms (if included in sales promotion budgets). * Coupon face-value payments and rebates, including processing fees. * Bill-backs for local campaigns (a bill-back requires customers to submit proof of performance to receive payment or credit whereas an off-invoice are simply deducted from invoice totals). These are conducted by retailers but reimbursed by national brand and cooperative advertising allowances, based on current period sales. Marketers often do not consider their budgets in fixed and variable terms, but they can derive at least two benefits by doing so. First, if marketing spending is in fact variable, then budgeting in this way is more accurate. Some marketers budget a fixed amount and then face an end-of-period discrepancy or \\"variance\\" if sales miss their declared targets. By contrast, a flexible budget ‚Äì that is, one that takes account of its genuinely variable components ‚Äì will reflect actual results, regardless of where sales end up. Second, the short-term risks associated with fixed marketing costs are greater than those associated with variable marketing costs. If marketers expect revenues to be sensitive to factors outside their control ‚Äì such as competitive actions or production shortages ‚Äì they can reduce risk by including more variable and less fixed spending in their budgets. A classic decision that hinges on fixed marketing costs versus variable marketing costs is the choice between engaging third-party contract sales representatives versus an in-house sales force. Hiring a salaried ‚Äì or predominantly salaried ‚Äì sales force entails more risk than the alternative because salaries must be paid even if the firm fails to achieve its revenue targets. By contrast, when a firm uses third-party brokers to sell its goods on commission, its selling costs decline when sales targets are not met.  Construction  :Total selling (marketing) costs ($) = Total fixed selling costs ($) + Total variable selling costs ($) :Total variable selling costs ($) = Revenue ($) * Variable selling cost (%) Variable costs There are many types of variable selling costs. For example, selling costs could be based upon a complicated formula, specified in a firm‚Äôs contracts with its brokers and dealers. Selling costs might include incentives to local dealers, which are tied to the achievement of specific sales targets. They might include promises to reimburse retailers for spending on cooperative advertising. Sales commissions represent one example of selling costs that vary in proportion to revenue. Consequently, any sales commissions should be included in variable selling costs. Fixed costs By contrast, payments to a website for a fixed number of impressions or click- throughs, in a contract that calls for specific financial compensation, would more likely be classified as fixed costs. On the other hand, payments for conversions (sales) would be classified as variable marketing costs. References * Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010).

The right to clothing is similarly recognized under Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Beneficiaries The right to clothing forms an aspect of the right to an adequate standard of living, and as such, is regarded as something that needs to be ensured so as to prevent people from living below the poverty line. Indeed, being ill-clothed is emblematic of acute poverty: To illustrate how far-reaching the right to clothing potentially is, Dr Stephen James has provided a non-exhaustive list of beneficiaries of the right to minimum clothing. Included on this list are those sections of society that suffer the greatest from a lack of clothing, such as: The homeless are a section of society that suffer greatly from a lack of adequate clothing. Street children also suffer greatly. * The poor, including the unemployed, under-employed and working poor; * Pensioners and others dependent on social security; * The homeless and others in inadequate shelter; * Those in emergency accommodation (for example, women's refuges), whether of a state or private character (including charitable accommodation); * The elderly, whether in privately owned or rented accommodation, or state, commercial or charitable nursing homes, hospitals and hospices; * Persons suffering from serious mental illness or from intellectual or physical disabilities (whether the live at home independently, with family members or others, or in Community Residential Units, half-way houses, public or private hospitals and other institutions); * Children and adolescents, especially orphans and juvenile offenders in foster care, state institutions or detention centres; * The ill and injured in hospitals (or rehabilitation centres), including those being treated for alcoholism and other drug-related dependencies; * Prisoners, on remand or otherwise; * Workers in hazardous industries (for instance, chemical manufacturing and mining industries), or working under generally oppressive conditions (for example, sweatshops), whose lives or health depend on protective clothing (including child workers); * Indigenous persons living in impoverished conditions; * Refugees, asylum- seekers, and migrant workers (especially those working in the black market illegally); and, * The victims of natural disasters, civil unrest, civil and international war (including prisoners of war), genocidal persecutions and other traumatic dislocations.  Recognition  The lack of discussion about the right to clothing has led to uncertainty as to the ambit of the right and how much clothing is required. Matthew Craven notes that a minimum level of clothing is what is required to be provided; it is of \\"paramount importance not least because at minimum levels it represents a question of survival.\\" This requirement of a \\"minimum\\" or \\"adequate\\" standard is mirrored in reports from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and a report from the Consortium For Street Children, as well as a number of General Comments from the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) as regards the elderly, disabled, and workers. There is, however, no indication as to what such a \\"minimum\\" or \\"adequate\\" standard entails: indeed, only rarely has the CESCR questioned a party state of the ICESCR on its performance with respect to the right to clothing. There has been limited academic commentary on the ambit of the right to clothing with regards to refugees. James Hathaway has argued that refugees should have access to clothing that suitable for the climate and is sufficient for any work or other roles they may wish to undertake. Furthermore, they should not be compelled to wear any sort of clothing that would lead to social stigma or discrimination as foreigners. On the other hand, however, should refugees choose to wear clothing that is representative of their culture, country of origin or society, they are protected under Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to do so. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has tended towards applying context-specific interpretations on what is an adequate standard of clothing; so far, the right in its general sense has not yet been considered in a general comment. The right to clothing has been recognised domestically for millennia ‚Äì at least partially ‚Äì but has received very little recognition on the international scene. It is not clear why there is a lack of recognition; one author has suggested that the lack of elaboration is due to the variations in cultural needs and wants. However, this explanation has been regarded as \\"not plausible\\": Dr James notes that \\"[c]ultural, environmental and economic variations in 'needs and wants' are surely as marked with regard to housing, health as they are in relation to clothing, but this has not prevented detailed elaboration of those rights in international law.\\" Matthew Craven concluded in 1995 that: However, Dr James has remarked: \\"...none of us can be complacent that we will not find ourselves [...] in need of adequate clothing. The right is of great practical importance. It is an essential subsistence right, not an embellishment or a legal absurdity\\". He also called for further discussion and academic commentary, arguing: Interaction between the right to clothing and other human rights As the right to clothing concerns such a fundamental aspect of humanity, it naturally interacts with other human rights that are contained within various human rights instruments. =Right to life= Everyone has the essential right to life, as confirmed under Article 3 of the UDHR. However, if people are not adequately clothed, they are far more exposed to the elements. Without warm clothing, a person may well die from hypothermia during a cold winter; clothing that is inappropriately warm, on the other hand, could contribute to heat stroke, dehydration and exhaustion during summer or in tropical climates. Furthermore, inadequate clothing could increase exposure to ultraviolet rays; aggravate allergies and skin conditions; and worsen pre- existing medical conditions. Additionally, access to medical care ‚Äì similarly confirmed under Article 25 of the UDHR as well as Article 12 of the ICESCR ‚Äì can be impeded by inadequate access to clothing, particularly if the access to therapeutic clothing or orthopedic footwear is unavailable or prohibitively expensive. =Right to freedom of expression= Wearing clothes ‚Äì or more accurately, choosing which clothes to wear ‚Äì is, for many people, an important part of expression as confirmed under Article 19 of the UDHR. Persons with serious disabilities may be dress inappropriately, denying their desired expression. Furthermore, being forced to wear dirty, ripped, ill-fitting and even extremely outdated clothing may invite ridicule and contempt and inflict shame. This can be particularly true with school children ‚Äì parents may be reluctant to consider sending a child to school as a result of ridicule and shame brought through the clothing the child wears. A distinction should be drawn, however, between those who are forced to wear ripped, ill-fitting or extremely outdated clothing and those who consciously choose to wear such clothes as a 'fashion statement'. =Right to freedom from discrimination= The clothes that people choose to wear can identify a great number of things about a person: religious affiliations, ethnicity, national or political identity, culture, or race. Arguably, the clothes that an impoverished person wears can indicate their poverty. This sign of poverty or poorer economic status can be a cause of discrimination and of vilification. Additionally, clothing which is culturally distinctive or denotes religious affiliation could provoke discrimination and lead to a denial of social, economic, or political opportunities. =Right to freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment= There is a large potential for \\"abuses of trust, for humiliations and various physical abuses in medical and institutional settings, especially in relation to women and children, the disabled and elderly.\\" If a person is denied access to adequate clothing ‚Äì especially essential clothes, such as undergarments ‚Äì it is possible that they may be rendered vulnerable to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment under the ambit of Article 5 of the UDHR. Such denial would include forcibly taking clothes, and is of particular importance in the context of detention and prisons: \\"[o]ne can literally be left naked in the midst of power, a tragic condition [...] seen too often in prisons, in war and in concentration camps.\\" Examples of such abuses in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay have found to have caused serious mental illnesses, including post- traumatic stress disorder, resulting from forcing prisoners to strip naked and parade in front of female guards, as well as male detainees being forced to wear female underwear.

Hinged flaps enable the viewer to see a body as if in various stages of dissection. They appeared for the first time in the 16th century and became popular as instructional aids. The parts were labelled, making it easier for lay students to understand the workings of the human body.Wellcome LibraryWellcome Library2 The earliest known examples of these sheets were published in Strasbourg by the engraver and printer Heinrich Vogtherr in 1538, and probably existed in great numbers although very few have survived. Jean Ruel, a French botanist and physician, published his own anatomical sheets in 1539. Andreas Vesalius published his anatomical work on the human body, \\"De humani corporis fabrica\\", four years later in 1543. His \\"Tabulae anatomicae sex\\" had appeared in 1538 showing skeletons and viscera, and differ substantially from the Ruel plates. Thomas Geminus, a pseudonym for Thomas Lambrit, was another engraver and printer, who freely copied the anatomical drawings of Vesalius, a practice which infuriated him into denouncing 'extremely inept imitators'. Geminus did however redraw and rearrange Vesalius' woodcut illustrations, choosing to use engraved copperplates, with which he was more familiar. Gyles Godet, a French printer/publisher, worked in London from the end of the 1540s until his death in the 1570s. He also made use of Vesalius' diagrams, though crediting the Flemish anatomist.http://wellcomelibrary.blogspot.com/2010/03/novelty- exquisitely-emprinted-paris.html A letter in the British National Archives is from Edmund Bonner, the English ambassador at the court of Francis I in Paris and future bishop of London. He wrote to Arthur Plantagenet, deputy of Calais, in 1539 sending him a gift of Ruel's woodcuts of a man and women.

Tumer, K. (1996) \\"Estimating the Bayes error rate through classifier combining\\" in Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Volume 2, 695‚Äì699 A number of approaches to the estimation of the Bayes error rate exist. One method seeks to obtain analytical bounds which are inherently dependent on distribution parameters, and hence difficult to estimate. Another approach focuses on class densities, while yet another method combines and compares various classifiers. The Bayes error rate finds important use in the study of patterns and machine learning techniques. Error determination In terms of machine learning and pattern classification, the labels of a set of random observations can be divided into 2 or more classes. Each observation is called an instance and the class it belongs to is the label. The Bayes error rate of the data distribution is the probability an instance is misclassified by a classifier that knows the true class probabilities given the predictors. For a multiclass classifier, the Bayes error rate may be calculated as follows: :p = 1- \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{C_{i} eq C_\\\\text{max,x}} \\\\int\\\\limits_{x\\\\in H_{i}} P(C_{i}x)p(x)\\\\, dx where x is an instance, Ci is a class into which an instance is classified, Hi is the area/region that a classifier function h classifies as Ci. The Bayes error is non-zero if the classification labels are not deterministic, i.e., there is a non-zero probability of a given instance belonging to more than one class.  Proof of Minimality  Proof that the Bayes error rate is indeed the minimum possible and that the Bayes classifier is therefore optimal, may be found together on the wikipedia page Bayes classifier.

It is located south of the A923, between the villages of Muirhead and Liff. Since 1996, the woodland has been under the ownership of the Woodland Trust, which manages it in partnership with a local community group. The area of the wood has been extended since then, including the acquisition of a further 17 acres (7 hectares) in 2009. Backmuir Wood is a diverse woodland, which is home to a variety of different tree species. It also provides a habitat for the red squirrel, a protected species in the UK. History Backmuir Wood is an ancient woodland, which was acquired by the Woodland Trust in 1996, with financial assistance from a number of sources including Scottish Natural Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund. At the time of acquisition, the area of the wood was 111 acres (45 hectares), but it has been extended while under the ownership of the Trust. In 2000, the Trust used funding from Homebase to purchase an adjacent 4-acre (1.6-hectare) field to extend the wood, as part of the \\"Woodlands for the Millennium\\" scheme in celebration of the 2000 millennium. The planting of over 8000 trees on the site began the following year, and this plantation became known as Millennium Corner. A commemorative feature, consisting of standing stones within a ring of copper beech trees, was also placed in the wood. In 2009, following a fundraising appeal, the Trust was able to extend Backmuir Wood by another 17 acres (7 hectares). Management and access Backmuir Wood is owned and managed by the Woodland Trust, in collaboration with a local Backmuir Woodland Community Group. Like all other Woodland Trust woodlands, it is open to the public. There are approximately of trail in the wood, with four major access points for walkers. The wood is popular with local residents, especially for dog walking. The Woodland Trust estimate that there are 11,000 visitors to the wood each year. Flora and fauna Backmuir Wood is a diverse woodland, containing a variety of species of tree, including oak, beech, sycamore, alder, Scots pine and rowan. Overall, around 20% of the wood is conifers, 70% broadleaves and 10% open space. Different species predominate in certain parts of the wood, with many beech trees in the south, birches in the centre, conifers in the north east, and oaks and rowans in the north west. The oldest trees in the wood are oak and beech; one of the beech trees in the wood is believed to date to the 19th century. The wood provides a habitat for red squirrels, a protected species in the UK. The squirrels can be found in Scots pine trees. Sightings of buzzards and kestrels are common in the area.

Legend Some rumours say that he was thought to be a stranded foreign sailor (some say French) who could not speak English. Other tales tell of his ship being wrecked on the rocks along the Roker coast and as he couldn't afford to rebuild it he became, in effect, shipwrecked. As he could not speak the language he could not converse with the locals, Spottee was thought by some to be a poor lunatic, and is so referred to in The Bishoprick Garland by (Sir) Cuthbert Sharp. He earned his name from the spotted shirt he wore. He set up his home in a cave, which eventually bore his name, becoming Spottee‚Äôs Cave. He earned his living by begging and doing odd jobs for local farmers. Rumour has it that he eventually died in the cave and his ghost has been spotted on stormy nights warning ships to stay away from the rocks, or alternatively that he (and now his ghost) lured ships onto the rocks and that his cave was a place of evil. The cave still retains the name of Spottee‚Äôs Cave over two hundred years after he was considered by locals as the ‚Äúboggle bo‚Äù of the children of Sunderland and Whitburn.

In 2010, 741 historical materials relating to the Yase D≈çji were designated as Important Cultural Properties. Etymology As a prince, the Emperor Tenmu (631‚Äì686) was once wounded with an arrow (ya), and went to the steam baths at Yase after which his wound rapidly healed. However, this story is unconfirmed and may be only legend. It is considered more likely that \\"Yase\\" derives from the eight (ya) rapids of the river. The term d≈çji means \\"children\\". This derives from the local hairstyle, which appeared very peculiar to the officials from the bakumatsu.Inose[1983:9] By tradition, neither men nor women of Yase cut their bangs, which was similar in appearance to the designated hairstyle of children in feudal Japan.Inose[1983:78] History Since antiquity, people living at Yase worked as handymen or palanquin-bearers for people of the temple complex of Enryaku-ji, in ≈åtsu. The guild of palanquin bearers was started in 1092, the earliest guild in Japan. In 1336, Emperor Go-Daigo used their palanquin in his escape from Kyoto and afterward exempted them from land taxation. They served as palanquin bearers of all subsequent emperors and retired emperors. In 1569, Oda Nobunaga and in 1603 Emperor Go-Y≈çzei reaffirmed their tax exemptions. Antique Japanese palanquin for a noble =Conflict= Originally, the people of Yase had the right to go into the mountains of Enryaku-ji for food and firewood, and they were proud of their tax exempt status given by the emperor. However, in the Edo era, their privileges were curtailed by the Buddhist prince Kobenhosshin- no (1669‚Äì1716) who denied the right to go into the mountains of Yase.Inose[1983:95] The people of Yase strongly and repeatedly asked the Edo Shogunate for the restoration of their rights. The sixth sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ienobu himself wrote the letters of judgement in favor of the Yase people, using simple kana letters so the people of Yase, as commoners with limited education, could understand.Inose[1983:103] For this restoration, Akimoto Tajimanokami worked for the people of Yase, such that after his death, he was enshrined and honored for his efforts. In addition, they started a folk dance in his honor, called the pardoned land dance.Inose[1983:106]Arai Hakuseki wrote that the basis of judgements was precedents.Inose[1983:105] =Meiji Era= Documents of Yase village recorded that they served as bearers of palanquins in Tokyo in the Meiji era. Citing the book Meiji no Gyoko (Travels of Emperor Meiji), Inose wrote that about 100 Yase people joined in Emperor Meiji's first trip to Tokyo in 1868 as bearers of the palanquin; ten people remained in Tokyo.Inose[1983:89‚Äì90] It was an important point when the Meiji Imperial Household Agency recognized that the Yase people would serve as bearers of Imperial palanquins. The Imperial Household Agency solved the problem of Yase's rescinded tax exemptions by paying their taxes to the shogunate.Inose[1983:110] In addition, 16 villagers were employed by the agency. Each member worked for three years, until another member came to replace him. The funeral of the mother of Emperor Meiji, Empress Eish≈ç was the largest funeral, in which 70 Yase people served as bearers of the palanquin.Inose[1983:124] Funeral of Emperor Meiji On September 14, 1912, the S≈çukaren was carried by Yase people from Momoyama Station in the suburbs of Kyoto to the Tomb of Emperor Meiji in the classical fashion, which took one hour. There was a thin rain and the road was 1 km long up a considerable slope.Inose[1983:129] Momoyama Fushimi tomb of Emperor Meiji Funeral of Emperor Taish≈ç After the funeral ceremony of Emperor Taisho, the coffin was transferred to the S≈çkaren, at the ceremony hall late at night, on February 7, 1927. They went under the east gate of Shinjuku Gyoen to the Shinjuku Gyoen Special Station.Inose[1983:136] There were eight coaches, the coffin was inside the fourth coach and Yase people rode in the last coach. The special train reached Asakawa Station, now Takao Station (Tokyo) at 1:35 am, the next day. The S≈çkaren arrived at 2:45 am, carried by 105 Yase people. They were given 10,967 yen and 2875 yen or 2950 yen as a special bonus.Inose[1983:138‚Äì139] The funeral of Emperor Taish≈ç Tama Ryo of Emperor Taish≈ç Funeral of Emperor Hirohito In 1989, the coffin of Emperor Hirohito was carried in a motor hearse; and later the s≈çkaren, the palanquin of Hirohito was carried by 50 members of Imperial Guards in classical dress inside the ceremony campus. People of Yase had asked the Imperial Household Agency to participate, but their request was rejected. Six people from Yase attended the funeral procession as observers.

These include non-profit organizations and for-profit programs. The Salvation Army's misdemeanor probation services initiated in 1975, condoned by the state of Florida, is considered to be among the first private probation services. The private probation industry grew in 1992, when \\"local and county courts began outsourcing misdemeanor probation cases to private companies to alleviate pressure on overburdened state probation officers.\\" Opponents such as the ACLU argue that private probation companies are profiting from poverty and devastating communities to a much greater extent than publicly run probation. In The New York Times, Thomas B. Edsall notes that \\"The more commercialized fee collection and probation services get, the more the costs of these services are inflicted on the poor.\\"  History  In 1841, John Augustus, a Boston cobbler, convinced a judge to grant him custody of a man convicted of public intoxication. The man would have been incarcerated, otherwise. The judge agreed, and instead, Augustus paid the man's fine and took him in. Augustus returned with the drunkard three weeks later for an evaluation. The judge perceived the man to be sober and respectable, and Augustus had found him a job. Impressed, the judge allowed Augustus to continue taking offenders into his custody for a probationary period as an alternative to imprisonment. Augustus took in over a thousand offenders, the majority of whom never returned to the criminal justice system. Augustus's method became popular, and was therefore implemented by Massachusetts as a public alternative to incarceration, and later by the other states in the United States. This slowly replaced private, voluntary probation such as that practiced by Augustus. Faced with an increase in the number of offenders in the 1970s, the state of Florida became the first to begin private probation. In 1975 Florida authorized the Salvation Army Misdemeanor Probation program. In 1989 both Missouri and Tennessee passed laws allowing private entities to supervise misdemeanor offenders. In 1991 a new law in Georgia with similar content became the catalyst for the founding of private probation firms based in that state, such as Professional Probation Services, Inc. (founded in 1992) a subsidiary of Universal Health Services Inc., Sentinel Offender Services (founded in 1993), and Judicial Correction Services (established in 2001).  United States  About ten states now contract probation to private companies. Private probation can take the form of a for-profit private probation agency, or a non-profit community-based private treatment provider. Private probation agencies usually model their practices after the bail bond system. Probationers would post a bond as insurance for their good behavior. Meeting probation conditions, such as attending court on a certain date, means that the probationer regains the bond. Failure to meet probation conditions means the probationer loses the bond. Most private probation agencies tend to specialize in certain kinds of offenses in an attempt to reduce their overall caseload. Private probation dates to 1992 in the United States when there was a rapid increase in incarceration. The United States currently incarcerates over two million people, more than any other country in the world, both in absolute numbers and in proportion to its population. Overcrowded prisons have turned to community corrections to relieve their institutions‚Äîover five million people are currently serving probation or parole in the United States. However, recidivism rates are high, and overworked probation officers have difficulty monitoring and managing so many probationers, many of whom were sentenced to community corrections simply due to overcrowding. As a result, since 1992 probation has also implemented privatization in order to relieve its caseload. In the United States private probation firms that provide offender-funded misdemeanor probation include Professional Probation Services, Inc. (founded in 1992) a subsidiary of Universal Health Services Inc., Sentinel Offender Services (founded in 1993), Judicial Correction Services (established in 2001), Southeast Corrections (founded in 2005), AD Probation, JAG Probation, Georgia Probation Services (founded in 1993 in Trenton, Georgia) and CSRA Probation with services offered in Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Colorado, Utah, Washington, Missouri, Michigan, Montana and Idaho. =Alabama= Judicial Correction Services provides probation services to court systems in Alabama. In 2012 Circuit Court Judge Hub Harrington in a well-documented case regarding private probation characterized the contract between Judicial Correction Services, a private probation company and the Harpersville Municipal Court as an extortion racket which created a debtors' prison condoned by local elected officials. In 2013 a bill in Alabama to extend private probation from local municipal courts to state courts was supported by the private probation industry. = Georgia = Georgia uses private probation more than any other state, with approximately 500,000 citizens on probation last year. The situation there has been likened to \\"debtor's prison\\". Human Rights Watch estimated that private probation firms in Georgia collect approximately $40 million a year from the people they supervise, mostly those who cannot afford to pay fines associated with low- level misdemeanors such as stop sign violations, illegal lane change, or trespassing. In 1991 a new law in Georgia authorized formal contracts under the Probation Services Agreement between local governing authorities and private organizations to supervise misdemeanor offenders. Georgia Legislature county-run probation services for misdemeanor cases were suspended and replaced with out-sourced private firms since c.1992. This was the catalyst for the founding of Georgia-based private probation firms such as Professional Probation Services, Inc. (founded in 1992) a subsidiary of Universal Health Services Inc., Sentinel Offender Services (founded in 1993), and Judicial Correction Services (established in 2001). Since 1996 the number of private probation contracts in Georgia had dramatically increased. By 2012 Georgia, with many rural areas, was one of only approximately 10-12 states that had private probation policies and services. The Georgia bill, called House Bill (HB) 837 would have extended more probation services to private companies to manage the probation periods of minor offenders while exempting the companies from Georgia's open-records laws. Georgia Governor Nathan Deal vetoed Bill 837 in May 2014. Sentinel Offender Services provides probation service to over ninety courts in Georgia. The private probation firm Sentinel Offender Services and the Richmond County State Court were accused of abuse and civil rights violations. \\"In Augusta, Georgia numerous former probationers accuse Sentinel Offender Services of ignoring their inability to pay hundreds and even thousands of dollars in company fees.\\" Sentinel Offender Services no longer operates in the state of Georgia; however, the company, contracts and employees were bought by CSRA, who is also headquartered in Augusta. On November 24, 2014, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that Sentinel had violated Georgians' rights by charging them \\"tolls,\\" a term for service fees charged by the probation company on top of government fines, which can extend beyond the duration of the actual probation. Georgians may now be able to get money they paid in \\"tolls\\" back from Sentinel and other probation companies in the state.  Georgia's regulatory system  According to the Human Rights Watch 2014 report, Georgia 's courts \\"put more people on probation with private companies than any other state\\" but Georgia also has a \\"more advanced regulatory and oversight model than any other state that permits privatized probation services.\\" The Administrative Office of the Courts in Georgia in 2001, considered the \\"oversight mechanism and use of local judicial control in Georgia\\" as a potential \\"national model for misdemeanor probation privatization.\\" However, as early as 2001 there were criticisms of private probation prompting a call for more \\"Advisory Council oversight and local accountability through careful contract crafting and performance supervision by the courts will be needed to insure the future success of private probation.\\" In their 2012 report to the Georgia Criminal Justice Reform Council, the Southern Center for Human Rights (SCHR) noted the conviction of former Chairman of the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles Bobby Whitworth, who during the 2000 General Assembly session in Georgia accepted a $75,000 bribe from Detention Management Services, Inc. for influencing the passing of Senate Bill 474. This private probation legislation, would have \\"effectively transferred supervision of approximately 25,000 misdemeanants from the State Department of Corrections to the individual counties.\\" Private probation firms like DMS would have benefited greatly from potential individual county contracts. When Sentinel acquired Detention Management Services, Inc., their books showed the $75,000 as a lobbyist payment for passage of the legislation. The bill was withdrawn. = Florida = Judicial Correction Services provides probation services to court systems in Florida. Salvation Army does as well. = Mississippi = Judicial Correction Services provides probation services to court systems in Mississippi. = Michigan = Sentinel Offender Services is active in several Michigan counties. In September 2014, the ACLU brought suit against Michigan for imprisoning a woman who had fled to an emergency room after her boyfriend threatened her with a gun. Because she had been cited for driving without a license and had outstanding fines, she was arrested and sentenced to six months in prison.  United Kingdom  In 2006 the UK Home Secretary John Reid announced that UK Probation Service would be opened to the private probation industry. Union representative Harry Fletcher argued that the data proves that the Probation Service was working well. In 2013 the United Kingdom announced plans to shift probation service contracts worth PS450 million from the regional probation trusts to the private probation industry (companies such as the large construction company Carillion plc). More than 200,000 offenders each year would be supervised by private probation companies. Coventry MP Jim Cunningham argued that the public probation system is \\"a social service dealing with human needs and human problems, whereas a private company runs on profit and sometimes they tend to take shortcuts to make that profit.\\" The National Association of Probation Officers calls the subcontracting \\"a disgrace.\\" In May 2014 Bob Jones, police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands, called the controversial scheme to use the private probation industry as \\"reckless.\\" Jones argued that \\"changes could lead to higher crime because they would mean the end of a successful scheme which was keeping crime down, called integrated offender management.\\"  Criticism  = Lack of oversight = The American Probation and Parole Association (APPA) began endorsing private sector services \\"to enhance or supplement supervision and casework services\\" in 1987. Although states are increasingly privatizing community corrections, some critics argue that private probation is less subject to the standards of oversight and regulation that public probation is held to. Private probation agencies generally require less certification, license, education, training, and employment recommendations than required of probation officers in the employ of the state. Moreover, while a heavy caseload is burdensome to the state, for a private agency, heavy caseloads can be profitable and are often planned for, even if services for individual clients deteriorate. States rarely employ minimum standards for private probation agencies. As such, agencies have less incentive to report violations, and there is usually less oversight requiring them to do so.  Probation for profit  Since the 1970s in Texas there have been a number of offender-funded initiatives designed to increase county probation services by making probationers pay for a large part of their own supervision. According to a National Institute of Justice 1992 paper, = Offender-funded private probation model = Since the 1970s, the Texas State Legislature has enacted a number of initiatives designed to help county probation departments increase their total revenues by requiring probationers to pay for a substantial proportion of their own supervision costs. Sentinel Offender Services claims to have pioneered the offender-funded model of private probation services in 1992 and to have saved the tax payer \\"hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars.\\" In an environment where municipal courts across the United States are under considerable financial strain, private probation companies such as Judicial Correction Services, who are \\"offender-funded\\" are able to provide the service for free to local authorities while turning a substantial profit. A distinction is made between the \\"offender-funded\\" private probation model or \\"probation for profit\\" and private probation which is not in itself problematic. Problems arise when \\"public officials allow probation companies to profit by extracting fees directly from probationers, and then fail to exercise the kind of oversight needed to protect probationers from abusive and extortionate practices. All too often, offenders on private probation are threatened with jail for failing to pay probation fees they simply cannot afford, and some spend time behind bars.\\" In their report Human Rights Watch argue that leading private probation firms like Sentinel Offender Services and Judicial Correction Services, who face \\"serious allegations of abusive practices\\" have lacked government oversight. In 2014 a Washington Post journalist listed some of the perils of private probation which included conflicting goals. Private enterprise must make profits and the more paying clients private probation companies have in the form of probationers, the more they earn for their equity firms. Probation programs seek rehabilitation so that people are \\"off of probation, out of the criminal justice system.\\" Others argue that the financial interests of for- profit probation companies may lead to a deterioration of services or to corruption, both of which would disrupt the needs of offenders and communities. In one example, a member of the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles was convicted on public corruption charges for accepting a bribe from a private probation agency. States generally forbid governmental officials from maintaining interests in private probation agencies, and some require that agencies post a surety bond to be allowed to supervise probationers.

This is close to Harraton Hall, the home of the Lambton family. A song and jig tune bearing her name, popular in her lifetime, are still current locally.  Life  A surprising amount is known about the life of Alice (Elsie) Marley, from birth and marriage records, from newspaper accounts of her death, and from Cuthbert Sharp's notes on the song about her life, prepared in consultation with her grandson. Her birth name, Alice Harrison, being common, a firm identification seems impossible, but she may well be the Alice Harrison christened in Houghton-le-Spring, on 24 August 1713.https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:JMT3-BYW This is not far from Chester-le-Street, and this birth date is consistent with the date of her marriage. In 1735 https://familysearch.org/search/collection/igi/results?count=20&query;=%2Bgivenname%3AAlice~%20%2Bsurname%3AHarrison~%20%2Bbirth_year%3A1710-1725~%20%2Bspouse_givenname%3ARalph~%20%2Bspouse_surname%3AMarley~%20%2Bsubcollection_id%3A5&igi;=(1%202) she became the first wife of Ralph Marley, who kept a public house at Picktree, near Chester-le-Street, County Durham. They had eight children. She was well-known in her lifetime - in 1765 at Beverley races, one of the horses was Mr. Wormley's bay mare, 'Alcey Marley' https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000863/17650608/009/0002?browse=true,, suggesting her name was well known. According to Cuthbert Sharp, writing some 50 years after her death, the inn bore the sign of the Swan, with the appropriate motto:- ‚ÄúThe Swan doth love the water clear, And so does man good ale and beer.‚Äù She was a handsome, buxom, bustling landlady, and by her efforts, made the Swan a financial success. However, on their march towards Scotland during the Jacobite risings in 1745, the Dutch mercenary troops used the inn for target practice, and it remained \\"in a tattered condition\\" for many years after. She suffered from a long, severe illness, and on 5 August 1768, was found drowned in a flooded coal pit near Vigo, near Birtley, Tyne and Wear.OS reference NZ280547Newcastle Chronicle, August 13th 1768. It was presumed she had accidentally fallen in, and because of her weak state, had been unable to climb out. The report in the Newcastle Chronicle reads \\"Thursday sen'night, in the morning, Alice Marley, Vigo, near Chester-le-Street, remarkable for the celebrated song composed upon her, was found drowned in a pond near that place.\\" The account in the Newcastle Courant is more detailed: \\"Yesterday sen'night the well-known Alice Marley, of Picktree near Chester-le-Street, shaking in fever, got out of her house and went into a field where there was an old coal(pit) full of water, which she fell into, and was drowned.\\" Both make clear she had been a local celebrity. Her youngest son, Harrison Marley, in turn had a son (her grandson) called Ralph, who was known to be alive c. 1825. Ralph was cited as one of Cuthbert Sharp's informants in his notes on the song \\"Elsie Marley\\".  The song and tune  Elsie Marley gave her name to a spirited and lively jig, as well as a humorous song to the same tune, about her life, indexed by Roud as Roud 3065. The lyric is in the same metre as the verse on the sign of The Swan, which may well be deliberate. One verse of the song, not printed in Ritson's early version,http://www.farnearchive.com/detail.asp?id=N3404701 but noted by Sharp some years later as being current in the neighbourhood, reads: Elsie Marley wore a straw hat But now she's getten a velvet cap The Lambton lads mun pay for that Do ye ken Elsie Marley, hinny? This hints at a relationship between her and the sons of the Lambton family, two of whom served as M.P. for Durham. It might be a later addition, but may well have been omitted from the early printed text to avoid offending the Lambtons. The words in the last verse, \\"hoping there's none I do offend\\" tends to confirm the latter. It is mentioned as \\"the celebrated song\\" in the Newcastle Chronicle's account of her death. The words were first published by Joseph Ritson in The Bishopric Garland, 1784. The song is described as ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù in The Bishoprick Garland of 1834 compiled by Sir Cuthbert Sharp The song also appears in Rhymes of Northern Bards compiled by John Bell. Both the tune and the song are still widely known in the North-East; the tune was recorded by Tom Clough on his HMV recording of smallpipes in 1929, and the song by the High Level Ranters on their 1976 album Ranting Lads. The tune is also referenced in the lyrics of Byker Hill, another traditional North-East folk song. An early and consistent three-strain version appears in a collection by Robert Topliff,http://www.farnearchive.com/detail.asp?id=F0103401 from about 1815. A less consistent, but similar, 4-strain version appeared at about the time of Elsie's death in Robert Bremner's 'Collection of Scots Reels', compiled in Edinburgh, and a rather different 2-strain version is found in the William Vickers manuscript from Newcastle, dated 1770.http://www.farnearchive.com/detail.asp?id=R0307301 The distinctive harmonic pattern of this mixolydian mode tune is very common in Northumbrian and Border music, and specifically music for Border pipes. Some 13 of the 40 tunes in the William Dixon manuscript follow the same scheme, or one of its variants.The Master Piper ‚Äì Nine Notes That Shook the World, William Dixon (1733), edited Matt Seattle 1995, Dragonfly Music, ; 3rd edition, edited Matt Seattle 2011, . There were tunes with this structure well before the appearance of this tune, but it is perhaps the best known example of the type.

Christian church service before Parliament session - first, out with the Jew\\"!. De Notenkraker (Dutch: \\"The Nutcracker\\") was a Dutch political and satirical weekly magazine published between 1907 and 1936. In 1902 Het Zondagsblad appeared for the first time, a Sunday supplement to the newspaper Het Volk of the Social Democratic Workers' Party (Dutch acronym: SDAP). In 1907 the supplement was renamed De Notenkraker. Unlike Het Volk, which contained mostly heavy political articles with few illustration, De Notenkraker contained many cartoons and other illustrations. Famous cartoonist from the early period of the periodical included Leendert Jordaan and Albert Hahn, senior. Hahn drew cartoons against the Dutch monarchy and Abraham Kuyper (prime minister 1901-1905 and founder of the Anti-Revolutionary Party. Other contributors to De Notenkraker included Anton Kristians (pseudonym Toon Krias) and starting in 1920 the Belgian George Van Raemdonck. Het Volk and De Notenkraker chiefly criticized the close relationship between the monarchy and the capitalist bourgeoisie. The monarchy was attacked as a supported of the ruling class, which did little to help the working classes. As more socialist splinter groups appeared, such as the Communist Party of the Netherlands and the Independent Socialist Party, the periodicals also criticised groups on the left. By the beginning of World War One in 1914, many cartoons criticized militarism and war. Notably, Albert Hahn Sr. created powerful illustrations about the destruction that war sows. Hahn died before the end of the war in 1918. After that De Notenkraker's quality went down noticeably, until the arrival of a new generation of illustrators in the 1930s. At the end of 1918 De Notenkraker has about 8000 subscribers, compared to about 30,000 for Het Volk and almost 40,000 SDAP party members. A subscriptions to Het Volk at that time cost 0.20 guilders per week or 2.50 guilders (a rijksdaalder) per three months. A subscription including De Notenkraker cost 25 cents per week, or 3.50 guilders per three months, 4.15 guilders in the Dutch East Indies. In 1919, A.M. de Jong became editor of Het Volk, and a year later he was made editor of art and serials as well. In 1922 he introduced as part of the paper the massively popular illustrated series 'Bulletje en Boonestaak'. He wrote the text himself and George Van Raemdonck illustrated them. A.M. de Jong was also editor of De Notenkraker, for which he wrote the serial 'Het Verraad' (\\"Treason\\"). When Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in 1933, German politics was dealt with on numerous covers and in numerous illustrations, and illustrated articles. Illustrators from this time included George Van Raemdonck, Tjerk Bottema, Jan Rot, Albert Hahn jr., Paul van Reen and Albert Funke K√ºpper. Funke K√ºpper became the driving force behind De Notenkraker starting in the 1920s. After his early death in 1934 the paper was discontinued; the last issue was in July 1936. After Funke K√ºpper's death other socialist publications became popular with more photographs such as Wij and the VARA Radio Guide.

It attracted large investments before collapsing in February 1995. The Bombay Stock Exchange closed for three days after the crash. In 2005, a rehabilitation scheme for the company was devised by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction. Rise and fall Pavan Sachdeva took over his father's Delhi-based shoe export business, mostly serving Western Europe, and launched the company as MS Shoes in 1986. He raised money from investors and borrowed large sums from financial institutions and banks. Sachdeva used intriguing ads created by the Delhi branch of Rediffusion to attract investors. During the period 1986‚Äì1993, the company won various export awards from the Council of Leather Exports, from Delhi Administration, and from the National Productivity Council. The company came out with its first public issue in September, 1992, followed by a rights- cum-public issue of fully convertible debentures in November/December, 1993. In February 1995 the company made another rights-cum-public issue. The issue was to finance its diversification, setting up a twin-hotel project and yarn project, but it was undersubscribed and was subsequently devolved. Shares were trading at Rs24 in 1993, and peaked at Rs502.5 in January 1995. The underwriters to the public issue have been held to be liable to the extent of Rs. 98 crores. Apparently the share prices had been manipulated. When MS Shoes crashed in March 1995 the collateral effects were so severe that the Bombay Stock Exchange had to be closed for three days. More than Rs2.7 billion was lost. Investigations and charges The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) started an investigation in 1995. In June 1997 the CBI sought permission from the government to lay charges against senior officials of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and SBI Capital Markets, a subsidiary of the State Bank of India. Sachdeva was charged with violating the Companies Act and the Prevention of Corruption Act. The Central Bureau of Investigation filed a closure report on the MS Shoes case in September 1998, which was accepted by the court. In 2003, the CBI reopened the case. Several civil and criminal charges were filed. In April 2003 a Delhi Metropolitan Court issued a non- bailable warrant against Sachdeva for failing to pay back money owed to the Indian Air Force Benevolent Association. In June 2003 the Delhi High Court ordered that the company be sent to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). Few companies survive this process. In November 2005, MS Shoes was declared a sick company by the BIFR, and a plan was drawn up for its rehabilitation.Order , Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction Diversifications Before its collapse, the company attempted the bids floated by Hudco in July, 1994 for 5 star hotel land and a constructed four star hotel by Hudco comprising 363 rooms, 9 restaurants and 25 shops. The promoter Pavan Sachdeva made a successful bid for the properties. The total bid was Rs. 177.10 crores for which Hudco issued the allotment letters. When the public issue was devolved, Hudco cancelled the allotments. MS Shoes also attempted to go into the yarn manufacture business. The land value of Rs. 177.10 crores has increased more than ten times. MS Shoes has offered to buy the public shares to its existing public shareholders and presently promoters holding is 95%. Later development The production and export turnover of MS Shoes increased from Rs. 25 crores in 1993 to Rs. 171.93 crores in 1995.Order , Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction The company came up with public issues which were oversubscribed by more than 50 times. The reasons of sickness was devolvement of public issue and cancellation as well as forfeiture by Hudco of the amount paid of Rs. 68.68 crores by MS Shoes. The promoters brought in Rs. 41.20 crores as on 31.3.2011 and Rs. 22.08 crores in March, 2014 which have been approved to be converted into equity.

Overview Bremerhaven Army Airfield (Also known as Seefliegerhorst Weddewarden) was used by the United States Army and Air Force as a base in Northern West Germany during the Cold War to support the American presence in the Bremen area. It was headquarters of the US Army Garrison Bremerhaven which performed transshipment of supplies and military equipment and hosted transport and support units. The USAF stationed the 606th Tactical Control Squadron (a mobile radar unit) at the site and it was a major communications control unit. The United States Navy stationed the Weser River Patrol at the station until their task was transferred to the German Coast Guard, and operated a Naval Security Group unit in the same compound until late 1972. The airfield was closed in 1993 as part of the US drawdown of military forces in Germany after the end of the Cold War. History = Origins = Construction of the airfield began in 1925 between the villages of Speckenb√ºttel and Weddewarden, north of the harbour area of Weserm√ºnde. In the immediate surrounding area there were no buildings. A year after construction began the airfield was taken into service. In 1927 German airline Lufthansa opened a support facility at the airfield and opened services to the German Frisian islands and Helgoland. After the National-Socialists assumed power in Germany in 1933, the decision was taken to expand the airfield into a military air base. As a consequence the airfield was taken over by the Luftwaffe in 1935, which constructed several large hangars and barracks on the northwestern edge of the airfield. The flying occurred from a grass field, with aircraft taking off into the wind from any direction. Only the aircraft parking ramp and the ring taxiway were hardened. On the southern end of the airfield the Nordhafen was dug out. At the time it was known as the \\"Zeppelinhafen\\" (Zeppelin-port) or the Flugzeugtr√§gerbecken (aircraftcarrier dock), intended as berth for the German aircraft carrier \\"Graf Zeppelin\\". To the east another dock was dug, intended for the carriers sistership (only known as \\"Flugzeugtr√§ger B\\"). The carrier \\"Graf Zeppelin\\" was 85% complete in 1940 when all work was ordered to be stopped, and the ship never was completed. =World War II= During World War II the airfield was used mainly by German Navy flying units (Seeflieger), and in October 1942 the Minensuchgruppe I (Mine Searching Group I) was established, flying Ju-52MS aircraft, fitted with a large electromagnetic mine detonating ring to locate mines in the coastal waters of Bremen. In April 1945 the airfield became the replacement site for the development of the V-weapons. The Erprobungsstelle (Test Unit) Karlshagen, better known today as Peenem√ºnde- West was in danger over being overrun by the Soviet Red Army so all of its materiel and personnel were moved west to Bremerhaven. Development of rocket weapons was to take place here from now on, and the large hangars were filled with fuselages and parts of Fi-103, X-4, BV-346 and the gliderbomb Hs-293. The base was partially destroyed when British Forces moved into the area on 7 May 1945, one day before the official German Capitulation. =United States use= Although northwest Germany was to become a British occupation zone, an exclave was granted to the US Army in the area between Bremen and Nordholz. The US needed a support point with a harbour, to allow the unhindered support of US forces in the American Occupation Zone in Southern Germany. The US Army moved into the airfield as early as May 1945, and used the port to return troops from Europe to the United States. Until 1947 the US airforce also used the Nordholz Airbase. Initially several locations were used by the Americans, but over time they were reduced in number until by the 1960s they all merged into the joint location referred to as the \\"Staging Area\\" and became home to units of the US Army Terminal Command, Europe (USATCEUR), US Navy, US Coast Guard and US Air Force. In 1973 the barracks were renamed Carl Schurz Barracks. After the Cold War ended the US reduced their presence in Germany. In an effort to further reduce costs most of the goods were sent through the Dutch port of Rotterdam, ending the need for Bremerhaven. This ended the American presence and the military units were withdrawn in 1993, leaving only a small civilian contingent to coordinate the remaining transshipments. Today, the former airfield has been redeveloped into a large storage yard for the Bremerhaven shipping facilities. References * Seefliegerhorst Weddewarden/Bremerhaven AAF (R-57) * Johnson, David C.

In accordance with the constitutional arrangements of the day, he was obliged to resign as an MP and fight a by-election. Electoral history Candidates Anderson‚Äôs Unionist opponent was again Capt.

There was no Labour candidate, even though they had contested the seat in 1906 and January 1910, finishing a poor third on both occasions. Campaign The contest was dominated by the government‚Äôs legislation on National Insurance and the uncertainties this legislation would produce for individual electors, particularly small manufacturers and shopkeepers. Result Although there was no Labour candidate, Anderson was thought to have lost some support among working-class voters because of his opposition to Labour candidates in other recent elections.The Times, 20 December 1911 p10 After six years of Liberal government, the electors of North Ayrshire reverted to their more traditional allegiances, perhaps rebelling against the background of the rapid social changes being introduced by H H Asquith‚Äôs reforming administration.The Times, 22 December 1911 p7 Aftermath After the election, Anderson agreed to be re-adopted as prospective Liberal candidate for North Ayrshire, expressing a wish to contest the seat again.The Times, 23 January 1912 p7 A General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915.

It is found in Asia and Africa. The nominate subspecies, Colotis aurora aurora is found in India and Sri Lanka. The other subspecies, Colotis aurora evarne is found in Mauritania, Senegal, the Gambia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, and southern Arabia. The habitat consists of savanna and shrubland. The larvae feed on Capparaceae species, including Cadaba fruticosa. Taxonomy This species was described by Pieter Cramer in 1780 as Papilio aurora. But many authors incorrectly mentioned this as Colotis eucharis Fabricius, 1775. This happened because Fabricius incorrectly placed Papilio eucharis Drury, 1773 as a synonym of Papilio hyparete Linnaeus, 1758 and applied the same name eucharis to this species. To resolve this confusion, Godart altered the oldest name (eucharis, Drury) to epicharis, instead of correcting the incorrectly imposed name (eucharis, Fabricius). Westwood reverted this change. Description The upperside of the males has a pure white ground colour. The forewing has the base and costa speckled with black scales near the base; has a broad apical orange-yellow patch, with the inner edge straight and margined with gamboge yellow; the patch is sometimes without speckles, but often bears a black diffuse spot on its lower inner edge which may or may not extend to the termen below the orange; costa, apex and termen, the latter nearly up to the tornus, edged and festooned beyond the orange area with black. Hindwing of the male has black spots at the apices of the veins that vary in size and end on the termen, also a diffuse preapical black spot on the costa. Underside is pure white in most specimens, suffused, except on the disc of the forewing, with pinkish yellow, and at base of the same wing with pure sulphur yellow; apical orange patch and black terminal markings on the upperside of the forewing show through by transparency, the former crossed by a sinuous fuscous band that ends in a black diffuse spot. Hindwing is shaded with ochraceous at base and with a fuscous preapical spot on costa, also a few scattered transverse fuscous striations and small spots. Many specimens have the preapical spot continued as an obscure fuscous band across the wing and bear a series of large terminal fuscous spots that correspond to the black spots on the upperside. Both forewing and hindwings with black discocellular dots. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black; antennae speckled with white on the sides, head and thorax clothed with short greyish-brown hairs; beneath the palpi, thorax and abdomen white. Female has the ground colour similar to the male; the markings differ from those of the male as follows: Upperside, forewing: base and costa more heavily irrorated with greyish-black scales; discocellular spot larger; apical area black, with three enclosed elongate orange spots; inner margin of black area irregularly sinuate and diffuse, extended shortly inwards in interspace 3; a transverse black spot across middle of interspace 1. Hindwing: base irrorated more sparsely than in the forewing with greyish-black scales; preapical spot on costa and terminal spots much larger; in a few specimens there is an obscure transverse posterior discal fascia. Underside: markings similar to but very much broader, more heavily marked, and more prominent than those in the male; the transverse fuscous strife and dots more numerous. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male.

Al Uyun, Al Jiwa, and Oyounaljewa, ) is a Saudi governorate in northwestern Al-Qassim Region, less than northwest of Buraydah, the provincial capital city. The name translates to The Valley's Ponds, and it derives from the water ponds which used to surround the area. It is most famous for the past societies which used to live in the area and its ancient historic sites. People of Al Jiwa are distinguished from other people in Al-Qassim Region by their accent. History Many historic as well as pre-historic societies have settled in the Al Jiwa land. One example is Banu Abs, who gave birth to the famous knight, adventurer, lover, and poet Antarah ibn Shaddad. Moreover, Al Jiwa contains many Thamudic patterns (e.g. Thamudic petroglyphs). In recent history, many of the region inhabitants' forefathers were among who are called Al Oqilat, which was a group that traveled long distances to trade, work for money, and bring back merchandise. Others were farmers and worked either in harvest or raising livestock. The name of Al Jiwa has been mentioned in both Islamic and Pre-Islamic-era Arabic poetry by poets such as Antarah ibn Shaddad, Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma, Imru' al-Qais, Kumait Ibn Zaid, and Hassan Bin Thabit. Geography To distinguish between Al Jiwa and Uyun AlJiwa: *Al Jiwa' (without \\"Uyun\\") translates to \\"valley\\" and refers to the valley that contains the governorate *Uyun AlJiwa refers to both the governorate and the main city Besides that, the governorate consists of 8 other towns such as Ghaf Al Jiwa (also called Al Ghaf), Rawdh Al Jiwa (also called Ar Rawdh), Authal, and Al Slubiya.

In 1882, he succeeded his brother, Sir Hugh Allan, of Ravenscrag, in the Allan family's Canadian enterprises that were centred on the Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers, but also included banking and railways. He was Master of Foxhounds for the Montreal Hunt. Early life Born in 1822 at Saltcoats, Ayrshire, Andrew Allan was the fourth son of Captain Alexander Allan and his wife Jean Crawford (1782‚Äì1856). He was a first cousin of Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt and his father was a first cousin of the Scottish bard, Robert Burns. In 1819, Allan's father established the Allan Shipping Line, which became synonymous with running goods and passengers between Scotland and Montreal. After a parish education at Greenock, Andrew was brought into the family shipping business, then known as J & A Allan, of Glasgow. Of his four brothers, at this time James was running the Glasgow office, helped by Alexander; Bryce, was in charge of the Liverpool office, while Hugh was expanding the family's interests in Montreal. With the rapid growth of the business in Montreal, it was decided that Andrew would be best placed there. Shipping Offices of H & A Allan, Montreal, 1863 As a clerk, Andrew joined the newly organised shipping firm of Edmonstone, Allan & Co., of which his brother, Hugh, was partner. By 1846, Andrew had also become a partner and from 1863 the firm was known as the H & A Allan, of Montreal. Andrew worked closely with his brother in forming the Montreal Ocean Steamship Company, incorporated in 1854. By 1857, the Allan family were the sole owners, whose chief advantage over their competition was the use of iron-hulled steamships with screw propellers. The company won government mail contracts and was subsidised for the number of immigrants it brought from Britain to Canada. There was never any doubt that Hugh Allan was the driving force behind what became Canada's leading steamship company, and the multitude of his other business interests. For the most part, Andrew remained comfortably under his brother's wing. In 1870, he wrote \\"every year I have even more reason to wonder at, and admire his (Hugh's) business capabilities.\\"Biography of Andrew Allan in the Canadian Dictionary of National Biography When Hugh died in 1882, Andrew took his place as head of the Allan family's Canadian enterprises, presiding over the peak of the shipping firm's worldwide cargo and passenger activities in the 1880s and 1890s. Andrew had kept things as they were under his brother, but by 1897 it was necessary to make some major changes, in part to raise additional capital for a new fleet of ships. He presided over the dissolution of the family partnership and the creation of a steamship company with limited liability, taking the post of chairman in the Allan Line Steamship Company Limited, based in Glasgow. Andrew tirelessly represented the Allan family's shipping interests wherever they were needed. From 1873 until his death he was an influential member of the Montreal Harbour Commission and for several years he served as its chairman. Banking The Allan's Merchants Bank Building on St. James Street, Montreal. 1870 In 1861, Andrew and Hugh Allan founded the Merchant's Bank of Canada which became an important part of the Allan family's financial empire. The bank had grown with particular success in Ontario and the Canadian West to become one of Canadas most important financial institutions. In addition to being an important shareholder, Andrew was a director from its start in 1861, to 1883 when he became its president, a position he held until his death. As president, he continued the bank's policy of western expansion, seeing the bank's assets grow by one-third but its net profits falling. Since its creation, the bank had been used by the Allan family, including Andrew, to finance their personal investments, particularly in Manitoba and towards the North Western Railway. The loans taken out by the Allans were almost always outstanding, which stunted a greater percentage of its investments going into more secure bonds. Railways Andrew had enjoyed relative success in shipping and banking, but his involvement with the Manitoba and North Western Railway Company of Canada was a failure. The Allan family had invested heavily in the venture and Andrew, connected with the railway since 1883, was its president by 1892. Despite expansive and enthusiastic lobbying, by 1894 the Allans could not afford the interest payments on its debt and the company was put into receivership. A dispute quickly arose between the railway's bondholders and the Allan family over control of the company's assets. The fact that Andrew took little direct part in the negotiations perhaps indicated the rise of younger family members within the Allan hierarchy. In 1898, after extensive litigation, administration of the company's assets passed to a receiver representing the bondholders. Andrew's nephew, H. Montagu Allan managed to pass the lease of the railway line from Portage la Prairie to Yorkton to the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1900. Further business interests Andrew Allan was president of several manufacturing enterprises, including the Montreal Rolling Mills Company; Cornwall Woollen Manufacturing; Dominion Oil Cloth; Canadian Rubber Company; Windsor Hotel of Montreal and the Montreal Lumber Company. In 1883, he co-founded the Citizens Gas Company of Montreal in an unsuccessful attempt to challenge the Montreal Gas Company. Among others, he was a director of Confederation Life and the Montreal Telegraph Company, succeeding his brother Hugh as president of the latter in 1882.Biography of Andrew Allan at Electric Scotland Private life Carriage at Andrew Allan's, Montreal 1901 Andrew Allan was chairman of St. Paul's Church from 1872 to 1901, which under him and through his own significant financial donations became the wealthiest Presbyterian church in Canada. He was a life member of the St Andrew's Society of Montreal and served as an officer in the Royal Light Infantry of Montreal. From 1862 until his death he was president of the Montreal Sailors Institute, established to promote sobriety and morality among seamen ashore.Negotiating Identities in 19th and 20th Century Montreal (2005), Bettina Bradbury and Tamara Myers Apart from the funds collected by ships officers from their crews, (including those of the Allan Line) the institute's main source of revenue was the Allan family. His other philanthropic interests included the Montreal Protestant House of Industry and Refuge, of which he was made a life governor in 1863. He was Master of the Montreal Hunt from the 1870s, and like other members of his family he took a great interest in floriculture and horses. In comparison to his brother Hugh Allan, Andrew's business ability is often overlooked. While he lacked his brother's entrepreneurial flair and despite his failure with the railway in the Canadian West, he nonetheless steered the Allan Line through the height of its success, and when needed, stepped up to re-organize the family firm ready for his many sons and nephews on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean to take them into the 20th century.Electric Scotland's Biography of Andrew Allan He is buried with his family at Mount Royal Cemetery, Montreal. Family Mrs Allan in their conservatory, 1871 The Allan family at home in Montreal, 1871 In 1848, Andrew Allan married Isabella Ann Smith, one of the four daughters of John Smith (d.1872) of Athelstane Hall, Montreal, and his wife Betsy Rea. John Smith was a native of Athelstaneford and became one of Montreal's leading dry goods merchants. Isabella's eldest sister, Caroline, had married Andrew's brother Hugh in 1844. Mrs Allan's sister, Elizabeth, married Hartland St. Clair MacDougall (brother of George Campbell MacDougall) and the last remaining sister married James St. George Bellhouse, of the firm Bellhouse & Dillon. The Allans home, Iononteh, was a greystone mansion that dominated Upper Peel Street in the Golden Square Mile, near to Andrew's brother's house, Ravenscrag.

To date, 'Blippers' in over 170 countries worldwide have posted 3.4 million photos with close to 22 million shared comments on the site. Each photo on Blipfoto represents a single day in someone's life - so there are almost 3.5m individual days saved to date. History In October 2004, Blipfoto founder Joe Tree built a website which let him publish just one photo a day on the internet and write something about it. He set two simple rules: he could only upload one picture a day, and it had to be taken on that day. In the summer of 2006, Tree released a very rudimentary version of Blipfoto and invited 15 other people to join in. It let anyone set up a journal of their own, upload one picture a day, write some words, and comment on other people‚Äôs material. This was subsequently opened to anyone. In November 2009 the site won a BAFTA Scotland award for the best website. Following the BAFTA win, in December 2010 Blipfoto announced seed investment which allowed the business to turn from a project into a full-time venture. In 2011 it was voted as best Scottish website by arts and culture magazine The List.

Tricel's four core divisions are Water Storage, Environmental, Construction and Materials. It has production sites in 5 locations in Northern Europe including Ireland, Britain and France, which services customers in over 50 countries. Tricel currently employs 450 people and exports 75% of its products worldwide. Tricel Killarney Rebranding to Tricel The Tricel brand was established in 2002 as KMG expanded into new markets and was already an established name in a number of countries. Tricel was awarded French and German trading licences in 2011 and 2012 respectively. Due to the growing success of KMG's sub-division Tricel, on 28 March 2014 Killarney Manufacturing Group headed by its founding company Killarney Plastics underwent a rebrand which saw companies within the groups existing structure renamed to Tricel.http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&dateJO;=20130103&numTexte;=65&pageDebut;=00336&pageFin;=00340 Companies rebranding The companies included in the rebrand include: Killarney Plastics, now Tricel (Killarney); Fibreglass Sales, now Tricel (Newry) Ltd.; Gloucester Composites, now Tricel (Gloucester) Ltd.; and Tricel, now Tricel Poitiers SAS. Tricel Headquarters History Killarney Plastics was founded on 1 February 1973 by Anne and Con Stack in Killarney. Con had previously been involved in setting up Ross Products for the local health board. Ross Products manufactured cardboard boxes and traded in the town for over 30 years. Killarney Plastics started off from a small lane in Killarney, manufacturing composite and fibreglass (GRP) products which were still relatively new to the Irish market. The company also manufactured a range of products including boats and building products for people in the locality.http://www.kmggroup.eu/history.php Killarney Plastics To accommodate increased business, a new site was acquired and a small factory built in the early 1980s, also in Killarney. It was then the company started to develop its own range of products such as water-storage tanks and meter enclosures. By the early 1990s the company had expanded its range of water- storage tanks and meter enclosures and its first export sales were sent to the UK and Europe. This trend continued and soon after Killarney Plastics was being awarded contracts for Irish and U.K. utility companies such as the ESB and Bord G√°is (now Ervia). Tricel (Killarney) now employ's 135 people at its main manufacturing site located just outside Killarney. http://www.envirocentre.ie/Content.aspx?ID=bad83e1a-44d2-4719-8989-9a2a1e7716c0&PID;=dd9ec456-47e2-4521-9e86-69b60b78e8f0#KMG Growth and formation of the KMG Group Tricel (Gloucester), previously under the name of Gloucester Composites, was established in 1994 to establish a base in the UK. The function of this business was to manufacture a specific amount of products for the U.K market. Fibreglass Sales, now Tricel (Newry), was then established to distribute raw materials in Northern Ireland in 1997. As a direct result, Killarney Manufacturing Group was established in 1998 to integrate all three companies. In 1999 KMG completed its first acquisition, Technotrak, which allowed the group to diversify into the design and manufacture of civil and road safety products. At the end of 1999 KMG acquired two of the UK's water tank manufacturers, Dewey Waters and Nicholson Plastics. Dewey Waters, based in Bristol, was formed in 1956 and Nicholson Plastics with bases in Scotland and London was formed in 1968. As the size of the company had doubled, a R&D; centre and advanced manufacturing facility was constructed in Ballyspillane Industrial Estate, Killarney by the end of 1999. Diversification As part of the KMG Group diversification strategy, the group expanded into the environmental sector. A new division called Tricel was formed in 2002. Tricel was originally established to focus on the sewage treatment market, initially in Ireland and the UK and thereafter in Europe and the USA. In 2005, the KMG Group acquired A.C. Plastic Industries, a UK manufacturer of water and fire sprinkler tanks. A.C. Plastic Industries Limited was formed in 1958. The company already had business in supplying water tanks to the Middle East and North Africa which further diversified the company. Tricel Novo wastewater treatment systems Cancelled Acquisition In 2007, the KMG Group negotiated the purchase of the GRP Cold Water Tanks section from the Balmoral Group, a Scottish-based manufacturer. The merger was debated by the Office of Fair Trading and referred to the Competition Commission. However, it was ruled that it would reduce the competitiveness of the GRP cold water tank market in the UK .The deal was subsequently abandoned.> Recent Developments * 2011 - In early 2011, the KMG Group was granted a French Government Licence for its Tricel Sewage Treatment Systems. As a result, a European factory was opened in Poitiers, France to manufacture the Tricel waste water treatment systems for the French market, which has created 15 new jobs. * 2012 - In 2012, KMG Group added a new sand polishing filtration system called Sandcel to their Tricel range. This is for the Irish market.http://www.kerryman.ie/local-notes/killarney-company-launches-new- product-3163100.html Tricel was also awarded the allgemeine bauaufsichtliche Zulassung des DIBt, the German Certification to sell Tricel wastewater treatment systems in Germany. * 2013 - In March 2013 Cavus, a range of recycled structural chamber systems and access covers was launched by KMG company Gloucester Composites Limited. * 2014 - In March 2014 KMG headed by its founding company Killarney Plastics underwent a rebrand which saw companies within the groups existing structure renamed to Tricel.

The acquisition significantly increased the portfolio of fibreglass products available from Tricel.http://tricel.eu/tricel-history/ * 2016 - In May 2016, Tricel was awarded another Agr√©ment from the French Government. This Agr√©ment refers to the 'Seta' - a compact filter wastewater treatment system which uses coconut hairs to treat wastewater. This Agr√©ment allows Tricel to offer this product in the French market. * 2017 - In September, Fiberglass Supplies Leeds and Glasplies merged into Tricel Composites (GB) Ltd, and Tricel (Newry) rebranded to Tricel Composites (NI) Ltd. Along with the successful launch of Tricel Composites, the group also acquired Action Pumps Ltd, a UK based company. Ongoing growth throughout the company resulted in over 110 new employees. Tricel also achieved the French Agreement for the Seta Simplex, along with a French Agreement for the Novo pumped system. The company‚Äôs position in the French market is now firmly secured with the establishment of Tricel Avignon, which is now assembling the full range of Tricel treatment systems and supplying to the French market. *2020 Tricel have launched Engineering tools to help in the specification of cold water storage tanks which can be used across a wide selection of industry sectors. Tools developed include a Cold water storage tank capacity calculator to aid calculating the correct water capacity options for different housing types including: Domestic housing, hospitals, hostels, factories, offices, small commercial premises, hotels, guesthouses & schools.The second calculator tool developed for the water storage industry is a water storage tank size calculator to calculate what size tank will be required when entering the volume of water needed to service a building.

He was a member of the Sciences Academy of Lisbon. Biography Born into a wealthy family from Porto, Venceslau Pereira de Lima was sent abroad very young, and there made his preparatory and secondary studies. After completing these studies he returned to Portugal with professional training focused on the natural sciences, quite distinct from the course of study then propitiated by Portuguese schools. He enrolled at the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Coimbra, completing the course with high honors. This required a licensure examination in which he defended his thesis on coal plants. Soon afterwards, on 26 November 1882, he received his doctorate from the same university. In 1883 he competed for a position on the faculty of the Polytechnic Academy of Porto, having publicly presented during the competition a dissertation on the function of chlorophyll as evidence of his ability. He was ultimately nominated for the position, initiating a career that would last for nearly thirty years. During that time he chaired the institution's geology department, with a few hiatuses due to his political activity. In parallel with his academic career, he carried out a set of pioneering experiments in the field of plant paleontology. At the time, paleontology was a nascent science and the study of fossils discovered in Portuguese territory was in its early stages, with most paleontological researchers in Portugal being foreigners. The only published works by Portuguese researchers consisted of Bernardino Ant√≥nio Gomes's studies of Carboniferous plant fossils. Venceslau de Lima decided to bring together the previously-published works of foreign researchers, especially those of Daniel Sharpe, Charles Bunbury, and Oswald Heer, and from that incipient base developed a study of geology and plant paleontology in Portugal, specifically of Carboniferous land. In 1886, he was nominated as the engineer of the Geological Works Section (Sec√ß√£o dos Trabalhos Geol√≥gicos) of Portugal and was charged with the study of plant fossils in Portugal. In this position he collaborated with Carlos Ribeiro, a pioneer in Portuguese geology. In 1908 he became the President of the Geological Survey Commission (Comiss√£o dos Servi√ßos Geol√≥gicos) of Portugal, when its previous president, General Joaquim Filipe Nery da Encarna√ß√£o Delgado, died. Because of his scientific work, he was nominated for membership in the Sciences Academy of Lisbon and the Institute of Coimbra (Instituto da Coimbra). Venceslau de Lima did not limit himself to academic and scientific pursuits; soon after taking his first teaching position he became a member of the Regenerator Party, and in the name of the party was at one time or another civil governor (prefect) of Vila Real, Coimbra, and Porto. He was also elected to represent northern Portugal in the Assembly of the Republic for various terms. On 17 March 1901 he was made a Peer of the Portuguese Realm. His involvement in the Royal Courts focused on issues related to public education; he advocated for the reform of Portugal's Higher Council for Public Instruction (Conselho Superior de Instru√ß√£o P√∫blica), of which he was a member. When Ernesto Hintze Ribeiro became President of the Council of Ministers (now Prime Minister) in 1903, he asked Venceslau de Lima to assume the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs, which he did. During his tenure there were marked improvements in Portugal's relations with the United Kingdom and a commercial treaty was signed with Germany. Lima continued in the office into 1905, despite the fact Jos√© Luciano de Castro had replaced Hintze Ribero as President of the Council of Ministers. In 1909, during the death throes of the Portuguese constitutional monarchy, Venceslau de Lima was asked to lead one of the last regimes of the constitutional monarchy, serving as President of the Council of Ministers from 14 May to 22 December 1909, and during the same time was also Minister for the Kingdom (Ministro do Reino). During his long political career, he was also a member of the Council of the State (Conselho do Estado), Mayor of Porto, and director of the Medical-Surgical School of Porto (Escola M√©dico-Cir√∫rgica do Porto). He was also vice-president of the executive commission of the National Institute for Assistance to Consumptives (Instituto de Assist√™ncia Nacional aos Tuberculosos) and a member of the Porto Employers Commission (Patronato Portuense). Venceslau de Lima was also a viticulturist, introducing on his properties various technical improvements that were new to Portuguese viticulture. He was president of the Anti-Phylloxera Commission of the North and helped develop technical solutions to the parasite's destruction of vineyards. When the Portuguese Republic was founded in 1910, he refused, as a monarchist, to work for the government, choosing instead to resign any and all public posts he held. Having moved away from politics in the last years of his life, he focused once again on scientific research. He was preparing a study on Portuguese coal lands when he died. Decorations Venceslau de Lima was a Commander and Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword, the Order of Saint James of the Sword, the Order of Christ, and the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi√ßosa. He also received various foreign decorations, including the Legion of Honour of France, the Order of Charles III and the Order of Isabella the Catholic of Spain, the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus of Italy, the Royal Victorian Order of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the Order of Leopold of Belgium. Published works Over a thirty-year period Venceslau de Lima published a wide range of works on paleontology and the geology of coal deposits, including: * Not√≠cia s√¥bre os vegetais f√≥sseis da flora neocomiana do solo portugu√™s (Notice on the plant fossils of the flora neocomiana of Portuguese soil) * Monografia do g√™nero Dicranophillum (Sistema Carb√≥nico) (Monograph of the genus Dicranophillum [Carboniferous System]) * Notice sur une algue pal√®ozoique (Notice on a Paleozoic algae) * Not√≠cia s√¥bre as camadas da s√©rie permo-carb√≥nica do Bussaco (Notice on the layers of the Permo-Carboniferous series of Bussaco) * Note sur une nouvel Eurypterus rotliegendes (Notice on a novel Eurypterus rotliegendes) References * Jorge de Macedo de Oliveira Sim√µes, Biografia dos Ge√≥logos Portugueses.

He is regarded both as a Portuguese neo-realist and a novelist of Angolan literature. Biography Born in Mozambique, Castro Soromenho was the son of Artur Ernesto de Castro Soromenho, governor of Lunda, and Stela Fernan√ßole de Le√ßa Monteiro, a native of Porto from a Cape Verdean family. When he was one year old, they moved to Angola. Between 1916 and 1925, he attended primary and secondary school in Lisbon. He then returned to Angola, where he worked for an Angolan diamond company. Following that, he began an entry-level position in government administration, serving in the hinterlands in the eastern region of the colony. Later, he became an editor of the newspaper Di√°rio de Luanda. In 1937 he returned to Lisbon where he worked at several newspapers such as Humanidade (the weekly edition of the Di√°rio Popular), A Noite, Jornal da Tarde, O S√©culo, Seara Nova, O Diabo, O Primeiro de Janeiro and Dom Casmurro. He also collaborated on an account of the Portuguese explorers in Africa, No. 12 of the magazine Mundo liter√°rio (1946‚Äì1948).Mundo liter√°rio : seman√°rio de cr√≠tica e informa√ß√£o liter√°ria, cient√≠fica e art√≠stica (1946‚Äì1948) [c√≥pia digital, Hemeroteca Digital] In 1949, he married Mercedes de la Cuesta in Argentina. As a consequence of having criticized the Salazar regime in Portugal, he was forced to leave for exile in France in 1960. He later went to the United States, where he taught at the University of Wisconsin for six months in 1961Russell G.

He returned to France in August 1961 and worked at the magazines Pr√©sence Africane and R√©volution. In December 1965, he went to live in Brazil, where he spent the rest of his life, teaching courses in the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Humanities at the University of S√£o Paulo and at the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Humanities at Araraquara. He also dedicated himself to the study of Angolan ethnography, having been one of the founders of the Center for African Studies at the University of S√£o Paulo.

Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Shias and Ahmadis among other religious minorities often face discrimination and at times are even subjected to violence. In some cases Christian churches and Ahmadi mosques and the worshippers themselves have been attacked. Khawaja Nazimuddin, the 2nd Prime Minister of Pakistan, stated: \\"I do not agree that religion is a private affair of the individual nor do I agree that in an Islamic state every citizen has identical rights, no matter what his caste, creed or faith be\\". The State of Pakistan has particularly remained a discriminatory law enforcer against Non-Muslims since independence. One of the significant issues being faced by minority communities is the abuse of the blasphemy law. People belonging to minority religions are always considered as falsely accused of using derogatory remarks against the Prophet Muhammad which can result in fines, lengthy prison sentences, and sometimes the death penalty. Often these accusations are made to settle personal vendettas and, due to the bias against minorities, victims are often immediately presumed guilty without any substantive evidence. According to 1951 census, Non-Muslims constituted 14.20% of total Pakistan's (West Pakistan and East Pakistan) population. In West Pakistan (now Pakistan), the Non-Muslims constituted 3.44% of the total population while East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) had a significant share comprising 23.20 per cent of the population therein. One reason for low Non- Muslim percentage is because of higher birth rates among the Muslims. A report compiled by Members of the European Parliament a tributes multiple reason for decline of minority population including communal violence and forced conversions. Another reason was due to constant migration of India and Pakistan's respective minorites after the partition of India in 1947. However, the main reason as to why the population of minorities declined was due to the separation of East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh) which constituted almost 18% of Pakistan's Hindu population according to the 1961 Pakistani census. After the independence of Bangladesh, all minorities (mostly Hindus) that lived in the former East Pakistan were no longer counted in the census as they were officially Bangladeshis, and not Pakistanis. Due to the fact that Hindus made up the large bulk of the minority population, the percentage of Pakistan's minorities plummeted. However, both the percentage and the actual population of minorities of Pakistan (former West Pakistan) has actually increased over the years. In the 1951 census, West Pakistan had 1.6% Hindu population, while East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh) had 22.05%. By 1997, the percentage of Hindus remained stable at 1.6% in Pakistan,Census of Pakistan while in Bangladesh, it had dropped to 9.2% by 2011, with non-Muslims accounting for 10.2% of the population. In 1999 the United Nations Human Rights Council approved the first resolution against defamation of religions. However these resolutions have been severely criticized by the United States, various European nations and freedom of religion groups as these resolutions contained language which could be used to discriminate against minority religions, and in March 2010 the UN refused to enact the most recent resolution. In 2011 religious intolerance was reported to be at its height, hundreds of minorities, women, journalists and liberals were being killed by Islamist fundamentalist extremists, while the Government remained mostly a silent spectator, often only making statements which condemned the ruthless acts of violence by the extremists but taking no real concrete action against them. Progress on religious freedom is being made gradually as Pakistan transitions to democracy from Zia's legacy, in 2016 Sindh with Pakistan's largest Hindu minority passed a bill that outlawed forced conversions. However, the bill was never ratified by the Governor. The bill was tabled by a faction of the Pakistan Muslim League which in Sindh is led by Sufi leader Pir Pagara, called PML-F, Pakistan Muslim League functional. In 2014, NGOs estimated that around 1000 girls from minority groups every year are being forcibly converted to Islam. In November 2019, a parliamentary committee was formed to prevent act of forced conversion in Pakistan. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, reports emerged that rations were being denied to minority Hindus and Christians in the coastal areas of Karachi. The Saylani Welfare Trust, carrying out the relief work, said that the aid was reserved for Muslims alone.COVID-19: Hindus denied food supplies in Pakistan's Karachi , Business Standard, 30 March 2020. Shafique Khokhar, Coronavirus: Karachi NGO denies food to poor Hindus and Christians, Asia News (Italy), 30 March 2020. On 14 April, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom expressed concern with the discrimination. Other organisations, including Edhi Foundation, JDC Welfare Organization and Jamaat-e-Islami are reported to have stepped forward to provide relief to the minorities. USCIRF says ‚Äòtroubled‚Äô by denial of food to Pakistani Hindus, Christians amid Covid-19 crisis, Hindustan Times, 14 April 2020. Violence against minorities Attacks on religious minorities in Pakistan have claimed hundreds of lives of religious minorities, such as Hindus, Pakistani Ahmadis, Shia, Sufis and Christians. Women belonging to minority communities have been targets of forced conversions and marriages. Forced conversion, rape, and forced marriages of Hindu women in Pakistan have recently become controversial in Pakistan. Attacks on minorities in the country have led to condemnation of policies that are discriminatory to religious minorities in Pakistan. Following the 2010 Lahore massacre, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said \\"Members of this religious community have faced continuous threats, discrimination and violent attacks in Pakistan. There is a real risk that similar violence might happen again unless advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence is adequately addressed. The Government must take every step to ensure the security of members of all religious minorities and their places of worship so as to prevent any recurrence of today‚Äôs dreadful incident.\\" Ban's spokesperson expressed condemnation and extended his condolences to the families of the victims and to the Government. The United States ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, issued an unusually strong statement saying Pakistan had witnessed an increase in \\"provocative statements that promote intolerance and are an incitement to extremist violence.\\" An editorial published in Dawn condemned the attacks, commenting that \\"Bigotry in this country has been decades in the making and is expressed in a variety of ways. Violence by individuals or groups against those who hold divergent views may be the most despicable manifestation of such prejudice but it is by no means the only one. Religious minorities in Pakistan have not only been shunted to the margins of society but also face outright persecution on a regular basis.\\" =Ahmadis= Pakistan made an amendment to its constitution in 1974, declaring Ahmadis as non-Muslims. In the following decade, military dictator Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq prohibited Ahmadis from calling themselves as Muslims. The May 2010 Lahore attacks left 94 dead and more than 120 injured in nearly simultaneous attacks against two mosques of the minority Ahmadiyya Community Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, as well as their Punjab wing, claimed responsibility for the attacks and were also blamed by the Pakistani police. The Ahmadi community released a persecution report in 2018 in which the discrimination faced by Ahmadis in Pakistan has been detailed including \\"indiscriminate arrests\\" of people from the community. Ahmadis are forbidden to call themselves Muslims or use Islamic symbols in their religious practices. They are also mandated to declare themselves as Non-Muslims in order to vote in general elections. Another report listed 3963 news items and 532 editorial pieces in the country's Urdu-language media for spreading \\"hate propaganda\\" against Ahmadis. In September 2018, several Islamist groups in Pakistan publicly opposed the selection of Atif Mian, who is from the Ahmadi community, as a member of the government's Economic Advisory Council. He was removed less than a week after selection owing to pressure from Islamist groups. Voice of America reported that after the ouster of Mian the \\"Ahmadi community fears a renewed sense of religious intolerance and discrimination\\" in Pakistan. =Christians= In 2005, a mob set churches and Christian schools on fire in Faisalabad, forcing Christians to flee from their homes. In 2009, a mob set fire to about 40 houses and a church in Gojra and burnt eight people alive. On 22 September 2013, a twin suicide bomb attack took place at All Saints Church in Peshawar, Pakistan, in which 127 people were killed and over 250 injured. On 15 March 2015, two blasts took place at Roman Catholic Church and Christ Church during Sunday service at Youhanabad town of Lahore. At least 15 people were killed and seventy were wounded in the attacks. A church in Quetta was bombed with 9 being killed. The Islamic State group took responsibility for the attack. According to an Open Doors claim in November 2017, Pakistan had the highest number of Christians killed in the world during the 12-month time period of 1 November 2015 to 31 October 2016, with 76 Christians being killed in the country. Pakistan also topped the list of most number of documented church attacks, accounting for 600 of the total 1329 churches attacked worldwide during the same time period. =Hindus= On 18 October 2005, Sanno Amra and Champa, a Hindu couple residing in the Punjab Colony, Karachi, Sindh returned home to find that their three teenage daughters had disappeared. After inquiries to the local police, the couple discovered that their daughters had been taken to a local madrassah, had been converted to Islam, and were denied unsupervised contact with their parents. In January 2017, a Hindu temple was demolished in Pakistan's Haripur district. In 2006, a Hindu temple in Lahore was destroyed to pave the way for construction of a multi-storied commercial building. When reporters from Pakistan-based newspaper Dawn tried to cover the incident, they were accosted by the henchmen of the property developer, who denied that a Hindu temple existed at the site. In July 2010, about 60 Hindus were attacked by 150 residents in Murad Memon Goth neighbourhood of Karachi and ethnically cleansed following an incident when a Hindu youth drank from a water tap near an Islamic mosque. About seven were injured, the injured stated that 400 Hindu families were being threatened to leave the area. In January 2014, in an attack on a temple in Peshawar, the guard was gunned down. On March 15, 2014, a crowd of Muslims burnt a Hindu temple and a dharmashala in Larkana, Sindh, Pakistan, after unverified allegations of a Hindu youth desecrating a copy of the Quran. Hindu temple set on fire in Pakistan over blasphemy, Reuters, March 16, 2014Mob sets fire to Hindu community center in Pak over ‚Äòblasphemy‚Äô, Firstpost, March 15, 2014Pakistan mob sets ablaze Hindu temple over desecration of Koran, Economic Times, April 16, 2014Hindu temple set on fire in Pakistan over alleged blasphemy, Indian Express, March 16, 2014 In January 2014, a policeman standing guard outside a Hindu temple at Peshawar was gunned down. The 25 March 2014 Express Tribune citing an All Pakistan Hindu Rights Movement (PHRM) survey said that 95% of all Hindu temples in Pakistan have been converted since 1990. A senior Pakistani journalist stated that \\"Wealthy Muslim farmers see [Hindu girls] as fair game for abductions, rape, and prolonged sexual exploitation in captivity. Some notorious religious establishments proudly validate these alleged crimes. State institutions, the police and politicians have encouraged the trend by looking the other way.\\" Harris Khalique claimed that \\"madrassas provide an institutional backing and that cannot happen if the state does not allow that. I rest the responsibility of such incidents squarely on the state, which fails its citizens.\\" In 2019, Fayyaz ul Hassan Chohan, the information and culture minister of Punjab province made derogatory remarks against the Hindu community in a television programme. However, later on, he apologised for his derogatory remarks and insisted that his remarks were aimed at Indian armed forces and Indian government and not against any Hindu community. On April 10, 2019, Pakistan decided to restore over 400 Hindu temples which were either demolished or converted for other uses. Pakistan's federal government stated they are fulfilling the longstanding demand of the minority Hindus that their places of worship be restored to them. This action has been welcomed by the Hindu community living in Pakistan. The process will begin with two historic temples in Sialkot and Peshawar. According to a recent government estimate, at least 11 temples in Sindh, four in Punjab, three in Balochistan and two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were operational in 2019. Out of the 400 temples in Pakistan, only 13 temples are operational where members of the Hindu community perform their religious rituals. A survey carried out by All Pakistan Hindu Rights Movement revealed that out of 428 Hindu temples in Pakistan only around 20 survive today and they remain neglected by the Evacuee Trust Property Board which controls those while the rest had been converted for other uses. In the aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition Pakistani Hindus faced riots. Mobs attacked five Hindu temples in Karachi and set fire to 25 temples in towns across the province of Sindh. Shops owned by Hindus were also attacked in Sukkur. Hindu homes and temples were also attacked in Quetta. Jain Mandar at Jain Mandar Chowk in Lahore was destroyed by the bigoted Muslims mobs in 1992 and the government changed the name of Jain Mandar Chowk to Babri Masjid chowk, which became the official name.Pakistan's attempt to erase all signs of its non-Islamic past runs up against popular imagination, Scroll.in, 9 August 2015 According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan data, just around 1,000 Hindu families fled to India in 2013. In May 2014, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Dr. Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, revealed in the National Assembly of Pakistan that around 5,000 Hindus are migrating from Pakistan to India every year. =Shias= In 2012 Jundallah militants stopped buses and massacred 18 men travelling on buses. All but one of the victims were Shia Muslim, while others on the buses were spared. In 2012, Malik Ishaq, founder of the anti-Shia militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, called Shias the \\"greatest infidels on earth\\" and demanded the country to declare them as \\"non-Muslims on the basis of their beliefs.\\" Brad Adams, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch, stated that \\"The government‚Äôs persistent failure to apprehend attackers or prosecute the extremist groups organizing the attacks suggests that it is indifferent to this carnage.\\" Shia Muslims, who make up 15 to 20 per cent of the Muslim population in the country, have been \\"specifically targeted and killed by machine guns and suicide bombers.\\" According to the data compiled by South Asia Terrorism Portal, there have been 446 incidents of violence against the Shia Muslims in Pakistan between 2003 and May 2016, in which more than 2558 people have been killed and over 4518 others injured. In 2020, the European Foundation for South Asian Studies (EFSAS) in a report entitled, Guilty until proven innocent: The sacrilegious nature of blasphemy laws Pakistan, has said that the biggest proportion of Muslims charged with blasphemy offences belong to the Shia community. The paper has recommended wide-ranging changes to Pakistan's laws and legal systems. Thousand of Pakistanis marched for an anti-Shia protests in Karachi, the country's financial hub, during early September, 2020. The march was caused due to Shia clergies making disparaging remarks against historical Islamic figures. The remarks were televised during the Shia Ashura procession. Ashura commemorates the Battle of Karbala, which caused the schism in Islam. Sunni groups demanded that disparaging remarks against any Islamic figures were not acceptable and will not be tolerated.https://www.arabnews.com/node/1732981/world =Sikhs= In 2009, the Pakistani Taliban imposed Jizya on Non-Muslims, houses of 11 Sikh families were demolished in Orakzai Agency for refusing to pay jizya ransom. In 2010, a Sikh youth Jaspal Singh was beheaded in Khyber Agency after his family could not pay the big Jijzya ransom. Consequently, thousands of Sikhs had to abandon their homes and flee from tribal areas to resettled in areas with larger Sikh populations, such as Peshawar, Hassanabdal and Nankana Sahib.How Pakhtun Sikhs fleeing the Taliban made Nankana Sahib a cultural hub, Dawn, 9 January 2018 In May 2018, a prominent Sikh leader Charanjeet Singh was shot dead in Peshawar. It was the tenth targeted murder of a prominent Sikh since 2014, and \\"stirred unprecedented fear ‚Äì and fury ‚Äì among the community‚Äôs members, particularly in Peshawar.\\" On 3 January 2020, Pakistani media reported that \\"scores of protesters surrounded the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, on Friday afternoon, threatening to overrun the holy site if their demands for the release of suspects in an alleged forced conversion case were not met\\". There were also reports of stone-pelting on the shrine by a mob of angry local Muslims, that even threatened to convert it into a mosque. On 27 July 2020, it was reported that the Gurdwara Shaheed Bhai Taru Singh, which is the site of martyrdom of Bhai Taru Singh, had been forcibly taken over and was converted into a mosque and named as Masjid Shahid Ganj. =Sufis= The July 2010 Lahore bombings killed 50 people and wounded 200 others in two suicide bombings on the Sufi shrine, Data Durbar Complex in Lahore. The 2016 Khuzdar bombing on a Sufi shrine in Balochistan killed more than 47 people. = Valentine's Day = Though Valentine's Day in Pakistan is officially banned, and the Islamist orthodoxy has taken steps to obstruct celebrations, many Pakistanis celebrate the day's festivities. In recent years, youth and commercial establishments in Pakistan have supported Valentine's Day festivities and celebrating romantic friendship and love, as noted by journalists Asif Shahzad and Andrew Roche and Safia Bano, a philosophy lecturer. They note that youth in the country, where 60 percent of the population is below age 30 and half are under 18, are influenced more by global trends than traditions. Valentine's Day serves annually as a flash point of the culture war in Pakistan. Forced conversion Dargah pir sarhandi, a frequent crime scene of forced conversion and marriage of kidnapped underage Hindu girls. Women belonging to religious minorities have been known to be victims of kidnapping and forced conversion to Islam. Amarnath Motumal who works for Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has stated that 20 to 25 Hindu girls were kidnapped and converted every month though the exact number is impossible to estimate.25 Hindu girls abducted every month, claims HRCP official The News International Sadiq Bhanbhro, Researcher on Public Health and Gender-Based Violence at Sheffield Hallam University commented he found reports of 286 girls forcibly converted from 2012 to 2017 in English-language dailies, though this number is likely higher.Forced conversions of Hindu girls in Pakistan make a mockery of its constitution The Conversation The 2019 Religious Minorities in Pakistan report compiled by Members of the European Parliament has stated that independent NGOs estimate every year at least 1,000 girls are forcibly converted to Islam, although the number may be probably more due to under-reporting. A Pakistan Muslim League politician has stated that abduction of Hindus and Sikhs is a business in Pakistan, along with conversions of Hindus to Islam.Abduction of Hindus, Sikhs have become a business in Pak: PML MP Times of India ‚Äì 28 August 2011 Many Islamic extremists believe that it is an achievement to convert a Hindu into Islam, and to do so can earn one a blessing. Abdul Haq (Mitthu Mian) is a custodian of Bharchindi Shia Dargah, who is well known for subverting the legal process in numerous cases of kidnapping of underage Hindu girls, their forced conversion to Islam and marriage to older men at this dargah, as well as inciting violence against Hindus specially by misusing blasphemy laws.Who Is Mian Mithu?, Naya Daur, September 16, 2019 Firstly underage girls are abducted from their homes or where they work, later re- appearing after having been married off to a Muslim. They are often raped and then forcibly converted to Islam. To prevent her from going back home or reporting the rape to the police, she is forcibly married to the perpetrator. Reports obtained by the NGO Global Human Rights Defence indicate that the perpetrators will often put a fake age of the girl on the marriage certificate to hide that she is underage. When the families of the girl try to report this to the police, they are often met by biased officers who refuse to file an FIR (First Information Report). The conversions are backed by powerful religious instititutions and leaders who also offer incentives to people to convert. Moreover, the perpetrators will often force the victim to sign a report saying that she converted and married on her own free will, hindering the attempts of the family to have their girl returned to them. Additionally, the perpetrators will often file counter-suits against the victim's family for harassment and for attempting to convert the girl back to her former religion. According to a report from the Movement for Solidarity and Peace also cited by the European Parliament, about 1,000 non-Muslim girls are converted to Islam each year in Pakistan. According to the Pakistan Hindu Council, religious persecution, especially forced conversions, remains the foremost reason for migration of Hindus from Pakistan. Pakistan Hindu Council estimated that about 5000 Hindus migrate from Pakistan to India every year in order to escape religious persecution. Religious institutions like Bharchundi Sharif and Sarhandi Pir support forced conversions and are known to have support and protection of ruling political parties of Sindh. This practice is being reported increasingly in the districts of Tharparkar, Umerkot and Mirpur Khas in Sindh. A total of 57 Hindus converted in Pasrur during May 14‚Äì19, 2010. On May 14, 35 Hindus of the same family were forced to convert by their employer because his sales dropped after Muslims started boycotting his eatable items as they were prepared by Hindus as well as their persecution by the Muslim employees of neighbouring shops according to their relatives. Since the impoverished Hindu had no other way to earn and needed to keep the job to survive, they converted. 14 members of the another family converted on May 17 since no one was employing them, later another Hindu man and his family of eight under pressure from Muslims to avoid their land being grabbed. Rinkle Kumari, a 19-year Pakistani student, Lata Kumari, and Asha Kumari, a Hindu working in a beauty parlor, were allegedly forced to convert from Hinduism to Islam. Their cases were appealed all the way to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The appeal was admitted but remained unheard ever after. Rinkle was abducted by a gang and \\"forced\\" to convert to Islam, before being head shaved. Afterwards, Rinkle reportedly stated that she will stay with her husband rather than return home - her husband and the son of Mitthu Mian met her several times just before her final statement in the Supreme Court. In March 2019, two Hindu minor girls were allegedly abducted on the eve of Holi and forcibly converted to Islam in Dharki, Ghotki District, Sindh. A video showed them being married by a Muslim cleric and another also emerged showing the girls claiming they converted out of their own will. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has ordered an investigation into the accusations. On 11 April, Pakistan High Court let the Hindu girls live with their husbands, stated both teenage girls are adult and marry to men with their own will, parents of both girls accepted the verdict and asked for more time. The court gave the verdict that the Hindu girls were not forcefully converted, abducted and they converted to Islam voluntarily and on their own will. In 2017, the Sikh community in Hangu district of Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province alleged that they were ‚Äúbeing forced to convert to Islam‚Äù by a government official. Farid Chand Singh, who filed the complaint, has claimed that Assistant Commissioner Tehsil Tall Yaqoob Khan was allegedly forcing Sikhs to convert to Islam and the residents of Doaba area are being tortured religiously. According to reports, about 60 Sikhs of Doaba had demanded security from the administration. Many Hindus voluntarily convert to Islam for easily getting Watan Cards and National Identification Cards. These converts were also given land and money. For example, 428 poor Hindus in Matli were converted between 2009 and 2011 by the Madrassa Baitul Islam, a Deobandi seminary in Matli, which pays off the debts of Hindus converting to Islam. Another example is the conversion of 250 Hindus to Islam in Chohar Jamali area in Thatta. Conversions are also carried out by ex-Hindu Baba Deen Mohammad Shaikh mission which converted 108,000 people to Islam since 1989. In 2017, a human rights activist claimed that, \\"At least 25 conversions of young Hindu girls and women take place every month in Umerkot's Kunri and Samaro talukas alone. This area is so deprived and the people, most of whom belong to the scheduled castes, are so powerless that the families know there‚Äôs no use in them reporting forced conversions to the police, let alone raising a hue and cry.\\" In 2014 alone, 265 legal cases of forced conversion were reported, mostly involving Hindu girls. In July 2019, Sindh-based activist Duo Kalhoro stated that \\"Current statistics estimate that every month, 20 Hindu girls are abducted and converted to Islam\\" in her province. She added that \\"Most of the victims are under the age of 18. Some as young as 11 years old. Once the girls have been married off and converted, they are prohibited from contacting their families, leaving them even more vulnerable to exploitation.\\" Blasphemy Law The Pakistan Blasphemy Law derives from section 295-C of the Pakistan Penal Code which states that whoever \\"defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.\\" This law is phrased in vague terms (therefore violating the principle of legality), and is often used to level false accusations at people from religious minorities. ‚ÄòSentences for these offences range from fines to long terms of imprisonment, and in the case of defamation of the Prophet Muhammad, a mandatory death sentence.‚Äô 'This law thus serves as a legal justification to persecute religious minorities, or any other person, by means of false accusations in pursuit of personal vendettas or disputes'. By failing to repeal this law, the government is complicit in encouraging discriminatory prosecutions. Asia Bibi is a Pakistani Christian woman who was convicted of blasphemy by a Pakistani court, receiving a sentence of death by hanging. In June 2009, Bibi was involved in an argument with a group of Muslim women with whom she had been harvesting berries after the other women grew angry with her for drinking the same water as them. She was subsequently accused of insulting the Islamic prophet Muhammad, a charge she denies, and was arrested and imprisoned. In November 2010, a Sheikhupura judge sentenced her to death. If executed, Bibi would be the first woman in Pakistan to be lawfully killed for blasphemy. In August 2012, Rimsha Masih, a Christian girl, reportedly 11 or 14 years old, and an illiterate with mental disabilities was accused of blasphemy for burning pages from a book containing Quranic verses. The allegation came from a Muslim cleric who himself has subsequently been accused by the police of framing the girl. The girl, and later the cleric, were both arrested and released on bail. In 2014 Junaid Jamshed was accused under the blasphemy law. According to The Economist, Jamshed \\"is unable to return to Pakistan after being accused of mocking one of the Prophet‚Äôs wives in a throwaway remark about the weakness of women.\\" In March 2017 a Hindu man Prakash Kumar was arrested on the charges of blasphemy in the province of Balochistan. Critics of the blasphemy laws have called for change. In 2019, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appealed to Pakistan to stop the misuse of the law, estimating that over 40 people were serving life sentences or facing execution for blasphemy in Pakistan. Demographics According to 1951 census, Non- Muslims constituted 14.20% of total Pakistan's (West Pakistan and East Pakistan) population. In the West Pakistan (now Pakistan), the Non-Muslims constituted 3.44% of the total population while East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) had a significant share comprising 23.20 per cent of the population therein. Much of the decrease in minorities of Pakistan has occurred due to the events around the partition of India, the wars of 1965 and 1971. It has been attributed to reasons like communal violence and discrimination that minority communities face. In the 1941 census of India, areas of modern Pakistan had a population of 5.9 million Non-Muslims. After the Partition of India, about 5 million Hindus and Sikhs left the country. It is estimated that 95% of Pakistanis are Muslims (75-95% Sunni, 5-20% Shia). The Ahmadiyya have faced greater persecution since 1974 after being declared \\"non Muslims\\" over allegations that they do not recognize Muhammad as the last prophet. In addition, there have been many cases of religious persecution in of Hindus in the nation. Among these, the most recent include 19-year-old Hindu girl Rinkle Kumari from Mirpur Mathelo in Ghotki district, Sindh province who was abducted by a gang and \\"forced\\" to convert to Islam, before being head shaved. Another recent case was the gunning down of four Hindu doctors in Chak town, Shikarpur sparking fears and panic among the minority community. Education system The 2019 report on Religious Minorities in Pakistan compiled by Members of the European Parliament found: \\"The curriculum in Pakistani schools includes compulsory reading of Qu‚Äô ran, the ideology of Pakistan based on the Islam, the Jihad and Shahadat path. The textbooks in schools extend the intolerance with systematic negative portrayals of minorities, especially Hindus. While teachings avoid denoting the contribution of religious minorities to the cultural, military and civic life of Pakistan, anti-Islamic forces are declared to endanger its very existence. By historic revisionism and unsubstantiated claims which convey religious bias, the Islamic civilization is glorified while religious minorities are denigrated.\\" In 2011 the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) released a report on the public schools and Madrassas in Pakistan. The study concluded: > *Public school textbooks used by all children often had a strong Islamic > orientation, *Public school and madrassa teachers had limited awareness or > understanding of religious minorities and their beliefs, and were divided on > whether religious minorities were citizens; *Teachers often expressed very > negative views about Ahmadis, Christians, and Jews, and successfully > transmitted these biases to their students; *Interviewees' expressions of > tolerance often were intermixed with neutral and intolerant comments, > leaving some room for improvement.  Constitution  Tolerance for religious discrimination can be found in the Constitution of Pakistan. Islam is named as the religion of the state, and whilst there is a provision allowing for minorities to practice their religions, they are still subject to the principles of 'democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice as enunciated by Islam'. Certain provisions are outrightly discriminatory - such as article 41(2) which provides that only Muslims can become president, thereby denying minorities the chance to hold the highest position of power. The Constitution also provides for the set up of the Islamic Council, created to safeguard Islamic ideology. The Islamic Council can shape governmental decisions, actions and policy, which creates an institutionalised priority for Islamic ideas to the detriment of religious minorities.

Biography  Casais Monteiro graduated in History and Philosophy at University of Porto (Faculdade de Letras), where he was colleague of Agostinho da Silva and Delfim Santos, in 1933. At Porto he started as a high school teacher at Liceu Rodrigues de Freitas, until he was prevented from teaching by the government dictatorship in 1937. He would eventually go into exile in Brasil in 1954 for the same reasons. After the removal of Miguel Torga, Branquinho da Fonseca and Edmundo de Bettencourt, in 1930, Adolfo Casais Monteiro was director of the Coimbra's literary journal Presen√ßa (journal), with Jos√© R√©gio and Jo√£o Gaspar Sim√µes. This journal published the political views of Casais Monteiro until it ceased publication in 1940. He was arrested several times due to his political opinions adverse to the Estado Novo regime and directed anonymously the weekly Mundo Liter√°rio in 1936 e 1937. Prevented from teaching, Casais Monteiro goes to Lisbon, living as literary author, translator and editor. As Agostinho da Silva or Jorge de Sena, he would eventually leave to Brasil, due to his opposition to Estado Novo, which he could not accept. He also directed the journal Princ√≠pioPrinc√≠pio : publica√ß√£o de cultura e pol√≠tica (1930) [c√≥pia digital, Hemeroteca Digital ] (1930) and collaborated with the journals SudoesteSudoeste : cadernos de Almada Negreiros (1935) [c√≥pia digital, hemeroteca Digital ] (1935) and Variante (1942‚Äì43). Having participated in the celebrations of the 4th centenary of Cidade de S√£o Paulo, in 1954, Adolfo Casais Monteiro fixed residence in Brasil, teaching since then Portuguese Literature in several Brazilian universities, namely at Universidade da Bahia in Salvador, till fixed in 1962 at Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP), Campus de Araraquara-SP. He wrote by then several essays and wrote as literary critic for several Brazilian newspapers, having contributed to the study of Fernando Pessoa and the Movimento da Presen√ßa. Among his translation works is Germania, de Tacitus, published in 1941. His only novel, Adolescentes (Teenagers), was published in 1945. His poetic work, which began in 1929 with \\"Confus√£o\\", was influenced by the first Portuguese modernism, approaching stylistically the aestheticism of Andr√© Gide.Jo√£o Mendes- \\"Adolfo Casais Monteiro\\", \\"Enciclop√©dia Verbo Luso-Brasileira da Cultura\\", volume XX, Setembro de 2001. Their criticisms of concreteness were based on the idea that this aesthetic movement promoted impersonality, starting from the \\"'purest abstractions to build a new language to the service of nothing, a pure language, an invention of objects - in short: a beautiful toy\\". \\"While some authors describe it as independent of Surrealism others emphasize the influence that this had on the author's current aesthetic, as can be seen in his essays on authors such as Jules Supervielle, Henri Michaux and Antonin Artaud (designating the latter as unsustainable presence ).

Biography  Mihajloviƒá was born in a musical family: his father, Konstantin, studied composition and conducting at the Belgrade Music Academy, and with his brother Nedeljko, founded an ensemble for light music and toured Europe and the Middle East. Mihajloviƒá graduated in composition (Stanojlo Rajiƒçiƒá, 1970), and conducting (≈Ωivojin Zdravkoviƒá, 1969) at the Belgrade Music Academy where he also acquired his M.A. degree (1978). For a short time he attended master courses in Cologne and Salzburg. From 1975 to 2010, Mihajloviƒá worked at the Faculty of Music in Belgrade, teaching at the Department of Music Theory and, from 1997, at the Department of Composition and Orchestration. He also taught composition at the Academy of Arts in Novi Sad. He was the Secretary and Head of the Department of Music Theory, and, from 2002 to 2009, the Dean of the Belgrade Faculty of Music. He is one of the founders of the Ensemble for Contemporary Music, as well as the contemporary music festival ‚Äì the International Review of Composers (1992). He was the director of the IRC festival from 1992 to 2002, and the Chairman of the Union of Serbian Composers from 1987 to 2002. Mihajloviƒá's compositions have been performed in Switzerland (Tonhalle, Zurich), USA (Carnegie Hall, New York), Germany (Berliner Philharmonie Hall), Great Britain (Steinway Hall in London), France (Op√©ra de Dijon), in most of the European countries and Australia. His works were performed by all significant orchestras in the former Yugoslavia, Jena and Brussel philharmonic orchestras, the Camerata Serbica,the Belgrade Strings, St George Strings, as well as the ensembles: Lontano (London), Alternance (Paris), 76 (Zurich), Serbian String Quartet, Belgrade Wind Quintet and Women Academic Chamber Choir - Collegium musicum.

Since 2015, his compositions are published by Musikverlag Brandst√§tter K√∂ln/Cologne.Bry-Music.de  Awards  For his artistic achievements, Mihajloviƒá has been awarded several biggest national prizes for music: * Stevan Hristiƒá Award (1970), * Belgrade Music Festival Award (1972) * Belgrade October Prize (1984) * First Prizes at the International Review of Composers (1992, 1996), *Stevan Mokranjac Award (1994) * City of Belgrade Prize (2003)  Personal Style  = Early works = Mihajloviƒá drew the attention of the public with his first orchestral composition: his graduation work Fantasy Overture, (Uvertira fantasia, 1970) which was awarded the Stevan Hristiƒá prize. It was followed by Preludio, Aria e Finale for orchestra (1974, BEMUS Prize), and Symphonic metamorphosis (Simfonijske metamorfoze, 1977). = Mature Works = In his composition Notturni for string quartet and wind quintet (1983, the Belgrade October Prize), Mihajloviƒá made very successful intra-musical dialogue between the avantgarde musical language (Polish avantgarde school) and classical expression. There, the allusive tone-painting of nocturnal ambients was boldly combined with semi-hidden citations, in functional use of the avantgarde and classical composing techniques rooted in the Scriabine mode verticals.Z. Premate, New Works of Our Composers, Treƒái program (Third Programme), Radio- Belgrade, 1984. Such comprehension of music as the extrapolation of a personal world of expression is the main characteristics of all Mihajloviƒá‚Äôs works as of the mid-1980s: three songs for soloists and choir What Do I Dream (≈†ta sanjam, 1984), Bagatelle (1986) for violin and strings, Elegy (Elegija, 1989) for strings, Three preludes (1986‚Äì89) for piano. Scriabine‚Äôs mode remained the constant of Mihajlovic‚Äôs expression, as the basis for the inventive harmony that specifically \\"colours\\" his music, and so did the reduction to small thematic cores from which \\"arise\\" its main motives and the linear movement as a whole, frequently with ostinatos and pedals. Experimenting with his own style as the subject of his music is also evident, as well as the \\"thematisation of the thematic technique.\\" This can be found in the way Mihajloviƒá composes his basic material from only a few intervals, and the way he uses such a core in many diverse, inventive and omnipresent ways.Z.

During the 1990s, Mihajloviƒá based his musical narration on quotations, samples and models from the music history. Eine kleine Trauermusik, (Mala ≈æalobna muzika, 1990) was dedicated to the bicentenary of Mozart‚Äôs death, and quotes the fragment from the second movement of Mozart‚Äôs Piano concerto in A-Major (awarded First Prize at the International Review of Composers, 1992). His orchestral Memento (1993) is dedicated to the memory of the Serbian composer Vasilije Mokranjac, (awarded \\"Stevan Mokranjac\\" Prize, 1994). The piece Silenzio for female choir and chamber ensemble (1996) was written to the lyrics by Torquato Tasso and quotes a fragment from the Monteverdi‚Äôs madrigal Chiome d‚Äôoro (awarded First Prize at the International Review of Composers, 1997). Since 2000, Mihajloviƒá has developed the communication within his own music, which is evident in his piece Return (Povratak, 2002) for cello and orchestra, in which he summarized and tested the effects and comprehensiveness of his own style in the status of a quotation (awarded the City of Belgrade Prize, 2003).Z.

His remains rest in the crypt of the Monument to the Heroes of the Battle of Iquique, in Valpara√≠so.  Early life  He was born to a modest family. He was the son of professor Jose Manuel Aldea and Ursula Fonseca. His childhood was spent in Santiago with his paternal grandparents, Juan de Dios Aldea and Maria Antonieta Contreras. At the age of 8 he enrolled in the Franciscan School of Chill√°n, directed by his father. Here he distinguished himself with his excellent handwriting and his evident interest for military exercises.  Career  After living for four years with his aunt, on August 1, 1872, he enrolled as a volunteer soldier in the Financial Commission sent by the Navy's Artillery Battalion; an organization located in Valparaiso which was dependent on the General Command of the Chilean Navy. In this battalion, he also served as a chief. He stayed in the First Company of that battalion for two years. In April 1874 he was sent on commission to Valdivia and on May 11 was promoted to 2nd Corporal. On January 1, 1876 he was promoted to 1st Corporal, and a year later to 2nd Sergeant. In June 1877 he embarked on the corvette Esmeralda. In February 1878 he was transferred to the pontoon Thalaba, and, after staying a month, he returned to the First Company of the Battalion.

He studies Fine Arts in Madrid. He travels to Paris and other cities in Europe before returning to Ja√©n in 1966, where he teaches drawing and painting at the School of Arts and Crafts (now School of Art Joseph Nogu√©), where he serves later as Director. He leaves in 1981 his teaching activity to pursue an artistic career that led him to exhibit in many cities in Spain and Europe. With Fran√ßoise G√©rardin, he has three sons: Fausto, Jaime and Efr√©n. He dies in his hometown in May 1995. There is an Atelier-Museum Fausto Olivares in France. In 2011, on the occasion of the seventy years of the birth of her husband, Fran√ßoise G√©rardin publishes a work in French: Evocations, my husband, Fausto Olivares, painter.  His life  = Early years = Fausto Olivares C√≥zar and S√©rvula Palacios C√≥zar live in the Magdalena district of Ja√©n, during the end of the Spanish Civil War. They lose their first daughter, Flor, just a few months old. Then Fausto (1940), Jose, Francisco, Ceferino, Maribel, Domingo Jes√∫s, Pedro and Maria Florencia are born. Despite the difficult times of the post-Franco period, the family tries to give every child a proper education. From his childhood, Fausto shows clear artistic predispositions, and concretizes his skills by learning from the hand of D. Enrique Barrios, and later in the company of Francisco Cerezo Moreno. During his teenage years, he alternated working hours with his father and his brothers with drawing and painting classes. At the same time he made some works that allow him to reach already a little notoriety in the city. He prepares the entrance examination at the Escuela Superior de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid, with Don Pablo Mart√≠n del Castillo, and at the age of 18, he leaves for the Spanish capital. At the School of Fine Arts, he has for companions Dario Villalba, √Ångel Estrada, Isidro L√≥pez Murias. His friend Luis Santiago, a musician, gives him the opportunity to meet flamenco artists like Pepe el de la Matrona, Lola Flores, Antonio Mairena ... Flamenco will later mark an important aspect in the life and work of the artist. painter. He takes advantage of summer vacation periods to travel in Spain (Le√≥n, Galicia), France (harvest) and Europe (Belgium, Netherlands, Germany), but also during the last years of studies while doing his military service in the Canary Islands. During all his travels, he makes sketches, paintings and even organizes an exhibition during his military service. = Return to Ja√©n = Once his studies are over, he travels again to France, and especially to Paris, where three of his brothers live and work. He meets his future wife Fran√ßoise G√©rardin. He has as a friend Alfredo Vila Monasterio, with whom he discovers certain modalities of abstract art. After a new trip to Europe, he returns to Ja√©n to settle there almost definitively, first as a modeling teacher, then as a teacher of drawing and painting at the School of Arts and Crafts. He tries to combine his passions: painting, photography, flamenco and travels. He makes frequent trips to France, exhibits in England, and at the same time deepens his expression with expeditions throughout Andalusia. With Antonio Povedano Berm√∫dez and others, he takes part in a monographic exhibition: El Flamenco en el Arte Actual, which travels the country for years. He was appointed director of the School of Arts and Crafts (1978), a charge he will be responsible for four years, before applying for layoff to be fully dedicated to painting. = New travels = From 1983, he moves his studio to the coasts of Malaga, where his painting takes new lights, then in the Vosges for family reasons. These trips led him to multiply solo exhibitions in Andalusia and in the north of France: museums and galleries interested in the style of this Andalusian painter, whose deep expressiveness contrasts with the traditional reserve of the Nordic regions. The illness surprises him while he is working on illustrations for a book of poems by Ramon Porras, Arco del Consuelo, and after Holy Week of 1995, Fausto dies at his home in Ja√©n the night of May 13.  His work  Fausto Olivares' style, from the moment he reaches his own autonomy, is part of the movement known in Europe as figurative neo-expressionism. Most of his work is done in oil on canvas or on wood. He also executes a large number of pen, coal, and pencil drawings, among which stand out his portraits of artists, who \\"were born from the pencil of Fausto, above all, to serve as a testimony and relic of an evening Flamenco enthusiasm\\".Manuel Urbano : \\"Estos retratos de flamenco nac√≠an del l√°piz de Fausto, ante todo, para ser testimonio y reliquia de una noche de entusiasmo flamenco\\" Revista Candil, . Ja√©n. = Analysis = Manuel Kayser Zapata illustrates as follows the trajectory of Fausto: \\"His aesthetic evolution was very coherent, at the beginning of his singular creative necessity he let himself be impregnated by the avant-garde movements that struggled to win He had many exhibitions in Madrid during the time of his formation, Fausto felt that he was a child of his time, and as such he was aware of his responsibility, and later on his aesthetics would be exclusively for his own internal communication needs.\\"Manuel Kayser Zapata Fausto Olivares : Proyecto para el estudio de una d√©cada, exposici√≥n Cajasur, C√≥rdoba 1999 : Su evoluci√≥n est√©tica fue muy coherente. Al comienzo de su singular necesidad creativa se dej√≥ empapar por los movimientos de vanguardia que luchaban por imponerse a trav√©s de m√∫ltiples exposiciones realizadas en Madrid durante su formaci√≥n. Fausto se sent√≠a hijo de su tiempo, y como tal era consciente de su responsabilidad. Posteriormente su est√©tica responder√≠a exclusivamente a sus necesidades internas de comunicaci√≥n. = Fausto Olivares and the Flamenco = Ram√≥n Porras writes: \\"The name Flamenco expressionism can be confusing: it is not an art that reflects the literality of the moods, characters or anecdotes of the flamenco world, but a deeply flamenco art in itself. To put it another way, Fausto does not paint La Sole√°, but his painting sings by sole√°.\\"Ramon Porras, Aproximaci√≥n al expresionismo jondo de Fausto Olivares, 2003, Cat√°logo de la exposici√≥n La Color de lo Jondo, Talence, Francia, 2003 : La denominaci√≥n expresionismo jondo puede prestarse a equ√≠vocos que prefiero anticipadamente aclarar. No se tata de un arte que refleja la litelaridad de √°mbitos, personales o episodios flamencos, sino que tal arte es en s√≠ mismo jondo. Dicho de otra forma, Fausto Olivares no pinta la sole√°, sino que pinta por sole√°.

It sat along the path of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Passenger service along the line (not picking up at Eaton) stopped completely in the fall of 1981. Eatons's long abandoned train station burned the mid 1980s. All rail service on the line was discontinued in 1988. The railroad tracks were removed in the 1990s and turned into part of the North Bend Rail Trail. The town was named for a tunnel builder named Eaton.  Tunnel accident  In the early 1960s work began on the tunnels, widening and raising the roofs. Eatons tunnel (#21), which was originally built in 1867, collapsed on June 6, 1963 burying 2 workers. One was rescued safely. The other was never recovered. The old tunnel was deemed unsafe to continue and was sealed off. A new tunnel was dug parallel to the old. There is no marker commemorating the still buried worker. The tunnel has become a place visited by ghost hunters.  Note  Please do not forget the trails are a part of the park system and those without renting a camping site may be ticketed if visiting after their visiting hours.

He \\"considered the rationalization of the home according to functionalist principles a debasement of its traditional role as an intimate place for gathering and repose\\". Biography Malmsten was born in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the son of Karl Malmsten and Inez Cadier. Malmsten's career took off when he won a competition in 1916 to design furniture for the Stockholm City Hall (stadshus); in 1917, he exhibited alongside well-known Swedish architects such as Gunnar Asplund and Uno √Öhr√©n. Malmsten founded an eponymous furniture store on the riverfront of Stockholm. The store is currently run by his grandson. In the 1920s he was invited to furnish a room for the crown prince, Gustaf VI Adolf, and his wife Louise in Ulriksdal Palace. He was honoured with an inaugural Prince Eugen Medal for design in 1945. Legacy Malmsten has had a lasting influence on Swedish furniture design through the two schools he founded‚Äîthe Carl Malmsten Furniture Studies (Carl Malmstensskolan), which has been a part of Link√∂ping University since 2000, is situated on the island of Liding√∂ on the outskirts of Stockholm. The school had been situated in the city centre until 2009. Malmsten's second school, Capellag√•rden, is located on the island of √ñland in Vickleby. It offers courses in textile craft and design, cabinet making, furniture design, interior carpentry, ceramics, and organic horticulture. Personal life In 1917, he was married to Siv Munthe (1894-1972). Together with his wife, he founded the Siv and Carl Malmsten Memorial Foundation (Stiftelsen Siv och Carl Malmstens Minne). The Foundation owns the intellectual property rights from Carl Malmsten. Malmsten was the paternal grandfather of author Bodil Malmsten (1944‚Äì2016).

Biography His father, Adolf, was a pastor and professor and his grandfather, , was a noted doctor and scientist who studied with Carl Linnaeus. In 1824, at the age of fourteen, he became a Cadet at the Military Academy Karlberg. While there, his primary interests were gymnastics and fencing. The methods of Per Henrik Ling, a pioneer of physical education, had a great influence on his personal development. In his letters, he also expressed interest in literary and artistic endeavors and made illustrations for a student publication called Kornblixten (heat lightning). Bragi with his Harp After his father died in 1828, he was forced to find employment as a teacher at the Royal Central Gymnastics Institute, which provided housing. It was there that he first met Ling. He was also exposed to the drawings of Fredric Westin, with whom he began to study that same year. In 1829, after leaving military service, he was able to enroll at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts. During this time, he also received support from Fredrik Boije, the publisher of an artistic journal. Boije also taught him etching. He later produced lithographs, including a series of twenty-four historical scenes with text by Karl August Nicander.Slaget p√• Fyrisvall p√• Nationalmuseum He also did illustrations for Fritiof by Esaias Tegn√©r. His preoccupation with graphic work made Westin remark that he was not developing a good sense of color.LibrisLibris In response, he focused on watercolor techniques. Despite Boije's support and living with Westin, he found himself in financial difficulties and had to quit the Royal Academy in 1833. After that, he supported himself with his illustrations and occasional work as a gym teacher, although he did take some time to study anatomy with Anders Retzius. In 1838, he was a candidate for a major scholarship, but it was awarded to Per Wickenberg. Instead, a group of friends joined together and raised 700 riksdaler. With recommendations from Ling and the Academy's art director, Johan Gustaf Sandberg, he was able to go on a study trip to Paris. Once there, he moved into the H√¥tel de Beauvais, where he shared an apartment with Fritz von Dardel. He soon sent home several sculptures, but they found no buyers. In addition to drawing and modeling, he studied xylography. Illustration for Asarne by Per Hendrik Ling, with Storkvid (center), the father of Starkad =In Paris and Rome= Funds were scarce in Paris, and the local publishers were not interested in his drawings. Aubert et Cie. offered to give him work if he would do pictures of pretty girls. Finally, through the Swedish ministry, he made contact with Count who was able to find him work with an English publisher who was planning a translation of Gustaf II Adolfs Historia by Anders Fryxell. Wahlbom travelled to Germany and made extensive preliminary sketches but, upon his return, was told that the publisher had gone out of business. He managed to sell his drawings to an art dealer. He began painting in oils and, with a recommendation from Olof Johan S√∂dermark, a military officer who was a part-time painter, he was able to receive lessons from Franz Xaver Winterhalter. Despite a glowing letter of praise from Winterhalter, another attempt to get a scholarship from the Royal Academy was a failure. However, in 1842, they named him an \\"agr√©\\" (a type of member candidate) and received a stipendium. The Death of King Gustav II Adolf at the Battle of L√ºtzen In 1843, he decided to try his luck in Rome, where he found a position in the studios of Bengt Erland Fogelberg. A shift in his interests also took place, as he visited the Roman Campagna to paint animals and farmers. He also spent a great deal of time with his fellow Swedish artists at the Caff√® Greco. In 1845, based on the work he sent home, he was awarded a two-year extension of his financial support. After another stay in Paris, he returned to Stockholm in 1848 and was elected a member of the Royal Academy. After filling in for Carl Gustaf Qvarnstr√∂m, during a leave of absence, he was named a Professor. At this time, his health had begun to worsen. In 1852, upon his doctor's recommendation, he spent the winter in Brussels. The following year, he went again to Paris, but his illness prevented him from painting for long periods. An attempt to display some of his works at the Salon was not successful. Soon after, he and a friend went to Rome and he acquired a studio on the Via della Purificazione, in the art district. Once more, he was unable to paint for long periods due to attacks of gout.Gustaf Adolf vid Stuhm p√• Nationalmuseum =Final years and death= When his mentor, Westin, left the Academy, Wahlbom was named to replace him but, shortly after the appointment, he was found on the floor of a hotel room, unconscious from a stroke. He spent nine months at the Fatebenefratelli Hospital, unable to move his left side or lift his right arm. Accompanied by a nurse, he travelled to Lyon for treatment, then to London to receive an experimental electrical treatment invented by a certain M. Beckensteiner. He remained in London, a shadow of his former self, and received numerous visits from his friends. He was preparing to return to Sweden when he was diagnosed with kidney disease. In April, he died after a series of strokes and was buried at the Brookwood Cemetery in Woking. His works may be seen at the G√∂teborgs konstmuseum,G√∂teborgs konstmuseum Nationalmuseum,Nationalmuseum Uppsala University Library,Uppsala universitetsbibliotek Nordiska museet and the Nasjonalgalleriet, among many others.

Biography  His father, Anders Wilhelmson, was a \\"B√§steman\\" (a type of Naval Master), who died in a shipwreck in 1875. His mother, Amalia, opened a small shop to support the family. Some relatives were in the printing business so, in 1881, he was apprenticed to the lithographers Meyer & K√∂ster in Gothenburg. He also took evening classes at the School of Design and Crafts.

His villa and studio in Fiskeb√§ckskil In 1888, on the recommendation of Larsson and his former employers, he was awarded a scholarship from the Kommerskollegium that enabled him to travel to Leipzig. While there, he worked for several notable lithography firms. Despite this, he remained undecided as to whether he should pursue a career in lithography or strike out on his own as an artist. By 1890, he had saved enough money to move to Paris. In Paris, he worked as an advertising artist while taking classes from Paul S√©rusier and Maurice Denis at the Acad√©mie Julian. He may also have studied, at least briefly, with Jules Lefebvre and Tony Robert-Fleury. In 1893, he visited Brittany and, in 1895, had a small showing at the Salon. He returned to Sweden in 1896.

Ahnlund was a popularizer of history and became widely known for his contributions in newspapers and radio, but in academia he was also successful and became, among other things, a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities as early as 1934 and the Swedish Academy.

Richard's shout of \\"a-wop bop-a loo-mop, a-lop bam-boom\\" at the beginning of \\"Tutti Frutti\\" is said to be a reference to Connor's drum rhythms. James Brown described Little Richard and his band, with Connor as the drummer, as \\"the first to put funk into the rhythm.\\"  Early life  Connor was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. His father, a merchant mariner, was from Santo-Domingo in the Dominican Republic and his mother was a native Louisianan. As a young boy, Connor was inspired by his father singing calypso songs and by the marching bands playing Dixieland jazz near his home in New Orleans' French Quarter, as well as by Bob Alden, Art Blakey, Charles Otis, Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, and Max Roach. He received his first drum kit at the age of five.  Career  Connor's first professional work as a drummer came in 1950, at the age of 15, when he was hired by Professor Longhair to play drums with him at Mardi Gras. Over the next three years, Connor played drums with Smiley Lewis, Guitar Slim, Jack Dupree, and Shirley and Lee. At the age of 18, in 1953, Connor became the drummer of Little Richard's new, hard-driving rhythm & blues road band, The Upsetters. The Upsetters began to tour successfully, even without a bass player on songs, forcing drummer Connors to thump \\"real hard\\" on his bass drum in order to get a \\"bass fiddle effect.\\" Connor continued to drum for Richard as his fame increased throughout the 1950s, drumming on records such as \\"The Girl Can't Help It\\", and \\"Keep A-Knockin'\\", and \\"Ooh! My Soul\\". On 1957's \\"Keep A-Knockin'\\", Connor played a four-bar drum intro (known as the \\"flattened out double shuffle\\") that John Bonham later imitated in the opening of Led Zeppelin's \\"Rock and Roll\\". At times when Connor was not working with Richard, he drummed with James Brown, after Richard connected The Famous Flames with his promoter Clint Brantley. Brown described Connor, while playing in Richard's mid-1950s band, as \\"the first [drummer] to put funk into the rhythm\\". In his later career, Connor has drummed with Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, The Coasters, Big Joe Turner, Larry Williams, Don Covay, George Lightfoot, and Dee Clark.  Personal life  Connor is married to Zenaida; they have a daughter named Queenie.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy Sir James Gibson had been Liberal MP for the seat of Edinburgh East since the 1909 Edinburgh East by-election. On 10 January 1912 his poor health was reported by The Times, who commented that he had been ill for some time. His death was reported two days later. Electoral history The seat had been won by a Liberal at every election since it was created in 1885. The result at the last election was as follows. Sir James Gibson However, at the by-election in 1909, the Liberal majority had been reduced to 458 votes - 5.4%. Candidates When the by-election was first announced, the Conservative Party had already chosen John Gordon Jameson as their prospective candidate and he was quickly adopted. He was an advocate and son of Lord Ardwall. It took the Liberals a bit longer to settle on a candidate. There was early speculation that Andrew Anderson the Solicitor General for Scotland would be the Liberal candidate as he was without a seat in parliament having lost his seat at the 1911 North Ayrshire by-election. However, he expressed a desire to remain Liberal candidate for North Ayrshire.The Times, 23 January 1912 p7 By 22 January, 38-year-old James Myles Hogge was chosen by the Liberals to defend the seat. He was raised in Edinburgh where he attended the Edinburgh Normal School, Moray House School of Education, and the University of Edinburgh, where he was President of the Liberal Society. He was a founding member of the Young Scots' Society that favoured a Scottish Parliament. He started work as a pupil teacher in Edinburgh and was a 1st class King's Scholar at Moray House Training College, Edinburgh. In December 1910, Hogge stood as Liberal candidate in the Camlachie division of Glasgow, losing narrowly to a Liberal Unionist. Campaign Jameson, the Unionist candidate unsurprisingly sought to champion opposition to two Liberal Government policies, the Irish Home Rule proposals and the National Insurance Act while supporting Tariff Reform. However, he also spoke out in favour of the abolition of hereditary peers and making the second chamber democratic. He also favoured the use of public referenda.The Times (London, England), Friday, 19 January 1912; p. 8 He was opposed to giving women the vote and opposed to granting Home Rule for Scotland. For the Liberal, Hogge stood for Irish and Scottish Home Rule, universal adult suffrage, temperance reform and the reform of the land laws.The Times (London, England), Tuesday, 23 January 1912; p. 7 He also favoured the abolition of the House of Lords. The Edinburgh branch of the National Society for Women's Suffrage after questioning both candidates unsurprisingly chose to support the Liberal, James Hogge. The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies also chose to use interest in the by-election to promote women's suffrage through a series of local meetings. Result James Hogge Unsurprisingly, the Liberal majority was well down on what it had been at the last General election, however, the majority was nearly twice as much as it had been following the by-election in 1909. Aftermath A General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the autumn of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. *Liberal: James Myles Hogge *Unionist: Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place. *Balfour was the endorsed candidate of the Coalition Government.

The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2013 and stars Emma Roberts, Evan Peters, and John Cusack. The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on February 14, 2014, by IFC Films. Plot Recent college graduate Amy believes she's destined to be a great poet. Pressed by her parents to earn a living, she takes a job at a small sex shop, Adult World, where she works with the manager, Alex. When her car is stolen, her parents discover that she had canceled the car's theft insurance to afford submission fees for poetry journals, and kick her out. She briefly moves in with a coworker, trans woman Rubia, before finding her own apartment. She meets one of her favorite poets, Rat Billings, and talks her way into being his prot√©g√©e by offering to clean his house. After some cajoling, Billings reads her poetry and offers to feature her work in an anthology he is working on. One night, she gets drunk and makes a clumsy attempt to seduce him, but he rebuffs her advances. Alex fires Amy after she fails to catch a shoplifter; angered, she says she is too good to work there. She soon discovers that she misses Alex, however, and realizes that she has feelings for him. She apologizes to him and asks for her job back. Alex rehires her, and they begin hanging out. At Amy's birthday party, Billings gives her a copy of the poetry anthology he featured her work in‚ÄîShit Poems: An Anthology of Bad Verse. Furious and humiliated, she confronts him and calls him a has-been. She goes home and tries to commit suicide by asphyxiating herself with a plastic bag, but changes her mind at the last second. The next day, she makes peace with Billings: he tells her that she needs to do more living before she can fulfill her potential as a writer, while she tells him not to take himself so seriously. Later, she sleeps with Alex, and they become a couple. She finds out she has been published in an erotica magazine that she submitted prose to as a joke. She and Alex go to a party together to celebrate, and he encourages her to keep writing. The film ends with Amy reading Shit Poems with a smile on her face. In the epilogue, next to the credits, she becomes a well-known poet and arranges her first poetry book on a shelf in a bookstore to be more prominently shown.

It is known that on 23 January 1945 a severe accident happened when a Ju88 broke up during takeoff and crashed into a building, killing 4 in the ensuing fire. The Americans moved into the area in late April 1945, It was used for casualty evacuation and battlefield supply by IX Air Service Command briefly before the German Capitulation on 8 May. The Americans withdrew from the area in July 1945 and the airfield was taken over by the Soviet Red Army as part of the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany. After the war the local inhabitants stripped the buildings to rebuild their own homes. Post war, the Russians took over the airfield, and it became a tank storage and repair depot, as it wasn't far from the Cold War front line, and it was envisaged that tanks would play a major part in any future warfare with the West. After German reunification, the country was keen to eradicate any memory of Russian occupation, and so the airfield was put to non military use. Today the former airfield is an industrial area at the location, aptly called \\"Industriegebiet Fliegerhorst\\". The old airfield headquarters building was torn down in 2009; nothing remains of the airfield. References * R-33 Gardelegen * Johnson, David C.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Hutchinson's brother-in-law A. E. \\"Beanie\\" Backus, who was married to Hutchinson's sister Patsy, often had James and Joan over for painting, socializing, and listening to live jazz. Some of these gatherings included a variety of people such as Zora Neale Hurston, Bob Cushman, and Art Pottorff. Backus and Hutchinson were very close friends in the 1950s and remained so up to Backus' death. They traveled to Jamaica and all over the Florida coast, painting many beautiful landscapes back to back. In the 1950s and 1960s, The Highwaymen, a group of African-American artists including Alfred Hair and Harold Newton, became close friends of Backus and Hutchinson. The Highwaymen emulated the art they saw in Backus' studio and sold quick, stylized pieces on Highway US 1 and A1A. Although Backus and Hutchinson admired and supported the energy put into the Highwaymen's work, they kept to their own entrenched and studied styles. Once married, James and Joan Hutchinson lived in the now historic Golden Gate Building in Golden Gate, Florida, when the Owen K. Murphy Foundation and The Arthur Vining Davis Foundations offered them the opportunity to live on the Brighton Seminole Reservation, where Hutchinson painted the Seminole and Miccosukee people in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Hutchinsons lived on the reservation with the Seminoles for four to six years, producing 10 paintings a year for the State of Florida, resulting in 50 paintings depicting the Native Americans. During that time, Hutchinson became close friends with many of the Seminole elders, such as Billy Bowlegs, Charlie Cypress, Charlotte Tommy, and Billy Osceola. In the mid-1990s, the Hutchinsons moved to Hawaii, where James studied and painted many Hawaiian scenes depicting the native Hawaiians, as well as the scenic beauty of the islands. After many years in Hawaii, the Hutchinsons returned to their original home in Sewalls Point, Florida in late 2011. Since their return, Hutchinson has been featured in several shows both private and public along the Treasure Coast, including showings at The Elliott Museum, Singer Island, Jupiter Island Town Hall, and many galleries in Miami and Palm Beach.

She was also a strong advocate for peace, feminism and environmental issues.  Life and education  Derkert was born on 30August 1888 in the parish of Adolf Fredrik Church in Stockholm. She was one of seven children of merchant Carl Edward Johansson Derkert and Emma Charlotta Valborg, born Fogelin. She received her first artistic education at the Caleb Althin school of art in Stockholm, where she started in 1904. She went on to the Royal Institute of Art in 1911‚Äì13. In 1913, Derkert moved to Paris where she studied at the Acad√©mie Colarossi and the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re together with Swedish sculptors Ninnan Santesson and Lisa Bergstrand, until the start of World War I in the autumn of 1914. In February 1914, the three friends spent five weeks in Algiers where Derkert was introduced to more vibrant and bolder color schemes. During and after the war she spent some time in Italy, where her first child Carlo was born. Derkert was also a student at the Kvinnliga medborgarskolan vid Fogelstad (Fogelstad Citizen School for Women) where she arrived in September 1943. The stay proved inspirational for her later works. She made several sketches of the women in charge of the school, among them Honorine Hermelin and Ada Nilsson. Derkert had three children: a son Carlo (1915‚Äì1994) with Finnish artist Valle Rosenberg and daughters Liv (1917‚Äì38) and Sara (born 1920) with Swedish illustrator Bertil Lybeck. Derkert was married to Lybeck in 1921‚Äì25, but they did not live together. Derkert died on 28April 1973 in Liding√∂, and is buried in the Liding√∂ churchyard.  Artistic career  Derkert working on the carvings in the √ñstermalmstorg metro station Derkert is known as an artist with a strong personal and Expressionistic style. In her early works, particularly from her time in Paris, elements of both Cubism and Fauvism can be found. She made paintings of figures in grayscale, mostly using pastels as well as paintings of interiors and portraits of children. During the 1910s, she worked as a fashion illustrator. It was not until the 1940s, that she made her breakthrough in the art community. This also coincided with her new political engagement in the peace movement and feministic issues. Siri Derkert designed fashion plates, fashion collections and designed costumes during the 1910s and early 1920s. Cubism and modernism was reflected in her designs with geometric shapes and patterns made from the layering of fabric and stringing of beads and pearls to create square and rectangular shapes. The pearls and rich colors she used reflected oriental and Egyptian influence in her costumes as well. At this time Russian Ballet had a heavy influence on fashion design and inspired an avant garde dance show she participated in producing in 1917. The dance show was produced in a theater in Stockholm knows as the Intiman, with collaboration from artist Anna Petrus, M√§rta Kuylenstierna, and her sister Sonja Derkert. Together they combined many art forms into a Gesamtkunstwerk using dance, costumes, music, and scenery. Though they never created a sequel, the costumes received recognition and compliments. These costumes were designed at a school for training dressmakers knows as the Birgittaskolan, where Derkert produced two collections per year. Siri Derkert herself wore men's bohemian style clothing including men's trousers. This was common amongst women artists at this time to emphasize modernity and liberation. She became known to a greater audience when she was asked to do the art in the √ñstermalmstorg station of the Stockholm metro. Since the station was designed to serve as a shelter in case of a nuclear war, Derkert filled the walls with messages of peace, feminism and notes from revolutionary songs. When her exhibition R√∂relser i alla riktningar (\\"Movements in all directions\\"), opened in April 1960, she became the first woman to hold a solo exhibition at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm. Derkert's work is represented at the Nationalmuseum, Moderna Museet, Museum of Sketches for Public Art and Gothenburg Museum of Art. Her work can also be found on a stamp issued by the Swedish postal service in 1982, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Elin W√§gner.  Political engagement  She was an ardent advocate for peace, feminism and environmental issues. This commitment started in the early 1940s and grew during the rise of the Swedish peace movement in the 1950s, when Derkert became leader of the Stockholm section of the Svenska Kvinnors V√§nsterf√∂rbund (the Swedish Women's Left-wing Association). At the time the Swedish Security Service monitored all participants in that new movement and consequently her activities were meticulously recorded in their files. When Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969, the Swedish Radio invited some noted Swedes to comment on the event during the broadcast. Derkert was chosen to speak along with former leader of the Communist Party of Sweden C.-H. Hermansson and archbishop Ruben Josefson. She has been described by Martin Gustavsson as a \\"bird loving motorcycle-Marxist\\".  Awards  She was awarded the Prince Eugen Medal in 1960, and in July the same year she received the Guggenheim International Award of US$1,000 for her painting F√•gel i topp (\\"Bird on top\\").

Life and work Laurentius Cyrillus Johansson was born in G√§vle, Sweden. He was the son of Magnus Johansson and Johanna Charlotta Bohlin His father worked as a stonemason. He studied architecture at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg and graduated in 1908. After his studies he moved to Stockholm to pursue his career as an architect. Although productive as an architect already during the 1910s, he became renowned through his design for the main storage building for the liquor company Vin & Sprit, built 1920-24. This building effectively established Cyrillus Johansson as one of the most influential architects in Sweden during the 1920s, and he became one of the most prolific representatives of the so-called Nordic Classicism-movement. Other notable works from this period include the Museum of V√§rmland in Karlstad, a large office complex in central Stockholm () and two large villas in Diplomatstaden in Stockholm. Following the Stockholm Exhibition in 1930 and the advent of Functionalism, Cyrillus Johansson's aesthetic language fell out of favour with the broad architectural community in Sweden. Johansson himself considered the new ideas \\"a personal affront\\" and continued to pursue his personal architectural ideals. In the 1940s, as the functionalistic doctrines were softened somewhat and an economic crisis caused by the ongoing World War II prompted a revival for building in cheaper brick, arguably Johanssons favourite material, he experienced something of a comeback and was among other things commissioned with designing buildings for the Military Archives of Sweden and other military offices in G√§rdet, Stockholm. He also designed the Fagersta airspace surveillance tower. During the 1950s, he was mainly engaged in church building (e.g., the church in Bj√∂rneborg) and restoration. Style Cyrillus Johansson preferred to work with brick, inspired to some extent by German Brick Expressionism, and to some extent by National Romanticism. As mentioned above, he also became a practitioner of what has been labelled Nordic Classicism in the 1920s, although he relied on historical references to earlier Swedish architecture to a perhaps greater extent than to continental Classical architecture. Strong influences from Japanese and Chinese Architecture together with various personal forms of expressions however often add a distinct character to his buildings. In addition to highly prestigious commissions such as grand villas and office complexes, Johansson also worked with Industrial architecture and the like, providing designs also for bridges, water towers and factories, among other things. =Gallery= File:Vattuormen 33.JPGResidential house in Stockholm, 1923‚Äì24 File:V√§rmlands museum, 2011.jpgMuseum of V√§rmland (}), Karlstad, 1929 File:Ludvika stadshus.jpgLudvika Town Hall, Ludvika, 1936‚Äì38 File:Essinge kyrka front.jpgChurch on Stora Essingen, Stockholm, 1959 References External links * Category:1884 births Category:1959 deaths Category:20th-century Swedish architects Category:Chalmers University of Technology alumni Category:People from G√§vle ","title":"Cyrillus Johansson"},{"id":"35685476","text":"Arvid Kurck (also known as Arvid Kurki; 1464 in Vesilahti ‚Äì 22 July 1522 in √ñregrund) was the Roman Catholic Bishop of Turku from 1510 to 1522.Archdiocese of Turku (in Finnish).

It tells the story of a young Austrian writer who travels across the United States in search of his wife from whom he is estranged. The film- director John Ford appears as a character who brings resolution at the end of the road on the coast of California. His film Young Mr. Lincoln also serves as a point of reference and an antidote to the alienation experienced by the stranger crossing the States. The novel shares many themes and motifs with the film Alice in the Cities from 1974, directed by Handke's frequent collaborator Wim Wenders; the film can be seen as a response to the book.

In 1866 he enrolled at a teacher's college in Karlstad and took the last name of Frykman, which derived from the valley where he was born: Fryksdalen. After graduating in 1868 Frykman worked as a primary schoolteacher at schools in V√§rmland and √ñsterg√∂tland. He married Betty Jonsson in 1869, with whom he had ten children. The couple's association with the Free Church and P. P. Waldenstr√∂m led to conflicts with the school board until finally in 1883 Frykman gave up his teaching position.Twice-Born Hymns by J. Irving Erickson, (Chicago: Covenant Press, 1976) pp. 94-95. For the next few years he devoted himself to the ministry, spreading the Gospel as an itinerant preacher. During all of this time Frykman was a prolific hymnwriter, publishing his lyrics in the Christian weekly Sanningsvittnet (Witness of the Truth). America In 1888 Frykman and his family immigrated to the United States after he had accepted a pastorate at the Tabernacle Church of Chicago. They remained in that city until 1889 when he was called to Salem Mission Covenant Church in Pennock, Minnesota. He served the congregation there until his retirement in 1907. His final years were spent in Minneapolis, where he held administrative posts with the Covenant Church. In 1908 he oversaw the publication of Sions Basun (Zion's Trumpet).Sions Basun (Chicago: Svenska evangeliska missionsf√∂rbundet i Amerika, 1909).

She founded the Atlantic Center for the Arts in 1982. She was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 1999. Leeper was born on April 4, 1929, in Charlotte, North Carolina. She attended Duke University, originally intending to become a brain surgeon ‚Äì the origin of her nickname \\"Doc.\\" She eventually graduated in 1951 with a degree in art history. In 1958, while working in the field of commercial art, she moved to the small community of Eldora, Florida, situated on a barrier island between New Smyrna Beach and Titusville, Florida. As a result of her presence there, Leeper became increasingly interested in environmental preservation.Moore, Roger. \\"Doris Leeper Was A 'Force For The Arts': The Atlantic Center For The Arts Was Among The Volusia Woman's Many Creations,\\" Orlando Sentinel (April 12, 2000). By 1961, she had become a full-time artist, specializing in painting and sculpture. Her work is in over 100 collections in the U.S. and abroad. By the early 1970s, Leeper was a well-known figure in the Florida environmental movement, and was instrumental in the 1975 creation of the Canaveral National Seashore (CANA), which encompassed the island on which Eldora was located. Leeper conceived of the Atlantic Center for the Arts in 1977, envisioning it as a Florida artist-in-residence program in which artists of all disciplines could work with current prominent artists in a supportive and creative environment. Leeper saw the potential for an artist's residency as a place for ideas to be created, shared, and come into fruition. She soon persuaded friends and community members to join in her vision. In 1979, she convinced the Rockefeller Foundation to provide a challenge grant that soon was matched. This $25,000 in seed money was the unofficial inception of the ACA. When a prime piece of property became available on the shores of Turnbull Bay, a tidal estuary west of New Smyrna Beach, Leeper raised the $50,000 necessary to buy the ten-acre plot. Three years later, five main buildings were completed. Over the years, five more buildings were constructed and an additional 59 acres were purchased as preserve land. The ACA officially opened in 1982 for the first residency with author James Dickey, sculptor Duane Hanson, and composer David Del Tredici. Since then, over 155 interdisciplinary residencies have taken place, featuring over 430 Master Artists and over 3,500 Associate Artists from around the world. Leeper was awarded honorary doctorates from Duke and from Stetson University. She was named Florida ambassador of the arts, and inducted into the Florida Hall of Fame in 1999. A 45-year retrospective of her work was held at Cornell Fine Arts Museum in 1995. She died April 11, 2000 as the last resident of Eldora. After her death, the management of the town was officially turned over to the federal government, as the town is located more than two miles within the borders of the Canaveral National Seashore. The town claims no permanent residents and visitation is limited and subject to park hours. Only two of its original buildings remain.

Biography  Eva Moberg was the daughter of author Vilhelm Moberg and grew up in Stockholm. She graduated from secondary school in 1952, and in 1963 she became a licentiate of literary history, religious history, and practical philosophy with her thesis K√§rlek och k√∂n, en studie i Colettes diktning (English: Love and gender, a study of the poetry of Colette). She was editor of Fredrika-Bremer-F√∂rbundet's periodical Hertha (1960-1962), culture editor in the weekly magazine Vi (1967-1976) and a columnist for Dagens Nyheter (1976-1992). She wrote about social issues, politics, and ethical questions. From 1968 to 1970 she held a position as a script writer for Sveriges Television, Sweden's national television network. There, she wrote a series of notable TV variety shows, and later several sitcoms. Moberg was an early participant in the gender equality debate in Sweden. In 1961 she published the article \\"Kvinnans villkorliga frigivning\\" (Woman's Conditional Release), which is considered a Swedish feminist classic. (See a link to it under \\"External links\\" below.) In that article she argued that equality between men and women was still far off, as women were still expected to see marrying and having children as their purpose in life. Her essay started an intense and long-lived debate on men's and women's roles in the family and the society at large. By the middle of the 1960s she became a member of Group 222, a loosely organized activist group for gender equality. Group 222's and Moberg's ideas of an equitable society criticized the traditional man's role; they claimed to seek not only women's but also men's emancipation. \\"Men are better than the patriarchy\\" was one of Moberg's important ideas - it also became the title of a lecture she later held abroad in the 1990s. In the 1970s, Moberg also became involved in campaigns against nuclear power and later in questions of pollution and as a champion of animal rights. From 1964 to 1976, Moberg was married to TV producer Hans Hederberg, with whom she had a daughter in 1966. Eva Moberg later lived, until her death, with author Gottfried Grafstr√∂m.

She is mainly known for her figurines and reliefs.  Early life and education  Milles was born Ruth Anna Maria Anderson on √ñrby Manor in Vallentuna near Stockholm, Sweden. She was the daughter of Chief Verifier of the br√§nnvin manufacturing in Sweden, Emil Anderson (1843‚Äì1910), called \\"Mille\\". She had two siblings when her mother died in childbirth and gained three half siblings after her father remarried. Her brother was the sculptor Carl Milles (1875‚Äì1955) and her half brother Evert Milles (1885‚Äì1960) was an architect. Unlike her brother Carl, Milles was a college educated artist. She studied at the Tekniska Skolan (the Technical School), predecessor to the Konstfack University College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm in 1892‚Äì93, after which she went on to the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1894‚Äì98, where she was considered talented enough to skip a year. She would also visit the Theosophical Society which became influential for her future works.  Career  In the autumn of 1898, Milles left for Paris, approximately a year after her brother Carl had moved there. She studied at the Acad√©mie Colarossi and √âcole des Beaux-Arts, and used Paris as base for journeys through France and Germany. Milles and her brother spent much time together in Paris where they collaborated, artistically and economically, in a joint company they started. Among other things, the company sold small bronze figurines, depicting children and characters from fairy tales made by her. She spent the summers in the fishing village Briac in Bretagne where she would draw inspiration from the local fishers' life for her sculptures. Her sculptures were made in an early Impressionistic style. While in France, she and her brother changed their surname to Milles after their father's nickname. In 1902, she received an honorary award at the Salon in Paris. The next year she fell ill with tuberculosis. She travelled back to Sweden and settled down in Islinge on Liding√∂, where she set up a studio which she sometimes shared with the wife of her brother Carl, Olga Milles. Milles got many commissions from cultural institutions in Stockholm, among them the Royal Dramatic Theatre for medallions and busts of the singer Jenny Lind and the actor Georg Dahlqvist. In 1904‚Äì16, she participated in a number of international exhibitions like in St. Louis (1905) and Buenos Aires (1910), where she received silver medals for her work, Rome (1911), the world's fair in San Francisco (1915) and the Swedish art exhibition in Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition, Denmark (1916). However, her failing health forced her to abandon her sculpturing and she turned first to painting and later to writing instead. She also made illustrations for books, her own and those of other writers. In 1932, she moved to Rome.

During the tenure of her spouse in office, she played a considerable political role. Christina Piper became known in history as a landowner and builder. She is known as one of the most successful female entrepreneurs in contemporary Scandinavia, and as one of the greatest builders in the history of Scania. Biography Christina Piper was born to the very wealthy merchant and city official Olof Hansson T√∂rne and Margareta Andersen. Her father was ennobled by the name T√∂rnflycht in 1698, but as she married eight years before this, she never wore that name herself. On 13 February 1690, she married the royal official Carl Piper, who was 26 years her senior and the stepbrother of her father. The marriage was arranged for economic reasons: her husband was in need of funds, and as a relative with a good career (he had been ennobled during his career in royal service) he was seen as a good asset to keep in the family. The couple had eight children. =Political activity= In 1697, her spouse was appointed statsr√•d and the following year baron and count, and it became clear he had replaced Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna as the perhaps most favored of the advisers of the monarch, a position he kept until 1709. As was normal for the wife of a politician at the time, this gave Christina Piper an influential role, as she was seen as a potential channel to her spouse, and she began to host a receptions and participate in court life, where she was besieged by diplomats and supplicants attempting to reach her spouse (and by him the King) through her. During the 1700s, Christina Piper and Carl Piper played a similar role as Magdalena Stenbock and Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna in the 1680s and 1690s, and as Margareta Gyllenstierna and Arvid Horn in the 1720s and 1730s: that of a married couple acting as political colleagues.Norrhem, Svante, Christina och Carl Piper: en biografi [Christina and Carl Piper: a biography], Historiska media, Lund, 2010 (Swedish) Carl and Christina Piper gained a notorious reputation by their contemporaries for being corrupted by bribes. It is noted that Carl Piper were often offered gifts in exchange for making recommendations for posts to the monarch on behalf of diplomats and supplicants, which was not unusual in that period, but that he normally refused to accept gifts. However, he did accept and even encouraged petitioners to give gifts to his wife: she would then make the recommendations on behalf of the petitioners to him, often successfully.Norrhem, Svante, Christina och Carl Piper: en biografi, Historiska media, Lund, 2010 This was, not an unusual method for contemporary officials - their predecessors as a political power couple, Bengt Oxenstierna and Magdalena Stenbock, had in fact done the same - and one reason to why they were given such a notorious reputation because of it may have been the fact that they, being members of a very recently ennobled noble family, were resented by the older nobility as upstarts. In 1700, Carl Piper left Sweden in the entourage of Charles XII to participate in the Great Northern War, leaving Christina in charge of the family affairs. She visited him in the Swedish military headquarters on two occasions: the first one in Rawicz in 1705, and the second time in Altranst√§dt in 1707. On her first visit, she was received by the Polish queen Catherine Opali≈Ñska and introduced at the Polish court at Rydzyna Castle. Carl Piper was contemplating to visit Sweden for his health, as he was ill at the time, but she persuaded him to stay. During her second visit, in 1707, Carl Piper was approached by John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who allegedly offered him a pension in exchange for advising Charles XII to attack Russia.Norrhem, Svante, Christina och Carl Piper: en biografi, Historiska media, Lund, 2010 After the Battle of Poltava, which became disastrous for Sweden, Carl Piper was blamed for having ultimately caused the defeat by persuading Charles XII to the Swedish invasion of Russia having been bribed by Marlborough. Carl Piper denied having accepted the bribe, but he did admit that he had accepted a gift of two valuable earrings from the Duke to his wife Christina Piper, who also admitted having accepted them, but denied having done so as a bribe.Norrhem, Svante, Christina och Carl Piper: en biografi, Historiska media, Lund, 2010 One her way home, she was escorted by the Prince of W√ºrttemberg and a large entourage, and visited Berlin, where she was given a grand welcome by the King of Prussia and the royal Prussian court. During her visit, a statue celebrating the Prussian victory over the Swedes at the Battle of Fehrbellin was removed after she had expressed a dislike for it, and she was given a brilliant bracelet as a gift by the King.Norrhem, Svante, Christina och Carl Piper: en biografi, Historiska media, Lund, 2010 Back in Sweden, she participated in court life, where she was a member of the group consisting of herself, Arvid Horn, the queen dowager's priest Molin, Beata Sparre, and M√§rta Berendes who evicted the favorite Anna Catharina von B√§rfelt from court by forming an alliance with Carl Gyllenstierna. At the Battle of Poltava 1709, Carl Piper were taken as a prisoner to Russia, where he remained until his death seven years later. When the disastrous news of the Swedish defeat reached the capital of Stockholm, panic erupted and the bank was emptied: Carl Piper was blamed for having persuaded the King to attack Russia, and according to the reports of the Danish and French envoys, Christina Piper was attacked by a mob and forced to flee the capital.Norrhem, Svante, Christina och Carl Piper: en biografi, Historiska media, Lund, 2010 She managed negotiations with the government to trade her spouse for Russians prisoners in Sweden, which however did not succeed. According to contemporary unconfirmed rumors, she did in fact not wish for him to return, as she liked the independence she had in his absence. Carl Piper died in his captivity in Russia in 1716: he was brought home in 1718, and finally buried in 1719. =Later life= After the capture of her spouse, Christina Piper lost all influence over state affairs: she was not popular in the capital, and her connections were of no use after the fall of Carl Piper. For the rest of her life, she devoted herself to her position as a respected matriarch of her family, and her affairs as a major landowner, and traveled between her estates, having her base at Krageholm Castle in Scania. She used her position as a landowner to affect the local policies, and became an important figure in national economy: she was one of the greatest financiers of the Great Northern war. After the death of her daughter Charlotta (d. 1727), she became the foster mother of her grandchildren by her: Eva Charlotta, Nils Adam and Christina Sofia (the youngest of whom being the mother of Magdalena Rudensch√∂ld). In 1712, she moved from the capital to her estates in Scania because of the costs. She acquired a great deal of additional estates to the ones she already had, and became known as the most important builder in the history of Scania. She owned and managed the estates Sturefors Castle, Krageholm Castle, Bj√∂rnstorp Castle and √ñstra Torup. In 1725, she acquired and estate in Andrarum, which she made the biggest producer of Alum in Scania, with 900 employees. She created schools, retirement homes, a prison, a court and hospitals for her employees; she also had a coin factory made, which produced coins with the stamp of her initials, \\"C.P.\\", which were only possible to use in the shops at her estate. Upon this estate, she had the Christinehof Castle built (1740). Christina Piper also had six so called \\"fideikomiss\\" founded, estates which could not be sold but could only be inherited.

Life and career  Carl Wilhelm Carlberg, who was born on 9 March 1746 at √ñrgryte and died on 8 April 1814 in G√∂teborg. He was the son of Bengt Wilhelm Carlberg during his second marriage, to Jeanna Stina Carlberg, n√©e Blaesinghs. His uncle Johan Eberhard Carlberg was Gothenburg's first city engineer, from 1717 to 1727, and subsequently city architect in Stockholm for 45 years. The Carlberg family has a street in Gothenburg named after it, Carlbergsgatan in the area of the city called G√•rda. Like many wealthy men of his time, he undertook a grand tour of Europe in his youth, visiting France, England, Germany and Italy. The Renaissance style of Italian architect Andrea Palladio was said to make a particular impression on Carlberg. Carlberg is maybe best remembered today as the architect of the Gunnebo House, a neoclassical mansion in G√∂teborg that was built for John Hall, the city's wealthiest inhabitant. The mansion is one of Sweden's best preserved 18th century estates and currently serves as a museum. The building itself is protected since 1963, while the entire estate became a cultural reserve in 2003. He also designed the current building of the Gothenburg Cathedral, the Mariakyrkan church and several homes and trade halls that still stand today.

Location The valley of the middle part of the Cetina river and its surrounding area, known as the District of Cetina, represent the backbone of the entire area and separate geographical region of mountainous Dalmatian hinterland. Its stream flows through dry karst fields covered by sub- Mediterranean vegetation where many archaeological remains are preserved. Modern day ƒåitluk is situated near the town Sinj at the edge of the Cetina valley. History and significance During the Roman administration in the mid-first century AD, Aequum reached the status of an agrarian Roman colony after it was settled by the veterans of LEGIO VII Claudia Pia Fidelis during the rule of emperor Claudius (41‚Äì45 AD). The colonia was founded by Claudius and named colonia Claudia Aequum; it was the only colony in the interior of the province of Dalmatia. Aequum was a planned city of enclosed by walls with features of classic forms of ancient urbanism (urbs quadrata). The town had an orthogonal grid of streets with numerous public building and city fortifications. Aequum was the center of a wider area where the colonists lived, and it was packed with public services, with very little housing. The city offered colonists from a wider area a place to fulfill their administrative, cultural, religious and social needs and duties. The area is not fully explored. In his 1774 Viaggio in Dalmazia, Alberto Fortis describes the ruins of canals and an ancient amphitheatre. Notable persons Sextus Julius Severus was a member of one of the most notable families in Roman Dalmatia. He served as governor of Moesia and was appointed governor of Britain in 131. According to Cassius Dio, Severus was Hadrian's best general. In 135 AD, he suppressed the Jewish rebellion (Bar Kokhba revolt) in Judaea, the event that marked the beginning of the Jewish diaspora.

Geminus started work in England by working with Thomas Raynalde and producing \\"The byrth of Mankinde\\" aka \\"The Woman's booke\\" in 1545. \\"The byrth of Mankinde\\", was the best English language reference work on midwifery in the 1500s. Its text was translated from Eucharius R√∂sslin's \\"Der schwangern Frauwen und Hebammen Rosengarten\\". Its first English edition was a 1540 translation by Richard Jonas. The second, by Thomas Raynalde, appeared in 1545 and saw many editions in the next 100 years. It discussed fertility, pregnancy, birth, and infant care, with the best anatomical descriptions then available. Its illustrations were again after Vesalius via Geminus‚Äôs \\"Compendiosa\\".Wellcome Library The \\"Compendiosa totius anatomie\\" consisted of 41 unnumbered engraved sheets and was dedicated to Edward VI. One of the sheets was a fold-out engraving of the external anatomy of Adam and Eve; in addition there were 3 engravings of the skeleton, 16 of the muscles, 5 of the arteries and veins, 4 of the nerves, 6 of the organs, 4 of the brain, and one of the eye and its parts, all after woodcuts by Vesalius. The Latin edition of 1545 had been distributed in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and other countries. Geminus wrote in the later English version that it had been produced for the benefit of \\"unlatined Surgeons\\". He had employed Nicholas Udall, the playwright, to translate some of the work, while the text was taken from an early translation of Henri de Mondeville's \\"Surgery\\". The book was a great success, printing three editions in England - one in Latin (1545) and two in English translation (1553 and 1559). In his engraved copies, Geminus removed all the detail he regarded as superfluous, notably the background landscapes which had informed Vesalius's images. The copperplate engravings were the first ever to be done in England, and enjoyed a large following in France. Jacques Gr√©vin, the French poet who also happened to be a physician and writer on matters medical, had print editions done from Geminus's plates in 1564, 1565 and a French translation in 1569. Watermarks suggest that the plates for the 1564 Paris edition were printed in London and then transported to Paris.

It is published in Arabic. History Al Eqtisadiah was first launched as an economic daily in 1962. The founders of the paper were Hisham Hafiz and his brother Mohammad Hafiz. Later, it began to be published by Saudi Research and Publishing Company, a subsidiary of Saudi Research and Marketing Group, on 12 January 1992. The paper has a Gulf edition. Target audience Al Eqtisadiah is often called \\"The Financial Times of Saudi Arabia\\". Therefore, its target population is primarily businesspeople as well as academics, and senior government employees in the Kingdom and the GCC. Al Eqtisadiah is reported to rapidly secure a loyal readership of Saudi executives and government officials. The paper is also read by educated Saudi women and female students. Ownership Al Eqtisadiah is one of the daily newspapers published by Saudi Research and Publishing Company (SRPC), one of the Saudi Research and Marketing Group (SRMG) companies. The other daily newspapers published by SRPC are Arab News and Al Sharq Al Awsat. The chairman of SRMG is Turki bin Salman Al Saud. Content Al Eqtisadiah is the only specialized business and financial newspaper in the Kingdom. The paper provides both news coverage and research, analysis and commentary on economic and business-related events at domestic, regional and international levels. It also provides the translated articles and news from major international business publications, including the Financial Times, the Harvard Business Review, INSEAD, and Frankfurter regarding major economic events and developments. The newspaper closely deals with consumer affairs as well as financial trends within the region and abroad. It offers its readers opinions about their financial initiatives and investments. It monitors the developments throughout the Kingdom by focusing on social and economic trends and uncovering important issues that have impact on communities as well as the country's economy as a whole. Additionally, daily in-depth articles published provide an analysis of how developments may affect the Saudi economy. Although Al Eqtisadiah was founded as a financial daily paper, it is equally known for its political content, often printing editorials and opinion harshly critical of the US on a number of fronts. On the other hand, during the term of its former chief editor Abdul Wahab Al Faiz, Al Eqtisadiah a few years before 2009 appeared to return to its original finance-focus, gradually moving away from political opinion and focusing on themes of interest to the region's business elite. However, Al Eqtisadiah seems to return to the pre-Al Faiz period, since editor-in-chief Salman Al Dossari published an article challenging the Russia's stance over Syrian government on 24 March 2012. Specifically, Al Dossari harshly criticized Russia, especially Sergey Lavrov, for supporting Bashar Assad and argued that the same tactics used by Russia to oppress Muslim majority in Chechnya and the Caucasus have been used by Assad to oppress Sunni majority in Syria. The paper also contains a section on environmental issues which is published weekly. Circulation Al Eqtisadiah had a circulation of 76,928 copies in the beginning of the 2000s. Its 2007 circulation was about 60,000 copies. The paper's website was the eighth among top 63 online newspapers of the Arab world in a ranking published by Forbes Middle East magazine in 2011. Chief editors Former editor-in-chief of Al Eqtisadiah was Muhammad Faraj Al Tunisi, who resigned due to personal reasons in 2003. He had been in this post since 1992.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy The Liberal MP for Manchester South, Sir Arthur Haworth was appointed a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury. In keeping with the times he was required to seek re-election in a by-election. Electoral history Haworth had gained the seat from the Conservatives at the 1906 general election, and held it since. The previous General Election in December 1910 saw Haworth returned unopposed. The last contested election was the previous General Election; Arthur Haworth Craig, F. W. S. (1974). British parliamentary election results 1885-1918 (1 ed.). London: Macmillan. Candidates The Liberal candidate, 47-year-old Arthur Haworth was a Manchester businessman fully established in the community. Haworth again faced just one opponent, the Conservative Philip Glazebrook. Thirty-two-year-old Glazebrook was a Captain in the Cheshire Yeomanry and also involved in business in Manchester. He had not stood for parliament before, though in December 1910 he was chosen as Conservative candidate to contest the constituency of Manchester South at the general election. However, due to an error by his election agent, he arrived at Manchester Town Hall six minutes after nominations had closed, resulting in the unopposed election of Haworth. Campaign Polling day was set for 5 March. A vigorous campaign was held, with the main issues being woman suffrage with the Parliamentary Franchise (Women) Bill soon to be debated, Irish Home Rule (the Third Home Rule Bill was currently being debated in parliament) and National Insurance, which had been introduced by the Liberal Government the year before. Result The Conservatives gained the seat from the Liberals. The details below, with percentage changes are a change from January 1910. Craig, F. W. S. (1974). British parliamentary election results 1885-1918 (1 ed.). London: Macmillan. Aftermath In parliament, Glazebrook recorded his vote against the Parliamentary Franchise (Women) Bill. A General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the autumn of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. Unionist Party: Philip Glazebrook, Liberal Party: Sir Arthur Haworth. Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place. In early 1918 Philip Glazebrook was killed in action. Unionist, Robert Burdon Stoker was returned unopposed in the following by-election. At the 1918 general election, Haworth was Liberal candidate for Manchester Exchange but failed to make a return to parliament.

He is known as an Aditya by virtue of being born to Aditi. Etymology M√¢rt√¢nda is etymologically derived from m√¢rta meaning ‚Äúdead or undeveloped,‚Äù (being connected with mrita, the past participle of mri to die) and √¢nda, an egg or a bird; and it denotes a dead sun, or a sun that has sunk below the horizon.Arctic Home in the Vedas, B G Tilak Mentions Martand Sun temple, built in 8th-century CE in Anantnag, Jammu and Kashmir is dedicated to MƒÅrtanda. Book 10, Hymn 72 of the Rigveda has the following verse: ::Eight are the Sons of Aditi who from her body sprang to life. ::With seven she went to meet the Gods she cast Martanda far away. ::So with her Seven Sons Aditi went forth to meet the earlier age. She brought ::Martanda thitherward to spring to life and die again. Aditi at first had only seven sons but later gave birth to an eighth son named MƒÅrtanda. Although many hymns in the Rigveda mention him along with the other Adityas as a form of Surya, as evident from the verse above, Aditi shunned him. Surya temple at Martand, photographed by John Burke, 1868. The Taittir√Æya Aranyaka reads - tat par√¢ M√¢rt√¢ndam √¢ abharat (she set aside M√¢rt√¢nda for birth and death). The Aranyaka then proceeds to give the names of the eight sons as Mitra, Varuna, Dh√¢t·πõi, Aryaman, Amsha, Bhaga, Indra and Vivasvat. But no further explanation is added, nor is it told which of these eight sons represented M√¢rt√¢nda.The Taittir√Æya Aranyaka, I, 13, 2-3 In the post-Vedic period, when the number of Adityas increased to twelve, the name Vivasvat was added to the canon. Vivasvat and Martanda are often used interchangeably. Martand Sun temple in Anantnag, Jammu and Kashmir is dedicated to MƒÅrtanda.

Users can create wiki applications using the Topic Markup Language (TML), and developers can extend its functionality with plugins. The Foswiki project was launched in October 2008 when a dispute about the future direction of TWiki could not be settled, resulting in the decision of nearly all key TWiki contributors to fork. Since then the codebases have diverged significantly. However, Foswiki continues to maintain compatibility with content written for TWiki. Foswiki stands for \\"free and open source\\" wiki to emphasize its commitment to open source software. The project is governed by the Foswiki Association e.V, a volunteer run, non-profit foundation. The Foswiki website is seen by some as one of the more popular Perl-related websites based upon Alexa rankings of all websites in the world. Features Foswiki features an open architecture programmed and implemented in the Perl and JavaScript languages and runs on standard web servers such as Apache, Nginx and lighttpd. With almost 70 contributors providing over 56,000 commits since its inception, the Foswiki team not only develops the code but also offers on-line support, including on IRC. Core features include a TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor, built-in search engine, default text database, and skinnable user interface, as well as RSS/Atom feeds, e-mail support, and database interfaces to support scalable database solutions such as MongoDB and MySQL. Additional security-related features include an auditable version control system, user authentication, an access control system, cross-site request forgery protection, and improved spam-prevention extensions. Extensions Users have contributed over 300 extensions. Most of these extensions have been developed by or for corporate users, and are maintained by developers and users, as documented in the individual extension histories. Extensions have been developed to link into databases, create charts, tags, sort tables, write spreadsheets, create image gallery and slideshows, make drawings, write blogs, plot graphs, interface to many different authentication schemes, including single sign-on, track Extreme Programming projects, and others. Application platform Foswiki is a structured wiki that acts as an application platform for web-based applications. Specifically it provides database-like manipulation of fields stored on pages, and offers a SQL-like query language to support the embedding reports in wiki pages. Wiki applications are often called situational applications because they are created ad-hoc by users for very specific needs. For example, users have built Foswiki applications that include call center status boards, to-do lists, inventory systems, employee handbooks, bug trackers, blog applications, discussion forums, status reports with rollups and more. User interface The user interface is customizable through use of templates, themes and CSS. It includes support for internationalization, with support for multiple character sets, UTF-8 URLs etc. The English user interface has been translated by users into Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish and Klingon. Deployment Foswiki is expected to be used primarily at the workplace as a corporate wikiPaper on corporate wiki users (slides) to coordinate team activities, track projects, implement workflows\\"The wiki as online conveyor belt\\" section in BusinessWeek article Make Some Noise - How web 2.0 tools can help you communicate with customers more effectively and as an Intranet Wiki, for example in academia. Foswiki (among other components) was used in several research programs including Data Integration Platform for Systems Biology Collaborations, an interactive data integration platform supporting collaborative research projects, based on Foswiki, Solr/Lucene, and custom helper applications. Implementation Foswiki is implemented in Perl and JavaScript (using jQuery), though it can be used without JavaScript being enabled in the browser. By default, wiki pages are stored on the server in plain text files. Everything, including meta-data such as access control settings, are version controlled using RCS. RCS is optional since an all-Perl version control system is provided. Other server-side databases, such as MongoDB, are supported through use of extensions. Informal user reports suggest that Foswiki scales reasonably well even though it uses plain text files and no relational database to store page data, especially where load balancing and caching are used to improve performance. Support Foswiki is an entirely community-driven project, and has no controlling commercial interest behind it. User support is provided by the community, via the mechanisms of IRC and the main website.  History Foswiki started life as a fork of the TWiki project. Since the fork it has been worked on continuously by a relatively large development team. Notable developments since the fork include adoption of the jQuery JavaScript user interface framework, interfacing to the MongoDB NoSQL database, interfacing to the Solr search system, page caching and a modified editing interface.

It tells the story of a female writer and her relationships with two different men, one joyous and one introverted. The book was adapted into a 1991 film with the same title, directed by Werner Schroeter from a screenplay by Elfriede Jelinek. Plot The novel focuses on an unnamed female narrator, known only as I., who explores her existential situation as a woman and writer, both through personal reflection and in dialogue form. She is a writer and intellectual, who lives in Vienna during the second half of the 20th century. The writer shares a flat with the calm and rational Malina, a historian, who offers her the necessary support as she is often confused and seems to be losing touch with reality. She eventually meets Ivan, a young Hungarian, and falls in love with him. They begin an affair but soon Ivan is starting to avoid her and ultimately rejects her. The second chapter, \\"The Third Man\\", is the climax of the narrative. In dream sequences the narrator remembers the horrors of the Second World War, gas chambers and rape. A ‚Äúfather‚Äù figure is omnipresent in her dreams but she realises that he doesn‚Äôt represent her own father but is a personification of the male-dominated world of Nazism. In the third chapter \\"From last things\\" the narrator tries to overcome her problems in dialogue with the always proper but scarcely approachable Malina. The narrator realizes that a relationship with Ivan is not possible, and that for her a relationship with another man won‚Äôt be possible at all. She feels she can‚Äôt live in this male-dominated world anymore. \\"I have lived in Ivan and I die in Malina,\\" she says soberly. At the end of the novel, the writer disappears without a trace into a crack in the wall and Malina removes any sign of her existence from their flat, as if she had never existed. The novel closes with the sentence \\"It was murder.\\" Reception The book was reviewed in Publishers Weekly in 1991: \\"This demanding work contains flashes of great beauty and insight but is ultimately marred by Bachmann's cryptic, fragmented prose and internalized story line that is based entirely on the narrator's emotional responses to events conveyed only obliquely to the reader. Part of the problem derives from the veiled yet critical references to Austrian history, which are satisfactorily explained only in the excellent afterword.\\" See also * 1971 in literature * Austrian literature References Category:1971 novels Category:Austrian novels Category:German-language novels Category:Austrian novels adapted into films Category:20th-century Austrian novels Category:Suhrkamp Verlag books ","title":"Malina (novel)"},{"id":"35685878","text":"Johan Fredrik √Öbom (1901) Johan Fredrik √Öbom (30 July 1817 - April 20, 1900) was a Swedish architect.  Biography  Johan Fredrik √Öbom grave √Öbom was born in the parish of Katarina in Stockholm County, Sweden. He was a student at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm at the same time as Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander (1816‚Äì1881). Prior to this, he was a bricklayer apprentice and student at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Apart from a short study tour to Germany in 1852, he followed the traditional timeline for scientific publication. After the Royal Art Academy and until 1882, he was working at the Swedish government administration of state buildings (√ñverintendents√§mbetet). During the years 1843-1853, he was working as an architect for prison management. He had the entire country as sphere of activity, with both public - and private assignments. He designed manor houses, banks, hotels, factories, hospitals, town halls, churches and theatres. In 1848 he was one of the founders of the Stockholm building association (Stockholms byggnadsf√∂rening). The association was established for the exchange of information and establishment of personal contacts within the trade trades. Johan Fredrik √Öbom was from 1857 one of the first to design stoves for the porcelain manufacturer R√∂rstrands porslinsfabrik.

Biography Hanna Mathilda Winge was born in Gothenburg, Sweden. She was the daughter of blacksmith Johan Thimotheus Tengelin and Anna Maria Hultman, and married the artist M√•rten Eskil Winge (1825-1896) in 1867. Hanna Winge was a student at J. J. Ringdahls m√•larskola (J.J. Ringdahl Art School) in Stockholm in 1859, and at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts in 1864-67, and the student of Johan Christoffer Boklund (1817-1880). Together with Sophie Adlersparre (1823-1895) and Molly Rohtlieb (1836-1914), Hanna Winge was the co-founder of the association Friends of Handicraft (Handarbetets v√§nner) which was founded in 1874 with the purpose of the development and refinement of Swedish textile art. She was the leading force of the association and was inspired by older textile art. She became known for her design in the Old Norse (Fornnordiska) style, such as embroidery inspired by Viking Era patterns with dragon loops for embroidery. Her style inspired the revival of the Old Norse style within art which was also demonstrated in her design of the villa in Lysekil of physician Carl Curman (1833-1913) in 1878, for which she and her spouse were engaged as decorators. Another area in which her style was displayed was in church textiles, where it spread after her design of an altar cloth at Uppsala Cathedral in 1882. She participated in several exhibitions between 1860 and 1885 and was represented as a textile artist at the Art and Industry Exhibition at Copenhagen in 1872 and the Art Exhibition at Vienna in 1873. She designed a reform dress for the Swedish Dress Reform Association. She died during 1896 in Gothenburg. References Related reading *James Graham- Campbell (2013) Viking Art (Thames & Hudson) *A. G.

She mainly considered herself an artist. She died at Roman√§s sanatory in Tran√•s after some years of tuberculosis.  Family  L√∂wenhjelm was the daughter of colonel Gustaf Adolf L√∂wenhjelm (1842‚Äì1929) and Margareta, n√©e Dickson (born 1853). She had five siblings. Her older brother, Carl L√∂wenhjelm, was a medical doctor, and the younger one, Chrispin L√∂wenhjelm (1892‚Äì1983), was an officer and chamberlain. Her cousin Marianne M√∂rner was a docent in French at Lund University. She accompanied L√∂wenhjelm on a trip to Paris and in different ways inspired her in her poetic works. M√∂rner also introduced L√∂wenhjelm's poems and pictures into the literary Sweden of the 1920s.  Education  L√∂wenhjelm studied at Anna Sandstr√∂m's higher teacher seminary, Kerstin Cardon's drawing school, Konstakademien (1909‚Äì1911) and for the previous superintendent of Valands konstskola, professor Carl Wilhelmson.  Literary production  Some of L√∂wenhjelm's most well-known poems are Jakt p√• f√•gel (\\"Bird hunt\\"), Tag mig. H√•ll mig. Smek mig sakta. (\\"Take me. Hold me. Caress me gently.\\") and Beatrice-Aurore, which has been set to music by Hjalmar Casserman. Her poems originally were a complement to her drawings.

Biography The father had been a principal at a school in Finsp√•ng from 1851. Fridtjuv succeeded him 1878 and kept the service until 1881. 1883 Fridtjuv wrote the book \\"Folksolan s√•som bottenskola\\" where he advocated a school system where there was only one type of school for all different classes in society. Fridtjuv sat as a riksdagsman (member of parliament) in the second chamber for Stockholm's city council from 1891 to 1911 and for Stockholm's constituency 1912-1916. In the forming of the Folkpartiet, which year 1900 went into the Liberal coalition party, he started 1905 to be active in a portion of other political questions other than just education questions. After the union dissolution between Sweden and Norway Fridtjuv spoke out against all violent conflicts between the two countries. This resulted in that he at the election year 1905 got less support from the right and the right-liberal voters. When Karl Staaff formed a government November the 7th 1905, with a majority vote system in mind, Fridtjuv became the minister of education. As a minister he successfully created a more equal school system. He was also responsible for a spelling reform year 1906, which removed all spelling with \\"fv\\",\\"hv\\" and \\"dt\\" in the Swedish language. After a proposal of proportional based elections got voted for in the riksdag, Fridtjuv decided that the political war between proportional based and majority based elections needed to rest. About parliamentarism, the nations defense and sobriety questions Fridtjuv joined Staaff. The work Fridtjuv had made as the minister of education had a great support. He was one of the leading politicians revolving liberal education views and Swedish school politics. With the support of the male teachers he proposed that the salary should be dictated by sex for the public servant school teachers. The proposal went through in 1906.

He is one of Sweden's most famous naval officers, as he in 1704 fought a doomed battle against a superior English force, because he refused to strike the flag of his Swedish man-of-war while in English waters when demanded to so by William Whetstone. Early life Psilander was the son of a clerk in the Royal Wardrobe, who died when Psilander was eleven years old. Raised by a friend of the father, the Stockholm Alderman Johan Hagemeister, he joined the Navy as a clerk in 1687. Two years later Psilander was promoted to Gunner's Mate, and the following year to Gunner. To gain experience, and achieve promotion, Psilander joined the Dutch Navy during the Nine Years' War, serving as rating and petty officer, fighting in the Battle of Beachy Head (1690). Promoted to Sub-Lieutenant in his absence, he returned to Sweden in 1695. Wars Psilander's coat of arm as ennobled contain clear references to the Battle of Orford Ness (1704). At the outbreak of the Great Northern War, Captain Psilander served as Flag Captain, under Admiral Cornelius Anckarstjerna, escorting King Charles XII and the Swedish Army to P√§rnu in Estonia. After having served as Frigate Captain in the Bay of Finland, he became Captain of the √ñland, a Swedish ship-of-the line escorting Swedish merchantmen during the Great Northern War. During one of these expeditions, the event that made him one of Sweden's most famous sea officers occurred. Followed by a squadron of eight English ships-of-the-line and a frigate, he refused to strike his flag or lower the topsails to recognize the authority of the English in the English Channel, being under strict orders to not lower his flags under any circumstances by his king. The ensuing Battle of Orford Ness (1704) left his ship of the line captured with fifty-three casualties, but they were eventually released and allowed to return home.Anderson, R. C. (1910). Naval Wars in the Baltic. London: C. Gilbert- Wood, p. 141. Psilander commanded a ship-of-the-line in the Battle of K√∏ge Bay (1710), becoming Deputy Superintendent of the Royal Navy shipyard in Karlskrona the same year. Promoted to Schoutbynacht and Admiralty Commissioner in 1712, he was also ennobled the same year. Favoured by the King's patronage since the 1704 battle, he was promoted to Vice-admiral and superintendent of Karlskrona shipyard 1714, and full Admiral in 1715. In 1716 he became governor of Gotland. The Swedish island in the Baltic was under increasing threats from the ascending Russian Navy, which was repeatedly launching raids upon it. Psilander's mission was to organize the local population in a homeland defence, but this proved unfeasible when the Russian galley fleet under Admiral Fyodor ApraksinHofberg, Herman (1906). \\"Psilander, Gustaf von.\\" Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon. Bonnier, vol. 2, p. 305. in July 1717 carried out a week-long looting of parts of the island.

Later life Psilander's baronial coat of arms is more elaborate, but still contain references to the 1704 battle. After the death of the King in 1718, Psilander belonged to those favoured by the new regime. He became a Baron in 1719, was suggested as Privy Councillor, and commanded a squadron that blocked the Russian Navy at Gdansk. Psilander now belonged to the political elite of the country, participating in all Parliaments from 1719 to 1732. In 1728, he was transferred to the Governorship of Kalmar L√§n in order to be closer to Karlskrona, the seat of the Swedish Board of Admiralty. In 1734 he was one of three naval officers proposed to be Naval Privy Counsellor, but the King chose Admiral Edvard Didrik Taube instead, and appointed Psilander president of the Admiralty Board, replacing the promoted Taube.

K. Sinha, is an Indian nuclear scientist and mechanical engineer. He had served as the Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Government of India from April 2012 to October 2015. Prior to that, Ratan Kumar Sinha had served as Director of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai from May 2010 to June 2012. During the four decades of his illustrious career, Ratan Kumar Sinha held several important positions related to design & development of nuclear reactors for the Indian nuclear programme. He has been actively involved in the development of Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) and Compact High Temperature Reactor (CHTR), two of the highly acknowledged technological innovations which are suitable for large scale deployment of nuclear power, particularly in Indian scenario. As Chairman, AEC and Secretary, DAE, Ratan Kumar Sinha had put special thrust on several key deliverables for sustainable development and deployment of nuclear energy. Major thrust areas, in continuation to his research at BARC, include advanced nuclear energy systems for thorium utilisation and accelerator technology. He had given high priority to application of radiation technology in the areas of healthcare management, agriculture, food preservation and water purification. He had also strengthened outreach activities of DAE for spreading awareness about the peaceful uses of atomic energy among the general public. He had been instrumental in kick starting several public outreach campaigns to present the human face of India's nuclear capabilities. Under his leadership, DAE displayed its first ever tableau in the 66th Republic Day Parade 2015 and had launched its social media page on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/dae.connect) as a part of public outreach initiatives. Ratan Kumar Sinha has coined the phrase ‡§∞‡§æ‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•á‡§µ‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ‡§£‡•Å (Atoms in Service of the Nation) which has been imbibed as the motto of the Department of Atomic Energy. Motto of DAE is a part of the new logo of DAE launched in January 2014. Education and career Ratan Kumar Sinha graduated in Mechanical Engineering from Patna University in 1972, securing the first position in the University. He joined the Reactor Engineering Division of BARC in the year 1973 after completing one-year training course at BARC Training School. After serving in various capacities in BARC, he headed the organisation as the Director during May 2010 to April 2012. He served as Secretary, Department of Atomic Energy and Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission of India from May 2012 till his superannuation in October 2015. Subsequently, he has been conferred the position of DAE Homi Bhabha Chair Professor. He has also been appointed as the Chairman of the newly constituted Thorium Implementation Platform to envision, plan and facilitate implementation of Thorium related programmes of India. He has represented India in several important technical and policy-making forums of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). These include the Steering Committee of IAEA's International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO), of which he was the Chairman for four years from the year 2005 to 2008. Dr. Sinha is nationally and internationally recognized expert in the field of nuclear reactor technology. Contributions to next generation Indian reactors Ratan Kumar Sinha has made significant contributions to the design, experimental development and implementation of next generation Indian reactors. He had been guiding the programmes for new advanced reactors, under design and development at BARC, Mumbai, to utilise thorium as fuel. These programmes include the Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR), which produces most of its power from thorium and has several innovative passive safety systems. Most of the technological innovations in the design of AHWR have been validated under his guidance, in large experimental facilities. He has contributed substantially to design and development of Indian High Temperature Reactors intended for hydrogen generation and has been instrumental in the guiding the design and development of Compact High Temperature Reactor (CHTR), which will serve as technology demonstrator for future larger high temperature reactors. Another salient objective of the CHTR is to demonstrate the technologies needed for transportable nuclear power packs capable of being deployed in remote areas with practically no need for skilled operation and no need to refuel for 15 years. This first-of-its-kind design incorporates thorium based coated particle type nuclear fuel, a reactor physics design to achieve inherently safe neutronic characteristics, use molten lead-bismuth as coolant driven by natural circulation, passive emergency cooling systems that deliver core heat to atmosphere, passive shutdown device and passive control devices capable of operation at very high temperatures. These innovative features are unparalleled in any other reactor in the world. His initiatives in these areas are driven by a vision of achieving energy independence through the deployment of advanced nuclear energy systems that may be located close to population centres in our densely populated country. Dr. Sinha has overseen the launch of various important projects of the Department of Atomic Energy including the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant. The Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) is under advanced stages of construction in Kalpakkam, India. The foundation stone of the 2800 Megawatt Gorakhpur Nuclear Power Plant or the Gorakhpur Haryana Anu Vidyut Pariyojana (GHAVP) was laid in January 2014. Non-power applications and spin-off technologies Ratan Kumar Sinha has enabled development of self-reliance, and achievement of international excellence in several domains of nuclear technology. In addition to guiding programmes for the development of nuclear energy system, he has given high priority to application of radiation technology and spinoff R&D; for enhanced contribution of Department of Atomic Energy towards healthcare management, agriculture & food preservation and water purification and other deliveries of direct societal relevance.

LA 395 turns east and begins a short concurrency with LA 102 that lasts for two sections at which point LA 395 turns north at Raymond toward Elton. LA 102 continues east for another two sections and intersects LA 26 at a point known as Hathaway. LA 26 also runs to Elton on the north. After one more section, LA 102 turns to the south and parallels LA 26 to Jennings. Its bannering likewise changes from west-east to north-south. Reaching the northern border of Jennings, LA 102 crosses over, but does not connect with, Interstate 10 (I-10). Just to the west, LA 26 engages in a full interchange with I-10 at Exit 64. Continuing south into town, LA 102 travels along North Cutting Avenue. At Roberts Avenue, LA 102 intersects LA 97, and the two highways run concurrent for a short distance to the intersection with U.S. 90 (East Shankland Avenue). Here, LA 97 reaches its southern terminus, and U.S. 90 continues west parallel with I-10 toward Lake Charles. LA 102 continues south in a final concurrency with U.S. 90. At East Division Street, the local name changes from North Cutting Avenue to South Cutting Avenue. Shortly thereafter, LA 102 and U.S. 90 intersect South Railroad Avenue at the BNSF/Union Pacific Railroad crossing. Here LA 3055 proceeds to the northwest and connects with LA 26 while U.S. 90 turns to the southeast toward Mermentau. LA 102 then continues south across the railroad tracks. After crossing the southern limit of Jennings, LA 102 intersects LA 1126. It continues south for four more sections then turns west onto Dugas Road and shortly ends at an intersection with LA 26 about north of Lake Arthur. History In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 102 made up parts of several routes, including State Route 105 from Fenton to the west end of the present LA 99 concurrency; State Route 735 to Raymond; State Route 2030 to Hathaway; State Route 702 to the change in direction east of Hathaway; State Routes 701 and 703 to a point just north of Jennings; and State Route 731 through Jennings to its southeastern terminus. LA 102 was created with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, and its route has remained unchanged to the present day.
