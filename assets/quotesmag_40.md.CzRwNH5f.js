He was educated at Kilkenny College, entered Middle Temple in 1718 and was called to the Irish Bar in 1723. In 1741 he married a great heiress, Mary Wooley of East Sheen, who is said to have brought him a dowry of ¬£30,000. She died childless in 1743. He outlived her by thirty years and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Waterford. Legal and political career He was appointed Third Serjeant in 1738 and Second Serjeant in 1741. As a barrister he made his reputation in the celebrated Annesley case, in which James Annesley claimed to be the rightful Earl of Anglesey. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Clonmel and was a reliable Government supporter; he was also for a time Recorder of Clonmel. He became a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) in 1754 and retired in 1766. Vanessa Vanessa - an imagined likeness by John Everett Millais; no true likeness of her survives. In 1723 the warm friendship between Jonathan Swift and Esther Vanhomrigh, for whom he created the name Vanessa, ended in a violent quarrel about another woman whom he had loved for many years, Esther Johnson (Stella); Swift may secretly have married Stella in 1716, although the truth of the matter is impossible to determine. The quarrel arose when Vanessa apparently asked Swift not to see Stella again, and he refused. Vanessa, who was seriously ill with tuberculosis and died a few months later, revoked the will she had made in Swift's favour and made a new will, dividing her estate between Marshall and George Berkeley, later to be a celebrated philosopher and Bishop of Cloyne, and appointing them as her joint executors. Her choice of legatee caused a good deal of surprise since it does not seem that she knew either man well. In the event much of the estate was dissipated in a lawsuit. There is a tradition that Marshall and Berkeley disobeyed a provision in the will that they publish all of Swift's correspondence with Vanessa, but in fact no such provision seems to have existed. Marshall did preserve copies of the correspondence.

This chapel was in the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion derived from the Calvinistic Methodists. In 1823 the congregation came under William Lucy, and shortly migrated to the Lodge Street Chapel. Sortain attended the Bristol Baptist Academy when still young (around 1824); at this period he won an essay prize, in a competition for which Lucy was his sponsor, on the topic Christ's Mission. Reading Micaiah Towgood dissuaded him from going to the University of Cambridge. He then studied at Cheshunt College, and Trinity College, Dublin. He returned to Cheshunt College as a tutor, from 1838 to 1850. Under the initial arrangement he taught mathematics, logic, and belles lettres, for two periods of six weeks in a year.W. J. Mander, Alan P. F. Sell, Gavin Budge (editors), The Dictionary of Nineteenth-century British Philosophers, Volume 2 (2002), p. 1045. From 1832 Sortain was the Countess of Huntingdon's preacher at her North Street Chapel in Brighton, where he was admired as an orator, and noted for not exceeding 30 minutes. He held to the dissenting position of his family, though he was known not to differ much from Anglican theological positions. Henry Crabb Robinson appreciated Sortain as a preacher, while thinking Frederick William Robertson (\\"Robertson of Brighton\\") would rival him. The North Street Chapel in Brighton Sortain died on 16 July 1860. His funeral sermon was given by his friend Richard Alliott at the North Street Chapel. His reputation lapsed, and he could be called a \\"forgotten Bristol celebrity\\" by 1907.Stanley Peerman Hutton, Bristol and its Famous Associations (1907), p. 165; archive.org. Works Sortain was a reviewer during the mid-1830s. He obtained work foe the High Church British Critic, through contacts with the Rev. Richard Harvey of Hornsey, and James Shergold Boone. He wrote also for the Edinburgh Review, at the suggestion of William Empson. These articles of the mid-1830s were anonymous, but attributions to Sortain have been made, for topics such as Brougham on natural theology, Coleridge, Charles Lyell on geology, and Mary Somerville's Connection of the Physical Sciences in the British Critic.John Taylor, Notes on Bristol Huguenots, Proceedings of the Huguenot Society, Vol. III Issue 3 (PDF), p. 373. In the Edinburgh Review topics were Richard Baxter, Thomas Lathbury's History of English Episcopacy, and Jeremy Bentham's Deontology (he thought Bentham's works brought on \\"mental nausea\\"). Harvey, however, seemed to find Sortain's oratory incomprehensible. Sortain wrote A Lecture Introductory to the Study of Philosophy (1839) as a Cheshunt College tutor. He published Romanism and Anglo-Catholicism (1841); at this time he was preaching on Antichrist. The Eclectic Review noticed this work with one by Charles Pettit McIlvaine, as anti-Tractarian, though giving it little space, and regretting the \\"declamatory\\" style, while praising the content. His Life of Francis, Lord Bacon was published by the Religious Tract Society in 1851. Sortain wrote novels, as well as theological and philosophical works: *Hildebrand and the Excommunicated Emperor (1852) *Count Arensberg; or, The days of Martin Luther (1853).

He has had visiting professor positions in the U.S., Israel, the Netherlands, and South Africa. He was awarded the Thur√©us prize (humanities) 2008 by the Kungl. Vetenskaps-Societeten in Uppsala. Between 1978 and 2003, he was one of the editors of the monograph series Coniectanea Biblica, Old Testament Series. Mettinger served as an expert consultant for the official Swedish Bible translation committee, whose work led to the creation of the Bibel 2000 translation. He is a member of various learned societies, such as the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities, Stockholm and the (British) Society for Old Testament Study (honorary member). He has also been a guest lecturer at many universities and delivered papers at many conferences devoted to Old Testament study, Assyriology and Comparative Religion. He has described his epistemological attitude towards studying religious texts using the following words: \\"I try to draw a line [of demarcation] between what I believe I know as a scholar and what I know I believe as a Christian.\\"http://tryggvemettinger.com/about.html In 2011, the Festschrift Enigmas and Images was published in his honor. That volume also includes an almost complete bibliography of Mettinger's publications up to that point. Previously, another Festschrift dedicated to him was also published as a volume of Svensk Exegetisk √Örsbok.http://exegetiskasallskapet.se/sv/SEA/arkiv/65-2000.html In 2015, a volume collecting a number of his scholarly essays was published by Eisenbrauns under the title Reports from a Scholar's Life; the book also includes an English language version of Mettinger's farewell lecture when leaving his professorship at Lund University (a lecture that has given the book its title) ‚Äî summarizing much of his scholarly career. The lecture can also be read online.http://www.tryggvemettinger.com/pdf/Trygger_N.D._Mettinger____Report_from_a_scholars_life.pdf  Central points of scholarship  Among the central points of his scholarly work have been such subjects as Israelite aniconic cult (cult without images), put in the context of a wider study of Ancient Near Eastern religion (the monograph No Graven Image?, in which he argued that the official Jerusalem cult was indeed aniconic in nature), Israelite notions of divinity as reflected in various divine names (In Search of God, subsequently translated into many languages), the state officialdom of the Solomonic era (his doctoral dissertation, Solomonic State Officials), and the question of \\"Dying and rising gods\\" in the Ancient Near East (in the book \\"The Riddle of Resurrection', in which he defended the concept that there were, indeed, prevalent images of divine beings believed to die and return to life again). Another of his studies is The Dethronement of Sabaoth, which deals with the theologies of the Babylonian Exile, as opposed and related to that of the monarchical era - the Babylonian exile creating a cognitive dissonance in the theological traditions connected with the presence of YHWH in the Jerusalem temple, which, according to Mettinger, led to the rise of theologies focused on YHWH's \\"name\\" or \\"glory\\".http://tryggvemettinger.com/research.html His monograph A Farewell to the Servant Songs criticized the notion of a separate collection of \\"Servant Songs\\" in the text of Deutero-Isaiah. Mettinger has worked extensively with extra-biblical material from the Ancient Near East (e.g. Ugaritic, Akkadian). The latter is evident in his study of the Eden narrative (2007), which includes not only comparisons with the Akkadian Adapa and Gilgamesh stories but also uses narratological and literary methods. He has also published Swedish language studies on the biblical creation stories in relation to modern astrophysics (2011) as well as an exposition on the love poetry of Song of Songs (2016), the latter of which uses literary perspectives to elucidate the import of the biblical book. Mettinger has often applied cultural/literary and religio-historical comparison with various Ancient Near Eastern cultures in his exegetical work, as well as perspectives from iconography and archaeology.

Proponents state that it reduces poverty through higher employment and higher incomes. This is expected to lead to improved nutrition and improved education of the borrowers' children. Some argue that microcredit empowers women. In the US and Canada, it is argued that microcredit helps recipients to graduate from welfare programs. Critics say that microcredit has not increased incomes, but has driven poor households into a debt trap, in some cases even leading to suicide. They add that the money from loans is often used for durable consumer goods or consumption instead of being used for productive investments, that it fails to empower women, and that it has not improved health or education. The available evidence indicates that in many cases microcredit has facilitated the creation and the growth of businesses. It has often generated self- employment, but it has not necessarily increased incomes after interest payments. In some cases it has driven borrowers into debt traps. In addition, it can produce unintended rent-seeking entrepreneurship. There is no evidence that microcredit has empowered women. In short, microcredit has achieved much less than what its proponents said it would achieve, but its negative impacts have not been as drastic as some critics have argued. Microcredit is just one factor influencing the success of a small businesses, whose success is influenced to a much larger extent by how much an economy or a particular market grows. A critical review of 58 papers covering experiences in 18 countries concluded \\"there is no good evidence for the beneficent impact of microfinance on the well-being of poor people\\" and that \\"the greatest impacts are reported by studies with the weakest designs\\". The attempt to objectively evaluate the impact of microcredit on a global or a local scale is marred by numerous methodological challenges. There are only few rigorous evaluations of microcredit,The title quotes from Jonathan Morduch's comments made at Innovations for Poverty Action/Financial Access Initiative(IPA/FAI) Microfinance Conference, Oct. 17, 2008. and much of the literature on the impact of microcredit is based in anecdotal reports or case studies that are not representative. Even among the rigorous evaluations many \\"suffer from weak methodologies and inadequate data\\", according to a systematic literature review of the impact of microcredit conducted in 2011 by a group of researchers on behalf of UKAid. A 2008 review of over 100 articles on microcredit found that only 6 used enough quantitative data to be representative, and none employed rigorous methods such as randomized control trials. Rigorous impact evaluations using control and treatment groups are difficult to undertake today, because microcredit is so common in developing countries today that few locations remain where such a research setting can still be applied. Further complicating impact studies is the often highly politicized context of poverty alleviation initiatives. Income and poverty Microlending aims at increasing income through productive activities such as goat herding, as shown here in Rwanda on a cooperative funded through microlending. Among 6 representative studies selected from a sample of more than 100 studies as being methodologically most sound, five found no evidence that microcredit reduced poverty, although they found other positive impacts.Westover J. (2008). The Record of Microfinance: The Effectiveness/Ineffectiveness of Microfinance Programs as a Means of Alleviating Poverty . Electronic Journal of Sociology. Quote:\\"Some studies have found marked decreases in overall poverty levels, including declining levels of extreme poverty (Khandker, 2005), while other studies do not find the same direct effect (Morris and Barnes, 2005; Kan, Olds, and Kah, 2005; Goetz and Gupta, 1996). Still, other studies provide mixed results (Copestake, Bhalotra, and Johnson, 2001; Morduch, 1998).\\" The first randomized evaluation of the impact of introducing microcredit in a new market has been undertaken by Abhijit Banerjee of the M.I.T. Poverty Action Lab in slums in Hyderabad, India, in 2008. It compared two groups of randomly selected slums. In the treatment group banks opened branches that provided microcredits, while in the control group this was not the case. The study showed that fifteen to 18 months after lending began, there was no effect on average monthly expenditure per capita, but expenditure on durable goods increased. Consumption thus shifted from consumables to durable goods. Also, the number of new businesses increased by one third, but they were not very profitable. Pulitzer prize winner Nicholas Kristof quotes another rigorous study by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo covering loans by Spandana in India. In this case, loans were also used to buy durable goods, but in addition they were used to expand existing businesses. Tazul Islam argues that the Grameen Bank does not reach the poorest, since the clients of the bank tend to be clustered around the poverty line of predominantly moderately poor or vulnerable non-poor. Of the poor who join Grameen bank‚Äôs microcredit program, a high percentage often drop out after only a few loan cycles, while many others eventually drop out in later loan cycles as loan amounts begin to exceed their repayment capacity. Nevertheless, he concludes that microcredit in Bangladesh had a \\"positive impact on enterprise and household income and asset accumulation\\". Microloans in Canada have allowed small business owners to make their businesses their primary source of income with 67% of the borrowers showing a significant increase in their income as a result of their participation in certain micro- loan programs. A film by the Danish journalist Tom Heinemann, The Micro Debt, alleges that microcredit in Bangladesh had little impact on poverty. The film highlighted the purported continued poverty of Sufiya Begum, the original loan recipient of Grameen, in Jobra Village. After a thorough investigation in December 2010 by the Norwegian Foreign Ministry, the alleged problems have been proven to be false. Documentary maker Gayle Ferraro found the woman alive and well, confirming the original Grameen story. Milford Bateman, the author of Why Doesn't Microfinance Work?, argues that microcredit offers only an \\"illusion of poverty reduction\\". \\"As in any lottery or game of chance, a few in poverty do manage to establish microenterprises that produce a decent living,\\" he argues, but \\"these isolated and often temporary positives are swamped by the largely overlooked negatives.\\" Bateman concludes that \\"The international development community is now faced with the reality that, overall, microfinance has been a development policy blunder of quite historic proportions.\\" Professor Anu Muhammad of Jahangirnagar University in Bangladesh, a Marxist and critic of microcredit, claims that \\"according to different studies\\" which he does not name, \\"you cannot find more than 5-10 per cent people who could change their economic conditions through micro-credit.\\" German journalist Kathrin Hartmann relates tales of women who she met in 2012 while visiting Kurigram District in Bangladesh trapped in debt. She was told by rural women of brutal methods to enforce debt repayments, including the forced sale of goats, cows, house utensils and land. She also describes intense peer pressure under group lending schemes. Heavily indebted men and women even sold their kidneys to organized groups in order to be able to repay loans, as discovered by the police in summer 2011. Hartmann writes, without quoting a source, that one third of microcredits are taken in order to pay for food or health care, especially during the times of the year called Monga when food and work opportunities are scarcest. Children drop out of school to earn money and families cut down on food expenses in order to repay loans. When natural disasters strike, such as Cyclone Sidr in 2007, weekly instalments to repay loans continue, although the ability of borrowers to earn income has been destroyed by the disasters.Kathrin Hartmann:\\"Erl√∂sen kann uns nur der Tod\\" (\\"Only Death Can Save Us\\"), Frankfurter Rundschau, 30 August 2012 A study in the Philippines by Dean Karlan of Yale University and of Innovations for Poverty Action compared a treatment group, financed through microcredit, and a control group that did not receive microcredit, in Manila. In this case many microcredits were loaned to people with existing businesses. The businesses became more profitable, but laid off unproductive employees including friends and relatives that they previously had felt obliged to employ. Male-owned businesses increased profits, but female-owned businesses did not.Karlan, Dean S., and Jonathan Zinman. 2011. \\"List Randomization for Sensitive Behavior: An Application for Measuring Use of Loan Proceeds.\\", Journal of Development Economics 2012. For a brief summary see: Poverty Action Lab:Measuring the Impact of Microcredit and Interest Rate Sensitivity in the Philippines Debt traps, suicides and group pressure In 2008, economist Jonathan Morduch of New York University noted there were still major gaps in research on microcredit, such as on debt traps and the use of microcredits for consumption. There has been much criticism of the high interest rates charged to borrowers. The real average portfolio yield cited by the sample of 704 microfinance institutions that voluntarily submitted reports to the MicroBanking Bulletin in 2006 was 22.3% annually. However, annual rates charged to clients are higher, as they also include local inflation and the bad debt expenses of the microfinance institution. Interest rates charged by the Mexican Banco Compartamos on their micro-loans reached 86% per year while it sold stocks in the stock market in 2007.Businessweek Online Extra: Yunus Blasts Compartamos In India microfinance institutions have been criticized for creating small-debt traps for the poor in Andhra Pradesh with high interest rates and coercive methods of recovery. Villagers often did not know the interest that they were being charged and were not aware of the consequences of taking multiple loans as they take the second loan to clear the first loan. retrieved on 13 February 2012 In 2010 aggressive lending by microcredit institutions has been blamed for over 80 suicides in Andhra Pradesh. Bangladesh's former Finance and Planning Minister M. Saifur Rahman charged in 2005 that some microfinance institutions use excessive interest rates.Bangladesh Strategic and Development Forum:Saifur takes swipe at micro- credit, 21 November 2005, retrieved on 13 February 2012 A 2008 study in Bangladesh showed that some loan recipients sink into a cycle of debt, using a microloan from one organization to meet interest obligations from another. Field officers who are in a position of power locally and are remunerated based on repayment rates sometimes use coercive and even violent tactics to collect instalments on the microloans. Some microfinance institutions lend only to groups of women. This practice puts loan recipients under pressure, because all women are liable for the loans of the other women in the group and each member can only obtain a new loan if each member has repaid the previous loan. Muhammad Yunus argues that microfinance institutions that charge more than 15% above their long-term operating costs should face penalties.Muhammad Yunus and Karl Weber. Creating a World Without Poverty: Social Business and the Future of Capitalism. PublicAffairs, New York, 2007 Empowerment of women Meeting of clients of the Indian microlender ESAF in the state of Kerala. Microcredit has been directed at women because it was believed that, compared to men, they are better clients of microfinance institutions and that women's access to microcredit has more desirable development outcomes, since women tend to spend more money on basic needs compared to men. Microcredit has also been promoted as a tool to empower women. Early studies tended to confirm this positive picture. For example, a 1996 study in Bangladesh claims that the \\"success\\" of reaching women with microcredit was \\"highly impressive\\", but also notes that loans are often given over to male relatives or husbands. Only in a minority of cases there was an increase in domestic violence for women who did not get the loan or had to wait a long time to get the loan. The study also showed that women are more likely to retain control over their loans in traditional women‚Äôs work like livestock rearing that are considered \\"women's work\\". The President of Grameen Foundation USA suggested in 2005, based on a review of various studies, that \\"there is strong evidence that female clients are empowered\\". It also found that \\"even in cases when women take but do not use the loan themselves, they and their families benefit more than if the loan had gone directly to their husbands\\". However, a 2008 study of microcredit programs in Bangladesh found that women often act merely as collection agents for their husbands and sons, such that the men spend the money themselves while women are saddled with the credit risk.Jason Cons and Kasia Paprocki of the Goldin Institute, \\"The Limits of Microcredit‚ÄîA Bangladeshi Case\\" , Food First Backgrounder (Institute for Food and Development Policy), Winter 2008, volume 14, number 4. The bigger the size of the loan, the more women lose control. For example, a study in Bangladesh showed that women have 100% control over loans that are smaller than 1000 Taka but only 46% of control if the loan is bigger than 4,000 Taka. A study in India showed that women may be put under pressure by their male relatives to join a credit group and indebt themselves. A study in Bangladesh showed that microcredit increases dowries, with women forced at times to take microcredit loans as the only means to pay these increased dowries for their daughters. The first randomized evaluation of the introduction of microcredit, carried out in Hyderabad in India, found no impact on women's decision-making. One scientist argues that empowerment cannot be given to women by (mostly male) development practitioners in the form of loans, since empowerment is a self-directed process. More female employees should be hired by microfinance institutions, and male staff should be trained in gender awareness. Based on the evidence of the two rigorous evaluations in India and in Manila, Nicolas Kristof concludes that \\"there is no evidence that microcredit has any effect on (...) women‚Äôs empowerment.\\" Other impacts Tazul Islam asserts a positive influence of microcredit on the level of education, health and nutrition. In the US, microcredit has created jobs directly and indirectly, as 60% of borrowers were able to hire others. Business owners in Canada were able to improve their housing situation after their income improved due to business expansion facilitated by microloans, 70% indicating their housing has improved. Ultimately, many of the small business owners that use social funding are able to graduate from government funding. According to reports every domestic microcredit loan creates 2.4 jobs. These entrepreneurs provide wages that are, on average, 25% higher than minimum wage. A 2005 review published by the Grameen Foundation summarize scores of studies, concluding that \\"society-wide benefits that go beyond clients‚Äô families are apparently significant\\". Based on the evidence of two rigorous evaluations in India and in Manila, Nicolas Kristof concludes that \\"there is no evidence that microcredit has any effect on health or education.\\" Unintended consequences of microfinance can include informal intermediaton: That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro- entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to even poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.

The fort was built in place of a tollhouse on the southern shore of the Pregel River at the western edge of K√∂nigsberg.Albinus, p. 81 It was included within the new ring of K√∂nigsberg fortifications constructed from 1626‚Äì34. Districts neighboring the fort were Vorstadt to the east, Nasser Garten to the southwest outside of the city walls, and Lastadie to the north across the river. Construction of the fort was resented by the constituent towns of K√∂nigsberg, especially Kneiphof. Friedrichsburg was designed by Christian Otter, court mathematician and Albertina professor. Friedrichsburg's position allowed its cannons to defend the city from the west, monitor incoming traffic from the Frisches Haff, and suppress civil uprising. The fort originally consisted of earthwork, bricks, and ditches. The square-shaped structure included four bastions, nicknamed Smaragd, Perle, Rubin, and Diamant. Initially only the northeastern bastion contained a cavalier and ravelin. Later additions included ravelins along the western and southern fronts, a cavalier along the southwestern bastion, and a covered way along the counterscarp . These additions were possibly completed during the occupation of K√∂nigsberg by the Imperial Russian Army in the Seven Years' War (1758‚Äì62). The additions were not visible on Valerianus M√ºller's plan from 1815.Erhardt, p. 18 The interior of the fort contained a command building, lodging, supplies, and prisons. It had a small permanent garrison of about 150 men, but could host a stronger force if need be. A small church, constructed in 1671, served as the garrison church until 1816. An armory was completed in 1796, but dismantled in 1892.B√∂tticher, p. 9 Peter I of Russia studied the fort in 1697 while touring Europe.Iwanov, p. 120 The fort was used as a state and military prison until 1825; Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg was imprisoned there for insubordination from 1780‚Äì81.Armstedt, p. 222 The Friedrichsburg Gate was completed during the reign of King Frederick William IV of Prussia. The fort was remodeled in 1852 during the reign of King Frederick William IV of Prussia, with construction of the stately Friedrichsburg Gate, new walls, and expansion of the citadel with four round towers. By the end of the 19th century, however, the fort was used only for military storage. To allow construction of new tracks for K√∂nigsberg's goods station, Friedrichsburg was sold to the Prussian Eastern Railway on 23 August 1910 and subsequently dismantled. Segelclub RHE moved from Friedrichsburg to Contienen in 1914. The site was used for storage and automobile exhibitions after the change of German K√∂nigsberg to Russian Kaliningrad resulting from World War II. It is being restored during the 2010s and is part of the Museum of the World's Oceans.

His wins included the Prix de Deux Ans, Grand Criterium, Poule d'Essai des Poulains and Eclipse Stakes. During his racing career he was owned by Edmond Blanc and trained by Robert Denman. After retiring from racing he became a sire in Argentina. Background Val d'Or was a bay colt foaled in 1902. He was sired by British Triple Crown winner Flying Fox. Flying Fox was also a successful stallion in France, with his progeny also including Prix du Jockey Club winner Ajax, Poule d'Essai des Poulains and Prix du Jockey Club winner Dagor, Prix de la For√™t winner Adam and Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner Gouvernant. Val d'Or's dam, Wandora, was a daughter of Bruce. Racing career Val d'Or was unbeaten in four starts as a two-year-old. His wins came in the Prix de Deux Ans at Deauville, the Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte at Maisons-Laffitte, the Prix La Rochette at Longchamp and the Grand Criterium, also at Longchamp. Returning as a three- year-old he won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains at Longchamp. In the Grand Prix de Paris he finished fourth behind winner Finasseur. It was widely believed than he was not at his best for the Grand Prix de Paris, due to him suffering from an illness that affected many horses in the stable. He then travelled over to England for the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park. The favourite for the race was Epsom Derby winner Cicero at 8/13. Val d'Or was second favourite at 3/1, with Llangibby at 9/1. The three outsiders of the six-strong field were Polymelus, Henry the First and Challenger. Polymelus led the field away, being followed by Cicero and Val d'Or. Cicero took the lead as they turned into the finishing straight and was closely followed by Polymelus and Val d'Or. As they neared the finish Polymelus faded away and Val d'Or challenged Cicero for the lead, with Llangibby back in third place. Val d'Or and Cicero raced side by side until the finish, where Val d'Or got the better of Cicero by half a length. Third placed Llangibby was a further three quarters of a length behind, with Polymelus finishing in fourth. Val d'Or had been the strong favourite for the St. Leger Stakes with just a few days to go to the race. However, he was held up for three days in Boulogne due to rough seas and Blanc decided to withdraw him from the race. Stud career It had been intended for Val d'Or to stay in training as a four-year-old, but Edmond Blanc received an offer of ¬£30,000 for him so stand at stud in Argentina, which he accepted. He met with some success as a sire there, with his progeny including Gran Premio Carlos Pellegrini winner Ocurrencia.

Coser Memorial Award for Theoretical Agenda Setting by the American Sociological Association's Theory Section. The Disciplinary Revolution In his 2003 book, The Disciplinary Revolution: Calvinism and the Rise of the State in Early Modern Europe, Gorski offers a new explanation for the rise of a strong, centralized nation-state in certain areas of Europe in early Modernity, when other areas were not as successful. Gorski rejects two of the dominant explanations, which are the bellicist explanation, which sees military growth as key to the emergence of strong states, and the neo-Marxist explanation, which sees economic factors as key to the explanation. Instead, Gorski points to the strong influence of religion in the formation of strong states. Specifically, Gorski sees Calvinism as crucial to the emergence of the Netherlands and Prussia as strong, centralized states, because of its emphasis on discipline and public order. The effects of Calvinism could be seen in crime rates, in education, in military effectiveness, in financial responsibility, and many other parts of Dutch and Prussian social life, all of which increased their ability to form bureaucratic states. Where in the Netherlands the effect of Calvinism was from the ground upwards, as most of its population was indeed Calvinist, in Prussia‚Äîwhere most of the population was Lutheran and only the royal house was Calvinist‚Äîthe effect was from the rulers downwards (to some extent through the Pietist Lutheran movement, which was influenced by Calvinism).

Colin Davis was the president until his death in April 2013. The Group continues to perform operas and other works in London and in Salisbury. Company history and performances Since Falstaff in 1956, a considerable number of operas by Giuseppe Verdi have appeared on the roster, including many of the lesser-known earlier works such as the 1847 version of Macbeth (in 2008); the original French version of I Vespri Sicilianni, the 1855 Les v√™pres siciliennes (1977 and 1999); and several others such as Aroldo (1993); and J√©rusalem (1997). Musicians who have gained experience early in their careers by performing with the Group include Sir Simon Rattle, Sir Mark Elder, and Sir Roger Norrington, Dame Kiri te Kanawa, Sir Willard White, Sir John Tomlinson, Sarah Walker and Jill Gomez. In addition to some of the standard operatic repertory over the years, a recent concert performance which has drawn attention to the Group has been Donizetti's rarely performed Belisario (written in 1836), which starred Nelly Miricioiu under conductor Richard Bonynge and was given at Queen Elizabeth Hall on 13 February 2011.

Originally home to the Reverend John Keep, the house underwent a serious renovation in 1911 in order to transform it into a college dormitory. In 1965, it became the property of Oberlin Student Cooperative Association, the second largest student cooperative in the United States. It is named after its primary trustee, the reverend John Keep, an abolitionist who cast the deciding vote that let African-American students attend Oberlin College, the first institution to do so. History The contract for the construction of Keep Cottage was awarded to Mr. George Feick of Sandusky in October, 1911. The architect was the firm of Patton and Miller of Chicago. The cottage was opened for use in January, 1913. It has dormitory accommodations for fifty-two women. It was named in honor of Rev. John Keep and Mrs. Theodore J. Keep. Mr. George M. Clark and his wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Keep Clark, contributed $10,000 toward the cost of this cottage. The total cost, including equipment and site, was $45,500. OSCA Keep is entirely student-run, with all participating students working as cooks, buyers, administrators, and coordinators. Most decisions within Keep are made by modified consensus. Oberlin bans all fraternities and sororities, making the co-ops the largest student-organized social system at the college. OSCA boards 630 students, the cottage houses 54 of those diners. Similar to Tank and Old Barrows, Keep has a tradition of vegetarian meals, with meat occasionally and vegan options. The intimate and homey lounge is the primary venue for the cooperative's events, historically including the campus-wide Halloween party, the OSCA Chamber Ensemble and weekly astronomy sessions. Keep‚Äôs basement is also home to the Oberlin Bike Co-op, where students can rent bicycles and learn to fix them, too. In the cooperative spirit, each member of the house has an assigned, equitable task requiring some five hours of cooking or house maintenance every week. The Oberlin Student Cooperative Association (OSCA) remains a nonprofit organization, and refunds unspent room and board to its members at the end of the school year.

One of the band's most successful and popular singles, the song was a charting hit in both Canada and the United States, peaking at #4 in the Canadian RPM Hot 100 and #9 in the American Billboard Rock Tracks chart. In 2018, Cochrane released a new solo recording of the song as a charity single to benefit the victims and survivors of the Humboldt Broncos bus crash. Background The song is told from the \\"voice of an anguished hockey parent from an unidentified northern town\\", whose son had earned a scholarship with a U.S. team before being killed when a truck travelling in the wrong lane crashed into his car. While the song is fictional, Cochrane has said it was inspired by a custodian who approached him before a show at a rink and requested Cochrane play his son's favourite song, \\"Boy Inside the Man\\" from the band's 1986 self-titled album. He noticed the man was using the past tense, and as the conversation continued, Cochrane understood that the father's son had died. The story resonated with Cochrane, who said he began to write a song that crafted a stronger hockey narrative and thematic elements of mortality around the basis of his encounter with the father. The singer spent less than half an hour forming the basic structure, which he wrote with only a tape recorder, a guitar and a notepad in a rented bungalow in Mississauga, Ontario. Reception \\"Big League\\" was well received upon release, with the Ottawa Citizen praising Cochrane's song, calling him \\"hockey's man of the moment\\". It has become one of the band's signature songs, and still gets frequent airplay on classic rock radio stations around the world. Accolades \\"Big League\\" was nominated for the Juno Award for Single of the Year in 1989, and won the SOCAN Award for Best Rock Song. British Columbia radio station CKKQ-FM \\"the Q\\" compiled a list of the 150 Best Canadian Songs of All Time, in honour of Canada Day in 2017, where \\"Big League\\" was ranked at #11. In 2006, CBC released a list of the \\"Top 10 Hockey Songs\\", where \\"Big League\\" ranked #3, behind only \\"Fifty Mission Cap\\" by The Tragically Hip and \\"The Hockey Song\\" by Tom Connors.\\"Tom Cochrane releases his reworked version of 'Big League'\\". CTV News, April 19, 2018. Legacy \\"Big League\\" has been used in a number of forms to honour young Canadian hockey players whose lives were cut short. The song has become an enduring part of hockey lore in Canada, particularly for junior hockey teams, whose communities helped build legends and rumours around its origins. Some suggested it was based on the life of George Pelawa, an 18-year-old high school hockey right winger from Bemidji, Minnesota. He was killed in a car accident months after he was selected 16th overall for the Calgary Flames in 1986. Another theory suggested the song was drawn from a separate 1986 accident involving a bus carrying the Swift Current Broncos, which skidded off the road after hitting a patch of black ice. Four players were killed in the crash, including Brent Ruff, the younger brother of Buffalo Sabres captain Lindy Ruff. Pat Quinn played the song in the Vancouver Canucks dressing room when he was coach, according to Cochrane. The Canucks also used the song in a campaign video for player Trevor Linden's candidacy for the Calder Trophy as NHL rookie of the year. Samir Kadri, the father of Colorado Avalanche centre Nazem Kadri, has said the song came on the radio as he was driving to the delivery ward, which he considered an omen for his son's future career. \\"Big League\\" has also commonly been used in tributes to fallen hockey players. It was played at a December 1988 arena memorial service for three players and the coach of a junior hockey team in Alberta who were killed when their car collided with a train near Calgary. It was also the team's theme song. Cochrane performed an acoustic version of Big League during a televised memorial tribute to Luc Bourdon, the Canucks defenceman who was killed in a motorcycle accident in May 2008. Bourdon's family had requested he perform the song before the opening face-off of the Canucks' first home game. Canadian singer-songwriter Del Barber recorded a cover of the song for his 2016 hockey themed album The Puck Drops Here. In 2018, \\"Big League\\" reappeared again as Canadians mourned the deaths of 16 people in Humboldt Broncos bus crash in Saskatchewan. A semi-trailer collided with a bus carrying the youth hockey team, injuring 13 others. One YouTuber asked Cochrane for permission to use the song in a tribute video to the players. Four days after the Humboldt Broncos crash, Cochrane appeared on Canadian sports network TSN to perform an acoustic version of the song before hockey coverage began. He updated the lyrics to imply the players were \\"riding to immortality\\" and placed an emphasis on the unpredictability of life. Eight days later, he released a studio recording of the reworked version as a charity single, with sales proceeds directed to the Humboldt Strong Community Foundation.

It is set during the Jacobite rising of 1745, when an army of Scottish highlanders advanced into England seeking to place Bonnie Prince Charlie (Charles Stuart), the grandson of ousted King James II, on the throne. Plot Alastair Maclean, a Scotsman who has been living in France with the exiled Stuarts, comes to England to join the Scottish army as it advances towards London. But on the way he discovers that agents (Sir John Norreys and Nicholas Kyd) supposedly helping the Jacobite cause by encouraging various nobles to commit to the cause, are actually in English pay, and are passing on to the English government the letters from these nobles to Charles Stuart promising him men and money. These agents are acting purely as mercenaries, hoping to gain part of the estates that the nobles will forfeit to the Crown when their treasons is revealed. Maclean falls in love with Claudia, the Jacobite wife of Norreys, and is torn between taking time out from his own mission to use his own knowledge of Norreys' treason to the Jacobite cause to kill Norreys and gain the love of Claudia for himself, and speeding off on his own mission to join Prince Charles himself. The novel also features a young Samuel Johnson as Claudia's tutor, and the mysterious Midwinter, a fiddler and a sort of gypsy king who leads the Spoonbills, a 'secret army' of innkeepers and peasants of 'Old England' who are above politics, but assist Maclean in return for aid Maclean gave them early on in the novel. Maclean also forms an unlikely friendship with Engish officer James Oglethorpe. In the end, Maclean decides not to kill Norreys, but shames him into giving up his mercenary treason and returning to his wife to live a respectable life worthy of her love. Norreys' employer, Kyd, is also permitted to live, but is exiled to France. Maclean is too late getting to Derby to join the Young Pretender, but he remains loyal to the cause, and joins the retreating Stuart for the Culloden campaign, and eventually returns to France with the defeated remnants of the Stuart army. Johnson goes on to write his Dictionary, and uses the publisher's advance to repay a loan to Maclean. The two remain friends for life. Structure The book is written with a framing narrative of the 20th- century discovery of a manuscript that tells Maclean's story, and that explains a period of Johnson's life that is missing from his biography by James Boswell. The story itself is the supposed manuscript, fleshed out by the discoverer for publication.

One of the few buildings from central K√∂nigsberg to survive World War II, it is now a cultural centre in Kaliningrad, Russia. The first stock exchange in K√∂nigsberg was documented in 1619. Four years later it was located in a new building of Kneiphof on the northern shore of the Alter Pregel; until 1798 it was accessible from the bridge Gr√ºne Br√ºcke. In 1699 Altstadt built its own stock exchange along the Hundegatt branch of the Pregel River. Kneiphof's building was rebuilt in 1798 as its second exchange, but it burned down in 1800. Kneiphof's third exchange was then constructed partially within the river in 1801. It was closed in 1875 because it was too small for the growing city. Kneiphof's fourth and final stock exchange opened in 1875 in Vordere Vorstadt, along the southern shore of the Pregel opposite the island of Kneiphof. The two-storied building was constructed by the Bremen architect Heinrich M√ºller from 1870‚Äì75. Emil Hundrieser designed its decoration, which included allegorical figures of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America along the roof and two lions at its steps. K√∂nigsberg's merchants considered the building to have been built in the Northern Italian Neo-Renaissance style. Aside from its business activities, the building also hosted concerts and political meetings. Because the Kunsthalle was used by the German Army's postal service during World War I, exhibitions were held instead at the stock exchange. The stock exchange was heavily damaged by the 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg and 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg and became part of Soviet Kaliningrad after World War II. While most ruined buildings in the city were demolished, the Soviet authorities decided to rebuild the former stock exchange in 1967 into a marine cultural centre because they considered it to contain elements of Russian neo-classical architecture.

Early years  Mel Smilow was born in the Bronx, New York, the son of Irving Smilowitz and Claire Benes. He attended New York City public schools and enrolled at the Pratt Institute in 1939 with the intent of becoming a commercial artist. As a result of his father's death that year, he was forced to withdraw and go to work as the family's only breadwinner: at 17, he took over his father's position selling wholesale furniture to retail stores in New York and Pennsylvania. Growing up during the years of the Great Depression and experiencing the discrimination against Jews that pervaded American culture at the time had a lasting influence on Smilow's art and world view. As a result, he was especially sensitive to the plight of the working class and the poor, and throughout his life championed causes that sought to end social inequality and discrimination in any form. He was proud that his employees were union members, and he consistently incorporated the qualities of great design with affordability and durability in his furniture.  Military service  In 1944, Smilow enlisted in the army and after basic training was shipped to Europe, seeing action as an infantryman in the waning days of the war. Arriving in the French port of Le Havre, he travelled by train for two days in a box car until arriving in the Belgian town of Malmedy, where he witnessed the aftermath of the infamous Malmedy massacre and the carnage of the Battle of the Bulge, in the mountainous Ardennes region. Fighting in General Patton's Third Army during the grueling winter of 1944‚Äì1945, he was later awarded several medals including the Purple Heart for valor.  Career  After an honorable discharge from the army, Smilow returned to his job selling furniture. In 1949, in partnership with a colleague, Morton Thielle, he founded Smilow- Thielle, a manufacturer and retailer of modern furnishings. As they started their business, the partners saw a unique opportunity: by purchasing quality furniture directly from a variety of American manufacturers and selling it at Smilow-Thielle retail outlets, they recognized they could eliminate the cost of middlemen and pass the savings on to their customers. Frustrated by the lack of available, good-quality modern design, Smilow began designing furniture for the company; with his acute interest in and eye for modern design, he soon became its sole designer. The business evolved, selling only exclusive modern designs focusing on clean lines, exquisite attention to detail, and carefully calculated proportions, and it brought an American perspective to the Scandinavian designs that were becoming so popular in the mid-twentieth century. Using American hardwoods, particularly walnut, oak, and birch, the Smilow-Thielle product line included chairs, sofas, tables, its trademark ‚Äúfloating‚Äù cabinets, bookshelves, lamps, and eventually, textiles used for upholstery and draperies. Large pieces, such as sofas, chairs and bookshelves, had finished backs, allowing them to be freestanding pieces in the open floor plans popular in mid-century America. Zippered fabric covers on loose cushions could be removed for dry cleaning or repair, a significant savings when compared with reupholstering or outright replacement. With the goal of producing furnishings that were functional, durable. By eliminating the middleman, Smilow's pieces were designed to become family heirlooms, yet sufficiently affordable for average Americans. As the Smilow-Thielle furnishings became increasingly popular, the number of their retail outlets increased: at its height, there were five Smilow-Thielle stores around the metropolitan New York area and one in Washington, DC. For more than 30 years, the firm's flagship store was located on Lexington Avenue between 64th and 65th Streets in Manhattan. Smilow-Thielle was also a regular advertiser in the Washington, DC newspapers and the front section of the Sunday New York Times for over a decade. Examples of Smilow's furniture were featured in publications such as The New York Times and discussed in The New Yorker magazine, and in books that chronicled modern designs of the times, including six examples in William Hennessey's Modern Furnishings for the Home. The Pratt Institute included an ottoman designed by Smilow in its 1955 exhibit of well- designed furniture available for under $25.00. In 1967, Smilow's Wooden Rocker, designed in 1960, was chosen as seating in the United States Pavilion, designed by Buckminster Fuller at Expo 67 in Montreal. In 1988, Edward Fields Carpet Makers and the American Society of Interior Designers (ASID) awarded him first prize in their annual rug design competition for ‚ÄúHeartland,‚Äù with its textured and subtle geometric design. Smilow's Wooden Rocker, designed in 1960, and exhibited at Expo 67 in Montreal. Rush ottoman from the 1955 Pratt Institute exhibition. In 1969, Smilow and Thielle dissolved their partnership. Smilow retained sole ownership of both the company, operating as Smilow, Corp. and later as Contemporary Classics, as well as his flagship store at Lexington Avenue and 64th Street. By 1981, he retired and closed the business, but continued to offer custom furniture, cushions, and covers to his loyal customers while he pursued his passion for sculpting, painting, and printmaking. In May 2013 a collection of Smilow Furniture was re-introduced at the ICFF (International Contemporary Furniture Fair) in New York City and is once again available.  Personal life  In 1953, Smilow married Edith Kern, whom he had met at a furniture trade show where they were both exhibiting. Edith's family had owned the Heinrich Kern furniture factory in Heilbronn, Germany. After immigrating to the United States and settling in New York City, her family opened Kern Interiors, a modern furnishings and interior decorating firm. The Smilows had two daughters, Pamela, born in 1956, and Judy, born in 1958, both of whom have become artists and designers in their own right.  Usonia  Smilow and his family moved to Pleasantville, New York, in 1963 to live in Frank Lloyd Wright's planned community, Usonia Homes. The Smilows purchased a home that had been built for Roger Kahn, the author of The Boys of Summer and designed by Aaron Resnick, one of Wright's students. Smilow loved the designs of the homes, which integrated the forms and proportions of the outside world with the design and functionality of their interiors. The simple shapes, clean lines, subtle details, and unobtrusive beauty appealed to his aesthetic. During the 1970s, he developed a growing interest in Japanese principles of art, specifically the concept of Shibui, the Japanese design philosophy. Eventually, he would create a Shibui collection of furnishings, which featured shoji screens, and finely detailed joinery on a simple floating platform bed, and accompanying low cabinets. The Smilow home in Usonia (above), and interior view including Mel Smilow's furniture and paintings (below). The ethos of Usonia served to underscore Smilow's belief, developed early on in his career, that beautiful furnishings should not be reserved for only the very affluent, but should be high-quality, durable pieces that meld form and function and provide regular working people with enduring modern classics.  Death and legacy  On December 26, 2002, at the age of 81, Mel Smilow died after suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

The offensive was stopped after the Syrian Army launched a counter-offensive, leaving the rebels in control of only half a dozen towns and villages in the north of the province. Background With the Hama province largely controlled by Army Forces, the FSA launched an offensive on 16 December, to capture the province and Hama city itself and by the same time, cutting the principal supply route of the Army in Aleppo. The offensive The rebel military council of Hama announced the start of the offensive on 16 December, giving Syrian government troops in the province an ultimatum to surrender to the Free Syrian Army within 48 hours. Within two days, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Qassem Saadeddine, a member of the Free Syrian Army military command, claimed that Syrian government troops had already been cleared from the towns of Halfaya, Kafr Nabudah, Hayalin, Hasraya, al-Lataminah, Taybat al-Imam and Kafr Zita, leaving the rebels in control of the rural western part of Hama Province, and all areas north of Hama city. Rebels had advanced south from Maarrat al-Nu'man and Jisr ash-Shugour, encountering little resistance. It seemed that rebels had overrun Syrian Army lines north of Hama city within 48 hours. Government positions in Khan Shaykhun and Mhardeh were reportedly under attack by rebel forces. The rebels also made claims of fighting inside Hama city itself, with international analysts wondering if the Syrian Army was redeployed towards Homs and Latakia. However, this was not confirmed. On 19 December, according to the Local Coordination Committees (LCC), Syrian Government security forces reportedly set up checkpoints outside Hayalin, leading to doubts as to whether or not rebels had full control over the town, unlike the other places they captured in the operation.Miller, James. \\"Syria Live Coverage: The Insurgents Close on Hama\\". Enduringamerica.com. 2012-12-19. On 20 December, rebels attacked and captured parts of the town of Morek in Hama's countryside, and were surrounding the Alawite towns of Ma'an and al-Tleisa. On 23 December, the LCC and SOHR reported that up to 300 civilians were killed by bombing from warplanes in the city of Halfaya, while queuing for bread at a bakery. The Syrian Government did agree that many women and children were killed, however they blamed rebel fighters who they say attacked the town. On 26 December, the Syrian Army retook control of the three Alawite villages, including Ma'an, repelling the rebels who had entered them days earlier. On 29 December, six people were killed by the Syrian air force bombardment on the town of Kafr Nabudah, two of them were children and two women. Also, one civilian was killed by the bombardment on the town of Taybat al-Imam. A week later, Assad forces from Qamhana, attacked this same town. On 30 December, the Syrian Army general command announced that they took back control of the strategic town of Morek. On 31 December, Syrian Army shelling was reported on Halfaya. Aftermath On 21 January 2013, SOHR said that a car bomb near the headquarters of a pro-government militia killed 50 people in the eastern suburbs of Hama.Moscow Is Sending Planes to Lebanon for 100 Russians Leaving Syria On 22 January, the military launched an offensive, with the aim of recapturing territory lost during the rebel advance into northern Hama. 1,500 soldiers and 100 tanks were being used in the operation, and the focus was on the town of Kernaz in Mhardeh District, where up to 1,000 rebel fighters were based. By early February, the rebels were reportedly in fear of losing Kernaz and with it Kafr Naboudeh. This would leave the military in control of the whole north of Hama, reversing all previous rebel gains. On 6 February, 54 government employees of a defense-related factory were killed in al-Buraq south of Hama city, when a mini-bus blew up at a bus stop.Group Says 54 Died in Syria Military Factory Blast On 7 February, the military recaptured Kernaz, after 16 days of fighting. Two days before, the Army had also regained control of the nearby town of Mughir, securing a corridor to Alawite villages in the west of the province.

The brain's left side is the dominant side utilized for producing and understanding sign language, just as it is for speech. In 1861, Paul Broca studied patients with the ability to understand spoken languages but the inability to produce them. The damaged area was named Broca's area, and located in the left hemisphere‚Äôs inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 44, 45). Soon after, in 1874, Carl Wernicke studied patients with the reverse deficits: patients could produce spoken language, but could not comprehend it. The damaged area was named Wernicke's area, and is located in the left hemisphere‚Äôs posterior superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 22). Signers with damage in Broca's area have problems producing signs. Those with damage in the Wernicke's area (left hemisphere) in the temporal lobe of the brain have problems comprehending signed languages. Early on, it was noted that Broca‚Äôs area was near the part of the motor cortex controlling the face and mouth. Likewise, Wernicke's area was near the auditory cortex. These motor and auditory areas are important in spoken language processing and production, but the connection to signed languages had yet to be uncovered. For this reason, the left hemisphere was described as the verbal hemisphere, with the right hemisphere deemed to be responsible for spatial tasks. This criteria and classification was used to denounce signed languages as not equal to spoken language until it was widely agreed upon that due to the similarities in cortical connectivity they are linguistically and cognitively equivalent. In the 1980s research on deaf patients with left hemisphere stroke were examined to explore the brains connection with signed languages. The left perisylvian region was discovered to be functionally critical for language, spoken and signed.Campbell, Ruth, et al. ‚ÄúSign Language and the Brain: A Review.‚Äù Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education, vol. 13, no. 1, 2008, pp. 3‚Äì20., https://www.jstor.org/stable/42658909. Its location near several key auditory processing regions led to the belief that language processing required auditory input and was used to discredit signed languages as \\"real languages.\\" This research opened the doorway for linguistic analysis and further research on signed languages. Signed languages, like spoken languages, are highly structured linguistic systems; they have their own sets of phonological, morphological and syntactic characteristics. Despite some differences between spoken and signed languages, the associated brain areas share a lot in common.Poizner H, Klima ES, Bellugi U., What the hands reveal about the brain, 1987, Cambridge, MA The MIT Press  Hemispheric similarities and differences between spoken and signed languages  Both the left and right hemisphere have brain structures associated with spoken and signed languages. Spoken and signed languages both depend on the same cortical substrate. This shows that the left hemisphere is responsible for processing all facets of language, not just speech. The neural organization underlying sign language abilities, however, has more in common with that of spoken language than it does with the neural organization underlying visuospatial processing, which is processed dominantly in the right hemisphere. Those patients with left hemisphere damage (LHD), in areas ranging from the frontal lobe to the occipital lobe, exhibited both Broca‚Äôs and Wernicke‚Äôs aphasia symptoms. Patients performed poorly on many language-based tasks such as comprehending signs and sentences and fluently signing. Similar to hearing patients‚Äô ‚Äúslips of the tongue‚Äù after LHD, deaf LHD patients experienced paraphasias, or ‚Äúslips of the hand.‚Äù These slips of the hand usually involve an incorrect hand shape in the correct location and with the correct movement, similar to a hearing patient substituting ‚Äúbline‚Äù or ‚Äúgine‚Äù for ‚Äúfine.‚Äù Some right hemisphere damage does lead to disruptions in sign languages, however. The topographical use of signing space is often imprecise in patients with RHD; the relation between the location of hands in signing space and the location of objects in physical space is often impaired. Rather than being misunderstood, however, subjects and objects in a sentence may simply be placed incorrectly relative to the other subjects and objects in a sentence, like saying ‚Äúthe pencil is in the book‚Äù rather than, ‚Äúthe pencil is on top of the book.‚Äù Around the time of the experiment, theories began to float around the community that there may be an unexplained involvement of the right hemisphere in signed languages not seen in spoken languages. These theories were also adopted by signed language linguists and further imaging studies and neuropsychological testing confirmed the presence of activity in the right hemisphere. Prior right hemisphere studies on spoken languages has led to prevailing theories in its role in discourse cohesion and prosody. The right hemisphere has been proposed to assist in detection, processing and discrimination of visual movement. The right hemisphere has also been shown to play a role in the perception of body movements and positions. All of these right hemisphere features are more prominent for signed languages than spoken languages, hence the argument that signed languages engage the right hemisphere more than spoken languages. As brain imaging technology such as EEG became more developed and commonplace, it was eventually applied to sign language comprehension. Using EEG to record event-related potentials can correlate specific brain activity to language processing in real time. Previous application of ERP on hearing patients showed neural activity in the left hemisphere related to syntactic errors. When electrodes are hooked up to deaf native signers, similar syntactic anomalies associated with an event-related potential were recorded across both left and right hemisphere. This shows that syntactic processing for American Sign Language (ASL) is not lateralized to the left hemisphere. When communicating in their respective languages, similar brain regions are activated for both deaf and hearing subjects with a few exceptions. During the processing of auditory stimuli for spoken languages there is detectable activity within Broca's Area, Wernicke's Area, the angular gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and superior temporal sulcus.Neville, Helen (February 3, 1998). \\"Cerebral organization for language in deaf and hearing subjects: Biological constraints and effects of experience\\". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. Retrieved May 8, 2017. Right hemisphere activity was detectable in less than 50% of trials for hearing subjects reciting English sentences. When deaf subjects were tasked with reading English, none of the left hemisphere structures seen with hearing subjects were visible. Deaf subjects also displayed obvious middle and posterior temporal-parietal activation within the right hemisphere. When hearing subjects were presented various signs designed to evoke emotion within native signers, there was no clear changes in brain activity in traditional language processing centers. Brain activity of deaf native signers when processing signs was similar to activity of hearing subjects processing English. However, processing of ASL extensively recruited right hemisphere structures including significant activation of the entire superior temporal lobe, the angular region, and inferior prefrontal cortex. Since native hearing signers also exhibited this right hemisphere activation when processing ASL, it has been proposed that this right hemisphere activation is due to the temporal visuospatial decoding necessary to process signed languages. In a similar study published in 2017, deaf individuals who use French Sign Language were studied during processing French Sign Language and written French. During the processes of each of the languages, there was bilateral activation in the occipital lobes, in the temporal lobes near the superior temporal sulcus, and in the frontal gyri. The processing of sign language showed stronger activation in both occipital lobes, both posterior temporal lobes, and in the thalamus bilaterally. It also showed strong activation particularly in structures in the right hemisphere: the superior temporal sulcus, the fusiform gyrus, and the inferior frontal gyrus. Opposed to processing sign language, when the individuals processed written French there was strong activation bilaterally and in the left hemisphere. The areas that showed bilateral activation were the inferior parietal lobes, fusiform gyri, and Brodmann Area 44, among others. The areas lateralized to the left hemisphere were the calcarine and fusiform gyrus, specifically at the location for visual word form.  Neurological differences between deaf and hearing groups  It is thought that there are significant neuroanatomical differences among congenitally deaf humans versus those who become deaf later in life. Therefore, it is widely thought that research into the differences in connections and projections of neurons in deaf humans must block into two groups‚Äîcongenitally deaf and deaf after birth. Structural brain imaging has commonly shown white matter volume of the auditory cortices differs between deaf and hearing subjects, regardless of the first language learned. Deaf humans are thought to have a larger ratio of gray matter to white matter in certain auditory cortices, such as left and right Heschl's gyrus and Superior Temporal gyrus.Emmorey, Karen, et al. ‚ÄúA Morphometric Analysis of Auditory Brain Regions in Congenitally Deaf Adults.‚Äù Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 100, no. 17, 2003, pp. 10049‚Äì10054., https://www.jstor.org/stable/3147660. This heightened ratio is thought to exist due to less overall white matter in Heschl's gyrus and the Superior Temoral gyrus among deaf humans. Overall, the auditory cortices of deaf humans have an increased gray-white matter ratio as a result of the lack of auditory stimuli which is commonly thought to lead to less myelination and fewer projections to and from the auditory cortices. It has been thought that congenitally deaf people could provide insight into brain plasticity; the decreased auditory connectivity and brain volume for auditory processing provides an opportunity for enhancement in the visual cortices which are of greater importance to deaf humans.Allen JS, Emmorey K, Bruss J, Damasio H. Neuroanatomical differences in visual, motor, and language cortices between congenitally deaf signers, hearing signers, and hearing non-signers. Frontiers in Neuroanatomy. 2013;7:26. The Calcarine sulcus acts as the hub for the Primary Visual Cortex in humans. Congenitally deaf humans have measurably higher volume of Calcarine cortex than hearing humans. The increased volume and size of visual cortices of deaf individuals can lead to heightened visual processing. Deaf humans have demonstrated, via event-related potential, an increased sensitivity and reactivity to new visual stimuli‚Äîevidence of brain plasticity leading to behavioral enhancement.Bottari D, Caclin A, Giard M-H, Pavani F. Changes in Early Cortical Visual Processing Predict Enhanced Reactivity in Deaf Individuals. Sirigu A, ed. PLoS ONE. 2011;6(9):e25607. .  Differences between signers and non-signers  In one experiment published in 1992, visual mental imagery was studied in ASL signers‚Äîdeaf and hearing‚Äîand hearing non-signers. These hearing signers were born to deaf parents, and ASL was their first language. Another aspect looked at in this study was the difference between native signers and those who learned sign language at a later age. In this experiment, native signers are considered deaf individuals who were born to deaf parents and therefore started absorbing the language in infancy. The other deaf signers' primary language is sign language, but they did not learn it until between the ages of two to sixteen. In the experiment of generating simple and complex images, deaf individuals were the quickest, followed by hearing signers and then hearing non-signers. This was expected; however, looking at a chart of the results, the hearing signers performed almost identically, in regards to the simple and complex images, to the deaf signers but just more slowly. The hearing non-signers were right on track in following behind on the simple image, but their reaction time was vastly longer. At least in this area, experience with a visual-spatial language provides quicker reaction times. The results are consistent with abilities recruited for processing sign language being enhanced in the brain, compared to those abilities in non-signers. A couple of things the subjects were tested on were mental rotation and mirror reversals. Signers had an advantage in mirror reversals, but there was no difference between signers and non-signers performing mental rotation. Because of these results, it may not be true to say that signers have a better ability to transform images, but the ability may be in rotating images. Because of this experiment, the cause of enhanced abilities was questioned to be because of auditory deprivation or because of using a visual-spatial language. Hearing signers who learned sign language as a first language may be the key to answering this question.

It is often referred to by its Mount Wilson Observatory catalog number as MWC 314. It is a hot luminous star with strong emission lines in its spectrum. Spectrum V1429 Aql has a peculiar spectrum dominated by emission lines of hydrogen and many ionised metals, with Fe being particularly strong and numerous. There are also comparatively weak forbidden lines, primarily [Fe], but also [N]. Some absorption lines are present, but are either very weak or hidden by the emission. Many lines have variable profiles, particularly the hydrogen and helium series which vary during the orbit from emission to P Cygni profiles. The absorption lines are considered to be formed in the photosphere of the primary star, although some Fe absorption appears to be from gas between the stars. No lines of the secondary can be detected. The emission lines are formed in circumstellar material between and around the two stars Overall, the spectral type is given as B3 Ibe. In infrared spectra, the Pfund series of lines are strongly in emission, a very unusual feature characteristic of supergiant Be stars and LBVs. V1429 Aql is given a B2:e spectral type from analysis in the infrared. System V1429 Aquilae is a single-lined spectroscopic binary. The existence of a companion is inferred from the highly periodic variations in the radial velocity of its spectral lines and by equally periodic variations in brightness and spectral line profiles. It is unclear whether there are partial eclipses of the larger star or just of gas surrounding the stars. The orbital period is well-defined at 60.7 days and it is moderately eccentric (0.244). The primary star fills its roche lobe for at least part of the orbit. The other characteristics of the orbit are disputed. The orbital velocity of the secondary is unknown, and the possible inclinations do not sufficiently restrict the possible models of the system. Assumptions based on broadly similar data produce wildly different results for the masses of the stars, from to for the primary. A third star is visible in infrared images just over one arc second away. It is statistically likely to be in a wide orbit around the spectroscopic pair, about 5,700 AU away. The system contains material being transferred from the primary to the secondary star as well as material surrounding both stars. A dense clump of gas near the centre of mass of the system, and co-rotating with the stars, produces the bulk of the emission lines. A more diffuse region of gas surrounds both stars and produces some absorption components in the spectrum. The entire system is surrounded by a shell of material about 0.8 parsecs across, assuming that MWC 314 is 3,000 parsecs away. This appears in infrared images as a circular ring 25 arc- seconds from the central star. There is a much larger bipolar nebula detected by its HŒ± radiation. It is 13 parsecs from end to end. Variability V1429 Aquilae shows brightness variations of about 0.3 magnitudes and a detectable period of 4.16 days. No longterm variations in brightness have been detected over several decades of observations. The profiles of many spectral lines also vary with the same period, produced partly by radial velocity variations. The absorption and emission lines show different radial velocity amplitudes, but with the same period. Most of these variations can be accounted for by the orbit of the two stars and material being transferred from the primary to the secondary, with the gas being involved in partial eclipses and possible also a partial eclipse of the primary star. The two stars are also distorted into ellipsoidal shapes by their gravity and vary in brightness as they rotate. In addition to the orbital variations, two pulsation modes have been observed with amplitudes of a few thousandths of a magnitude and periods of 0.77 and 1.42 days. Physical properties V1429 Aquilae is sufficiently remote that its distance must be determined by indirect methods: estimates range between 2.4 and 4.3 kiloparsecs (9,800-14,000 light years), with 3 kpc usually being adopted. The primary is a hot B-type star. Its total luminosity has been estimated to be as much as 1,200,000 times that of the Sun (), with a radius 60 times larger than that of the Sun (), and 80 times more massive than the Sun (). More recent calculations give a luminosity of , radius of , and mass of . Alternative assumptions about the orbit lead to lower values of , , and . The physical parameters of the star, and its spectrum, are comparable to a luminous blue variable (LBV). Although it has not shown the defining outbursts and spectral variations, the surrounding nebulae indicate episodes of heavy mass loss in the past. Alternatively, it may be a supergiant Be star. The secondary cannot be observed. Making some assumptions, primarily the existence of a partial eclipse of the primary star, allows its mass and some physical properties to be estimated, giving a mass of and temperature of 6,227 K, but these are speculative.

The buttered toast phenomenon is an observation that buttered toast tends to land butter-side down after it falls. It is used as an idiom representing pessimistic outlooks. Various people have attempted to determine whether there is an actual tendency for bread to fall in this fashion, with varying results. Origins The phenomenon is said to be an old proverb from \\"the north country\\". Written accounts can be traced to the mid-19th century. The phenomenon is often attributed to a parodic poem of James Payn from 1884: In the past, this has often been considered just a pessimistic belief. A 1991 study by the BBC's television series Q.E.D. found that when toast is tossed into the air, it lands butter-side down just one-half of the time (as would be predicted by chance). However, several scientific studies have found that when toast is dropped from a table (as opposed to being thrown in the air), it more often falls butter-side down. A study on this subject by Robert Matthews won the Ig Nobel Prize for physics in 1996.  Explanation  When toast falls out of one's hand, it does so at an angle, by nature of it having slipped from its previous position, then the toast rotates. Given that tables are usually between two and six feet (0.7 to 1.83 meters), there is enough time for the toast to rotate about one-half of a turn, and thus lands upside down relative to its original position. Since the original position is usually butter-side up, the toast lands butter-side down. However, if the table is over 10 feet (3 meters) tall, the toast will rotate a full 360 degrees, and land butter-side up. Also, if the toast travels horizontally at over 3.6 miles per hour (1.6 m/s), the toast will not rotate enough to land butter-side down. In fact, the phenomenon is caused by fundamental physical constants. Other factors The added weight of the butter has no effect on the falling process, since the butter spreads throughout the slice. A piece of toast has inertia as it flips towards the floor, preventing its spin from stopping easily; it is usually only stopped by hitting the floor. This moment of inertia is determined by the speed at which the toast is flipping, combined with the size and mass of the toast. Because most toast is relatively uniform, they often land in a similar manner.

It is a grassroots movement among the Aboriginal peoples in Canada comprising the First Nations, M√©tis and Inuit peoples and their non-Aboriginal supporters in Canada, and to a lesser extent, internationally. It has consisted of a number of political actions worldwide, inspired in part by the liquid diet hunger strike of Attawapiskat Chief Theresa Spence and further coordinated via social media. A reaction to alleged legislative abuses of Indigenous treaty rights by then Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Conservative federal government, the movement takes particular issue with the omnibus bill Bill C-45.Bill C-45 is part of the 41st Canadian Parliament Omnibus bills and is a \\"second Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 29, 2012 and other measures.\\" Bill C-45 was assented to on December 14, 2012. The popular movement has included round dances in public places and blockades of rail lines. Background After the May 2, 2011 Canadian Federal election, the Conservative federal government, led by Stephen Harper, proposed a number of omnibus bills introducing sweeping legislative changes. While omnibus bills had been presented to parliament by previous governments, the removal of protections for forests and waterways proposed in Bill C-45 led to concern among Indigenous communities and environmentalists. Of particular concern is the removal of the term \\"absolute surrender\\" in Section 208. A number of these measures drew fire from environmental and First Nations groups. In particular, Bill C-45 overhauled the Navigable Waters Protection Act (NWPA) of 1882, renaming it the Navigation Protection Act (NPA). The NWPA had mandated an extensive approval and consultation process before construction of any kind could take place in or around any water which could in principle be navigated by any kind of floating craft. Under the new NPA, the approval process would only be required for development around one of a vastly circumscribed list of waterways set by the Minister of Transportation. Many of the newly deregulated waterways passed through traditional First Nations land. While the NWPA had originally been intended to facilitate actual navigation, the ubiquity of waterways in the Canadian wilderness has given it the effect of strong environmental legislation by presenting a significant barrier to industrial development, especially to projects such as pipelines which crossed many rivers. The government had by this time been engaged for some years in a campaign for approval of the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines project, a proposal to build a pipeline for bitumen condensate connecting the Athabasca tar sands with the Pacific Ocean, facilitating unprocessed bitumen exports to China. Many bills affecting First Nations people have failed to be passed. Numerous attempts to introduce bills have failed due to their low priority for past federal governments, eventually dying on the order paper without being debated or passed. In 1996 Bill C-79, the Indian Act Optional Modification Act died on the order paper. In 2002, Bill C-7, the First Nations Governance Act, attempted to reform reserve administration. It died in 2003. In 2008, there was Bill C-47, the Family Homes on Reserves and Matrimonial Interests or Rights Act, to redress inequity in the treatment of women. That one died on the order paper three times and is returned before Parliament, now called Bill S-2. The cancellation of the Kelowna Accords by the current federal government was seen as a betrayal by natives. Further background to this is the feeling that the federal government has repeatedly acted in bad faith with Aboriginal people's interests, and have violated treaties when it suited them. The feeling that the traditional tactics of negotiating with the federal government have become meaningless has caused support for new tactics. Vision and goals The founders of Idle No More outlined the vision and goals of the movement in a January 10, 2013 press release as follows: The press release also notes that \\"As a grassroots movement, clearly no political organization speaks for Idle No More\\". Furthermore, this is not just an Aboriginal Canadian movement. These pipeline projects will be stretching beyond borders carving through critical ecosystems and landscapes in the States. Canada's large oil reserves have attracted industry to exploit, and profit, \\"The tar sands industry aims to create an extensive web of pipelines to deliver increasing amounts of this Canadian tar sands sludge to refineries in the United States\\" (Glick, page 2). Reports say that some 900,000 barrels of oil per day will be traveling from Canada tar sands through these pipelines. According to the National Wildlife Federation report, these pipelines will stretch thousands and thousands of miles through Canada and into the States and will leave devastation along its paths. \\"This pipeline system would virtually assure the destruction of swaths of one of the world's most important forest ecosystems, produce lake-sized reservoirs of toxic waste, import a thick, tarlike fuel that will release vast quantities of toxic chemicals into our air when it is refined in the U.S., and emit significantly more global warming pollutants into the atmosphere than fuels made from conventional oil\\" (Glick, page 3). These impacts are already being seen in Canada's peoples and wildlife. \\"Communities that live near the tar sands are already experiencing health problems linked to the pollution, and dozens of wildlife species are at risk, including millions of migrating cranes, swans, and songbirds\\" (Glick, page 3). With the magnitude and power of this project, these negative impacts will not end soon, and will not end in Canada. These pipelines will stretch across borders and come into our own backyards here in the states.Glick, Daniel. Staying Hooked on a Dirty Fuel: Why Canadian Tar Sands Pipelines Are a Bad Bet for the United States. Rep. Reston: National Wildlife Federation, 2010. Www.nwf.org/tarsands. National Wildlife Federation. Web. 10 June 2013. Idle No More's vision has been linked by some commentators in the press with longstanding leftist political theories of indigenism. During the protests of late 2012 and early 2013, the theoretical framework of Idle No More has been frequently articulated in the Canadian press by Pamela Palmater. Palmater has denounced what she perceives as the federal government's \\"assimilationist agenda\\". It has been suggested by others that the definition of \\"nation\\" is itself problematic. Sylvia McAdam, a co-founder of the movement, has said that she does not condone the rail or road blockade tactics that some demonstrators have used, and has spoken in support of peaceful protest \\"within the legal boundaries\\". History Members of the Nipissing First Nation from southern Ontario and local non-Aboriginal supporters in Ottawa The movement was initiated by activists Nina Wilson, Sheelah Mclean, Sylvia McAdam, and Jessica Gordon in November 2012, during a teach-in at Station 20 West in Saskatoon called \\"Idle No More\\", held in response to the Harper government's introduction of Bill C-45. Sylvia McAdam, an author and educator from the Nehiyaw (Cree) Nation , stated that \\"one of our strongest motivations is our children. We want them to witness that we weren‚Äôt silent about Bill C-45\\". C-45 is a large omnibus bill implementing numerous measures, many of which activists claim weaken environmental protection laws. In particular, laws protecting all of the country's navigable waterways were limited in scope to protect only a few waterways of practical importance for navigation. Many of the affected waterways pass through land reserved to First Nations. Law blog writer/observer Lorraine Land, blog writer at the Law partnership, Olthuis Kleer, Townshend and Idle No More itself, have identified the following current bills as affecting natives or native sovereignty: *Bill C-38 (Budget Omnibus Bill #1) *Bill C-45 (Budget Omnibus Bill #2) *Bill C-27 First Nations Financial Transparency Act *Bill S-2 Family Homes on Reserve and Matrimonial Interests or Right Act *Bill S-6 First Nations Elections Act *Bill S-8 Safe Drinking Water for First Nations *Bill C-428 Indian Act Amendment and Replacement Act *Bill S-207 An Act to amend the Interpretation Act *Bill S-212 First Nations Self-Government Recognition Bill * \\"First Nations\\" Private Ownership Act This led to a series of teach-ins, rallies and protests that were planned by the founders in a National Day Of Action on Dec 10 which coincided with Amnesty International's Human Rights Day. These coincided with similar protests already underway in British Columbia over the Northern Gateway and Pacific Trails pipelines as well as a march and protest organized by students at the Native Education College. The protests were timed to coincide with the announcement that Chief Theresa Spence of Attawapiskat was launching a liquid diet to demand a meeting with Prime Minister Harper and the Governor General of Canada to discuss Aboriginal rights. The Assembly of First Nations then issued an open letter December 16 to Governor General David Johnston, calling for a meeting to discuss Spence's demands. Also on December 17 the Confederacy of Treaty No. 6 First Nations issued a press release saying that they did not recognize the legality of any laws passed by the federal parliament, \\"including but not limited to Bill C-45, which do not fulfill their constitutionally recognized and affirmed treaty and Aboriginal rights; as well as the Crown's legal obligations to meaningfully consult and accommodate First Nations.\\" As of January 4, 2013, the main goals have been narrowed down to (1) the establishment of a nation- to-nation relationship between First Nations and the Government of Canada, rather than a relationship as defined in the Indian Act to address issues and (2) social and environmental sustainability. Resource exploitation The Idle No More movement generally opposes certain types of resource exploitation, particularly on First Nations territory. The movement takes this stance against resource exploitation, as attributed to First Nations sovereignty and environmental sustainability. The position is supported by many groups including non-governmental and grassroots organizations. In a human rights report on Canada, Amnesty International suggested that the government should have \\"respect for indigenous rights when issuing licences for mining, logging and petroleum and other resource extraction.\\" The Idle No More movement outlines ways by which it opposes resource exploitation, although these views are contested within the First Nations population itself. It communicates the need for treaty modernization as well as increased land claims. It also advocates against resource exploitation on First Nations land without any benefit to the First Nations. Furthermore, the movement argues that First Nations communities do not get an equitable share of the profits from natural resource exploitation and encourages the government to address this issue. One demonstration reflecting opposition to resource exploitation was held at Barriere Lake in Quebec by the Algonquin people. It closed Highway 117 and was reported \\"to draw attention to forestry operations that they oppose on their lands.\\" In British Columbia (B.C.), the specific focus within resource exploitation is opposition to oil pipeline construction. Frank Brown, organizer of a B.C. Idle No More protest and a member of the Heiltsuk First Nation, said the B.C. group opposed proposed pipelines such as the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline. Moreover, several First Nations communities, the BC M√©tis Federation, the Union of British Columbian Municipalities, and several local governments have passed resolutions banning pipelines in B.C. and opposing Enbridge specifically. Protests in Canada Two members of the Siksika Nation from southern Alberta and a local non-Aboriginal supporter in Ottawa The use of flash mobs performing round dances in shopping malls became a recurring theme of the protest during the pre- and post-Christmas shopping season in 2012. On December 17 a flash mob performed a round dance at the Cornwall Centre shopping mall in Regina. The following day a similar flash mob round dance occurred at West Edmonton Mall. This tactic was also used at the Rideau Centre in Ottawa and St. Vital Centre in Winnipeg. It spread internationally with a similar protest at the Mall of America in Minnesota. Members of the Sandy Bay First Nation in Manitoba blocked the Trans-Canada Highway on December 15, 2012. Members of the Driftpile First Nation also blocked a road on December 18. The group executed their second round dance flash mob in Saskatchewan on December 20, this time at Midtown Plaza in Saskatoon. Two thousand people filled the upper and lower levels of the mall for the 10-minute dance of the flash mob. Also on this day, organizers started gathering people around the Vimy war memorial on the Saskatoon riverbank. On December 27 an online source reported that there had been 100 protests in Canada to date On December 30, as part of a day of nationwide actions, a group believed to be involved with Idle No More blocked the Canadian National main railway line between the country's two largest cities of Toronto and Montreal at a point near Belleville, Ontario for approximately three hours. On January 2, Waterfront Station in Vancouver was packed for a demonstration drawing hundreds of participants. Protestors danced and chanted. Protestors filled Toronto's Eaton Centre, while a simultaneous protest occurred in the West Edmonton Mall, 50 Protestors at Clifton Hill in Niagara Falls, and other locations in Canada. On January 5, 2013, protests shut down multiple border crossings throughout Canada, including Blue Water Bridge in Sarnia, Ontario, International Bridge in Cornwall, Ontario, the Peace Arch crossing in Surrey, B.C., The Peace Bridge between Fort Erie and Buffalo in the Niagara region, and NWT's Deh Cho Bridge. The International Bridge in Cornwall had not been closed since a month-long dispute between Akwesasne Nation and CBSA. On January 11, 2013, thousands of people participated in Idle No More demonstrations in all regions of Canada. In Vancouver, British Columbia, a mass march and rally was held at Vancouver City Hall. It was estimated over 1000 people attended the march which started at the Native Education College. Solidarity protests Indigenous protesters at an Idle No More event in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Idle No More SF Bay and other protesters against bringing tar sands to the San Francisco Bay gather outside the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, March 2018. The protests have also spread outside of Canada. On December 27 an online source reported that there had been 30 Idle No More protests in the United States, and solidarity protests in Stockholm, Sweden, London, UK, Berlin, Germany, Auckland, New Zealand, and Cairo, Egypt. On December 30, approximately 100 people from Walpole Island marched to Algonac, Michigan. CBS reported that \\"hundreds\\" attended a flash mob at the Mall of America in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Twin Cities Daily Planet called it a crowd of \\"over a thousand\\" and stated that it followed a similar protest a week earlier where Clyde Bellecourt had been arrested, as well as another flash mob at the Paul Bunyan Mall in Bemidji. On January 5, the International Bridge was closed again due to Mohawk protests from New York. Within the United States, protests have been reported in many states: Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, New York, Arizona, Colorado, Maine, New Mexico, Vermont, South Carolina, Washington State, Washington, D.C., Indiana and Texas. Support Former Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin, who had supported the Kelowna Accords, said that Teresa Spence's efforts made her \\"an inspiration to all Canadians\\". Former Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Joe Clark also met Spence and made a speech afterward saying that Canada and First Nations were on a dangerous path. In solidarity with the movement, Council of Canadians National Chairperson Maude Barlow, author Naomi Klein, and singer Sarah Slean have returned their Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medals. Criticism Criticism of the Idle No More movement has appeared in Canada's mainstream media, which has covered related high-profile protests such as road blockades and Spence's fast thumb The parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs stated to media that \\"With respect to Bill C-45, the changes to property leasing provisions, these changes respond directly to the request of a number of First Nations Chiefs to provide them with more flexibility\\". Conservative Senator Patrick Brazeau, who is Aboriginal and a former chief, has told media that the demonstrations lacked focus in protesting \\"a whole gamut of issues\\". He also said that democratic processes were available for participating in decision-making affecting First Nations. He criticized Teresa Spence's tactics, saying she should have used the \\"proper parliamentary process.\\" Effects The founders of the Idle No More movement have emphasized their intention for the movement to remain at its core a \\"grassroots\\" movement, led by Indigenous women; they have released a statement to say that they have a different vision than that of the \\"leadership\\" of First Nation Chiefs, saying \\"we have been given a clear mandate ‚Ä¶ to work outside of the systems of government.\\" By early January 2013, Shawn Atleo, leader of the Assembly of First Nations, and other Chiefs, were beginning to \\"use the protests' momentum to press Ottawa on treaty rights and improved living standards.\\" The protests have been noted for creating a stream of polarized debate online, bringing out both supporters and detractors. January 11, 2013 meeting Idle No More supporters occupying the grounds of Parliament Hill on January 11 On January 4, 2013, Prime Minister Harper announced a meeting with a delegation of First Nation leaders coordinated by the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), to follow up on the issues discussed during the Crown-First Nations Gathering on January 24, 2012. His statement announcing the meeting made no mention of Idle No More. The meeting was held on January 11, 2013. The preparations were the subject of intense negotiation and debate within the AFN membership, until late in the evening of the eve of the meeting. Some chiefs voted not to participate, choosing to boycott the meeting for various reasons, including demands that more chiefs be included in the AFN delegation, questions over what to include on the meeting's agenda, and the fact that the Governor General would not be present throughout the meeting, and would be limited to a shorter ceremonial meeting after the meeting with Prime Minister Harper. The day of the meeting, members of the Idle No More movement organized protests on Parliament Hill (drawing an estimated 3000 demonstrators), and in cities across Canada. Idle No More spokesperson Pam Palmater, who ran against Atleo for the position of National Chief with the AFN, said in a CBC discussion that the diverse positions expressed among the AFN chiefs \\"doesn't mean good things for the AFN\\". The January 11 meeting was attended by National Chief Shawn Atleo and a delegation of chiefs from several provinces and the Yukon, AFN representatives from its Youth Council, Women's Council and Elders Council (Ontario and Manitoba chiefs boycotted the meeting). While it had previously been announced that Harper would only attend portions of the meeting, he attended the entire meeting. The meeting was also attended by Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Duncan, his Parliamentary Secretary Greg Rickford, Cabinet Ministers Tony Clement and Leona Aglukkaq, and senior officials from the Privy Council Office, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, and several other federal departments. The ceremonial meeting with Governor General Johnston was attended by around 100 chiefs, including Chief Theresa Spence. After the meeting, Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Duncan stated that it would be followed by \\"high-level dialogue\\" between Harper and Atleo, including follow- up meetings and more frequent reporting on Aboriginal matters by the federal government. Matthew Coon Come, a former AFN National Chief who has been confronted by protestors, attended the meeting, stated after the meeting that the \\"prime minister had moved a couple of posts forward\\", furthering discussions on treaty process and specific land claims, and that the prime minister indicated a willingness to consult with First Nations on environmental issues and legislative matters that impact Aboriginal territories.

Fraggles The Fraggles are anthropomorphic creatures, about tall,\\" with fur in a wide variety of colors and a tail similar to a lion's, with a tuft of fur on the end. They live in a network of caves called Fraggle Rock, populated by a variety of creatures, and seeming to connect to at least two different worlds in separate dimensions of time and space. Fraggles spend much of their carefree lives in play, exploring their worlds, and generally enjoying themselves. However, at the same time they maintain a complex culture and society, with each individual having rights and responsibilities. They have basic skill with tools and with rudimentary machinery, and the concept of war is known to them (although wars between Fraggles are very rare). Fraggles live on a diet of vegetables, especially radishes. If individuals touch their heads together before falling asleep they can \\"share dreams.‚Äù Principal Fraggles Five teenage fraggles are at the center of the series: Gobo, Mokey, Wembley, Boober and Red. They form a tight- knit group of friends, and each has a distinct personality. * Gobo Fraggle (performed by Jerry Nelson and later John Tartaglia in the live-action series, voiced by Townsend Coleman in the animated series) ‚Äì The \\"leader\\" of the five main Fraggles. He has the mindset of a young teenager and unusually level- headed and practical for a Fraggle, preferring to control most situations. He plays a guitar (made from a gourd) and often goes on trips to explore the lesser-known tunnels of Fraggle Rock, apparently more out of a sense of obligation to, and admiration for, his Uncle Traveling Matt than from personal inclination, but he nevertheless enjoys these adventures. An unfailing pragmatist, he resists the influence of his friends. Gobo has an orange complexion and purple hair, and wears a yellow sweater with a brown vest: in early episodes he used to wear a dark magenta jacket. During the Outer Space segments, Gobo is operated by Mike Quinn with Jerry Nelson still performing his voice. He was designed by Michael K. Frith, and built by Caroly Wilcox and Tim Miller. * Mokey Fraggle (performed by Kathryn Mullen and later Donna Kimball in the live-action series, voiced by Mona Marshall in the animated series) ‚Äì Mokey represents a highly spiritual and artistic, hippie-type and usually remains quiet and contemplative, though even she can get annoyed from time to time. Mokey often enjoys painting and writing poetry, although, according to the episode \\"Mokey's Funeral,\\" her friends, Gobo, Boober, Wembley, and Red, do not always enjoy listening to her poems, especially ones about death or unusually long ones about friendships. She functions as the optimist of the group, trying to see the best in everyone and everything, and comforting her friends when no such \\"bright side\\" can be found. According to episode 15, Mokey can make friends quite easily because of her optimistic personality. Though spiritual and serene, Mokey has the dangerous job of procuring radishes from the Gorgs's garden. Mokey has mauve skin and light blue-green hair. She wears a greyish brown robe-like sweater and later an actual turtleneck sweater underneath the robe-like sweater starting in \\"The Great Radish Famine.\\" She also wears the pop-top from a soda can as a necklace pendant. Mokey Fraggle's puppet regularly switches back and forth between live hands and rod hands, depending on the requirements of the scene. During those times, Mokey's right hand is usually performed by Trish Leeper. Also, she is the only Fraggle character to have moveable eyelids which open wide when scared, excited, or surprised. Mokey thinks more about the heart and is the oldest of the Fraggle group, serving as a den mother. She was designed by Michael K. Frith, the husband of Mokey's performer Kathryn Mullen, and built by Jan Rosenthal. * Wembley Fraggle (performed by Steve Whitmire and later Frankie Cordero (voice only) in the live-action series, voiced by Bob Bergen in the animated series) ‚Äì is Gobo's roommate and best friend. He is the youngest of the Fraggle Five. He often appears nervous and pathologically indecisive (mostly because he doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings; saying \\"yes\\" to someone means saying \\"no\\" to someone else), but he is undeniably one of, if not the, kindest, friendliest character in the series. In fact, \\"to wemble\\" is a Fraggle verb meaning \\"to be indecisive\\" (though the episode \\"The Secret of Convincing John\\" points out that to not be able to choose, one must first understand ALL the possibilities, suggesting an \\"up\\" side to the condition). Starting with the episode \\"The Thirty-Minute Work Week\\" and in later episodes, Wembley works with the fire department as their siren. Wembley looks greenish-yellow, with yellow hair. He wears a white shirt with palm trees on it, which he refers to as his \\"banana tree shirt\\". As quite a talented percussionist, he often plays bongo drums. He was designed by Michael K. Frith and built by Rollie Krewson. * Boober Fraggle (performed by Dave Goelz in the live-action series, voiced by Rob Paulsen in the animated series) ‚Äì is by far the Rock's most intelligent Fraggle, as well the smallest young man of the five, but often too smart for his own good. His cardinal traits include depression and worry, and as the Fraggle who does everyone's laundry, he most enjoys washing socks even though Fraggles do not seem to use footwear most of the time. Boober almost always expresses a nervous, cautious attitude, and displays hypochondriac tendencies (he is apparently allergic to dogs) and he expresses deeply ingrained superstitions (although he has shown he can temporarily overcome his fears if his friends are at risk). He has so much knowledge that he is actually a capable medic to the other Fraggles, as evidenced in the later seasons. When not doing the laundry, Boober is an avid reader, likes to share his talent as a chef, and with his knack for harmonica, has a penchant for singing and playing the blues. Boober is greenish-blue (befitting his personality) with reddish-orange hair, and always wears a red hat and brown scarf. He is the only primary Fraggle whose eyes remain invisible, and he prefers to live on his own, although he is close friends with Red and Wembley. He was designed by Michael K. Frith and built by Leslee Asch. * Red Fraggle (performed by Karen Prell in the live-action series, voiced by Barbara Goodson in the animated series) ‚Äì In direct contrast to her best friend Mokey, Red has an exuberant and athletic nature; she is one of the best swimmers among the Fraggles. Red has a yellowish orange hue, red hair, and wears a red sweater. She is also highly cynical of her friends' plans and ideas, and often teases Gobo about his Uncle Traveling Matt (occasionally yawning while he reads the postcards, or incensing Gobo by calling Matt's adventures \\"Fiction\\", \\"Fairy Tales\\", etc.). While on the surface, she tends to be competitive, stubborn, arrogant, and rather insensitive, on the inside, Red has proven to be one of the friendliest of Fraggles, perhaps second only to Wembley. Red, like Gobo, wants to be in control, and there is often friction between them over who should be the one in charge (although she has admitted she secretly admires Gobo, and the two are mostly playful with each other). During the course of the show, Red and Mokey become roommates; they get off to a rocky start before improving their friendship. Mo Rocca described her on VH1's I Love the 80s: Strikes Back as the \\"buck the establishment Fraggle\\" (comparable to Peppermint Patty of the Peanuts Gang). She was designed by Michael K. Frith and built by Rollie Krewson. * Uncle Traveling Matt (performed by Dave Goelz in the live-action series, voiced by Patrick Pinney in the animated series) ‚Äì Gobo's famous (as well as pompous, clumsy, and absent-minded) explorer uncle, spends most of the series in \\"Outer Space\\" (the Fraggles's perspective of the human world) and sends postcards back to his nephew describing his adventures there. He interacts with and often ends up interfering with the daily lives of humans, known to Fraggles as the \\"Silly Creatures\\". He sometimes refers to himself as \\"Matthew\\": he identifies the room filled with entrances to \\"Outer Space\\" as the \\"T. Matthew Fraggle Room.\\" His name puns on \\"traveling matte\\", the \\"green screen\\" technique used to produce his film segments. He was designed by Michael K. Frith and built by Tim Clarke. Other Fraggles * Ancient Fraggles ‚Äì A tribe of Fraggles that were seen in \\"Mokey, Then and Now.\\" Back then, Fraggles had leaders and did not have hairs on the heads yet. Mokey, Wembley, and Boober ended up somewhere back in time where the Ancient Fraggles mistook Mokey as the legendary Blundig (who Mokey was dressed as when she, Wembley, and Boober were rehearsing a play about Blundig). ** Fishface Fraggle (performed by Jerry Nelson) ‚Äì The autocratic ruler of the Ancient Fraggles. ** Bigmouth Fraggle (performed by Bob Stutt) ‚Äì An Ancient Fraggle that speaks a lot. ** Bonehead Fraggle (performed by Cheryl Wagner) ‚Äì An Ancient Fraggle with a bone through her nose. She tends to repeat every phrase Fishface Fraggle says. ** Noodlenose Fraggle (performed by Tim Gosley) ‚Äì An Ancient Fraggle that is amused a lot and often ends up in the Ancient Fraggles' prison since being amused back then was a bad thing. * Aunt Granny Fraggle (performed by Trish Leeper) ‚Äì Aunt Granny Fraggle is a bespectacled Fraggle. She appeared in \\"Gobo's Discovery\\" where she tries to entice the other Fraggles into joining her on a picnic. * Cantus the Minstrel (performed by Jim Henson in the live-action series, voiced by Bob Bergen in the animated series) ‚Äì Cantus and the Minstrels continually travel to different parts of the cave, and stop several times at Fraggle Rock. They encourage the Fraggles to find their own songs, which culminate in \\"Our melody/come and sing it with me/It's a song where you know you'll belong.../'Cause you know we belong to the song.\\" ** Brio the Minstrel (performed by Terry Angus) ‚Äì A Fraggle who is one of the Minstrels following Cantus. Brio is a bespectacled Fraggle who plays the cymbals. According to puppeteer Terry Angus, Brio is also the only female minstrel, conceived by Jocelyn Stevenson to balance the gender ratio. She first appeared in the Fraggle Rock episode \\"The Minstrels.\\" She was designed by Michael K. Frith and built by Jane Gootnick. * Cave Fraggles ‚Äì Deep in the caves of Fraggle Rock lives another group of Fraggles that are known to other Fraggles as Cave Fraggles (as shown in the episode \\"Fraggle Wars\\"). Enemy Fraggles live in a place they call Fraggle Cave. The Enemy Fraggles are dull and seem to be a lot like Boober, in that they share his pessimistic attitude and dislike of most forms of fun. ** The Cave's Oldest Fraggle (performed by Tim Gosley) ‚Äì The elder of the Cave Fraggles. She urges her group of Cave Fraggles on to combat against the opposition as seen in \\"Fraggle Wars.\\" Ultimately, humor prevails, and both Cave's Oldest and World's Oldest can only express disdain for modern youth. ** Beige Fraggle (performed by Richard Hunt) ‚Äì One of the Cave Fraggles from the second season Fraggle Rock episode \\"Fraggle Wars\\". He is in charge of guarding Mokey when she is captured and kept prisoner in a cage. Beige tries very hard to be a tough, efficient Security Fraggle, but secretly begins to feel sorry for Mokey. When war threatens to break out between the Cave Fraggles and the Rock Fraggles, Beige finds the courage to help Mokey and, with Red's help, stop the battle before it starts. Like Red, however, his name is the same as his color, except his is the same color as his skin, and Red's is the same as her hair. While Mokey was being kept in the cage, she and Beige discussed the differences between their two cultures. Beige demonstrates the Cave Fraggles' unique sense of humor with the song \\"Ho Ho Ho (What a Funny World It Is).\\" One joke they find particularly amusing goes, \\"I met a man who had a son, he also had a daughter too!\\" * Chuchu Fraggle ‚Äì Appeared in \\"Playing Till It Hurts\\" and has extremely large, yellow teeth, which are knocked out in the course of the episode. He played first base on Rumpel Fraggle's rock hockey team and was an aggressive player. Despite his teeth being knocked out, he continued to play. * Convincing John (performed by Jim Henson) ‚Äì An evangelist-like Fraggle, uses his fast-talking musical numbers to convince Fraggles to do anything, from getting Red to wear a blindfold to getting all Fraggles to stop eating Doozer constructions (and, subsequently, to start eating them again). \\"He could convince a Gorg that he's a Doozer!\\" Convincing John lives some distance away from the rest of the Fraggle warren: it is suggested that this status is something akin to exile, or quarantine, given Convincing John's propensity to convince people to do things at random. He does, however, have a trio of backing singers/dancers who are almost his acolytes, though when not performing, they are aware of his true nature and are less than impressed. In \\"The Secret Society of the Poobahs\\", Convincing John was the Vanguard of the Poobahs. In the same episode, Convincing John did not know the difference between guilty and innocent. He was designed by Amy Van Gilder and assisted in building him by Rollie Krewson. Convincing John's Vanguard outfit was created by Jim Henson. ** Fragglettes (performed by Dave Goelz, Richard Hunt, and Kathryn Mullen, singing voice provided by Sharon Lee Williams) ‚Äì The female Fraggles who are Convincing John's back-up singers. * Dimpley Fraggle ‚Äì There were two different Fraggles who were named Dimpley. Both versions of Dimpley were seen in the backgrounds of the other episodes. ** Dimpley Fraggle #1 ‚Äì The first Dimpley Fraggle is a girl with pigtails who raced against Gobo in \\"Wembley and the Great Race.\\" ** Dimpley Fraggle #2 ‚Äì The second Dimpley Fraggle who was on Rumple Fraggle's rock hockey team. * Eminent and Venerable Council of Sages ‚Äì The council comprises the first three Fraggles to show up for a hearing. It is composed of the level-headed Lambo (performed by Richard Hunt), the dopey Hambone (performed by Steve Whitmire) and an unnamed sleeping female Fraggle (voiced by Sharon Lee Williams). Red brings Mokey before the council when she mistakenly thinks Mokey has stolen her radish bars as seen in \\"Red-Handed and the Invisible Thief.\\" * Feenie Fraggle (performed by Jerry Nelson) ‚Äì A good-natured but rather slow-witted Fraggle. Best friend to Large Marvin Fraggle. * Felix the Fearless (performed by Bob Stutt) ‚Äì A tan Fraggle with green and gray hair who serves as head of the Fraggle Rescue Squad. He possesses a high-pitched voice which contrasts with his name and reputation (as well as his oversized outfit), and values bureaucracy over practical methods. He appeared in \\"Marooned\\" and \\"Wembley's Wonderful Whoopie Water.\\" * Fire Chief Fraggle (performed by Richard Hunt) ‚Äì Firechief Fraggle heads the Fraggle Rock Volunteer Fire Department, and swears Wembley in as a new member, allowing him to be the siren. Like the other members, Firechief Fraggle doesn't know how to start a fire. ** Clerk Fraggle (performed by Dave Goelz) ‚Äì Clerk Fraggle is responsible for taking attendance at the meetings of the Fraggle Rock Volunteer Fire Department as seen in the episode \\"The Thirty-Minute Work Week.\\" * Gillis Fraggle (performed by Richard Hunt) ‚Äì A lavender Fraggle with green hair. He wears a black jacket and a pair of half-moon glasses. Gillis is the resident musician of Fraggle Rock. But unlike the Minstrels, he lives in the Rock full-time. His first appearance was in the episode \\"Uncle Matt Comes Home\\" where he conducts a song to welcome Uncle Traveling Matt back to Fraggle Rock and even conducts the Fraggle Choir. In \\"The Secret Society of Poobahs,\\" Gillis was the Beggler-Beg of the Poobahs. Gillis' name is a reference to Fraggle Rock music arranger Don Gillis. * Harmer Fraggle ‚Äì Harmer Fraggle is a Fraggle who plays the forward on Rumple Fraggle's rock hockey team as seen in \\"Playing Till It Hurts.\\" * Herkimer Fraggle (performed by Richard Hunt) ‚Äì A Fraggle who serves as the property caretaker of Rhyming Rock. * Large Marvin Fraggle (performed by Dave Goelz) ‚Äì A fat and somewhat dim-witted Fraggle who loves snacking and also swimming. He is a long-time nemesis of Red Fraggle as he is the opposite of Red's personality. * Lou \\"Louise\\" Fraggle (performed by Cheryl Wagner) ‚Äì A helpful, considerate Fraggle from Gobo's bowling team who becomes Wembley's girlfriend in the episode \\"We Love You Wembley\\". Outside of some occasional background scenes in other episodes, Louise made a brief speaking cameo in \\"The Secret Society of Poohbahs\\" where she served as one of the guards. * Marley Fraggle (performed by Karen Prell) ‚Äì A Fraggle that was around during Uncle Traveling Matt's childhood. * Marlon Fraggle (performed by Steve Whitmire) ‚Äì An odd- looking Fraggle, resembles Peter Lorre. He wants to form a cult, has \\"ideas about behavioural modification\\" (as seen in \\"The Finger of Light\\") and carves a sculpture out of radishes for his turn as Moon Greeter (as seen in \\"Capturing the Moon\\"). * Morris Fraggle (performed by Terry Angus) ‚Äì A bespectacled Fraggle who appeared in the background of most episodes. Terry Angus had to put some glasses on Morris Fraggle so that he can easily locate Morris in the monitors during filming. * Noble Fraggle ‚Äì There were two different Fraggles who were named Noble. ** Noble Fraggle #1 ‚Äì The first Noble Fraggle appeared in \\"Wembley and the Great Race\\" where he raced against Gobo and Wembley. ** Noble Fraggle #2 ‚Äì The second Noble Fraggle appeared in \\"Playing Till It Hurts\\" where he played on Rumple Fraggle's rock hockey team. * Old Gypsy Lady (performed by Kathryn Mullen) ‚Äì The only gypsy lady in Fraggle Rock, and walks with a wooden leg and a squeaky shoe. Boober pretends to be the Old Gypsy Lady when Sidebottom comes along to try to convince him to have some fun. However, he is caught in his lie when, at the end, the Gypsy Lady arrives. * Pedley Fraggle (performed by Mike Peterson) ‚Äì A Fraggle that appeared in \\"A Brush with Jealousy.\\" * Phil Fraggle (performed by Steve Whitmire, voiced by Phil Balsam) ‚Äì A bespectacled Fraggle musician. * Pipebangers ‚Äì The Pipebangers are Fraggles who come out after the King Gorg takes his daily bath and empties the Fraggle's pond, sing and repeatedly bang on the pipes in the wall until the pond fills with water again. The Pipebangers appeared in the episode \\"Let the Water Run\\". ** Archbanger Fraggle (performed by Jerry Nelson in the live-action series, voiced by Bob Bergen in the animated series) ‚Äì The head of the Pipebangers, who have the job of refilling the Fraggle Pond with water when it runs low. He does this by leading the Pipebangers in a ritual that involves striking the pipes in Fraggle Rock with sticks. The noisy pipes lead Doc to believe that there is a problem with his boiler, which he consequently empties. The Fraggles, however, believe the appearance of water to be magically related to the Pipebangers' actions. In his only appearance in \\"Let the Water Run,\\" the Archbanger Fraggle is shocked when the water doesn't flow out of the pipes, despite repeated banging. He is unaware that Doc is fixing his boiler at the time. When Red brings back an umbrella from Doc's Workshop, the Archbanger insists on using it to bang on the pipes, claiming, \\"I know a sacred banging stick when I see one.\\" Doc turns his boiler on at the very moment that the Archbanger begins to strike the pipes with the umbrella, and the Fraggles' faith in the pipe- banging ritual is restored. He also appeared in the animated version of Fraggle Rock in the episode \\"Mokey's Flood of Creativity.\\" For the 100th pipe- banging, the Archbanger wants a special ceremony and is persuaded to allow Mokey to recite a poem for the occasion. The recitation, or so the Fraggles assume, is the cause of a flood which spreads throughout the cavern. The Archbanger re-appeared in \\"The Great Fraggle Freeze.\\" * Rathbone Fraggle ‚Äì Exclusive to the animated series, Rathbone Fraggle is an elderly Fraggle that debuts in \\"Wembley & the Bemble.\\" It was mentioned in Storyteller Fraggle's tale of the Bemble that Rathbone Fraggle disappeared when fighting the Bemble. Wembley encounters Rathbone when he mistook him for the Bemble. * Rock Hockey Hannah (performed by Kathryn Mullen) ‚Äì Red Fraggle's role model and a famous sports figure in Fraggle Rock. She appeared in \\"Playing Till It Hurts\\" where she attended a Rock Hockey Game where Red was supposed to play in until she injured herself and took the place of one of the teammates. She did congratulate Red when she knew when to give up when Red got even more injured during the game. * Rumple Fraggle (performed by Gord Robertson) ‚Äì He is a friend of Large Marvin who wears an aviator's hat and goggles. In \\"Wembley and the Great Race,\\" Rumple bets Boober Fraggle radishes on who they think will win the race. In \\"Playing Till It Hurts,\\" Rumple is the coach of the rock hockey team called the Roustabouts. * Sidebottom (performed by Dave Goelz) ‚Äì Functions as Boober's alter ego. He is funny, loud, and messy, unlike Boober. He sometimes appears during Boober's dreams and causes problems. * Sir Blunderbrain (performed by Steve Whitmire) ‚Äì A brave Fraggle who appeared in a legend told in the Fraggle Rock episode \\"The Terrible Tunnel.\\" According to the Storyteller Fraggle, Sir Blunderbrain ventured into the Terrible Tunnel but \\"never came home again.\\" * Storyteller Fraggle (performed by Richard Hunt in the first appearance, Terry Angus in later appearances for the live-action series, voiced by Stu Rosen in the animated series) ‚Äì She lives somewhere in the Fraggle tunnels and tells the Fraggles the story of the Terrible Tunnel. She has an infatuation with Gobo's Uncle Traveling Matt which comes to light while she is telling the story of Uncle Matt's first adventure. * Tosh Fraggle (performed by Trish Leeper) ‚Äì A friend of Boober Fraggle. She has a pet beast named Beastie. * Uncle Gobo (performed by Jerry Nelson) ‚Äì Uncle Traveling Matt's uncle, Gobo's great-uncle and greatest Fraggle explorer only seen in flashbacks as seen in \\"Born to Wander\\" and \\"The Riddle of Rhyming Rock.\\" * Wimple Fraggle (performed by Kathryn Mullen) ‚Äì A Fraggle that was around during Uncle Traveling Matt's childhood. * Wizard (performed by Richard Hunt) ‚Äì The Wizard is a supposed master of prestidigitation who visits Fraggle Rock occasionally to show off his magic tricks, which include the \\"Blooming Flower\\" trick and the \\"Double Twisted Over Back Flip While Escaping from Ropes and Waiting to Be Eaten While You're All Tied Up\\" trick. He is also fond of using smoke pellets to create the illusion of magic happening when he really hasn't done anything. The Wizard's incantation while performing magic is \\"Horse enchiladas, ho-ho!\\" Without his glasses and false beard, the Wizard closely resembles Wembley Fraggle. In the second-season episode \\"The Wizard of Fraggle Rock,\\" he fools Wembley into switching places with him. Wembley wants the other Fraggles to give him attention and praise; the Wizard hopes to escape from the Poison Cackler that is pursuing him. ** 7-Words-Max (performed by Dave Goelz) ‚Äì The Wizard's lackey who is easily excited and loves to boast about the Wizard's accomplishments. * The World's Oldest Fraggle (performed by Dave Goelz in the live-action series, voiced by Bob Bergen in the animated series) ‚Äì He serves as elder for the Fraggles, often officiating at ceremonial events and emergency meetings. He first appears in the episode \\"The Finger of Light.\\" The World's Oldest Fraggle is obviously greatly respected by the Fraggles, but he's not their leader. His role seems to be mostly ceremonial; he presides over games and leads meetings a lot, but he doesn't make rules for anyone. ** Henchy Fraggle (performed by John Pattison in the live-action series, Rob Paulsen in the animated series) ‚Äì Henchy Fraggle acts as assistant to the World's Oldest Fraggle. His role is to correct The World's Oldest Fraggle, and then get hit with his cane after he exclaims, \\"I know that!\\" Doozers Within Fraggle Rock lives a second species of small humanoid creatures, the pudgy, green, ant-like Doozers. Standing only tall (knee-high to a Fraggle), Doozers in a sense represent anti-Fraggles; their lives are dedicated to work and industry. Doozers spend much of their time busily constructing all manner of scaffolding throughout Fraggle Rock using miniature construction equipment and wearing hard-hats and work boots. No one but the Doozers themselves seem to understand the actual purpose of their intricate and beautiful constructions. Often they accompany their building with marching songs and various Doozer chants. To ensure that they always have a steady stream of work to do, Doozers build their constructions out of an edible candy-like substance (manufactured from radishes) which is greatly enjoyed by Fraggles. They actually want the Fraggles to eat their constructions because \\"architecture's supposed to be enjoyed\\" and also so they can go on to build again. This is essentially the only interaction between Doozers and Fraggles; Doozers spend most of their time building, and Fraggles spend much of their time eating Doozer buildings. They thus form an odd sort of symbiosis. In one episode, the flavor of the Doozer sticks is augmented by adding other flavors, such as tomato and mustard. This symbiosis becomes integral to the episode \\"The Preachification of Convincing John\\" where Mokey calls upon the Fraggles to stop eating the Doozers' constructions‚Äîbecause they spend so much time making them. Fraggle Rock quickly fills with constructions and the Doozers have no space left in which to build. After running out of space, the Doozers finally decide to move on to a new area because the Fraggles won't eat their constructions, and there is even a tragic scene with a mother explaining to her daughter that Doozers must build or they will die, and so they must find a new place to live where they can build and hopefully find Fraggles who will eat their constructions. Overhearing this, Mokey realizes that she has inadvertently disrupted a vital symbiotic relationship through ignorant good intentions. As a result, Mokey frantically rescinds her prohibition and encourages the Fraggles to gorge on the structures ‚Äì just in time to persuade the Doozers to stay. At one point a series of Fraggle Rock books appeared, one entitled \\"The Legend of the Doozer Who Didn't.\\" This book details the story of a Doozer who went against Doozer tradition when he stopped working and going to school. According to this book, a Doozer who doesn't \\"do\\" becomes a Fraggle ‚Äì though \\"All Work And All Play,\\" a second-season episode of the show, unmasks this as merely a story that Doozer parents tell their children to teach them the value of hard work: no Doozer seriously believes it. The series had several episodes that featured a young female Doozer named Cotterpin as a main character. All of the Doozers were designed by Michael K. Frith and their mechanical bodies were built by Faz Fazakas. * Angle Doozer - * Architect Doozer (performed by Jerry Nelson in the live-action series, voiced by Townsend Coleman in the animated series) ‚Äì The designer of all of the Doozers' constructions. He also becomes Cotterpin's mentor in the episode \\"All Work and All Play\\". * Board Doozer - * Bolt Doozer ‚Äì Exclusive to the animated series, Bolt Doozer debuted in the episode \\"The Great Radish Roundup\\" where he was among the Doozers that were displeased that the Gorgs had replaced their radish crops with Banoony Berries. * Bulldoozer (performed by Tim Gosley) * Cotterpin Doozer (performed by Kathryn Mullen in the live-action series, voiced by Mona Marshall in the animated series) ‚Äì Cotterpin is a rather rebellious young Doozer who has a stubborn streak. She hates working and building (unlike the other Doozers) and states she would rather be a Fraggle. Cotterpin enjoys drawing, and actually was able to become Architect's apprentice. Though seen as a Baby Doozer in \\"The Great Radish Famine,\\" she was introduced in \\"All Work and All Play\\" when she rejected the pressure placed on her to take the helmet, and ran away to become a Fraggle. Cotterpin met and befriended Red Fraggle at this time, though Cotterpin finally realized that she couldn't become a Fraggle since she can't do what Red Fraggle could do. However, Architect Doozer understood her plight, as he himself was once in her shoes, and allowed her to \\"take the drawing board\\" rather than the helmet.

Gorgs On the outside of another exit from Fraggle Rock through a well live a family of Gorgs, giant furry humanoids standing tall. The Gorgs consider themselves to be the King and Queen of the Universe, but to all appearances, seem to be working as simple farmers, with a hut and garden patch. The second episode of the first season reveals that the Gorgs have never actually met anyone besides themselves in years (\\"I've never met a real subject before!\\"), suggesting that King and Queen of the Universe are self-bestowed titles. The Gorgs regard Fraggles as pests, which steal radishes from their garden. In one episode it is revealed that the Gorgs use radishes to make \\"anti-vanishing cream\\" that prevents them from becoming invisible. So the three main races of the Fraggle Rock universe ‚Äì Fraggles, Doozers and Gorgs ‚Äì are all dependent on the radishes for different reasons. While the King and Queen consider the Fraggles disgusting vermin, Junior enjoys chasing, catching and keeping them like a boy would lizards and bugs. Junior has no friends, and perhaps pursues the Fraggles just so he has someone to talk to. * Pa Gorg (portrayed by Gord Robertson and voiced by Jerry Nelson in the live-action series, voiced by Patrick Pinney in the animated series) ‚Äì The self-proclaimed King of the Universe. * Ma Gorg (portrayed by Trish Leeper and voiced by Myra Fried in 1983, Cheryl Wagner in 1984‚Äì1987 for the live-action series, voiced by Patricia Parris in the animated series) ‚Äì The self-proclaimed Queen of the Universe. Whenever the Fraggles comes into her view, Ma Gorg would scream, causing Pa Gorg and Junior Gorg to try to catch the Fraggles or drive them away. * Junior Gorg (portrayed by Rob Mills in Season 1‚Äì4, Frank Meschkuleit in Season 5, and voiced by Richard Hunt in the live-action series, voiced by Michael Laskin in the animated series) ‚Äì The son of Pa and Ma Gorg who serves as the Prince of the Universe and the heir apparent to the Gorg crown. Junior would always try to catch the Fraggles, which does not go well most of the time. The Gorgs were developed by art director Douglas Cook in the Isle of Wight. In one of the final episodes, all leaves suddenly drop from The Nirvana Tree in the Gorg's Garden, which is the traditional sign that the reigning King must abdicate his throne and allow the crown prince to succeed. But after eating the last Nirvana leaf, Junior shrinks to fraggle size, sees the realm from their point of view (including a consultation with Marjory the Trash Heap), and upon returning to his Gorg stature, invites his Fraggle friends to his coronation. As King, his first act is to abolish the Gorg monarchy, introducing a Fraggle-like society where all creatures are socially equal. Marjory the Trash Heap Marjory the Trash Heap Marjory the Trash Heap (performed by Jerry Nelson in the live-action series, voiced by Rob Paulsen in the animated series) is a wise being (referred to as an \\"oracle\\") that serves as the garbage dump of the Gorgs. She and her heckling heralds live near the Gorg's garden, and she gives the Fraggles guidance and advice, which the Fraggles regard with reverence, although they do not worship her. She also appears to have some magical abilities (specifically telepathy and the ability to teleport items or Fraggles), although she does not often use them. Sometimes she knits to pass the time. She has an uncle named Maximillian (which was somehow spelled with a \\"silent Q\\"), whom she refers to as \\"Uncle Max\\". In the animated series, Marjory speaks in a Jewish/Yiddish accent. Although being made of the Gorgs's junk, and having no real need for clothing, Philo and Gunge occasionally lavish her with jewelry (headbands and bracelets made of random objects), and often looks at her Fraggle clientele through a pair of spectacles mounted on a stick. The character has a popular aftermath in the German version of the serial where Marjory is named Allwissende M√ºllhalde (engl. all-knowing Trash Heap). Today this name is used as a common synonym for search engines, especially Google, and wikipedia. She was designed by Michael K. Frith and built by Jane Gootnick and Maria McNamara. Philo and Gunge Philo and Gunge (performed by Dave Goelz and Richard Hunt in the live-action series, voiced by John Stephenson and Bob Bergen in the animated series) are the heralds of the Trash Heap. They often introduce her as the \\"all-knowing, all-seeing Trash Heap! Nyeah!\\" They supply humor, bad jokes, and puns. Although Gunge portrays himself as the brains of the pair, neither ever really prove a great help. They watch over the Trash Heap; if they were to leave for a long time, she would begin to die out. When she finishes speaking, they announce, \\"The Trash Heap has spoken! Nyeah!\\" Philo and Gunge had two episodes of the series devoted to them: \\"Home Is Where the Trash Is\\" and \\"Gunge the Great & Glorious\\". They were designed by Michael K. Frith and built by Jane Gootnick. The Silly Creatures of Outer Space The producers made the series with the intention of it airing in various forms internationally. Therefore, some characters and \\"Outer Space\\" locations were changed. (UK episodes were set in a lighthouse, German versions in a workshop) Gobo's Uncle Traveling Matt has gone to explore the human world (Fraggles call it Outer Space), and he regularly sends postcards back to Gobo. The name \\"Traveling Matt\\" puns on the film special-effects device known as a traveling matte. Matt calls the humans he meets the \\"Silly Creatures.\\" Yet despite his contempt, the interactions related in his postcards often show his own ignorance. For example, he once sees two teenage girls chewing bubble gum: when they blow bubbles, he believes that the \\"food\\" has made their tongues inflate and explode. * Doc (portrayed by Gerard Parkes in the live-action series, voiced by John Stephenson in the animated series) ‚Äì Doc is a man who is an inventor and a former barber. His workshop has a Fraggle Hole that leads into Fraggle Rock. Gobo must go out into Doc's workshop to retrieve the postcards from the wastebasket where Doc throws them. Doc remains unaware of the Fraggles' existence. In the second-to-last episode, he finally learns that the Fraggles exist and befriends them. Matt also returns home to Fraggle Rock. When Ned Shimmelfinney moves to the desert due to his health, Doc moves with him. Due to the wisdom of Marjory the Trash Heap where states \\"You cannot leave the magic,\\" a magical portal opened up in Fraggle Rock that enabled Gobo and his friends to go to where Doc is currently living. In the animated series, Doc's head isn't shown. In the live-action series's finale, the theme song is played one as the credits roll, and Doc delivers the last line of \\"Down in Fraggle Rock!\\", punctuated by a bark from Sprocket. * Sprocket (performed by Steve Whitmire and Dave Barclay in the live-action series, voiced by Rob Paulsen in the animated series) ‚Äì Sprocket is Doc's dog. He has seen the Fraggles and tries in vain to prove their existence to his owner. Being a Live-Hand Muppet, Steve Whitmire is assisted in performing him by Karen Prell who handles Sprocket's right hand and wagging tail. He was designed by Michael K. Frith and built by Tim Miller. * International Docs ‚Äì There were different adaptations for Docs in different countries that aired Fraggle Rock where each one had their version of Sprocket: ** UK Version ‚Äì In the UK version, the Doc role was substituted for The Captain (portrayed by Fulton Mackay). He is a retired sailor who works as a lighthouse keeper at a rocky-sea lighthouse (which was portrayed by the St. Anthony's Lighthouse located near Falmouth, Cornwall) with his version of Sprocket. *** P.K. (portrayed by John Gordon Sinclair) ‚Äì The Captain's nephew who appeared in Season Four following the death of Fulton Mackay. *** B.J. (portrayed by Simon O'Brien) ‚Äì The Captain's son who appeared in Season Six. In the second-to-last episode, B.J. finally learns that the Fraggles exist and befriends Gobo. Due to the lighthouse being automated with technology, B.J. and Sprocket had to move away. B.J. takes up a job as a property caretaker at a castle which is where he and Sprocket discover the second Fraggle hole. This is how Gobo and his friends were able to reunite with B.J. and Sprocket ** German Version ‚Äì The German version of Doc (played by Hans-Helmut Dickow) is similar to the US version of Doc. ** French Version ‚Äì The French version of Doc (played by Michel Robin) who worked as a baker and a French alter-ego for Sprocket called Croquette. Doc inherited the home from his eccentric Uncle Georges (who was a noted inventor). Thus, when the frame story required the use of a mechanical device, Doc would merely find yet another of Uncle Georges' machines. Plot-lines also frequently involved the elegant but unseen Madame Pontaven (who Doc repeatedly attempted to impress and invite to dinner with no success). There were some other characters that Doc had interacted with off-screen or on the telephone: * Doc has a friend named Ned Shimmelfinney who lives next door to him. At first, Sprocket hates Shimmelfinney, who owns a cat named Fluffanella (voiced by Karen Prell). Sprocket makes a face and choking gestures every time Shimmelfinney's name is mentioned. He stops doing this after Doc and Shimmelfinney have a fight in \\"The Great Radish Famine.\\" In the last episode, Ned Shimmelfinney moves to the desert for his health causing Doc and Sprocket to go with him. * Doc also helps out Ms. Betty Ardath who moves into his neighborhood in \\"A Cave of One's Own.\\" She runs a bed-and-breakfast called \\"The Captain's Inn\\".

The community developed in the 1920s as a mill town, a planned community that contained the Dixie Spinning Mills thread mill and housing for its workers. History Chattanooga businessman John T. Lupton established the Dixie Mercerizing Company around 1920 to manufacture thread using the mercerizing process, which had been introduced in 1913. The company built its thread- spinning facility and the adjoining housing area on a tract north of the Tennessee River, outside the city limits of Chattanooga. In 1923, when production began, the spinning mill had 12,000 spindles; by 1925 there were 30,000 spindles. Lupton City provided modern worker housing near the mill, as well as community services such as a school, post office, and church, and amenities such as concrete sidewalks, a gym, a movie theater, and a swimming pool. Medical care was available from a doctor and dentist employed by the company. By 1929, Lupton City had 200 homes. For most of its history, Lupton City had a post office. Homes in the community did not have mailboxes or residential delivery, so residents picked up their mail at the post office, which used ZIP code 37351. In 2006 the post office was closed temporarily due to structural problems with the building that housed it, and residents were instructed to get their mail at the Hixson post office. The U.S. Postal Service and the building owner provided money to the city of Chattanooga to buy mailboxes for Lupton City postal customers, and the post office closed permanently on July 18, 2009. Lupton City is now part of the city of Chattanooga. The yarn mill no longer operates in the community as Dixie Yarns, and has been torn down. All that remains is the bricks of the mill.

It takes its name from the Freeport of Copenhagen which had been established on the coast just east of the church a decade earlier. History The Church of the Free Port is one of several churches built with funds raised by the Society for the Construction of Small Churches in Copenhagen. The organization was founded at the initiative of Dorothea von Ripperda, a young noblewoman who learned about the severe shortage of churches in the new districts of Copenhagen at a meeting in the mission house Bethesda in 1886. She was later joined by many other young women who participated in the collection of money for the cause. The architect Thorvald J√∏rgensen was charged with the design of the church which was completed in 1905. Its first pastor was H.P. Mollerup who later founded Kirkens Korsh√¶r. a Danish version of the British Church Army. Architecture The church is oriented north- south and has a tower at its north-eastern corner.

It re-elected Jacob Zuma and supporters to the party's top leadership and National Executive Committee (NEC), substantially defeating an opposing group that had coalesced around challenger Kgalema Motlanthe. The conference is a precursor to the general election of 2014, in which the re-elected leader of the ANC, the current majority party in the national parliament, is highly likely to remain the President of South Africa. It was also only the second leadership contest between two candidates at the national level since the 52nd National Conference of the African National Congress, when Zuma deposed then president Thabo Mbeki, and the 38th National Conference of the African National Congress in 1949, a watershed moment in the party's history when the moderate leadership was displaced by such figures as Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo and Walter Sisulu. Buildup The buildup to the 53rd conference saw rivalry for the presidency of the ANC between Jacob Zuma and Kgalema Motlanthe. New party leadership The 53rd conference re-elected Jacob Zuma as the president of the ANC. All of the top six NEC positions (President, Deputy President, Secretary-General, Deputy Secretary-General, National Chairperson and Treasurer-General) went to Zuma supporters, representing a comprehensive defeat for the forces backing Motlanthe. A consistently large margin of around 75% in the votes for all these positions indicated that Zuma and Motlanthe supporters had voted as a block on all the senior positions. The newly elected National Executive Committee was also dominated by Zuma supporters. The conference also agreed to retain the size of the NEC at 86, defeating a proposal to reduce it back to 66, the level prior to 2007. President Jacob Zuma was re-elected president of the ANC. Zuma, the incumbent president of the ANC and president of South Africa, defeated Kgalema Motlanthe, incumbent deputy president of the ANC and deputy president of South Africa. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa received 3,018 votes and was elected deputy president of the ANC, convincingly defeating Mathews Phosa, who received 470 votes and Human Settlements Minister Tokyo Sexwale, who received 463.

The label also has an office in Miami, Florida. It serves the genres of reggaet√≥n, bachata, hip hop, R&B;, and various other styles of tropical and Latin music. The label has previously been distributed by Univision Records and Machete Music while currently being distributed by Siente Music since early 2012. History Filtro Musik In 2005, Ivy Queen partnered with co-founder of Perfect Image Records, Jos√© Guadalupe to form Filtro Musik. This stemmed from Guadalupe parting ways with the other co- founder of Perfect Image Anthony P√©rez who in turn would launch his own label The Roof Records. Filtro Musik's concept initially stemmed from its name which means filter in English. \\"I've been in this industry 15 years, and we have the ability to filter and pick the best\\" said Guadalupe. Later that year, Univision Records signed the label to a licensing plan to promote Ivy Queen's fifth studio album Flashback (2005) to Latin and non-Latin buyers. This ensured that the album was positioned in Latin and mainstream accounts that would normally not carry Latin product. Following Queen's split from management and Jorge Guadalupe in 2006, Guadalupe separated into Filtro Music Group. Drama Records After the success of her 2007 effort Sentimiento, which spawned the Top 10 hit \\"Que Lloren\\" and was later certified Platinum by the United States Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), a substantial live album, Ivy Queen 2008 World Tour LIVE! was distributed by Machete in 2008. This would lead up to Queen signing with the label in April 2010 as it celebrated its fifth anniversary. The signing, described as a 360 deal, includes profit sharing in tours, sponsorships and merchandising. Ivy Queen was previously signed to a distribution deal with Univision Records, which in turn was acquired by Machete's parent company Universal Music Latin Entertainment in 2008. The president of Universal Music Latino and Machete, Walter Kolm, commented in a press release \\"It's a privilege to have Ivy Queen a part of our artistic roster. Ivy is an extraordinary woman with incomparable talent, and she's number one in her genre. We're happy to be able to work with her on her new album as well as future projects\\". \\"I'm very proud to be a part of Machete Music. They are a young, vibrant company that has created a name for itself in Latin music in the United States and the world. They are a strong and important company that has been recognized for nurturing their artists‚Äô creative talents,\\" said Ivy Queen, regarding the partnership. Ivy Queen Musa Sound Shortly, however, Queen released a new single, \\"Peligro De Extinci√≥n\\" in 2012 under Siente Music, a subdivision of Universal Music Latin Entertainment, sister labels with Machete. This in turn led to Queen launching Ivy Queen Musa Sound, a new record label, starting with the release of the single, and then her eight studio album effort, Musa on August 21, 2012.

In July 1992 he piloted his single engine Cessna 172 Skyhawk from Washington, D.C. across the Atlantic Ocean via Greenland and Iceland back to the UK. In the early 1990s Bruce started the 'Skydive From Space' project, to skydive from the edge of space from 130,000 feet and break the highest altitude freefall record previously set by Joe Kittinger in the 1960s. He trained with Loel Guinness' High Adventure Company and Kittinger. The project was partially backed funded by NASA.

He was killed while leading a coup attempt against Haitian President Fran√ßois Duvalier in 1958. Fighter pilot In 1942, Haitian President √âlie Lescot implemented an aviation corps program. and chose 3 men out of 42 corps members to receive pilot training in Tuskegee, Alabama. Alix Pasquet, a law graduate of √âcole Millitaire d'Haiti and an officer in the Haitian army at the time, was one of these three chosen officers.Dead or Victorious but not prisoner. Amistad Films. The U.S. government needed the Haitians to organize a patrol of the Caribbean Sea during World War II and gave the Haitian government six airplanes. These airplanes could carry bombs and could be used to attack German submarines within that area. In February 1943, Pasquet, along with Raymond Cassagnol and Philippe C√©lestin, traveled from Port-au-Prince to Alabama to begin training at the famed Tuskegee Flight School. The Tuskegee Airmen were renowned for their unmatched record of more than 200 combat missions with few losses. Pasquet's training went through three stages‚Äîprimary, basic, and advanced‚Äîand was extremely rigorous. He was trained by Jimmy Plinton, Jr., who was reputed as one of the best trainers in the Tuskegee Air Force program, over the course of a 7-month program. The Afro-American Newspaper, one of the most widely circulated black newspapers at that time, ran a feature story on Pasquet, Cassagnol, and C√©lestin in April 1943, and the trio was noted for their aptitude with the English language. Additionally since Pasquet and his compatriots were from Haiti, they were unfamiliar with the pervasive racial segregation and racism in the American South at that time and were forced to ride on Blacks-Only transportation or sit in the back of trains. As a result, they rarely ventured off-campus. Pasquet had a bad case of the flu and lost a month of his training, but ultimately graduated in August 1943 as a member of class 43G. Political revolutionary After the end of World War II, Pasquet returned to Haiti. However, he was exiled in 1957 for supporting Louis D√©joie in the May 1957 Haitian Civil War. From exile in Miami, Pasquet led a political movement to restore stability in his native country and overthrow current ruler Fran√ßois Duvalier. In 1958, he returned to Haiti with Henri Perpignan and Phillipe Dominique as well as five Americans‚ÄîArthur Payne, Dany Jones, Levant Kersten, Robert F. Hickey and Joe D. Walker‚Äîwith the intention of overpowering the capital's army barracks and capturing the ammunition depot within. He gained entry through the barracks' gate by convincing the sentry that he was an officer delivering prisoners, and then quickly seized control of the barracks. However the plot was foiled when an accomplice, Henri Perpignan, sent a prisoner to acquire Haitian-blend cigarettes, who then revealed crucial details to the incumbent government about Pasquet's position. Pasquet was killed during the attempted coup and buried in Port-au-Prince. Personal life Pasquet married Denise Etheart and had three sons: Gilbert Pasquet, Alix Pasquet Jr., and Bernard Pasquet. In 1973 his son, Alix, married Mich√®le Bennett, who later married Francois Duvalier's son, Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier.

Born in Persberg, V√§rmland, in Sweden, he grew to work in several modernist styles, was one of the first Swedish expressionist artists, and became a part of the international avant-garde in art after embracing more abstract art styles in Germany and France that were evolving there during the early 1900s. He created his most famous paintings, Night Caf√© I and II, and Trait, in France in 1905. These night caf√© paintings, made from studies in the Place Pigalle, and in other nightclubs popular with artists such as Caf√© du Rat Mort (Dead Rat Caf√©), are seen as two of Swedish modernism's most important works, and are considered breakthrough work of Swedish modernism. T√∂rneman gained international stature in 1905 at the Salon d'Automne in Paris with Trait I, and with his Narragansett Caf√© in 1906. He went on to paint murals and decorations in public buildings such as the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and Stockholm City Hall, and other Stockholm buildings such as Norra Latin, Ragnar √ñstberg's √ñstermalms l√§roverkl, and the second chamber in the Parliament House.

This very ambitions painting project was a subject of much discussion, and when completed was unanimously praised by critics, but disappeared from view until its rediscovery. During the 1950s, the ceiling painting De elektriska disappeared, having been hidden behind a new ceiling during a renovation; with time, speculation arose that it had been destroyed during construction at its KTH site. After nearly 40 years, and its being near forgotten, De elektriska was found during 1993 repairs to its original building, intact, though a ventilation duct had been installed through it. The painting, still considered an important part of Swedish cultural heritage, was restored and moved‚Äîa thin layer of it was removed with great care and affixed to a new support in its new location‚Äîwork that took a year and cost five-times as much as commission for the original artwork; it re-opened to the public in its new location, in 1994.

It is located along Tennessee State Route 56 southeast of Winchester, and just north of the Alabama state line. Sherwood has a post office with ZIP code 37376. Geography and Location The Crow Creek Valley, in which Sherwood is situated, is a relatively narrow valley surrounded on three sides (north, east, and west) by the Cumberland Plateau (including Lost Cove), with the southern end of the valley opening toward Alabama. Crow Creek, which flows from Lost Cove Cave, drains the valley and flows through the western part of Sherwood, emptying into the Tennessee River at Guntersville Lake near Stevenson, Alabama, several miles to the south. Sherwood lies at an elevation of . State Route 56, the only major highway that passes through Sherwood, traverses the valley from north-to-south. To the north, the road ascends more than to Sewanee atop the Cumberland Plateau. To the south, the road continues into Alabama as State Route 117, eventually reaching Stevenson. Railroad tracks run alongside the highway for much of its stretch in the valley. History Human habitation in the Sherwood area is very ancient as evidenced by the many thousands of Native American projectile points in the nearby fields. The town location is at the intersection of many old Native American routes which the modern trails and roads often follow. It is located on an old Stagecoach route approximately midway between Sewanee and Anderson, Alabama and is representative of the hamlets and villages that were once commonplace in the area coves and valleys. A small community called Kitchen's Station or Catchings Station had existed as a Stagecoach stop earlier at the location. Named for station master Meridith Catchings, the small community began appearing on railroad maps after the Civil War. The town of Sherwood was named for Charles D. Sherwood, lieutenant governor of Minnesota during the Civil War. The Tennessee State Legislature approved his charter for the Tennessee Immigration and Land Company on April 15, 1878. That same day, Sherwood purchased the 1,410 acres of land for his northern colony from John F. Anderson. On June 19, 1878 a local paper announced that the name of Kitchen's [Catching's] Station would be changed to Sherwood. A number of sources have erroneously reported that Charles Sherwood was lieutenant governor of Wisconsin and that the town was established in 1875. This information probably came from the Goodspeed History Tennessee: Giles, Franklin, Lincoln, and Moore Counties. The Railroad With the construction of the strategically important Cowan Tunnel to the north in 1852, train stops were created through the Crow Creek Valley, including at Catchings Station (Sherwood). Notably, at this station there were and continue to be pusher engines which are required to assist with train ascents up the steep mountain grade to the tunnel. Correspondingly, on the other side of the tunnel in Cowan, Tennessee, there are also pusher engines. In 1915, a passenger train and a freight train collided in Sherwood, killing fifteen and injuring twenty- two. Gager Lime Company Gager Lime Manufacturing Company The Gager Lime Manufacturing Company was established by Byron Gager in 1892 and operated a limestone quarry and lime kilns in the community. The lime production facilities operated until 1949. Excerpts available at Google Books. As of the 1930 census, Sherwood had 1,700 residents, but the community's population declined to 900 in the 1950s as its economy stalled after the closing of the limestone plant. The castle-like ruins of the lime production facilities and silos, which are unusual for their Egyptian Revival and Gothic Revival styling, remain in the community. The Tennessee Preservation Trust included them on its Ten in Tennessee Endangered Properties List for 2002‚Äì2003, citing their architectural distinctiveness and expressing concern that a \\"continued lack of maintenance\\" threatened their survival. Epiphany Mission Epiphany Mission In 1899, the Epiphany Episcopal Mission was established in Sherwood after the Episcopal church began to provide schooling for local children. The church structure was built in 1902, replaced in 1928, burned in 1960, and then rebuilt in 1967. The 1928 structure is maintained as a partial ruin on the grounds of the modern structure. During the Great Depression, the Episcopal priest Father George Jones began a publishing a series of pamphlets to raise funds and awareness of the improvised community; these pamphlets were later republished in 1954 as book entitled Candles in the Dark Boreen. In 1956, the mission helped train a group of women and opened a shirt factory in Sherwood in an attempt to create local jobs. Threatened snail species Snake-coiled forest snail Anguispira picta.jpg The painted snake-coiled forest snail is only found in the Sherwood area. The snail was first found in the area in 1906 and was designated as a threatened species in 1978. Anguispira picta has the common names of painted snake-coiled forest snail and painted tigersnail and is a rare species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Discidae, the disc snails.

The musical numbers are all songs performed by Springfield during her career. The book of the musical was written by Kirsten Holly Smith, who also plays the lead role of Dusty Springfield in the originating production, and Jonathan Vankin. Forever Dusty opened on 18 November 2012 at New World Stages, an Off-Broadway venue in New York City. The UK Premiere opened on 3 May 2017 at Brookside Theatre, a London Fringe theatre as the start of a UK theatre tour.  History  Smith originated the project at the University of Southern California in 2006, where she performed a workshop version of the piece as a one-woman show after receiving a Spectrum Arts Grant from USC. Smith has said that her interest in Springfield‚Äôs story was sparked by listening to the singer‚Äôs Dusty in Memphis album. \\"That soulful, sultry, passionate yet vulnerable voice. I immediately identified with her and knew that I needed to explore the roots of Dusty‚Äôs voice. I felt like I knew exactly what she was feeling when she sang her songs, that maybe it was the same feeling I had when I sang,\\" Smith said. The one-woman musical moved in 2008 to the Renberg Theatre in West Hollywood, California. The theatre is part of the Lily Tomlin/Jane Wagner Cultural Arts Center at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center. The L.A. Gay and Lesbian Center co-produced the show, then entitled Stay Forever: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield, with actress Jorja Fox (best known for her work on the TV series, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation ), Leslie Brockett and Jon Imparato as producers. Brockett was a producer of the USC workshop version as well. The Off Broadway production of Forever Dusty is greatly expanded from the one-woman Stay Forever. The show became a full-scale book musical with the addition of co-writer Vankin. The cast now consists of five actors, each portraying multiple characters (with the exception of Smith, who plays Dusty Springfield only). The director of the production at New World Stages is Randal Myler, whose notable previous work includes the bio-musicals Love, Janis (about Janis Joplin) and Hank Williams: Lost Highway as well as the Tony and Drama Desk Award-nominated Broadway production It Ain‚Äôt Nothin‚Äô But The Blues. Fox and Brockett stayed on as producers, joined by Jane Gullong and Sandalphon Productions. Helga Olafsson and Lawrence D. Poster came on as associate producers. Eva Price of Maximum Entertainment became the production‚Äôs executive producer. Michael Thomas Murray served as musical director as well as associate producer.

Before becoming a medical missionary, Phillips gained admittance into the Victoria University of Manchester and subsequently became the third woman to graduate with a degree in medicine from the University. Upon graduating, Phillips was sent to China as a medical missionary by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). In China, Phillips faced some difficulty with the local population, as they did not trust foreigners after the political turmoil that had taken place recently before Phillips' arrival. Her accomplishments in China include the construction of two hospitals, work with the YWCA, and the establishment of a private practice. Phillips was interned in China during the Second World War. Phillips returned to the UK in 1948 and died three years later.Phillips, Clifford H. 2003. The Lady Named Thunder: A Biography of Dr. Ethel Margaret Phillips (1876‚Äì1951), edited by Jill Fallis. Edmonton, Alberta: The University of Alberta Press. Early life Ethel Margaret Phillips was born in England in 1876 and had a difficult childhood. She was the second of the four children of her parents. When she was an infant, her father who had trained as an engineer but contracted tuberculosis, took up a business in mineral water production in Bridgnorth but left his wife and children at their original home. When she was about four years old, her mother left the family, taking Phillips‚Äô youngest brother, Herbert, with her. It was decided that all the other children would leave Bridgnorth, a small town in England, to live with their grandmother. After less than a year Phillips was then sent to attend school in London. Much of Phillips' childhood was spent living with unpleasant hosts and being passed from school to school. She also suffered from ill- health with suspected tuberculosis and fibroids, eventually needing a hysterectomy. Phillips began earning her living from the age of fifteen through teaching at Rushmore College, a private school located in Kidderminster, Shropshire. She took on various teaching jobs for the next few years, while also continuing her own studies. Phillips passed the Cambridge examination and then became an Associate of the Royal College of Preceptors. Education In September 1898, Phillips took the college entrance exam. Upon passing the exam, she enrolled at the University of Manchester. Women were only recently allowed admittance into the University and were not yet allowed to enrol in the medical program. In her first term, Phillips took many science courses and when the medical school began accepting women, during Phillips' second term, she transferred right away. In 1905, Phillips graduated from the University of Manchester with a bachelor of medicine and surgery, making her the third woman to graduate from the University with a degree in medicine. She was awarded several scholarships and medals during her university studies. Calling Around the time that Phillips was eleven, she heard a sermon given by a member of the London Missionary Society. After hearing the sermon, Phillips began to ponder the idea of becoming a missionary in the future. However, she decided that she was too shy to preach and abandoned the idea. As a young woman, her medical conditions meant she had had frequent visits to hospital, and she developed the ambition to become a medical doctor. These aspirations came together when Phillips was short on money. A friend advised her to apply for a scholarship from the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge to help to pay for her school tuition. To qualify, Phillips needed to go abroad as a missionary doctor and apply to a specific mission. Phillips decided to take the offer and applied to the Society for the Propagation of Gospel, who also provided her with training. Originally wishing to go to India, Phillips was instead assigned to China and arrived there on 23 October 1905. Work in China Political background The Boxer Rebellion took place about five years prior to Phillips' arrival in China. The uprising was a response to the foreign religious influence brought over by traders and missionaries. Women missionaries were not well received in China at this time because of the unconventional role they took on through working outside the household. Despite violence, Western missionaries were not deterred from their mission work.Duiker, William J. 1978. Cultures in Collision: The Boxer Rebellion. San Rafael: Presidio Press. Phillips arrived in China after the Boxer Rebellion but still experienced the aftereffects. People were not keen on Western practices in religion or medicine, so Phillips' patients might not adhere to her treatment recommendations. Peking When Phillips arrived in China, contemporary Chinese and Western medical practices were very different. Chinese medicine mostly used traditional methods, rather than the science- based methods developing in the West. Phillips encountered many herbal medications in China; herbal remedies and acupuncture were both very popular treatments.Rui-Juan, Xiu. 1988. \\" Microcirculation and Traditional Chinese Medicine.\\" JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association 260 (12): 1755‚Äì1777. She also noted that people would seek advice from additional doctors if one did not provide an immediate cure. After arriving in Peking, Phillips started to learn Chinese. She worked under Dr. Aspland, another medical missionary, who put her in charge of women and children outpatients and the women's ward at the dispensary. Phillips worked with Dr Aspland in Peking for six months and also visited other mission hospitals in the area to gain experience. During this time in Peking, Phillips developed an acute case of Tuberculosis and was advised by Dr. Aspland to leave Peking and go to the country for fresh air. During six weeks at the mission rest-house, Phillips' idealistic view of mission work became slightly tarnished by the lack of friendliness displayed by her coworkers in Peking. Pinyin Mission Station After recovering, a Bishop from a nearby diocese requested Phillips' presence in Pinyin. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel had opened a mission station in Pinyin in 1879. Phillips arrived at the mission station on 9 March 1906. There were no other mission stations present in the area while Phillips was there. She often did not see eye to eye with the missionaries and wished to build a permanent hospital. In 1908, Phillips received permission to build the hospital that she had requested, and St. Agatha's Hospital was opened on 5 February 1909 with official dedication on 1 May. St. Agatha's Hospital St. Agatha's Hospital was the first hospital that was built in the diocese of Shandong. The hospital was also the first women's hospital to be opened in the entire district. The first patients were admitted on 15 November. Phillips introduced a policy that only necessary cases would be admitted, and patients had to pay a fee. They also had to pay for their food if they decided to leave before their treatment was complete, to encouraged patients to stay for the full course and also to prevent people attending only for free food. On 27 December 1909, the first infant was born at the hospital. Phillips was given the Chinese name Lady of Thunder because of her resolute character following the establishment of this hospital. Furlough Phillips seldom left China but did take a furlough following the opening of St. Agatha's Hospital, beginning on 4 July. She sailed to America, going to Hawaii, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Chicago, and then to Canada. After that, Phillips travelled to London and was diagnosed unfit to return to China for health reasons by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. In March 1913, Phillips decided that she felt well enough to return to her work in China and requested to work at the Canadian Church Mission in Henan Province. Her request was accepted and Phillips prepared for her return. Kaifeng and St. Paul's Hospital In Kaifeng, at the Canadian Church Mission, Phillips was considered a senior missionary due to her prior experience and ability to speak Chinese. The Bishop in charge of the mission placed Phillips in command of the women's work, the supervision of the boys' orphanage, and the construction of the new hospital. St. Paul's Hospital opened in November 1914. Not long after the opening, the mission began to deteriorate; two missionaries had already resigned. At this time, the mission was ordered to close the hospital until World War I was over. After closing down the hospital, Phillips did not wish to join any more missions, for her initial view of missionary work had been ruined.  Return to Peking  Back in Peking, Phillips translated nursing training material into Chinese. Then, from September 1915, Phillips taught medicine in Chinese at the Union Medical College for Women. The classes included hygiene and public health as well as other medical topics. Phillips also attended classes with her students at the Peking Union Medical College to translate the curriculum for them. She also agreed to be the visiting physician for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, but when asked to join the mission again officially, Phillips declined, no longer wishing to be affiliated with a specific mission. Phillips rented a house to open her own private practice. Her patients included foreign nationals as well as Chinese. For additional income, she rented rooms to paying guests. Along with teaching and her medical practice, Phillips was also made the unofficial physician for the YWCA, in which she helped Chinese women medically and socially. While in Peking, Phillips adopted a two year old European boy, whom she called Clifford. He was sent to England at the age of 16 to continue his education. He remained in the UK, serving in the RAF during World War II and did not meet his mother until it ended. =Phillips and the YWCA= The YWCA was brought to China at the start of the twentieth century to provide a support system and to help Chinese women to move away from their original roles in the household.Drucker, Alison R. 1979. \\"The Role of the YWCA in the Development of the Chinese Women's Movement, 1890‚Äì1927.\\" Social Service Review 53 (3): 421‚Äì440. Phillips was consistently concerned with the betterment of women and children throughout her work in China. While working with the YWCA, Phillips wanted to create mother's clubs. Peking's YWCA successfully established a mother's club for women coming from lower income families. At the same time, Phillips pushed the creation of a Home Training School in which students would learn care for the sick, cleanliness, and a number of other simple tasks. Phillips was very firm in her beliefs of serving others. Late life Phillips had little impact from the political turmoil that was taking place in China until World War II began. As World War II started, she was running a tuberculosis sanatorium that was growing quickly. This was closed when the Japanese began their occupation of Peking. Along with the sanatorium, the Anglican Mission Girls' School where Phillips was doing health inspections was closed. On 7 December 1941, Phillips was declared by the Japanese to be an enemy alien because of her British ties. She was subsequently put under house arrest for a short while. Not long after being released, Phillips was ordered to evacuate Peking and was taken to the Weixian Internment Compound in Shandong Province. She remained there until the people in the camp were freed at the end of World War II on 17 August 1945. Phillips was reunited with her son Clifford after her release, and became a grandmother in 1946. Feeling that it was impractical to recover her private medical practice, she took a position with Radio Peking, broadcasting a half-hour program three times each week. With the Chinese Civil War looming overhead, Clifford convinced his mother that it was time to leave China and, after 43 years, Phillips left China to live with her brother in Bridgwater, UK in 1948. She suffered after effects from the Weixan Internment Compound and died of congestive heart failure on 17 May 1951. References Bibliography *Drucker, A. R. (1979).

The lake is situated on Wooleen Station, approximately north of Yalgoo and west of Cue. Description The lake is situated on the Yilgarn Craton, lying on alluvial and lacrustine valley-fill deposits in the flood plain of the Roderick River. The surrounding country gently undulates among isolated hills and rocky outcrops. Wooleen is a flood plain lake made up of two claypans joined by a neck including associated marches. The lake receives water approximately once every four years, fills once every ten years, and floods once every thirty years. It results from its position on a fault line and when it overflows it discharges into the Murchison River, but when the Murchison is in flood it can flow into the lake. Filling is usually the result of rain events of a tropical origin that occur in autumn and summer; water depth may reach as high as several metres when full and can take as long as ten months to dry out again. The water quality is fresh when full but becomes increasingly brackish as the lake dries out. The vegetation in the lakebed and claypans is mostly shrubland with species such as samphire and lignum dominating, and low open woodland of Eucalyptus camaldulensis in the margins. The surrounding vegetation is taller open shrubland.

The protests themselves took place on three occasions in 1970, 1975, and 1987 (BAM I, BAM II, BAM III). Many student organizations participated in the movement, which has been called one of the most challenging for administrators in the school's history. Alan Glenn of the Ann Arbor Chronicle said of the 1970 protests that \\"the BAM strike became one of the few protests of that era in which the students could make a valid claim of victory.\\" First protest After the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, students protested against the University of Michigan administration for lack of support for minorities on campus. The University agreed to certain concessions and to increase integration on campus. The 1970 Black Action Movement protests first began in late 1969, when black student organizations began to chafe at the slow progress of this proposed integration. Following their decision to become more proactive, the Black Student Union, Black Law Student Alliance, Black Psychologist, and the Black Educational Caucus among others entered into talks with university administrators. Accepting an invitation to dine and discuss with the university president in February 1970, the groups staged a demonstration on his lawn and demanded that by the beginning of the 1973-1974 school year, the balance of African American students and administrators proportionately reflect the 10% balance in the state at the time. Other requests were for better support for minority students, including a recruiter for Chicano students and a Black Student Center, financial support by way of extra grants and scholarships, and the establishment of a Black studies program. The campaign closed the University of Michigan for 18 days through strikes, protests, picketing, blocking of buildings and streets, and interruption and shutting down of classes. During the last week of the strike, attendance of classes in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) dropped by 75%. The settlement reached on 1 April 1970 involved the University accepting the 10% figure as a goal. In a speech later that month, U.S. Vice President Spiro Agnew criticized university president Robben Fleming for his \\"surrender\\" to the students, calling the university's settlement a \\"callow retreat from reality.\\" Second protest The 1975 Black Action Movement protests were brought about for a few reasons. One of these was the lack of progress by the University in implementing the demands of the first movement. Another reason was the expulsion of a black nursing student, for preparing a patient's insulin shot, who was not allowed an expulsion hearing. The final reason was the University's rejection of a Regent-approved candidate for deanship in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. While almost 300 students occupied the central administration building for three days in February 1975, the protests were considered milder than those of 1970. Led by a \\"coalition of Black, Chicano, Asian-American, and Native-American student group representatives,\\" they presented six demands calling for representation of the Chicano, Asian American, and Native American communities as well as the reinstatement of the expelled Black nursing student. The occupiers elected to leave voluntarily after receiving word, from University of Michigan President Robben W. Fleming, that discussions/negotiations would take place the following week. Because the protesters were never asked to leave, allowing them freedom to protest, no one was arrested or received any penalty. While the administration building was being occupied, nearly 500 students from the Graduate Employers Organization (GEO) held rallies in support of the occupiers in the plaza outside of the Administration building. Third protest The 1987 Black Action Movement arose after several incidents, including racist jokes that were broadcast during a show at the student-run radio station WJJX; the response of the university and Ann Arbor police departments to a fight on campus; the university housing's efforts to address racist flyers dispersed on campus; and concerns of the African American faculty over the \\"racial climate on campus\\". In 1970, the University announced the goal of having 10 percent Black students to match that of the Black population of the state of Michigan. Black enrollment fluctuated between 4.9 and 7.7 percent before 1987, when percentage of Black students was 5.4. The University's Vice President for Student Services stated that too few high-school graduates from large cities were academically qualified for admission. Additionally, the University provided the Black Student Union with an independent annual budget, created a position to monitor minority affairs at the University, and created an advisory committee including \\"representatives from Black faculty, student and administrators' organizations and members of the community\\" to monitor the progress made by the University. Black Action Movement in the 21st century In 2013 members of the University of Michigan's Black Student Union revived the Black Action Movement. The revival was prompted specifically by a Theta Xi fraternity party, whose invitation described the party as \\"World Star Hip Hop presents: Hood Ratchet Thursday\\". Outrage over the party's racist theme and complaints led to the cancellation of the party. It also fueled student to want to bring attention to the decreasing numbers in black student enrollment at the University as well as awareness of the treatment of those students. On Tuesday November 19, 2013, UofM's Black Student Union started the Twitter hashtag #BBUM, (Being Black at the University of Michigan), encouraging students to share their stories about the treatment of blacks at the predominantly white school. They had over 1,000 student responses. Despite black people making up only 4.1% of the freshman class at the time, the hashtag and stories garnered national attention. On January 20, 2014, leaders of the Black Student Union at the University of Michigan held a rally during which they delivered the seven demands that they had for the University. The Black Student Union treasurer told the crowd that what brought him there was \\"the unfinished business of the first three fights of the Black Action Movements.\\" The problems fought for remain unsolved 44 years after the initial protest began. Included in the Black Student Union demands were a new Trotter Multicultural Center in a more accessible location on Central Campus, better representation on campus for blacks, and more affordable housing options. The University President at the time, Mary Sue Coleman, responded to the demands by coming up with her own three-pronged approach, addressing some but not all of the demands raised. On April 22, 2014, the Supreme court upheld the Michigan law banning affirmative action. With the shrinking percentages of black enrollment in Michigan University's' this ruling was seen by the University of Michigan Black Student Union and students across the state as a hindrance toward their goal of increasing Black enrollment. In 2014, 32% of Blacks living in Michigan were living in poverty. Statistically people living in poverty are less likely to attend university. Attending university helps set people up with better jobs and is believed to result in a general betterment of life. It was thought that impact could be made on the large numbers of black poverty by giving a slight advantage to blacks, helping to change black communities as a whole. After the Supreme Court decision, the Black Student Union again met with some of the heads of University of Michigan in order to generate a plan to increase black student enrollment and outreach. The problem of low Black enrollment continues to be the hardest issue to solve. The 2016 Freshman class profile showed that Blacks made up only 5% of the class, half of what the percentage the BAM fought for in the late 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Despite many years, negotiations and actions taken, racism against Black students at the University of Michigan still occurs. On September 26, 2016 posters were found around the school with anti-black messages. Following a week of protests, racist and homophobic posters were again found around the university campus. As a result, University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel, along with fellow students and faculty in October, 2016 generated a new Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Plan, which aims to outline steps toward creating a more diverse and inclusive campus. However, in February 2017 racist emails were sent by a hacker to all students in the School of Engineering. They included vulgar racist language and phrases such as \\"Heil Trump\\". This incident and the lack of response from administrators prompted the student organization Students4Justice (S4J) to occupy the Michigan Union until administrators met their demands, which included meeting with students, improving the bias incident reporting protocol, fulfilling the remaining demands of the #BBUM movement, such as affordable campus housing and increasing Black enrollment to 10%, and creating an activist space on campus for students of color to organize for social justice modeled after an earlier building discontinued by the university called the Ella Baker - Nelson Mandela Center for Anti-Racist Education. The University of Michigan administration responded to the demands of S4J with a 35-page report and has agreed to hold private meetings with leaders of the group to negotiate further on the demands.

Graftio's house in Volkhov. Genrikh Osipovich Graftio (, 26 December 1869 in D√ºnaburg ‚Äì 30 April 1949 in Leningrad) was a Russian/Soviet engineer credited as a pioneer of the hydroelectric station construction, as one of the founders of the GOELRO plan, and notable for the construction of the first hydroelectric stations in the Soviet Union, the Volkhov Hydroelectric Station in Volkhov and the Lower Svir Hydroelectric Station in Svirstroy. Genrikh Graftio graduated from the Imperial Novorossiya University in Odessa in 1892 and the Peterburg Institute of Transport Engineers in 1896, where he was teaching since 1907. In 1921, he was appointed a professor at this university. Between 1896 and 1900 he was intern in Europe and USA, studying the power equipment. In 1900, Graftio created the first project of the electrified railway in Russia, which was never realized. In 1906, he was charged with developing an electric tram network in Saint Petersburg, then the capital of the Russian Empire, which was opened in 1907. Since 1905, he was involved in project design of hydroelectric stations. In 1905, he designed a project of a power plant on the Vuoksi River (never realized), and in 1910‚Äì1911 Graftio designed the power plant on the Volkhov River, which was only realized in 1927. Between 1918 and 1920 Graftio was the first deputy of the chief construction engineer of the Volkhov Hydroelectric Station, the first hydroelectric station to be built according to the plan. In February 1920, Graftio was included into the committee charged to draft the GOELRO plan, the program to provide sufficient electric power needed for future industrialization of Soviet Russia and, eventually, the Soviet Union. In the committee, he was responsible for the sections dealing with transportation and with the electrification of the Caucasus areas. The plan was drafted in December 1920. Since early 1921, he was the chief construction engineer until the construction was completed in 1927. On 21 March 1921 he was arrested on the charges of counterrevolutionary activity, but was freed after several months due to intervention of Gleb Krzhizhanovsky, who needed Graftio to continue working on the construction. After 1927, he was the chief engineer of the construction of the Svir Hydroelectric Station, opened in 1933. Between 1938 and 1945 Graftio was the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Energy, tasked with the power plant construction. In particular, he was responsible for the program of the restoration of the stations destroyed during World War II. He died in 1949 in Leningrad. Besides Russian, Graftio was fluent in English, French, German, Italian and Swedish. In 1932, he was elected a member of the USSR Academy of Sciences.

It was developed by Swedish programmer Nicklas Nygren and released in late 2012, with the PlayStation platforms PS3 and Vita seeing the first launch. The game offers two playable characters, nonlinear gameplay, multiple endings, and a large number of side-quests and secrets.  Gameplay  Knytt Underground's gameplay fuses the mechanics of Nifflas' earlier games. From Knytt it borrows the freedom to climb vertical walls as well as being able to safely fall from any height (barring hazards like lava and acid, but unlike Knytt water is not hazardous). From Within a Deep Forest it incorporates the ability to transform into a bouncing ball. However, there is only one ball \\"material\\" and different abilities must be gained by flowers that bestow temporary power-ups which are only usable in Sprite form, a new feature introduced in Underground. There are no hostile characters or antagonists in the story except for robots that follow a preset behavior and are confined to the room they spawn in. The player may interact with various NPCs and receive quests from them. Some characters may become traveling companions and influence certain events. The player also has an inventory system for items which are used for trading, completing tasks or gaining access to certain areas. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic future where the surface has been rendered uninhabitable. Humans no longer exist and the surviving creatures all live underground, although remnants of human technology are commonplace. There are different factions within the subterranean world such as the mystical Myriadists and a group called the Internet dedicated to salvaging human artifacts. The main world is divided into 47 rooms across by 29 rooms down, for a total of at least 1,363 rooms. However, there are many secret areas that exist off the in- game map, leading to over 1,800 total locations in all. Each region of the world has a distinct visual theme and some areas are analogous to the levels in Within a Deep Forest. Shortcuts for quickly traveling across large distances can be found via an alternative dimension called \\"the Disorder\\".  Plot  The player controls Mi Sprocket, a \\"sprite\\" who sets out to make a wish at the Fairy Springs, but due to her inability to speak, she is misunderstood by everyone and unwillingly recruited into a mission to save the world. Two of the fairies decide to accompany her; Cilia the Moon Fairy and Dora the Sun Fairy. They provide the majority of the dialogue within the game and each has her individual temperament, often in contrast to each other. Mi has to choose which fairy to send to speak on her behalf when initiating conversations with NPCs, and they can influence which quests the player is able to take and may even affect the outcome of those quests. Mi's primary goal involves ringing the Six Bells of Fate, a task which falls upon a member of the Sprocket family every six hundred years and is required by prophecy to prevent the destruction of the world. There are numerous side quests as well and most may be completed in multiple ways, awarding the player with different achievements and endings. Underground often breaks the fourth wall, with the developer himself making appearances as an NPC and various characters making remarks on common video-game clich√©s, including the apparent pointlessness of the main quest.  Development  In July 2012, Nifflas announced that he was working on Knytt Underground, and that it is his biggest game yet. It was released on the PlayStation Network for PlayStation 3 and PS Vita in late December 2012, and the console versions include extra content.\\"Knytt Happens: Knytt Underground Rolls to PS3, PS Vita Today ‚Äì PlayStation.Blog\\".

After learning that Jack's family planned to bury their son in a Victor Cruz jersey, Cruz called the family and wrote \\"RIP Jack Pinto\\" and \\"Jack Pinto my hero\\" on his shoes during the December 16 game against the Atlanta Falcons. He later travelled to Newtown and visited with the Pinto family.Victor Cruz: Meeting Jack Pinto family was 'toughest' The Sandy Hook Elementary Choir was invited to sing \\"America the Beautiful\\" with Jennifer Hudson at the pre-game ceremonies at Super Bowl XLVII on February 3, 2013.

On February 2, 2013, 150 children from Sandy Hook Elementary School, their families and teachers were invited by the New York Knicks to attend their game against the Sacramento Kings. Former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords traveled to Newtown and met with the families of the victims of the shooting on January 4, 2013. The Boston Bruins hockey team scheduled a series of events in the town on February 18, 2013. They presented a street hockey clinic, a clinic with the high school's hockey team and will hold an autograph session with children as well as a meeting with first responders who will be given autographed and framed hockey jerseys. NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Michael Waltrip traveled to Newtown to meet with the victims' families and the community. In the 2013 Daytona 500, he drove the #26 car for Swan Racing honoring the 26 victims, with a decal providing a number viewers could text donations to. Songs with lyrical references to guns, bullets, and/or premature death were removed from some U.S. radio stations, including \\"Die Young\\" by Kesha, \\"Titanium\\" by David Guetta, and \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" by Foster The People. On Opening Day April 1, 2013 at Yankee Stadium, the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox honored Newtown, Connecticut. The ceremonies featured a pre-game joint honor guards of police and firefighters from Newtown and a moment of silence as the Sandy Hook victims' names appeared on the video board. Players from both teams wore a ribbon on their uniforms. That same ribbon was to be painted on the field in front of both dugouts. Bud Selig, the Commissioner of Baseball, requested that all the other major league teams also wear the ribbon. The other New York team, the Mets, also paid tribute to the victims by wearing commemorative patches on their uniforms.  Gun control  The President and others observe a moment of silence in the Oval Office on December 21, 2012 The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting prompted renewed debate about gun control in the United States, including proposals for making the background-check system universal, and for new federal and state legislation banning the sale and manufacture of certain types of semi-automatic firearms and magazines with more than ten rounds of ammunition. Within hours of the shooting, a We the People petition was started asking the White House to \\"immediately address the issue of gun control through the introduction of legislation in Congress,\\" and the gun control advocacy group the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence reported that an avalanche of donations in the hours after the shooting caused its website to crash. Five days later, President Obama announced that he would make gun control a \\"central issue\\" of his second term, and he created a gun violence task force, to be headed by Vice President Joe Biden. On January 16, 2013, Obama signed 23 executive orders and proposed 12 congressional actions regarding gun control. His proposals included universal background checks on firearms purchases, an assault weapons ban, and limiting magazine capacity to 10 cartridges. On December 21, 2012, the National Rifle Association's Wayne LaPierre said gun-free school zones attract killers and that another gun ban would not protect Americans. He called on Congress to appropriate funds to hire armed police officers for every American school and announced that the NRA would create the National School Shield Emergency Response Program to help. After LaPierre's press conference, the Brady Campaign asked for donations to support its gun control advocacy and asked NRA members \\"who believe like we do, that we are better than this\\" to join its campaign. On January 8, 2013, former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot and injured in a 2011 shooting in Tucson, launched Americans for Responsible Solutions to raise money for gun control efforts to counter the influence of powerful pro-gun groups such as the NRA. On January 16, 2013, New York became the first U.S. state to act after the shooting when it enacted the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement (SAFE) Act. On April 4, 2013, Connecticut and Maryland both enacted new restrictions to their existing gun laws. Ten other states had passed laws that relaxed gun restrictions. Legislation introduced in the first session of 113th Congress included the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 (AWB 2013) and the Manchin-Toomey Amendment to expand background checks on gun purchases. Both were defeated in the Senate on April 17, 2013.  Violent video games  During the investigation into Adam Lanza's background, officials found that Lanza had possessed \\"thousands of dollars' worth of violent video games\\". Though the link between Lanza's video game habits and the shooting was not yet clear from the investigators, the findings reopened debate on the hypothesized connection between violent video games and real-world crime. Senator Jay Rockefeller called for regulation of the video game industry shortly after the shootings. In mid-January 2013, representatives from the video game industry met with Vice President Biden on the subject of violent video games and their regulation. In late January, Representative Jim Matheson reintroduced legislation that he had been attempting to pass that would require stores to post notices about video game ratings and restrict sales of mature and adult games to children. The Entertainment Software Association published a statement offering its condolences to the families and stating \\"The search for meaningful solutions must consider the broad range of actual factors that may have contributed to this tragedy. Any such study needs to include the years of extensive research that has shown no connection between entertainment and real-life violence.\\" The ESA retained professional lobbyist firm Brown Rudnick Government Relations Strategies, run by former Connecticut House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter to represent their interests with the state legislature.Resistance Looms To Newtown Bills; Lobbyists Already Hired  Investor reaction  Private equity fund Cerberus Capital Management, the owner of firearms manufacturer Remington Outdoor Company, the manufacturer of the Bushmaster brand AR-15 style rifle used in the shooting, announced its intention to sell Remington. In 2015, unable to find a buyer for Remington, Cerberus notified investors it would permit them to cash out. In 2018, Cerberus turned over Remington to bankruptcy court in Delaware. Days after the shooting, California State Treasurer Bill Lockyer ordering an accounting of investments in gun manufacturers from California's teacher pension system California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) and public employee pension system California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS). On January 9, 2013, the Teachers' Retirement Board Investment Committee directed staff to \\"begin the process of divestment from firearm companies that manufacture weapons that are illegal in California.\\" In 2013, CalSTRS divested from Sturm Ruger and the American Outdoor Brands Corporation (formerly Smith & Wesson). CalSTRS divested from Remington; completion of the divestment from Remington was delayed until 2015 due to contractual obligations regarding CalSTRS's investment in a private equity pool managed by Cerberus.

As a boy, his mother taught him to play the guitar and the piano, and he sang in the children‚Äôs choir of the Orthodox Cathedral in Riga. In Salzburg, he enrolled in the Mozarteum, and graduated from gymnasium. He served as assistant to the choir conductor of the Orthodox Archbishop‚Äôs Church in Salzburg, and played Viennese music, jazz, and Gypsy music in various bands. In 1952, Mickiewicz and his family emigrated to the United States. Yale education and the Yale Russian Chorus Denis Mickiewicz playing his guitar and leading the Yale Russian Chorus in song in a park at Yalta (USSR) on the Black Sea in 1958 Mickiewicz enrolled in the Yale School of Music in 1953, earning a B.A. in Music at Yale University in 1957. He then entered the graduate program in Slavic Languages and Literatures at Yale, receiving an M.A. and then a Ph.D. from Yale. While still an undergraduate at Yale, he and George Litton of the Yale Russian Club, founded the Yale Russian Chorus, which began as a small group of Russian language students. Over time the Chorus developed a broad repertoire of folk, liturgical, and classical music arranged or transcribed by Mickiewicz. In 1958, with members of the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, they performed a concert version of Mikhail Glinka‚Äôs opera A Life for the Tsar.http://www.yrcalums.org/history.html By 1963, the group had performed all over the United States, as well as in Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Spain; highlights were performances at Salle Pleyel in Paris, at Carnegie Hall in New York, and at Wigmore Hall in London.. In 1962, the Chorus won first prize at the Radiodiffusion Fran√ßaise Festival International de Chant Choral at Lille. Shortly afterwards, Philips Records invited Mickiewicz and the Chorus to record their repertoire in Paris.http://www.yrcalums.org/discography.html Mickiewicz marked out an original, culturally bold role for the Russian Chorus. The Soviet Union was hostile to much of the Russian cultural past, including liturgical and pre- Revolutionary songs. To help preserve and revive that culture, Mickiewicz and the Chorus went to the Soviet Union several times, first in 1958, to present their Russian and American repertoire directly to Russian citizens. Singing in squares and on streets, they were hailed as effective cultural ambassadors at a time of serious political tensions.http://www.yrcalums.org/Humph_all.pdf Professional career Denis Mickiewicz conducting the Alumni of the Yale Russian Chorus in a concert at Duke University in October 2005 Mickiewicz taught Russian and Comparative literature at Connecticut College, Michigan State University, Emory University and finally Duke University, acting as Chairman of his department at both Emory and Duke. He maintained his musical activities, co-founding the Lansing Opera Company in Michigan, and steadfastly retained his links with the Alumni of the Yale Russian Chorus, returning regularly to lead alumni concerts, including the 25th Anniversary concert in Carnegie Hall in 1978, the 50th Anniversary concert in Woolsey Hall at Yale University in 2003,http://www.yrcalums.org/2003_Wall_St_Journal.pdf the 60th Anniversary concert in Woolsey Hall at Yale University in 2013, as well as concerts in Duke Chapel at Duke University in 2005 and 2009. While publishing research on modernist poetics,http://www.v-ivanov.it/wp- content/uploads/2010/12/mickiewicz_viacheslav_ivanovs_apollini_1992_text.pdf Mickiewicz also returned to composing music. His Duo for Clarinet and Piano was premiered in Atlanta in 1989, and he wrote the choral and incidental music for a production of Euripides‚Äô Hecuba presented at Emory University. His setting of The Lord‚Äôs Prayer was premiered and recorded by the Chamber Choir of Washington University in St. Louis in 2000. In 2003, on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary Concert of the Yale Russian Chorus in Woolsey Hall at Yale, Mickiewicz was awarded the Yale Music School's Cultural Leadership Citation for his extraordinary service to Yale and the international music community.http://m.today.duke.edu/2004/04/mickiewicz_0404.html In 2004, he was presented with the Russian Federation's Medal \\"In Commemoration of the 300th Anniversary of St. Petersburg\\" at the Russian Embassy in Washington DC for his contribution in the field of American-Russian cultural relations, particularly for teaching, performing and presenting Russian music.

Career Until joining the Silvernagle rink in 2018, Hunkin skipped or threw last stones one of the top teams in Alberta. Since forming her rink in 2008, she has won four WCT events: the 2010 Meyers Norris Penny Charity Classic, the 2011 Boundary Ford Curling Classic, the 2012 Iron Trail Motors Shoot-Out and the 2013 Avonair Cash Spiel. Her team were also runners up at the 2010 Red Deer Curling Classic, the 2013 Shamrock Shotgun and the Boundary Ford Curling Classic. Hunkin played in her first Grand Slam event at the 2011 Players' Championship where her team won just one game, failing to qualify for the playoffs. The next season, she played in two Grand Slam events. At the 2011 Curlers Corner Autumn Gold Curling Classic she won just won match before being eliminated and at the 2011 Manitoba Lotteries Women's Curling Classic her team failed to win a single game. The next season, Team Hunkin did much better at the 2012 Curlers Corner Autumn Gold Curling Classic where they won four matches, before being eliminated in a qualifier game against Laura Crocker. At the 2012 Manitoba Lotteries Women's Curling Classic the team won three games before being eliminated and at the 2012 The Masters Grand Slam of Curling she won just one game. Provincially, Hunkin has played in two provincial championships. At the 2011 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts she and her team were eliminated after winning two matches. The 2012 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts was much more successful for the team. They won the A qualifier, by winning four straight games, and then they won their first page playoff match up against Heather Nedohin. However, Nedohin won her semi-final and faced off against Hunkin in the provincial final, and prevailed, beating her 8-5 and going on to win the national championship and a bronze medal at the world championships. At the following season's provincial Tournament of Hearts, her rink would be eliminated from contention after a 3-3 record. In 2013, Tiffany Steuber joined the team as skip, but threw third stones. The team began the 2013-14 Grand Slam season by being eliminated after losing their first three games at the 2013 Curlers Corner Autumn Gold Curling Classic. At the 2014 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the team won four games, but were eliminated in the C event. In 2014, Hunkin formed a new team with Crystal Webster skipping and throwing third stones. They played in two slams, the 2014 Curlers Corner Autumn Gold Curling Classic, where they won two games and the 2014 Colonial Square Ladies Classic, where they won three games, failing to make the playoffs in either event. At the 2015 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts, they would make it as far as the C2 qualifier final before being eliminated. In 2015, Hunkin formed yet another new team, this time with her returning to skipping. While her rink didn't play in any slams, they did play in the 2016 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts. There, Hunkin led to her team into the playoffs, where she lost in the semifinal to Chelsea Carey. That same year, Hunkin and Brock Virtue won the Alberta Mixed Doubles Championship, and played in the 2016 Canadian Mixed Doubles Curling Trials. There, the pair went 3-4 in pool play, missing the playoffs. Hunkin wouldn't return to the Alberta Scotties until 2018. Her team would go through the event without a single win. After that season, Hunkin joined the Robyn Silvernagle Saskatchewan-based rink as the team's second. The team had a strong start to the season, winning the 2018 Red Deer Curling Classic and Saskatchewan Women's Curling Tour events in Humboldt and Saskatoon. With the 2019 Canadian Open being held in North Battleford, the Silvernagle rink qualified for the event as the sponsor's exemption. The team qualified for the playoffs with a 3‚Äì1 record in the triple knockout format, before losing to Silvana Tirinzoni in the quarter-final. The Silvernagle rink won the 2019 Saskatchewan Scotties Tournament of Hearts with a steal in the final end against Sherry Anderson. Representing Saskatchewan at the 2019 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the rink went 8‚Äì3 in the round robin and championship pools, before eventually losing the semi-final to Ontario and winning the bronze medal. The team had semi-final and quarterfinal finishes at the 2019 Players' Championship and the 2019 Champions Cup respectively. Team Silvernagle missed the playoffs in the first two Slams of the 2019‚Äì20 season, the Masters and the Tour Challenge. She also competed in her first Canada Cup where her team finished with a 1‚Äì5 record. They defended their provincial title at the 2020 Saskatchewan Scotties Tournament of Hearts when they once again bested Sherry Anderson in the final. At the 2020 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, Team Silvernagle led Saskatchewan to a 6‚Äì5 record, finishing in fifth. It would be the team's last event of the season as both the Players' Championship and the Champions Cup Grand Slam events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 11, 2020, the team announced that Lawton would be stepping back from competitive curling and Thevenot would be leaving the team. Five days later, Silvernagle and Hunkin announced that Kristen Streifel and Dayna Demers would be joining them for the following season.

In 1893, this statue was installed in the centre of the square. It was designed by Joseph-Arthur Vincent and was unveiled in 1893. It stands tall and was made of cast iron. In the 1990s, the Cartier statue was replaced with a replica because the original had deteriorated due to exposure.

Chinchaga Firestorm, p. 8 was a forest fire that burned in northern British Columbia and Alberta in the summer and early fall of 1950. With a final size of between and , it is the single largest recorded fire in North American history. The authorities allowed the fire to burn freely, following local forest management policy considering the lack of settlements in the region. The Chinchaga fire produced large amounts of smoke, creating the ‚Äú1950 Great Smoke Pall‚Äù, observed across eastern North America and Europe. As the existence of the massive fire was not well-publicized, and the smoke was mostly in the upper atmosphere and could not be smelled, there was much speculation about the atmospheric haze and its provenance. The Chinchaga firestorm‚Äôs ‚Äúhistoric smoke pall‚Äù caused ‚Äúobservations of blue suns and moons in the United States and Europe‚Äù. It was the biggest firestorm documented in North America, and created the world's largest smoke layer in the atmosphere.\\"  Background and cause  Chinchaga River The region has a mix of black spruce, lodgepole pine and deciduous forests, giving way to muskeg in lower areas. Few people lived in the area in 1950. Sources vary as to the origin of the fire but agree that it was caused by human activity. One version faults an Imperial Oil surveying crew with starting a small blaze to protect their horses from biting insects. Another posits that slash burning from agricultural clearing could have been the initial spark. The blaze started on 1 June 1950 and continued to burn throughout the summer and early fall until the end of October. The ignition point was north of Fort St. John, British Columbia, and the fire burned north-eastwards nearly to Keg River, Alberta.  The burn  The path and extent of the burn was influenced by weather patterns. It burned in a fan-shaped pattern along a roughly SW/NE axis, starting in the Rose Prairie area.Tymstra, Chinchage Firestorm, p. 139 The fire alternated between \\"runs\\" of rapid spread and high intensity, interspersed with periods of low activity. A series of high pressure systems over the summer allowed a buildup of heat and dry air, reducing the moisture levels in the forest fuels. The breakdowns of these systems produced the high northeasterly winds that drove the \\"runs\\". There were five \\"runs\\" in total, with the final expansion in September 1950 causing the most destruction and amounting to one-third of the total burned area. It finally was put out by cooler weather and rain in late October, as it approached Keg River in the Whispering River area (hence one of its names \\"Whisp Fire\\"). Most of the burned area was on the Alberta side of the inter-provincial border, with only burned on the British Columbia side. Size estimates vary due to its remoteness from population centres and the imprecise measurement techniques of the time period. Estimates at the time ranged from . In 2008 and 2009, researchers with Natural Resources Canada and the University of Victoria conducted airborne surveys of several boreal forest fires, including the Chinchaga. Using polarimetric analysis, they arrived at a final estimate of that was considerably larger than previous estimates, placing the total burned area at . While most likely not the largest fire ever in North America, maybe not even in the North American boreal forest, the burnt area it produced is the largest ever known. No known deaths occurred as a result of the fire. In terms of damage, the dollar value of the Chinchaga fire is difficult to estimate. Although sparsely inhabited, the area was a productive trapping area for First Nations and M√©tis. The timber of the Chinchaga River watershed had not been surveyed and was undervalued by the Alberta provincial government, which placed the fire's cost at one million dollars. Cordy Tymstra, an Alberta forestry department fire historian, said it is a \\"value that reflects how little officials appreciated the wealth of the land.\\" Fromm et al. (2005) argued that the Chinchaga firestorm may have been an iteration of an explosive troposphere-to-stratosphere transport (TST), \\"a dynamic combination of extreme boreal forest fire and convection [...]\\"  Response  No fire suppression efforts were directed at the fire. Fire crews were spread thin because of numerous blazes in B.C., the Yukon Territory and Alberta. At the time, the Alberta forestry department's policy was to respond only to fires within 16 kilometres (10 miles)Tymstra, Chinchaga Firestorm, p. 9 of settlements and major roads. A request by the fire ranger at Keg River to fight the fire with a ground crew was denied by provincial fire managers. According to Tymstra, the Chinchaga fire changed the way Alberta responded to forest fires. Local residents, such as Frank Jackson, the husband of legendary pioneer doctor Mary Percy Jackson, did what they could but the fire only stalled with the coming of autumn precipitation.Tymstra, Chinchaga Firestorm, pp. 34‚Äì38 \\"The Great Smoke Pall\\" The Chinchaga fire produced large amounts of smoke, creating the \\"1950 Great Smoke Pall\\", observed across eastern North America and Europe. The giant smoke release from the conflagration in late September 1950 was first recorded at Ennadai Lake, in what is now Nunavut, on 24 September. The smoke was on a northeastern path, but hit an atmospheric trough and headed southward towards Ontario and the American eastern seaboard. The province of Ontario experienced heavy smoke conditions that caused pitch darkness.Tymstra, Chinchaga Firestorm, pp. 47‚Äì48 The towns of Sarnia and Guelph experienced three-hour midday periods of darkness, and city of Toronto streetlights turned on by themselves, and drivers resorted to automobile headlights during daytime hours. In Toronto, power consumption increased by 200,000 kWh during the smoke event. This caused power failures which in turn set off bank alarms ‚Äì responding police cars, sirens pealing, added to the tension of the day.Tymstra, Chinchaga Firestorm, p. 47 Aircraft were grounded, and an aerial search for a downed United States military plane was delayed by the smoke. Animals also felt the effects; cows required milking at different times, and birds were seen bedding down midday. Beneficially, the smoke blanket held off a killing frost that was expected in southern Ontario, saving the orchards. Most of the smoke in eastern North America was borne aloft by climatic conditions to high altitudes. As many observers could not smell it, and the news of the massive Chinchaga fire was sparse, affected people drew other conclusions about its source. Explanations included nuclear armageddon, local fires, secret U.S. military experiments,Tymstra, Chinchaga Firestorm, pp. 44, 46 U.S. atomic blast, supernatural forces, a solar eclipse and alien invasion. The heavy haze moved on to the Atlantic seaboard of the United States. New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Washington D.C., Virginia and Florida all reported effects from the fire, especially on September 24, so called \\"Black Sunday\\".Tymstra, Chinchaga Firestorm, pp. 44, 48 As in Ontario, streetlights turned on during the daytime, and animals showed abnormal behaviour. American meteorologist Harry Wexler followed the smoke plume closely, collecting data from a wide area of the U.S. He noted that the plume split in two during the event, with one southern plume getting caught in a stagnant anticyclonic pattern that extended the hazy period. Wexler observed lower temperatures as result of sunlight absorption by the smoke; he estimated a 4 ¬∞C (6 ¬∞F) drop in the Washington, D.C., area. The northern smoke plume traveled over the Atlantic by way of Newfoundland and Greenland. On 27 September 1950, the plume was observed over Scotland, with reports over England following soon after. France, the Netherlands, Portugal and Denmark also observed the plume. Reports by pilots put the haze over Europe at or more in altitude, higher than observed in North America. In early October, a smoke observation was made on the Aleutian Islands, suggesting that the Chinchaga haze had possibly circled the entire globe.

He opposed the dictatorship of General Primo de Rivera. In 1987 he was honoured posthumously by King Juan Carlos who restored to him the rank of Lieutenant general. Career Riquelme spent most of his military career in Africa, during the Rif War. In 1921 he was Colonel and Chief of the Indigenous Police. After the Battle of Annual, he was involved in a confrontation with General Sanjurjo over the Expediente Picasso. In 1924 he participated in the Battle of T√©touan. In 1929 he was a member of the military court that tried Jos√© S√°nchez Guerra for the artillery revolt at Ciudad Real. The acquittal of the Conservative politician caused Riquelme to be overlooked for further appointments. The chief minister and Minister of War, Alejandro Lerroux submitted Decree of 15 February 1935 for the signature of the President of the Republic, appointing Riquelme as chief of the Second Organic Division, based in the city of Seville. He served as commander in chief of the First Military Region from the early days of the General Franco uprising and, at the end of the war, occupied the post of Commander General of the interior zone of the eastern region (Catalonia). As General of the Infantry Brigade he remained faithful to the Republican government from the early days of the Spanish Civil War. He was appointed head of the Organic Division I, occupying the vacant position that existed after the failed coup of July 18. He commanded the forces that attacked Toledo and later fought in the Battle of Guadarrama. However, in early September his forces suffered heavy defeats in Oropesa and Talavera de la Reina that caused processing. Discharged in 1938, he returned to service as military commander for Barcelona. Exile and death From 1939, after the fall of Catalonia, L√≥pez-Bago was exiled to France until his death in Paris in 1972. His remains are interred in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.

The books follow various time periods and revolve around the Assassins at war with the Knights Templar. Renaissance The first novel of this collection, Renaissance, was published on November 20, 2009. The novel features Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a man who seeks revenge for the murder of his family. Ezio begins to train himself as an assassin and becomes drawn into a war between the Assassin's Brotherhood and the Templar Order. The two secret organizations have been combating each other for centuries to secure an ancient technology, called the \\"Apple of Eden\\", a relic which can control human minds. Both groups also seek a vault in Italy, which contains the knowledge and technology of an ancient, technologically superior civilization. Brotherhood Brotherhood‚Äîthe second novel in the series, was released in 2010. It's a novelized version of the popular game Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. Just like its previous book, Assassin's Creed: Renaissance, it does not contain any of the game's present-day events including Desmond, only a reference to a \\"phantom\\" by Ezio. The story takes place four years after the video game's story (1499), in 1503. Ezio Auditore struggles to free the city of Rome from the tyranny of Cesare Borgia, who seeks to take over Italy. The Secret Crusade The Secret Crusade's story follows Alta√Ør, as told by Niccolo Polo. It details the life of Alta√Ør, an Assassin; beginning with the death of his father. Alta√Ør watches his father's execution; which was carried out for causing the unintended death of a noble. Some time later, he also watches one of his father's fellow Assassins kill himself out of guilt over the death of Alta√Ør's father. The book then progresses to many years later where an older Alta√Ør, with his wife Maria and their son Darim, are returning to Masyaf Alta√Ør's home after successfully assassinating Genghis Khan. In their absence, Abbas proclaimed himself \\"Master of the Assassins\\" and took over Masyaf, ruling with tyranny. Alta√Ør is met with cold indifference. He discovers that despite being told that his son Sef had traveled to Alamut, his son was actually murdered by Malik. Malik has been imprisoned but claims innocence. Alta√Ør breaks him out of jail planning to confront Abbas and reclaim his place as Master Assassin. These plans are thwarted when Abbas has Malik killed and frames Alta√Ør for his death. Out of anger, Alta√Ør uses the Apple of Eden to kill the man responsible for Sef's death but also inadvertently causes Maria's death. Devastated, Alta√Ør flees Masyaf. Years later a merchant named Muhklis is saved from desert bandits by Alta√Ør, now an old man in his seventies. Muhklis takes an injured Alta√Ør back to his home in Masyaf and agrees to help him reclaim his place. They hope to take back Masyaf with as little bloodshed as possible. They are joined by a few young men who are aligned against Abbas and are training in the traditional ways of the Assassins, which have been ignored during Abbas' reign. They, along with the people of Masyaf, storm the castle fighting through Abbas' men but only killing if absolutely necessary. Alta√Ør faces Abbas for the last time, killing him with his pistol. With the death of their leader, Abbas' men lay down their arms and Alta√Ør is proclaimed the leader of the Assassins. The final chapter shows that Ezio Auditore da Firenze (Da Firenze means from Firenze/Florence) is the narrator and he is on a boat arriving in Constantinople, in the second sequence of events in Revelations. The Secret Crusade was released in June 2011. Revelations Revelations once again follows Ezio Auditore as he leaves his life behind in search of the truth about the Assassin Order and \\"those who came before\\". The resulting journey leads him to Constantinople where a growing army of Byzantine Templars threatens the region. Ezio goes through many obstacles then decides to give up his life as an Assassin to save Desmond. This book was released on 24 November 2011 in the United Kingdom and on 29 November 2011 in the United States. Forsaken Set in 1735, Forsaken is Haytham Kenway's (Edward Kenway's son) personal journal and tracks his life, from his early childhood in England, through his rise up the Templar ranks. Unlike Revelations, it is written in the first person and follows Haytham Kenway only. Forsaken was released on 4 December 2012. Black Flag Black Flag follows the journal of Edward Kenway, the father of Haytham Kenway and grandfather of Connor Kenway. Edward Kenway is a young privateer who sets out to become the world's deadliest pirate, only to be drawn into the centuries- old war between the Assassins and the Templars. Black Flag was released on 26 November 2013 and is based on the video game Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. Unity Assassin's Creed Unity follows Elise and Arno's side of the video game Assassin's Creed Unity that takes place during the French Revolution. The book is based on this installment and was released in November 2014.  Underworld  Assassin's Creed Underworld follows Henry Green and Detective Abberline 6 years before the events of Syndicate, eventually ending with the game's final missions in Evie's perspective.  Desert Oath  Assassin's Creed Origins: Desert Oath follows Bayek, a young boy who lives in Siwa in ancient Egypt. The events take place before the events of the game Assassin's Creed Origins. It was published on October 10, 2017.  Odyssey  Assassin‚Äôs Creed Odyssey (The Official Novelization) tells one possible story path of Assassin's Creed Odyssey featuring Kassandra, one of the two protagonists in the game.

Plot Jon, a man who hates women, brings a woman back to his apartment after a night out. He pours wine for them, but drugs Jeanie's and she passes out. He wraps her in a plastic tarp and places duct tape over her mouth and proceeds to stab her to death with a screw driver. He dismembers her body, keeping her hand in a jar as a memento. Jon is working as a barista when Delia comes in, flirts with him, and he imagines attacking her and quickly decides to make her his next victim. Jon goes out that evening and a prostitute offers him a \\"date\\", which he accepts and then strangles her. Delia works as an escort, and has taken out an ad online on Craigslist. Delia comes back into the coffee shop and they flirt more. She asks him to take her out, and they go to a bar. Delia tells him she just moved to town and her parents are dead. She is trying to save money so that she can bring her little sister, Lydia, to live with her. He tells her he is a neat freak. At the end of the night, they are in front of the building Jon lives in. She wants to come up to his place, but he makes lame excuses why he cannot. Delia gets his phone number and leaves. Jon calls an escort to come over, and he hits her with a hammer, killing her. Back at the coffee shop, Jon anxiously watches for Delia to come in and is disappointed when she does not and goes to her apartment. He invites her to go to the movies with him. At the coffee shop again, Jon asks Delia to come behind the counter and they make prank calls. She remembers she has an appointment with a client at a hotel. Jon is visibly upset that she left, goes home and clears out the jars of body parts and paints the walls. Delia goes to an appointment with a career counselor who offers her a job as an elevator operator. She walks by the coffee shop and sees that Jon is not there. She calls Lydia and leaves a voicemail telling her to get some things together and that she is going to go get her. Jon calls and says he wanted to surprise her by cooking her dinner since he feels bad about standing her up the night before. She is about to tell him she cannot go, but changes her mind. At Jon's place, Delia excitedly tells him about her new job, and she accidentally spills wine onto the carpet. He looks at her enraged, but laughs about it and they begin to make out and then go to his bedroom to have sex. While she is waiting for Delia to pick her up, Lydia's stepfather has figured out her plan to run away and tells her he won't let her go and he rapes her. The next morning, Jon makes Delia breakfast in bed, but she says she has to leave. Jon is insulted when he tells her what they did was special to him, and it was not to her. After she leaves, Jon continues to call her on the phone, but she doesn't answer. Delia arrives at the house to get Lydia, and finds her body in the bathtub and sees that she has committed suicide. Jon goes out to a bar that evening and gets drunk. A girl hits on him, thinking he is a professional baseball player for The Mets and he takes her home with him. He strangles her to death as they have sex on the couch. Delia walks in and not being sure what she saw, Jon grabs her and covers her mouth. He lets her go and she asks why he has not killed her yet. She helps him clean up the mess and they throw the body into a river. They make a plan to kill Delia's stepfather. They wait for his train to come in and they strangle him, but they see he his still alive and stab him to death with a broken bottle.

His work has been exhibited widely in North America, South America, and Europe. Biography Spang is an enrolled member of the Tsitsistas/Suhtai (Northern Cheyenne) Nation in southeastern Montana and was born at the Crow-Northern Cheyenne Indian Hospital on the Crow Reservation located in Crow Agency, Montana in 1960.Bently Spang Spang grew up both on and off the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, living in places such as Sitka, Alaska and Portland, Oregon The artist. He graduated from Montana State University Billings and earned a Master of Fine Arts degree at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He taught at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 2007 to 2009 as a full-time Visiting Faculty Member in Video. The University of Wyoming's American Indian Study Program named Spang its \\"Eminent Artist in Residence\\" for the spring semester of 2014. During this time he taught a class on Native American art and held exhibitions at the university's art museum. Spang now works as an independent artist and has a studio in Billings, Montana. Art works Spang's early work included mixed media sculptures, often made out of metal, and installations. His later work focused on incorporating digital technologies such as film and photography. Spang drew inspiration for his work in mixed media from how his Cheyenne ancestors incorporated European materials into their artwork; he has stated, \\"There was this fearlessness about mediums that we don't really have today.\\" Spang considers his art autobiographical, addressing his cultural identity as a Cheyenne living in a modern society and bridging the gap between these two worlds. Spang often adds humor to his works to help present these themes to his audience. For example, in his sculpture Pevah (meaning \\"good\\" in Cheyenne), Spang used stone and wood to signify the Cheyenne part of him, and he used aluminum to signify the contemporary world. In constructing the project, he explained, \\"The metal binds the stone, the wood binds them both. I am bound by my culture; we are still here after all.\\" Another one of Spang's sculptures is inspired by the Cheyenne tradition of adorning the fringe of war shirts with the hairs from the warrior's community. The fringe on Spang's War Shirt #1 is likewise composed of the photographic negatives of people he knows to show that he draws his strength from the community. Spang collaborated with techno DJ Bert Benally to create the Techno Pow Wow, a mix of rave dance culture with into a traditional pow wow. This piece was inspired by the 1990s electronic music movement. Spang claimed that the energy and effortless dancing reminded him of the pow wows at the reservation. Spang performed as part of this piece as \\"The Blue Guy\\", the tribal chief figure of the future. Through the installation's mix of cultural music and dance, Spang hoped to showcase the similarities between Native American and modern culture. In his New American Relics: Redux 2 (2009), Spang satirized museums and anthropologists' depiction of indigenous America as a \\"lost culture\\" using irony. He designed a futuristic museum exhibit for the \\"vit-heut\\" (meaning \\"white man\\" in Northern Cheyenne) with \\"artifacts\\" molded from the plastic encasings of ordinary modern objects. From February to March 2014, Spang presented his \\"Bently Spang: On Fire\\" exhibition at the University of Wyoming Art Museum, which told the story of the 2012 Ash Creek wildfire. In July 2017, Spang presented the video installation \\"War Shirt #6 ‚Äì Waterways\\" as part of his Modern Warrior Series, at the Dry Creek Schoolhouse in Belgrade, Montana. The installation was a series of moving images within a steel war shirt conveying Spang's relationship with water. Awards and recognition In 2003, Spang won an Outstanding Alumni Award from MSU Billings for \\"Exceptional Contribution\\" and a Woodrow Wilson Foundation: Imagining America grant. The next year, he was awarded a Paul G. Allen Family Foundation Grant for his residency in conjunction with the Techno Powwow Project. Spang has also gained artist fellowships from the Creative Capital Foundation and the Joan Mitchell Foundation. He was one of the eight artists who received the 2017 Artist's Innovation Award from the Montana Arts Council.

Florbetapir, like Pittsburgh compound B (PiB), binds to beta-amyloid, however fluorine-18 has a half-life of 109.75 minutes, in contrast to PiB's radioactive half life of 20 minutes. Wong et al. found that the longer life allowed the tracer to accumulate significantly more in the brains of people with AD, particularly in the regions known to be associated with beta-amyloid deposits. One review predicted that amyloid imaging is likely to be used in conjunction with other markers rather than as an alternative.  Development  Since the disease was first described by Alois Alzheimer in 1906, the only certain way to determine if a person indeed had the disease was to perform a biopsy on the patient's brain to find distinctive spots on the brain that show the buildup of amyloid plaque. Doctors must diagnose the disease in patients with memory loss and dementia based on symptoms, and as many as 20% of patients diagnosed with the disease are found after examination of the brain following death not to have had the condition. Other diagnostic tools, such as analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, magnetic resonance imaging scans looking for brain shrinkage and PET scans looking at how glucose was used in the brain, had all been unreliable.Kolata, Gina. \\"Promise Seen for Detection of Alzheimer‚Äôs\\", The New York Times, June 23, 2010. Accessed June 23, 2010.Staff. \\"Avid Radiopharmaceuticals Initiates First Phase II Trial Of Novel Compound For Imaging Alzheimer's Disease\\", Medical News Today, June 11, 2008. Accessed June 23, 2010. The development of florbetapir built on research done by William Klunk and Chester Mathis who had developed a substance they called Pittsburgh compound B as a means of detecting amyloid plaque, after analyzing 400 prospective compounds and developing 300 variations of the substance that they had discovered might work. In 2002, a study performed in Sweden on Alzheimer's patients was able to detect the plaque in PET brain scans. Later studies on a control group member without the disease did not find plaque, confirming the reliability of the compound in diagnosis. While the tool worked, Pittsburgh compound B relies on the use of carbon-11, a radioactive isotope with a half-life of 20 minutes that requires the immediate use of the material prepared in a cyclotron. Avid Radiopharmaceuticals was established by Dr. Daniel Skovronsky in July 2005 with the goal of finding a dye that could be injected into the body, would cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and attach itself to amyloid protein deposits in the brain.Staff. \\"Phila. start-up developing a way to test for Alzheimer's, Avid Radiopharmaceuticals has raised $26 million in new venture financing. Seeking a test for Alzheimer's\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, May 9, 2007. Accessed June 23, 2010. Avid raised $500,000 from BioAdvance, a medically- oriented venture capital firm in Pennsylvania, as seed funding toward the development of a biological marker.Staff. \\"Avid Radiopharmaceuticals Selected to Receive Seed Funding from BioAdvance; Funds to Be Used to Develop Molecular Imaging Tools for Alzheimer's Disease.\\", Business Wire, January 5, 2005. Accessed June 23, 2010. Once they found a candidate dye, they attached the positron-emitting fluorine-18, a radioactive isotope with a half-life over five times longer (109.75 minutes), used in PET scans, and that can last for as long as a day when prepared in the morning by cyclotron. The dye had been developed and patented by the University of Pennsylvania and was licensed by Avid. Initial tests in 2007 on a patient at Johns Hopkins University Hospital previously diagnosed with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease detected plaque in a PET scan in areas where it was typically found in the brain. Further tests found that the scans detected plaque in patients with Alzheimer's, didn't find it in those without the diagnosis and found intermediate amounts in patients with early signs of dementia. The tests found amyloid plaque in 20% of its test patients over age 60 that had been in the normal range, but had performed worse than a control group on tests of mental acuity. Validation by autopsy In order to confirm if the dye was accurate in detecting Alzheimer's, an advisory committee at the Food and Drug Administration demanded that the team of Avid, Bayer and General Electric perform a study to test their method. Avid established a study with a group of 35 hospice patients, some that had been diagnosed with dementia and others that had no memory problems. The participants and their families agreed that they would undergo the PET scans and would have their brains autopsied after their death by pathologists. After the study was conducted, Avid received confirmation in May 2010 that the results of the test were successful in distinguishing between those with Alzheimer's and those without the disease. In results presented in July 2010, the company showed that for 34 out of the 35 hospice patients who had been scanned, the initial scan results were confirmed when pathologists counted plaque under a microscope and when a computerized scan of the plaque was performed on material from the autopsied brain.Kolata, Gina. \\"New Scan May Spot Alzheimer‚Äôs\\", The New York Times, July 12, 2010. Accessed July 14, 2010. The findings required review by the FDA to confirm their reliability as a means of diagnosing the disease. Once confirmed, the technique provided a means to reliably diagnose and monitor the progress of Alzheimer's and allowed potential pharmaceutical treatments to be evaluated. In a study published in January 2011 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Avid reported on the results of further studies conducted based on 152 test subjects who had agreed to receive the company's PET scans and to have their brains analyzed after death for definitive determination of the presence of amyloid plaques. Of the patients included in the study, 29 who died had autopsies performed on their brains and in all but one the brain autopsy results matched the diagnosis based on the PET scan taken before death. Avid's technique is being used to test the efficacy of Alzheimer's disease treatments being developed by other pharmaceutical firms as a means of determining the ability of the drugs to reduce the buildup of amyloid protein in the brains of living subjects.Kolata, Gina. \\"Two Tests Could Aid in Risk Assessment and Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer‚Äôs\\", The New York Times, January 18, 2011. Accessed January 19, 2011.  Approval by FDA  On January 20, 2011, an FDA advisory committee unanimously recommended that Avid's PET scan technique be approved for use. The advisory committee included a qualification requiring Avid to develop clear guidelines establishing when the tests had spotted enough of the amyloid plaque to make a diagnosis of Alzheimer's, a task that Avid CEO Daniel M. Skovronsky stated could be resolved in several months.Kolata, Gina. \\"F.D.A. Sees Promise in Alzheimer‚Äôs Imaging Drug\\", The New York Times, January 20, 2011. Accessed January 20, 2011.

He reached Calcutta via Madras on 20 January 1897. Then Vivekananda travelled extensively and visited many Indian states. On 19 June (1897) he reached Almora. The lectures delivered by him in this period were compiled into the book Lectures from Colombo to Almora. The book contains reports of his 17 lectures.  Background  In 1893 Swami Vivekananda went to the United States to join the Parliament of the World's Religions where he got overwhelming success and public attention. For next four years, from 1893 to 1897, he travelled through various cities of the United States and England, and gave a series of lectures on religion and Vedanta. He came back to India in 1897 via Colombo. Vivekananda reached Colombo on 15 January 1897 where the natives warmly welcomed him. Vivekananda mentioned this welcome in a letter written to Mary Hale on 30 January 1897: > Things are turning out most curiously for me. From Colombo in Ceylon, where > I landed, to Ramnad, the nearly southernmost point of the Indian continent > where I am just now as the guest of the Raja of Ramnad, my journey has been > a huge procession ‚Äî crowds of people, illuminations, addresses, etc., etc. A > monument forty feet high is being built on the spot where I landed.

On 16 January 1897 he gave a lecture titled \\"Indian, the sacred land.\\" After staying at Colombo for four days he reached Calcutta on 20 January via Madras. Between 1897 and 1899 Vivekananda travelled extensively and visited the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Kashmir. On 6 May 1897 Vivekananda started his journey to Almora and on 19 June he reached there. He delivered 17 lectures in different places in this period which were compiled into the book Lectures from Colombo to Almora.  Lecture locations  Lectures at the following locations are included in the book‚Äî # Almora # Anuradhapura # Calcutta # Colombo # Jaffna # Kandy # Kumbhakonam # Madras # Madura # Manamadura # Mayavaram # Pamben # Paramakudi # Ramesvarem # Ramnad # Tanjore # Trichinopoly # Vavoniya  Publication  The book was first published by The Vyjayanti Press, Egmore, Madras in 1897 under the title From Colombo to Almora. The introductory note of the book was written by Henrietta Muller, a friend and disciple of Vivekananda.  Inspiration  These lectures have been subject of scholarly studies and source of inspiration for many people.

He was a member of the extended Strozzi family,Kanter and Palladino, 228 a wealthy and noble clan that rivaled the Medici family. After he was orphaned at age 15, Strozzi went to live with the artist Battista di Biagio Sanguigni, described in documents as his \\"tutor\\" but more probably also his teacher in the art of painting and illumination. Sometime between 1427 and 1430 the pair moved to Fiesole, about five miles from Florence. Strozzi is not recorded as joining the Florentine painters' guild the Arte dei Medici e degli Speziali, thereby precluding him from contracting paintings (as opposed to illuminations) under his own name in Florence. His commissions must thus have been received on behalf of other artists, like Sanguigni or Fra Angelico, who according to Vasari was another of Strozzi's teachers.Vasari, 126 Strozzi and Sanguigni would have both met Angelico in the 1430s at the convent of San Domenico, Fiesole, Angelico's base until 1436. In 1438 Strozzi married and moved into a new house in the same parish in Fiesole. Before that he was sharing a house with Sanguigni.Gordon, 422 When Fra Angelico moved to Rome in 1446, Strozzi moved to Florence, where he rented a house in the parish of San Paolo, near Santa Maria Novella. In 1450 he bought a house in another parish.Kanter and Palladino, 229 On his death in 1468 he was buried in Santa Maria Novella, Florence. Works Brooklyn Museum - Virgin and Child with Four Angels and the Redeemer - Zanobi Strozzi The Procession of the Magi, between ca. 1445 and 1450 (Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg, France) Panel paintings Strozzi's only \\"signed\\" painting is an Annunciation for the church of San Salvatore al Monte, Florence (c. 1440-45), now in the National Gallery in London. The painting's signature is semi-hidden in the decorated gold border to the Virgin's dress, where can be seen \\"Z\\" (reversed), followed by \\"A\\", then after a gap filled with ornament, \\"NOBI\\". An altarpiece of unknown provenance, now split between several museums, has been attributed to Strozzi. The main panel of this work was the Virgin and Child at the Hermitage Museum. The side panels, of which there were two, comprised the Saints Nicholas, Lawrence, and John the Baptist, now at the Hyde Collection, Glens Falls, New York, at the left, and the Saints Zenobius, Francis, and Anthony of Padua at the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, on the right. The continuation of the floor and the figures' draperies across all three panels proves that they originally belonged together as a single altarpiece.Kanter and Palladino, 242-245, with a reconstruction illustrated at 244; Christiansen (quoted) A Nativity at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and Adoration of the Magi in the National Gallery in London might have also belonged to this altarpiece as parts of its predella.Kanter and Palladino, 242-245 Around 1460, Strozzi painted an altarpiece for the convent of San Girolamo in Fiesole (Mus√©e du Petit Palais, Avignon). This commission was awarded by the Medici, whose newly constructed villa in Fiesole was located a short distance from the convent. convent was located a short distance from the convent. Several paintings by Strozzi described in archival documents are now lost. Between 1434 to 1439 he painted a panel for the choir screen of the church of Sant'Egidio, Florence, perhaps identifiable with the Madonna and Child with Four Angels today at the Museum of San Marco in Florence. He also painted a painted crucifix for San Marco, recorded in 1448. Vasari mentions a double portrait of Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici (d. 1429), founder of the Medici family fortune, and his ally, Bartolommeo di Taldo Valori. In Vasari's day the portrait was in the bedroom of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. A large Last Judgement by Strozzi for the convent of San Benedetto Porta a Pinti, Florence, was one of many paintings that disappeared from the Berlin State Museums in World War II. A smaller version of the subject is in a private collection.Kanter and Palladino, 246-248 Of his six Virgin and Child panels, five use the popular Madonna of Humility type, in which the Virgin sits low on the ground on a cushion instead of a throne. The earliest of these, in the Royal Collection, gave rise to the artist's old notname, the Master of the Buckingham Palace Madonna.Kanter and Palladino, 260-261, 264 Strozzi's sixthVirgin and Child composition, now at the Brooklyn Museum, instead shows the Virgin enthroned between four angels. A few small-scale narrative paintings by Strozzi appear to have been independent works for domestic interiors. These include a Nativity at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, an Annunciation at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and a God the Father Enthroned with Two Angels at the Mus√©e Jacquemart-Andr√©, Paris. Illuminations As an illuminator, Strozzi was responsible with Filippo di Matteo Torelli for several choir books for the church of San Marco. These were carried out between 1446 and 1454 on the commission of Cosimo de' Medici. In 1463 he collaborated with Francesco di Antonio del Chierico on a choir-book for the Cathedral of Florence, now at the Laurentian Library (Nos. 149, 150, 151). The collaboration with Francesco took eleven years and eventually involved other workshops, including those of Cosimo Rosselli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Attavante Attavanti and the Master of the Hamilton Xenophon.Garzelli Strozzi also collaborated with Francesco Pesellino and Domenico di Michelino. A set of nine grisaille designs in pen, wash and gouache, now housed in several museums, are probably designs for a goldsmith to follow in the sections of a reliquary or similar object.Kanter and Palladino, 251-256 Notes References *Christiansen, Keith, Met \\"catalogue\\" entry, on Nativity Scene's web page, 2012 *Garzelli, Annarosa (31 March 2000), \\"Francesco di Antonio del Chierico\\" in Grove, Oxford Art Online. *Gordon, Dillian, National Gallery Catalogues (new series): The Fifteenth Century Italian Paintings, Volume 1, 2003, * Kanter, Laurence, and Pia Palladino, with contributions by Magnolia Scudieri, Carl Brandon Strehlke, Victor M.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on December 23, 2012, and is written by Tom Devanney and directed by Julius Wu. The episode was postponed one week due to sensitive content in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that took place two days before it was originally scheduled to air. Plot As the Griffins prepare for Christmas by decorating their tree, Meg finds an ornament of the manger and Peter tells the story of Christmas. Joseph (played by Peter) and his friend Robby (played by Brian) spot Mary (played by Lois) in their village. Joseph introduces himself to her. They have many dates, but Joseph is annoyed by Mary's reluctance to have sex. Mary claims that she is destined for something special. Later, Mary tells Joseph that she has been visited by an angel (played by Bruce) who told her that God has blessed her with his child. Joseph accepts this. Taking a break from the story, Peter and the family call their Aunt Helen to wish her a merry Christmas. The call does not go well and Peter returns to the story. On the way to Bethlehem on a mule (played by Meg), Joseph is skeptical about the baby. Elsewhere, three wise men (played by Glenn Quagmire, Cleveland Brown, and Joe Swanson) are inspired to travel to Bethlehem themselves. They stop at the palace of King Herod (played by Carter Pewterschmidt) for water and talk of their plans to see the Messiah. Herod decides to protect his title and win the love of Jodie Foster (a reference to John Hinckley, Jr.) by killing the child. Mary and Joseph arrive at an inn, but the manager (played by Mort Goldman) denies them a room. Mary goes into labor, and the manager offers them space in a stable. Mary ponders what to call the new child. The angel takes her list of possible names to God, who is inspired to name the child \\"Jesus\\" after something the angel said. The wise men, who are following a light in the sky, argue about the nature of the light; they think it might be an airplane. A doctor tells them of an earlier messiah who was not successful. The wise men arrive with their gifts as the savior is born. A drummer boy (played by Chris) joins them. King Herod arrives with his army and demands the child. Jesus (played by Stewie) transforms the manger into a fighter plane and destroys Herod's troops with it. After Peter finishes his story, a pregnant couple arrives at the door. They explain that their car broke down and they need help, but Peter, thinking that they're faking, gives them the cold shoulder and threatens to call the police. When they press their request for help, Peter goes to get his baseball bat. Reception The episode received a 2.9 rating and was watched by a total of 5.49 million people, this made it the second most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating American Dad! and a repeat of The Simpsons but losing to another repeat of The Simpsons with 5.54 million. The episode was met with mixed reviews from critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C, saying \\"Family Guy never has that feeling of curiosity. It‚Äôs far too often bitter, malicious, and condescending to anyone it deems foolish enough to believe in something bigger. But other times‚Äîand ‚ÄúJesus, Mary, and Joseph!‚Äù unfortunately falls into this category‚Äîit‚Äôs so toothless and scattered that it can barely muster the old venomous attitude toward religion.\\" Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic gave the episode three and a half stars out of five, saying \\"I was wondering if there was anything in particular that would cause this episode to be delayed a week after the Sandy Hook tragedy, and perhaps it was the fact that King Herod‚Äôs forces were trying to kill a baby that did it, though little else seemed particularly offensive. However, there were a lot of pauses and general delay tactics that might have served as ways to edit out other potentially-insensitive content. But otherwise, it just seems like it was just pushed back because Fox didn‚Äôt want to air something crass right after such a tragedy. Probably a good idea.\\" References  External links  * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Family Guy (season 11) episodes Category:Christmas television episodes Category:Portrayals of Jesus on television ","title":"Jesus, Mary and Joseph!"},{"id":"37972415","text":"Mehmet Sakƒ±p √ñzberk (born 1 May 1945, in Gaziantep), is a Turkish former footballer and manager.

Picatic's crowd-funding platform for event ticket sales allowed promoters to create event pages to generate funding before events are booked. Picatic is known for creating ticketing and registration solutions specifically within the events industry. Jayesh Parmar founded Picatic in 2008. The company has offices in Toronto, Saskatoon, San Francisco, and New York City. In August 2018, Picatic was acquired by Eventbrite, a global ticketing and event technology company based in San Francisco. History Jayesh Parmar is the CEO and co-founder of Picatic. Founded in 2008, the company started as a traditional online ticketing company. The first website was launched in 2009. Online ticketing services are a foundation of the company. Picatic allows events and venues to create, promote, and sell tickets for a variety of events. In September 2012, Picatic launched their event crowdfunding feature, which has since been discontinued. Picatic currently serves American, Canadian, European, Australian, United Kingdom, Swedish, Swiss and Danish markets. The company plans to expand services to Brazil, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway and Singapore markets in 2018. By August 2018, Jayesh Parmar announced in a press release that Picatic was acquired by Eventbrite. Products Picatic offers two primary services. The company provides online ticket sales. Picatic charges vendors a commission on for-profit tickets. The company does not charge for free tickets. Picatic's API provides developers with the framework to build registration and ticketing into their own apps. Additionally, Picatic offers tools to supplement event planning. These include an app to monitor inventory or attendance lists from mobile devices, widgets to embed on company or individual webpages, online guest surveys, and others. Picatic also provides back-end management tools which allow planners to manage all aspects of an event from one location. Event planners are able to receive daily or weekly sales reports, manage tickets and refunds, email guests through the Picatic website, and provide updates. The company has been called ‚Äúthe Kickstarter of events‚Äù in the past, though now focuses entirely on its ticketing platform having removed its crowdfunding feature in 2015. Recognition Picatic unwittingly provided the punch line for an Internet sensation in 2012. Lisa Dutton, an anchorwoman for a local news show in Saskatoon, mispronounced the company name during a broadcast. Dutton told viewers that tickets for a sausage-eating contest could be purchased at ‚Äúpicadick‚Äù. This video went viral. Picatic reported a large spike in Internet traffic to the website following this event. In 2012, Extreme Startups selected Picatic as one of five start-ups to receive funding and support. As part of this cohort, Picatic receives seed money, mentorship and administrative and legal support for one year.

Idris is widely considered to represent the moderate elements of Syria's armed opposition, as armed opposition leaders under his leadership have subscribed to the pro-democracy Proclamation of Principles. Military activities Idris was elected as the Chief of Staff of the Supreme Military Council following its establishment in a conference held in Turkey on 15 December 2012. At the conference, over 550 members of the Syrian revolutionary council, brigades, and battalion commands elected 261 representatives to form the Revolutionary Force Authority. Thirty members were elected to form the SMC, which includes five combat Fronts covering Syria's 14 provinces. In December 2013, Idris was initially reportedly driven out of his headquarters in northern Syria by the Islamic Front into exile in Doha, Qatar, but U.S. officials later said he was in Turkey throughout the incursion. However, the FSA has denied that Idris has left Syria. A few days later, Syrian National Coalition (SNC) Chief of Staff Monzer Akbik said that Idris \\"has failed to make an institution, I don't think everything can continue in the same way.\\" Idris was removed from his position as Chief-of-Staff of the FSA's Supreme Military Council in an announcement on 16 February 2014. He was replaced with Brigadier General Abdul-Ilah al-Bashir. Political activities Idris has become increasingly engaged with soliciting aid from Western nations since his initial request of specialized training and non-lethal material support from the United States in February 2013. On 30 April 2013 the United States began deliveries of ready-to-eat rations and Warrior Aid and Litter Kits (WALK) to the Free Syrian Army under the oversight of Idris, in what was the first U.S. delivery of tangible aid to Syria's armed opposition. In May 2013, U.S. Senator John McCain crossed into Syria from Turkey to meet with Idris. Idris has issued letters and statements to Secretary of State John Kerry, President Barack Obama, and the United Nations Security Council to encourage international intervention and support in the ongoing Syrian Civil War. In an 8 June 2013 interview with the New York Times, Idris outlined that continued international support for the Free Syrian Army, including \\"game- changing weapons,\\" were required as a precondition for his attendance at planned negotiations with Bashar al-Assad in Geneva. In 2019 Idris was appointed to the post of Minister of Defence of the Syrian Interim Government and was thus appointed as commander-in-chief of the Syrian National Army. As such, he led the SNA into the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, alongside the Turkish Armed Forces. Idris stated that Turkey-backed Syrian rebels \\"stand in full force in support of our Turkish brothers in fighting all forms of terrorism represented by the PKK gangs.\\" References Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Syrian generals Category:Defectors to the Free Syrian Army Category:People from Homs Governorate ","title":"Salim Idris"},{"id":"37972711","text":"Ibrahim Hani Bisharat (; born February 22, 1984 in Amman) is a Jordanian equestrian rider.

It is beside the modern jail of the city. The mosque consists of a high valuated platform, a mosque with a 'dochala' annex on the north upon the western half of the platform and a 'baoli' (stepped well) to the east of the platform. Unlike the three-domed mosques at Lalbagh Fort and the Khan Mohammad Mridha Mosque, it is roofed by five bulbous domes resting on octagonal drums. The whole mosque was once reconstructed by the Jamider of Dhaka, Mirza Golam Pir. In accordance with Murshid Quli Khan's wishes, he was buried under the entrance to this mosque.  History  Kartalab Khan was appointed as Diwan (revenue administrator) of Bengal by Emperor Aurangazeb, when Azim-ush-Shan was Viceroy. His original name was Murshid Quli Khan but he earned the title of Kartalab Khan from Emperor Aurangazwb for his efficiency in Revenue Administration. After coming to Bengal he erected a mosque at Dhaka, known after his name. Murshid Khuli Khan transferred the headquarters of the revenue administration from Dhaka to Mukshusabad, later renamed Murshidabad in the year A.D. 1704 when a tussle started with the Subedar. Old image of Begum Bazar Mosque The mosque is undoubtedly one of the most impressive Mughal structures of Dhaka, having been built on a high platform called 'tahkhana'. Underneath the platform there is a series of rectangular rooms that are let out to shopkeepers. A kitchen market was built to meet the expenses of the mosque. In 1777, the control of the market was taken over by Begum daughter of the then Naib-e-Nazim Sharfaraz Khan. The name of the locality ‚ÄòBegumbazar‚Äô and the masjid originate from her name. The 'Baoli', the only known example of its kind in Bengal, is considered to be of North Indian or Deccan origin, the latter possibility being more likely since its builder had been in Deccen before coming to Dhaka.  Architectural value  The mosque proper and the do-chala annex occupy the western half of the vaulted terrace. The remaining part of the terrace was originally kept open but is now covered with a masonry verandah. The mosque proper, inclusive of its corner towers, measures 28.65√ó8.23 m and is entered from the east through five arched doorways ‚Äî each opens out under a half-dome and is flanked by slender octagonal turrets which rise above the parapets. There is one doorway in the middle of each of the north and south walls. The western wall is internally recessed with five semi-octagonal mihrabs, all showing outward projections with bordering turrets. There is a three-stepped masonry pulpit beside the central mihrab. Plan view of Begum Bazar Mosque The interior of the mosque, forming a large elongated hall (25.60m by 5.18m), is divided into five bays by four transverse arches of plain four-centred design. The central bay is square and bigger than a couple of smaller rectangular ones on either side. All the bays are covered with domes on octagonal drums and crowned with lotus and kalasa finials. The device adopted for the support of the domes is the same as in the Lalbagh Fort mosque and the Satgumbad Mosque. The four octagonal corner towers, all rising above the horizontal parapets and having kalasa bases, are topped by renovated solid kiosks with cupolas and crowned with lotus and kalasa finials. Each of these towers is flanked to right and left by a slender turret, which rises above the parapet and ends in a small cupola and kalasa finial. Interior view of the mosque The rectangular annex of the mosque in the north is covered with a Bengali type of do-chala hut roof, the eaves of which have pronounced curves and are drooping. The annex (6.10√ó2.13 m) has two doorways ‚Äî one in the centre of the east wall, now renovated, and the other in the middle of the south side. It is through this latter opening that the annex and the mosque are interconnected. A window has been put in recently in the northern wall of the annex. Internally the four walls of the room are marked with rectangular and square deep niches, perhaps devised originally as shelves. The curved ridge is exterior crowned with five kalasa finials at intervals. This annex was thought to be a tomb, but probably it was originally meant for the Imam's accommodation since it is still used for that purpose. Decoration on east side In decorating the building greater emphasis was given to architectural elements, such as flanking ornamental turrets of the doorway and mihrab projections, kiosks, cupolas, and lotus and kalasa finials. The doorways and the mihrabs are framed, with crowning rows of merlons. The parapets and octagonal drums are also enriched with merlon motifs. The inside of the domes have basal leaf ornamentation, while there are large medallions containing a rosette motif in the centre. The half-domed vault of the central archway is ornamented with muqarnas work in stucco, now in a crude form. Save these, the building is covered with plain plaster, a distinguishing feature of Mughal architecture in Bengal. The 'baoli' of this mosque, which appears to be a monument by itself, deserves special mention. It is the only one of its kind in Bengal. As stated by Dani,Dani, A. H. (1961).

Historical mention of Ji dates to the founding of the Zhou dynasty in about 1045. Archaeological finds in southwestern Beijing where Ji was believed to be located date to the Spring and Autumn period (771‚Äì476). The city of Ji served as the capital of the ancient states of Ji and Yan until the unification of China by the Qin dynasty in 221. Thereafter, the city was a prefectural capital for Youzhou through the Han dynasty, Three Kingdoms, Western Jin dynasty, Sixteen Kingdoms, Northern Dynasties, and Sui dynasty. With the creation of a Jizhou during the Tang dynasty in what is now Tianjin Municipality, the city of Ji took on the name Youzhou. Youzhou was one of the Sixteen Prefectures ceded to the Khitans during the Five Dynasties. The city then became the southern capital of the Liao dynasty and then main capital of the Jin dynasty (1115‚Äì1234). In the 13th century, Kublai Khan built a new capital city for the Yuan dynasty adjacent to Ji to the north. The old city of Ji became a suburb to Dadu. In the Ming dynasty, the old and new cities were merged by Beijing's Ming-era city wall. Pre-Imperial history  Ji, marked on the map of the Warring States period, as the capital of the State of Yan. The city-state of Ji was inhabited by the tribe of the Yellow Emperor in the Shang dynasty, and became one of the founding vassal states of the Zhou dynasty. According to Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian, King Wu of Zhou, in the 11th year of his reign, deposed King Zhou of Shang and conferred titles to nobles within his domain, including the rulers of the city states Ji and Yan. According to the Book of Rites, King Wu of Zhou was so eager to establish his legitimacy after his battle victory over the Shang that before dismounting from his chariot, he named the descendants of the Yellow Emperor to the State of Ji.„ÄäÁ§ºËÆ∞‚Ä¢‰πêËÆ∞„Äã The 11th year of the reign of King Wu of Zhou approximates to 1145. The Beijing Municipal Government designates 1045 as the first year of the city's history.(Chinese) ËìüÂüéÁ∫™ÂøµÊü± At some time in the late Western Zhou dynasty or the early Eastern Zhou dynasty, the neighboring State of Yan conquered Ji and made the city its capital. The Yan state eventually became one of the seven powers of the Warring States period (476‚Äì221). The rulers of the Yan built several capitals and moved their seat of power in response to threats from the nomadic tribes from the north and neighboring kingdoms from the south. Ji was referred to historians as Shangdu (‰∏äÈÉΩ) or the \\"Upper Capital.\\" Other Yan capitals include: (1) the Liulihe Site in southern Fangshan District of Beijing, which served as the Yan capital prior to Yan‚Äôs conquest of Ji, (2) Linyi (‰∏¥Êòì) in present-day Rongcheng and Xiong Counties of Hebei Province to which the seat of Yan moved in 690s,(Chinese) \\"Ëµ∞ËøõÁáïÂõΩ >> ÁáïÈÉΩÈÅóËøπ >> ÊòìÈÉΩ‚ÄîÂÆπÂüéÂçóÈò≥ÈÅóÂùÄ„ÄÅÈõÑÂéøÂè§Ë¥§ÊùëÈÅóÂùÄ\\" Accessed 2012-12-13 (3) the ancient city of Doudian in Liangxiang of Fangshan District, known as Zhongdu (‰∏≠ÈÉΩ), or the \\"Middle Capital\\"(Chinese) \\"Ëµ∞ËøõÁáïÂõΩ >> ÁáïÈÉΩÈÅóËøπ >> ‰∏≠ÈÉΩ‚Äî‚ÄîÁ™¶Â∫óÂè§Âüé\\" Accessed 2012-12-13 and (4) Xiadu (‰∏ãÈÉΩ) or the \\"Lower Capital\\", a larger settlement south of Linyi, in modern-day Yi County, Hebei Province, that was built in the 300s.(Chinese) \\"Ëµ∞ËøõÁáïÂõΩ >> ÁáïÈÉΩÈÅóËøπ >> ‰∏ãÈÉΩ‚ÄîÊ≤≥ÂåóÊòìÂéøÁáï‰∏ãÈÉΩÈÅóÂùÄ\\" Accessed 2012-12-13 By the time, the State of Qin invaded Yan in 226, the capital of Yan was back in Ji.

South and west of Guang‚Äôanmen, archaeologists have unearthed remnants of concentrated human habitation dating back to at least the 400s. In 1956, during the construction of the Yongding River viaduct, 151 ancient wells dating to the Spring and Autumn, Warring States and Han dynasty were discovered. In 1957, a rammed earth platform was found south of Guang‚Äôanmen along with tiles used for palace construction. Since then more wells and tiles have been discovered, and the wells are most densely concentrated in south of Xuanwumen and Hepingmen. Archaeologists have yet to discover remnants of city walls from the Zhou dynasty that have been found at the other four capitals. In 1974, excavations around the White Cloud Abbey uncovered remnants of city walls but three tombs from the Eastern Han dynasty found underneath the walls indicate the walls post-date the tombs.(Chinese) \\"Âåó‰∫¨Âª∫Âüé‰πãÂßã-ÁáïËìüÈÅóËøπ\\" 2005-09-01 The fact that the other four capitals were buried beneath farmland and the Guang‚Äôanmen area is a densely populated section of urban Beijing accounts for the greater difficulty of searching for Ji‚Äôs ruins. In 2008, city authorities in Beijing announced that archaeological efforts would accompany urban renewal constructions projects in southern Bejiing to search for more artifacts of Ji in the pre-imperial era.(Chinese) \\"ËÄÉÂè§Â∑•‰ΩúËÄÖÊêúÂØªËìüÂüéÈÅóÂùÄ ÈîÅÂÆöÂåó‰∫¨ÂÆ£ÂçóÂ∑•Âú∞(Âõæ)\\" Âåó‰∫¨ÊôöÊä• 2008-09-19 Early Imperial Era Qin dynasty Qin general Wang Jian conquered Ji in 226 and the First Emperor completed his unification of China in 221. The country was organized into 48 commanderies. Ji was the capital of the Guangyang Commandery. To prevent the Warring States from regaining their power, the First Emperor ordered the walls of the old capitals be destroyed and Ji's walls were torn down in 215 but later rebuilt. The Qin removed defensive barriers dividing the Warring States, including the southern wall of the Yan, which separated the Beijing Plain from the Central Plain, and built a national roadway network. Ji served as the junction for the roads connecting the Central Plain with Mongolia and Manchuria. The First Emperor visited Ji in 215 and, to protect the frontier from the Xiongnu, had the Qin Great Wall built north of Ji and fortified Juyong Pass. The Qin conscripted men from throughout the country to be garrisoned at the forts north of Ji. In 209, a group of conscripts who were delayed in their march to the north by flooding in central China and faced penalty by death, rose in rebellion under the leadership of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang. The rebellion spread to Ji, where Han Guang revived the Yan Kingdom. Han Guang sent his subordinate Zang Tu to help rebel leader Xiang Yu, who succeeded in capturing the Qin capital at Xianyang in 207. Xiang Yu then divided the country into Eighteen Principalities, appointing Zang Tu as the lord of Ji and Han Guang as the lord of nearby Liaodong. Han Guang refused to cede Ji to Zang Tu, who seized the city and killed Han Guang. Zang Tu then sided with Liu Bang, the lord of Sichuan, in the war against Xiang Yu. After Liu Bang prevailed and founded the Han dynasty, Zang Tu was appointed the Prince of Yan, and governed the Principality of Yan from Ji. Han dynasty Statue of man holding shield from an Eastern Han dynasty tomb discovered in the river bed of the Yongding River in Fengtai District to the west of Ji. When the Han court began to purge former supporters of Xiang Yu, Zang Tu became fearful and rebelled. Liu Bang as the Emperor Gaozu personally led a campaign against Zang Tu in Ji. Zang Tu was defeated and killed in 206. Emperor Gaozu appointed his childhood friend Lu Wan as the Prince of Yan. In 195, he became distrustful of Lu Wan and invaded Ji. Lu Wan fled to the Xiongnu in the steppes. To tighten control of the region, the Emperor Gaozu sent his son Liu Jian to Ji as the Prince of Yan. After Liu Jian died in 181, Gaozu's widow, the Empress L√º Zhi controlled the Han court, and made her nephew L√º Tong as the Prince of Yan. When Empress L√º Zhi's regency ended in 179, Liu Ze became the Prince of Yan and his family ruled Ji for three generations. In 117, Emperor Wu of Han appointed his son Liu Dan as the Prince of Yan. Liu Dan held the title for 38 years. In 106, Emperor Wu of Han organized the Western Han dynasty into 13 province-sized prefectures, each administered by a cishi (Âà∫Âè≤) or inspector. The city of Ji was the prefectural seat for Youzhou, which governed roughly the same territory as the State of Yan during the Warring States period.(Chinese) Map of Youzhou during the Western Han Dynasty Accessed 2012-12-19 Youzhou was composed of the Shanggu, Zhuo, Guangyang, Bohai, Yuyang, Right Beiping, Liaoxi, Liaodong, Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies. After Emperor Wu died, Liu Dan conspired with the Empress Gaichang and Sang Hongyang to subvert the throne. When the plot was foiled, Liu Dan was forced to commit suicide in 80 and the Principality of Yan was converted to Guangyang Commandery. In 73, Liu Jian's son, Liu Jian was appointed the Prince of Guangyang and the Guangyang Commandery became the Guangyang Principality. Liu Jian's tomb is now Dabaotai Western Han Dynasty Mausoleum in Fengtai District of Beijing. His grandson Liu Jia was ousted from the principality after Wang Mang's seized the Han throne. During the Wang Mang interregnum, Guangyang Principality became the Guangyou Principality. During the Eastern Han dynasty, Youzhou was as one of 12 prefectures and contained a dozen subordinate commanderies, including the Guangyang Commandery. In 24, Liu Xiu moved Youzhou's prefectural seat from Ji County (in modern-day Tianjin) to the city of Ji. In 96, the city of Ji served as the seat of both the Guangyang Commandery and Youzhou.(Chinese)\\"ÂåóÊñπÂÜõ‰∫ãÈáçÈïá- Ê±âÂîêÁªèÁï•‰∏úÂåóÁöÑÂü∫Âú∞-‰∏úÊ±âÊó∂ÊúüÁöÑÂπΩÂ∑ûËìüÂüé\\" Beijing Municipal Administration of Cultural Heritage 2005-09-01 Near the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, the commander of Fanyang was Liu Yan, better known as the governor of Yizhou Province a few years later.

In the early 4th century, the Western Jin dynasty was overthrown by steppe peoples who had settled in northern China and established in a series of mostly short-lived kingdoms. During the so-called Sixteen Kingdoms period, the city of Ji was successively controlled by the Di-led Former Qin, the Jie-led Later Zhao, the Xianbei-led Former Yan and Later Yan. In 319 AD, Shi Le, the founder of the Later Zhao Kingdom, captured Ji from Duan Pidi, a Xianbei chieftain nominally loyal to the Jin Dynasty. In 349, Ran Min, an ethnic Han general seized control of this kingdom, which he renamed Ran Wei in 350. But before he could capture Ji, the city was taken by the Murong Xianbei, led by Prince Murong Jun who swept down from Manchuria. Murong Jun then defeated Ran Min and extinguished the Ran Wei. In 352, he declared himself emperor and made the city, the capital of the Former Yan Kingdom.(Chinese) \\"Âåó‰∫¨ÂüéÂ∏ÇË°åÊîøÂå∫ÂàíËø∞Áï•\\" „ÄäÂåó‰∫¨Âú∞ÊñπÂøó„Äã Accessed 2012-12-19 Five years later, the Former Yan's capital was moved further south to Ye in southern Hebei.

But after losing the Battle of Feishui in 383, the Former Qin's control crumbled as the Later Yan, Northern Wei and other kingdoms broke away. In 385, the Northern Yan, under Murong Chui and seized Ji from the Former Qin.

Outside of Ji, the Linshuo Palace was built in 609 to accommodate the emperor during his trips and to and from Korea. The brutal reign of Emperor Yang brought rebellions against the Sui dynasty. One of these, led by Dou Jiande rose from Zhuojun and besieged Ji in 620 but was defeated by Luo Yi, a Sui general who joined Li Yuan's insurrection against the Sui. Li Yuan founded the Tang dynasty.

This is covered by a layer of tissue called coenenchyme in which is embedded calcareous sclerites. The sclerites are very varied in form in the Plexauridae, and examination of their morphology is helpful in identifying the different species.

Life and work Ren-Chang Ching was a Chinese botanist and pteridologist who made significant collections of plants from Mongolia to Yunnan. He was born in Wujin, Jiangsu, and studied botany and forestry at the University of Nanjing. On graduating in 1925 he taught at Southeastern University and from 1927 was Head of the Botany Section, Nanjing Museum. Here he switched his focus from trees to pteridophytes, which thereafter became his speciality. At this time, there were no experts on Chinese ferns in China and no single fern specimen was correctly identified in the small herbarium just started in Beijing. Ching started to correspond with pteridologists in the West (H. Christ, C. Christensen, W.R. Maxon and E.B. Copeland), thereby creating a basic library on Asiatic ferns for reference. In addition he started to make extensive collections of ferns, particularly from the provinces south of the Yangtze, but he knew he needed to see the type specimens in western herbaria. Learning western languages so he could access the many Chinese herbarium specimens held in western institutions, Ching visited Europe following the Fifth International Botanical Congress in 1930. In Copenhagen, he consulted the fern expert Carl Christensen, and then worked at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, for more than a year. He again visited Copenhagen in 1932 and then Vienna, Prague and other European herbaria before returning to China later that year, where he joined the Fan Memorial Institute of Biology (later Academia Sinica), Beijing. in 1933, Ching was one those who founded the Chinese Botanical Society, and soon afterwards founded the Lushan Arboretum and Botanical Garden in Jiangsi Province. When the Japanese invaded China in 1937, Ching fled to Kunming (Yunnan Province), where, working at Yunnan University, he helped to found the Lijiang Botanical Station, where he was director until 1945. Ching remained in Yunnan until 1949, when he returned to Beijing to head the Taxonomic Section in the Institute of Botany, Academia Sinica, where his energies were largely focussed on education and forestry. However, his interest in ferns continued for the rest of his life, with him finally publishing more than 140 papers and books on them. Major works were Icones Filicum Sinicarum (1930-1958) and the series Studies of Chinese Ferns. He was also the principal author of the fern treatments in Flora Republicae Popularis Sinicae.

Career A letter from Herschel to William Unwin on June 5, 1888, describing his invention of the Venturi meter while working at the Holyoke Water Power Company The first part of Herschel's career was devoted to bridge design, including the design of cast-iron bridges. For a time, he was employed on the sewerage system of Boston. Herschel was influenced by James B. Francis, who was the agent and engineer of the Proprietors of Locks and Canals on the Merrimack River at Lowell, Massachusetts, to switch his career path to hydraulic engineering. About 1880, he started working for the Holyoke Water Power Company in Massachusetts. He remained with the company until 1889. While he was there, Herschel designed the Holyoke testing flume, which has been said to mark the beginning of the scientific design of water-power wheels. Herschel first tested his Venturi meter concept in 1886 while working for the company, and by 1888 felt he had perfected it conceptually, ultimately naming it in honor of Giovanni Battista Venturi, the eminent Italian physicist who first described the differential pressure phenomenon in a 1797 treatise. The original purpose of the Venturi meter was to measure the amount of water used by the individual water mills in the Holyoke area.#129 Holyoke Water Power System (1859) .

In 1889, Herschel was hired as the manager and superintendent of the East Jersey Water Company, where he worked until 1900. He was responsible for the development of the Pequannock River water supply for Newark. He also installed two of his largest Venturi meters at Little Falls, New Jersey, on the main stem of the Rockaway River to serve Paterson, Clifton and Jersey City.McGuire, Michael J. (2013).

After 1900 and lasting until the end of his life, Herschel was a consulting hydraulic engineer with offices in New York City. He worked on some of the major water development projects in the world. He played a major part in the construction of the hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls, which was the first large-scale electric power plant. He was appointed to an expert committee that reviewed the plans for the first water tunnel that would deliver water from the Catskill reservoirs to New York City.

It is inferred from the empirical study of natural satellites in the Solar System that subsatellites may be elements of planetary systems. In the Solar System, the giant planets have large collections of natural satellites. The majority of detected exoplanets are giant planets; at least one, Kepler-1625b, may have a very large exomoon, named Kepler-1625b I. Nonetheless, no notable \\"moon of a moon\\" or subsatellite is known in the Solar System or beyond, there are of course human launched satelites in temporary Lunar orbit, Minor-planet moons, Rubble piles, Phobos (moon) is thought to be one, rather than true moons of moons. In most cases, the tidal effects of the planet would make such a system unstable. Terminology Terms used in scientific literature for moons of moons include \\"submoons\\" and \\"moon-moons\\". Other terms that have been suggested include moonitos, moonettes, and moooons. Possible natural instances  Rhea  alt= The possible detection of a ring system around Saturn's natural satellite Rhea led to calculations that indicated that satellites orbiting Rhea would have stable orbits. Furthermore, the suspected rings are thought to be narrow, a phenomenon normally associated with shepherd moons. However, targeted images taken by the Cassini spacecraft failed to detect any subsatellites or rings associated with Rhea of a size smaller than a few millimeters. Iapetus It has also been proposed that Saturn's satellite Iapetus possessed a subsatellite in the past; this is one of several hypotheses that have been put forward to account for its unusual equatorial ridge. Artificial subsatellites Many spacecraft have orbited the Moon, including crewed craft of the Apollo program. , none have orbited any other moons. In 1988, the Soviet Union unsuccessfully attempted to put two robotic probes on quasi- orbits around the Martian moon Phobos. The interplanetary spacecraft JUICE currently in development will enter an orbit around Ganymede in 2032, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a moon other than Earth's. In fiction The Elder Scrolls series of video games takes place on the planet of Nirn, orbited by the satellite Masser, which in turn is orbited by the subsatellite Secunda.

Glass is a useful material that has such advantages such as Transparency, Natural Day-lighting, permitting a sky view and Acoustic control, depending on the glazing solution used. Glass is a wholly recyclable material. Glass is beloved by architects as well as designers. Glass can play a role in accomplishing greater indoor environmental quality and when used carefully can improve energy efficiency, however a measured approach needs to be taken to ensure the building loads are not excessively increased due to solar gain. The intent of a green building design is to curtail the demand on non-renewable resources, amplify utilization efficiency of these resources when in use, and augment the reuse, recycling, and consumption of renewable resources. Double glazed glass Architects use high-performance double-glazed glass, which is laminated or coated, to moderate interior temperatures by controlling heat loss and gain. The coating filters the heat-producing aspects of solar rays. The use of such glass in green buildings is used comprehensively in tropical climates as well as the Middle East. Solar control glass ISolar control glass can be an eye- catching characteristic of a building whilst at the same time diminishing, or even eradicating the need for an air-conditioning system, reducing running costs of the building and saving energy.

The real applications were presented in 1998.Serafim Opricovic (1998) ‚ÄúMulticriteria Optimization in Civil Engineering\\" (in Serbian), Faculty of Civil Engineering, Belgrade, 302 p. . The paper in 2004 contributed to the international recognition of the VIKOR method.Serafim Opricovic and Gwo- Hshiung Tzeng (2004) \\"The Compromise solution by MCDM methods: A comparative analysis of VIKOR and TOPSIS\\", European Journal of Operational Research, 156(2), 445‚Äì455. (The most cited paper in the field of Economics, Science Watch, Apr.2009). The MCDM problem is stated as follows: Determine the best (compromise) solution in multicriteria sense from the set of J feasible alternatives A1, A2, ...AJ, evaluated according to the set of n criterion functions. The input data are the elements fij of the performance (decision) matrix, where fij is the value of the i-th criterion function for the alternative Aj. VIKOR method steps The VIKOR procedure has the following steps: Step 1. Determine the best fi* and the worst fi^ values of all criterion functions, i = 1,2,...,n; fi* = max (fij,j=1,...,J), fi^ = min (fij,j=1,...,J), if the i-th function is benefit; fi* = min (fij,j=1,...,J), fi^ = max (fij,j=1,...,J), if the i-th function is cost. Step 2. Compute the values Sj and Rj, j=1,2,...,J, by the relations: Sj=sum[wi(fi* - fij)/(fi*-fi^),i=1,...,n], weighted and normalized Manhattan distance; Rj=max[wi(fi* - fij)/(fi*-fi^),i=1,...,n], weighted and normalized Chebyshev distance; where wi are the weights of criteria, expressing the DM's preference as the relative importance of the criteria. Step 3. Compute the values Qj, j=1,2,...,J, by the relation Qj = v(Sj ‚Äì S*)/(S^ - S*) + (1-v)(Rj-R*)/(R^-R*) where S* = min (Sj, j=1,...,J), S^ = max (Sj, j=1,...,J), R* = min (Rj, j=1,...,J), R^ = max (Rj, j=1,...,J),; and is introduced as a weight for the strategy of maximum group utility, whereas 1-v is the weight of the individual regret. These strategies could be compromised by v = 0.5, and here v is modified as = (n + 1)/ 2n (from v + 0.5(n-1)/n = 1) since the criterion (1 of n) related to R is included in S, too. Step 4. Rank the alternatives, sorting by the values S, R and Q, from the minimum value. The results are three ranking lists. Step 5. Propose as a compromise solution the alternative A(1) which is the best ranked by the measure Q (minimum) if the following two conditions are satisfied: C1. ‚ÄúAcceptable Advantage‚Äù: Q(A(2) ‚Äì Q(A(1)) >= DQ where: A(2) is the alternative with second position in the ranking list by Q; DQ = 1/(J-1). C2. ‚ÄúAcceptable Stability in decision making‚Äù: The alternative A(1) must also be the best ranked by S or/and R. This compromise solution is stable within a decision making process, which could be the strategy of maximum group utility (when v > 0.5 is needed), or ‚Äúby consensus‚Äù v about 0.5, or ‚Äúwith veto‚Äù v < 0.5). If one of the conditions is not satisfied, then a set of compromise solutions is proposed, which consists of: \\\\- Alternatives A(1) and A(2) if only the condition C2 is not satisfied, or \\\\- Alternatives A(1), A(2),..., A(M) if the condition C1 is not satisfied; A(M) is determined by the relation Q(A(M)) ‚Äì Q(A(1)) < DQ for maximum M (the positions of these alternatives are ‚Äúin closeness‚Äù). The obtained compromise solution could be accepted by the decision makers because it provides a maximum utility of the majority (represented by min S), and a minimum individual regret of the opponent (represented by min R). The measures S and R are integrated into Q for compromise solution, the base for an agreement established by mutual concessions. Comparative analysis A comparative analysis of MCDM methods VIKOR, TOPSIS, ELECTRE and PROMETHEE is presented in the paper in 2007, through the discussion of their distinctive features and their application results.Serafim Opricovic and Gwo-Hshiung Tzeng (2007) \\"Extended VIKOR Method in Comparison with Outranking Methods\\", European Journal of Operational Research, Vol. 178, No 2, pp. 514‚Äì529.

The triangular fuzzy numbers are used to handle imprecise numerical quantities. Fuzzy VIKOR is based on the aggregating fuzzy merit that represents distance of an alternative to the ideal solution. The fuzzy operations and procedures for ranking fuzzy numbers are used in developing the fuzzy VIKOR algorithm.

It was one of the first Norwegian furniture manufacturers with a focus on serial production and one of the major participators in Norwegian furniture exports during the 50s and 60s. Production was discontinued in 2011. History Pega-system furniture stand at an international furniture convention in Cologne, 1960. First established in √òystese during the Second World War, the business relocated to the village of Florv√•g on the island Ask√∏y, just north of Bergen, in 1948. The business originally manufactured simple bedroom furniture, like small beds, but during cooperation with Danish designer Ib Juul Christiansen in 1952 the Pega furniture system was developed. This system would become the breakthrough of the company both nationally and internationally, and was based around the concept of being able to combine the various different furniture types in many different ways. Over 50% of production were for exports, mainly to the US and Germany. Exports to the US were handled by the companies Scandialine and ScandiCraft. Due to the massive amounts of production needed for exports, the company moved to new locales slightly north of the area where they first were located. This increased the production are from 500 sq m to 2600 sq m, and opened up the possibility of employing more personnel for the production. The company moved yet again in 1979, this time to Follese on the western side of Ask√∏y. During the 1980s the company started suffering financially due to the market shifting towards larger corporations, making it more difficult for smaller, independent manufacturers to compete. The decline continued during the '90s and parts of the market for exports disappeared. The need for employees was reduced; in 2003 the company had only 12. The financial crisis ruined the last part of the export market, and the board of directors decided to discontinue production in 2011. References : Familien Soltvedts Klassiker, Bergens Tidende.

Pavement dwellers were bludgeoned to death while they slept. All the murders took place at night and were committed by using stones or hard, blunt objects. Early murders Navas had already been convicted twice for murder. In 1996 he was arrested on charges of murdering Rajasekaran at Mundakkal in Kollam and was jailed for four years. He was acquitted because there were no witnesses. In 2007 he was arrested again on charges of murdering one Shamir at Karikode in the city following which he was arrested and convicted. Serial killings A series of brutal murders in the city of Kollam and nearby areas rocked the city in June 2012. Pavement and hutment dwellers were bludgeoned to death while they slept. All the murders took place at night and were committed by using stones or hard, blunt objects. A drug addict, Navas used to sleep by 8 p.m. and wake up at midnight to roam the city, targeting victims. The first murder was committed on 6 June night. The victim, aged about 65 years, was hit on the head with a huge stone whilst he was sleeping under the SP Office flyover which was under construction. The second murder was committed the very next night on the veranda of a shop. The victim, Appukuttan Achary, was bludgeoned in the nape of his neck, fatally damaging the spine. The third murder was on the night of 18 June, also under the SP Office flyover. Bondan Kumar, 65, was hit on the head with a stone. On 3 August, Thankappan, 55, a native of Sasthamcotta, was found dead inside a bus waiting shed. He was sleeping in the shed when Navas attacked. The fifth murder was committed on the night of 21 August at the veranda of the Municipal Building in Chinnakkada. Sudarsanan, 45, was hit on the head with a stone. Navas had attempted two more murders, but the victims escaped with injuries. Arrest Soon after the second murder, the police suspected Navas and took him into custody. Navas pretended to be mentally challenged and so the police got him admitted to a mental asylum in Thiruvananthapuram. Whilst there, however, psychiatrists found him mentally fit and he was discharged. He came back to Kollam and allegedly committed the other murders. Night patrol teams of the police had noticed Navas loitering in the city on those days, but on seeing the police party he feigned mental illness and was ignored by the police. After investigations which lasted about a fortnight a police team led by Kollam East Circle Inspector V. Sugathan, Sub Inspector G. Gopakumar, and senior civil police officer Prasanna Kumar arrested Navas from the Nehru Park area in the city on 2 November 2012.

The Hawk, a criminal who has never been apprehended even though he obligingly leaves many clues for the police to follow, is suspected. Helen Hamilton (Breamer), daughter of a wealthy American, loses her jewels after throwing them out of a window at Keats Gaunt (Craig), a poet she imagines she is in love with.

English detectives suspect him of the robbery and watch him closely. He goes to Helen's home and becomes acquainted with her family, but his mysterious actions raise doubts in the minds of all save Helen, who now loves him. Not even to her, however, will he admit his part in the mysterious proceedings that are occurring continuously until, by a master stroke, he catches the criminal, a rival for Helen's affections, and then reveals that he is an American secret service man and worthy of her love.

The road passes through eight regions: Boyolali Regency, Karanganyar Regency, Solo City, Sragen Regency in Central Java Province, and Ngawi, Madiun, Nganjuk and Jombang Regency in East Java Province. When commencing operation, Solo‚ÄìKertosono Toll Road, known as Soker Toll Road. The toll road is the longest toll road in Indonesia. History Administratively, Soker Toll Road with a total length of 177.12 km comprise two segments, segment Solo‚ÄìMantingan‚ÄìNgawi and segment Ngawi‚ÄìKertosono. The length of Solo‚ÄìMantingan‚ÄìNgawi toll road is 90.1 kilometer, while the length of Ngawi‚ÄìKertosono is 87.02 kilometer. Hence, in the beginning, Soker Toll Road was designed as two separate toll roads. However, during its tender process, no investors showed interest in bidding these two toll roads except one bidder, which is PT Thiess Contractors Indonesia. On June 28, 2011, Toll Road Concession Agreement (PPJT) amendment has been signed in Jakarta. With this concession agreement, segment Solo- Mantingan-Ngawi will be under PT Solo‚ÄìNgawi Jaya, while segment Ngawi- Kertosono will be under PT Ngawi‚ÄìKertosono Jaya. Both of this companies are subsidiaries of PT Thiess Contractors Indonesia. Since both of toll road concessions have been awarded to the same company, these two toll roads usually are referred as Solo‚ÄìKertosono Toll Road, or Soker Toll Road. Construction started in 2012 and the company aimed to finish the project in 2014, but the company was only able to acquire 80 percent of the needed land. The construction has been left idle due to financing and land clearing difficulties. Then State-run toll road operator Jasa Marga and state-owned construction company Waskita Karya taken over from Thiess Contractors in 2015, with about Rp 439 billion (US$34.15 million). Jasa Marga now owns 60 percent of the shares in the project, while Waskita Karya owns the remaining 40 percent.

He is best known for founding the humorous magazine Hvepsen in 1905 and editing it throughout its lifespan, until 1925. Early life He was born as Hans Rollefsen in Holla, Telemark as a son of farmers. After the death of his mother when Rollefsen was aged two, he grew up with his aunt and uncle Guro and Hans √òsterholt at the farm Nedre √òsterholt. He hence took the surname √òsterholt. He finished vocational training at Skiensfjorden School in 1892. He moved to the capital Kristiania, worked at Kongsberg V√•penfabrikk from 1894 to 1895, then back in Kristiania at the mechanical works Nylands Verksted. He was a co-founder of the trade union and later chaired it. He travelled on a scholarship in Berlin and Chicago between 1898 and 1901. Career In 1903 he was elected to the Labour Party's central board, a position he lost in 1906. He was the treasurer of the Norwegian Union of Iron and Metalworkers from 1904 to 1908. However, he was best known as editor of the socialist humorous magazine Hvepsen (\\"The Wasp\\"), which he started in 1905 after a fundraiser among trade unions. The magazine is viewed as qualitative and successful during its time, and attracted skilled writers such as Johan Falkberget. In 1916 √òsterholt started another magazine as a side project, Blinken (\\"The Blink\\"), and in addition he wrote several poems and songs for events in the labour movement. He also started a paper goods store in the party headquarters at Folkets Hus, Kristiania in 1906. Through this he published the annual calendar Arbeiderkalenderen. Hvepsen was also published out of Folkets Hus. Because of a large work burden, √òsterholt had to leave his paper store and Arbeiderkalenderen with the Labour Party in 1913. In 1921, the party split with the Social Democratic Labour Party denouncing the Labour Party line of membership in the Third International. √òsterholt joined the Social Democratic Labour Party, and as a result he was evicted from Folkets Hus in 1922. Blinken went defunct that year, and Hvepsen followed in 1925. He was the manager of the Social Democratic Labour Party main newspaper Den nye Social-Demokraten from 1923 to 1925, but after that he left the party press to work in the co-ops. He was the manager of Bryn Co-Op from 1926 to 1930 and the cooperative leaders' association Handelsbestyrerforbundet from 1929 to 1949. He also edited the association's member magazine during that time. He died in November 1958 in Oslo.

It was based on an 1897 play of the same title by Cecil Raleigh and Henry Hamilton. The future matinee idol John Gilbert appeared in a supporting part. Plot As described in a film magazine, Lord Angus Cameron (played by Herbert) of the White Heather country finds himself seriously embarrassed financially during a stock exchange panic and goes to Donald Cameron (Alexander) on his country estate for a loan. Donald refuses because Angus will not contract a favorable marriage with one of his class. With ruin facing him, Angus decides to rid himself of a secret marriage made with his housekeeper Marion Hume (Ballin) on his yacht before it was sunk. Documentary evidence of the marriage now lies many fathoms underwater, and one witness is dead while another, a sailor, has vanished on some voyage. During a hunt Angus accidentally shoots his son from the marriage, leading Marion to announce it to save her injured son. Angus denies the marriage, so Marion goes to her father James Hume (Aitken), while two admirers of Marion hunt for the missing witness in the London underworld. Her father fights for his daughter's honor in court, but the case is lost for lack of evidence, and he is ruined on the exchange, dying when he is unable to meet his liabilities. When the missing witness is found, Angus bribes him to disappear. There remain only the papers in a chest on the sunken yacht, and diving operations are ongoing. The two admirers and Lord Angus hasten to the scene. One of the admirers dives on the yacht as does Angus armed with a knife. During an underwater struggle Angus accidentally cuts his own air hose and is killed. The admirer returns to the surface with the proof of the marriage and claims Marion for himself, while the second admirer dies while also confessing his love.

Schedule *Source: 1951 Auburn football schedule Roster *Vince Dooley Season Summary Vanderbilt Auburn upset the 14-point favorite Commodores behind opportunistic defense and a bruising ground game. The Tigers recovered three fumbles in Vanderbilt territory and converted center Homer Williams rumbled for 122 yards on 29 carries. He scored the go-ahead touchdown with 6 minutes left in the 4th quarter and a 36-yard field goal from Joe Davis iced it with less than a minute left. Tailback Charles Hattaway racked up 120 yards on 24 carries and nose guard Bill Turnbeaugh made a few key defensive plays in the 4th quarter. Wofford Looking to erase the embarrassment of the previous year's loss to the hands of Wofford, Shug's Tigers were able to get revenge on the feisty Terriers by a 30-14 margin. The defense, led by Vince Dooley, took advantage of several Wofford mishaps, even with allowing Terrier quarterback Jack Beeler to complete 23 of 30 passes against them. Punter Dudley Spence was magnificent, pinning the visitors deep with every kick, and freshman Bobby Freeman made an impressive 79-yard touchdown jaunt to break the game open. Florida The Homecoming battle with Florida proved to be one of the most exciting contests of the season. The Gators struck first with a blocked punt to set up a touchdown and Auburn responded with an interception that led to an Allan Parks score just before half. With the score knotted at 7 apiece, the Tigers were forced to a 3-n-out to begin the second half. With the benefit of a 12-yard punt, the visitors promptly took advantage by engineering a three- play scoring drive. The point after sailed wide, but the Gators had amassed a 13-7 lead. The game was a seesaw affair from here out, with multiple fumbles direly costing Florida chances to put the contest away. With time dwindling in the final quarter, 137-pound Tiger defensive back Jack Creel proved to be the giant of the day by blocking a Florida punt at the Gator 29-yard line. It was big Bill Turnebaugh who corralled the pigskin to give Auburn possession. Despite the fortunate shift of momentum, the home team could only manage 5 yards on their first 3 attempts. With a minute left to play, Auburn faced a 4th down-and-5 at the 24-yard line with the game on the line. Quarterback Allan Parks took the snap from center, rolled out of the pocket, and heaved a pass to end Lee Hayley who was streaking up the sidelines. Hayley leaped for the ball and came down with it in the end zone. Joe Davis's kick was true and the Tigers held on to clip Florida, 14-13.

A guide to what one should do and avoid in ordinary social life, this courtesy book of the Renaissance explores subjects such as dress, table manners, and conversation. It became so popular that the title, which refers to the name of one of the author‚Äôs distinguished friends, entered into the Italian language as a general term for social etiquette. Della Casa did not live to see his manuscript‚Äôs widespread and lasting success, which arrived shortly after its publication. It was translated into French (1562), English (1576), Latin (1580), Spanish (1585), and German (1587), and has been read and studied in every generation. Della Casa's work set the foundation for modern etiquette writers and authorities on manners, such as ‚ÄúMiss Manners‚Äù Judith Martin, Amy Vanderbilt, and Emily Post. Context In the twentieth century, scholars usually situated Galateo among the courtesy books and conduct manuals that were very popular during the Renaissance. In addition to Castiglione‚Äôs celebrated Courtier, other important Italian treatises and dialogues include Alessandro Piccolomini‚Äôs Moral institutione (1560), Luigi Cornaro‚Äôs Treatise on the Sober Life (1558-1565), and Stefano Guazzo‚Äôs Art of Civil Conversation (1579). In recent years, attention has turned to the humor and dramatic flair of Della Casa‚Äôs book. It has been argued that the style sheds light on Shakespeare‚Äôs comedies. When it first appeared in English translation by Robert Peterson in 1575, it would have been available in book stalls in Shakespeare's London. Stephen Greenblatt, author of Will in the World, writes, \\"To understand the culture out of which Shakespeare is writing, it helps to read Renaissance courtesy manuals like Baldassare Castiglione‚Äôs famous Book of the Courtier (1528) or, still better, Giovanni della Casa‚Äôs Galateo or, The Rules of Polite Behavior (1558, available in a delightful new translation by M.F. Rusnak). It is fine for gentlemen and ladies to make jokes, della Casa writes, for everyone likes people who are funny, and a genuine witticism produces ‚Äújoy, laughter, and a kind of astonishment.‚Äù But mockery has its risks. It is perilously easy to cross a social and moral line of no return.\\" New York Review of Books, September 26, 2013 Distinguished historians argue that Galateo should be read in the context of international European politics, and some contend that the work expresses an attempt to distinguish Italian excellence. ‚ÄúDuring the half-century when Italy fell prey to foreign invasion (1494-1559) and was overrun by French, Spanish and German armies, the Italian ruling classes were battered by - as they often envisaged them - \\"barbarians\\". In their humiliation and laboured responses, Italian writers took to reflecting on ideals, such as the ideal literary language, the ideal cardinal, ideal building types, and the ideal general or field commander. But in delineating the rules of conduct, dress and conversation for the perfect gentleman, they were saying, in effect, \\"We are the ones who know how to cut the best figure in Europe\\".Lauro Martines, Times Literary Supplement, August 16, 2013 A skilled writer in Latin, Della Casa followed Erasmus in presenting a harmonious and simple morality based on Aristotle‚Äôs Nicomachean Ethics and notion of the mean, as well as other classical sources. His treatise also reveals an obsession with graceful conduct and self-fashioning during the time of Michelangelo and Titian: ‚ÄúA man must not be content with doing good things, but he must also study to do them gracefully. Grace is nothing other than that luster which shines from the appropriateness of things that are suitably ordered and well arranged one with the other and together.‚Äù The work has been edited in this light by such distinguished Italian scholars as Stefano Prandi, Emanuela Scarpa, and Giorgio Manganelli. The work may be read in the context of what Norbert Elias called the ‚Äúcivilizing process.‚Äù It is generally agreed that, given the popularity and impact of Galateo, the cultural elite of the Italian Renaissance taught Europe how to behave. Giulio Ferroni argues that Della Casa ‚Äúproposes a closed and oppressive conformity, made of caution and hypocrisy, hostile to every manifestation of liberty and originality.‚Äù Others contend, on the contrary, that the work represents ambivalence, self-control, and a modern understanding of the individual in a society based on civility, intercultural competence and social networking.  Content  Della Casa addresses gentlemanly citizens who wish to convey a winning and attractive image. With a casual style and dry humor, he writes about everyday concerns, from posture to telling jokes to table manners. ‚ÄúOur manners are attractive when we regard others‚Äô pleasure and not our own delight,‚Äù Della Casa writes. Unlike Baldassare Castiglione‚Äôs The Book of the Courtier, the rules of polite behavior in Galateo are not directed to ideal men in a Renaissance court. Instead, Della Casa observes the ordinary habits of people who do not realize that clipping one‚Äôs nails in public is bad. ‚ÄúOne should not annoy others with such stuff as dreams, especially since most dreams are by and large idiotic,‚Äù he advises. Valentina D‚ÄôUrso, Professor of Psychology and author of Le Buone Maniere, writes, ‚ÄúThe founding father of this literary genre, [Galateo] is an extraordinary read, lively and passionate. One doesn‚Äôt know whether to admire more its rich style or the wisdom of the practical words of advice.‚Äù Language and Style The work was preceded by a short treatise on the same subject in Latin, De officiis inter tenuiores et potentiores amicos (1546). Latin at the time was the language of learned society, and Della Casa was a first-rate classicist and public speaker. The treatise opens with a Latinate conciossiacosach√©, which gained Galateo a reputation for being pedantic and labored. However, Giuseppe Baretti and poets such as Giacomo Leopardi ranked Della Casa alongside Machiavelli as a master of Italian prose style. \\"Una delle prose pi√π eleganti e pi√π attiche del secolo decimosesto,\\" (one of the most elegant and Attic prose works of the sixteenth century) Leopardi said. Della Casa‚Äôs Galateo is, in the words of scholar E. H. Wilkins, ‚Äústill valuable‚Ä¶for the pleasant ease with which most of it is written, and for its common sense, its plentiful humor, and its general amenity.‚Äù Della Casa frequently alludes to Dante and more often to Boccaccio, whose Decameron he evidently knew very well and whose style he imitates. Several comments on language in Galateo reflect the Tuscan language model proposed about the same time by Della Casa‚Äôs friend Pietro Bembo. Summary of Galateo In the first chapter it is said that a gentleman should be at all times courteous, pleasant, and in manners beautiful. Although good manners may not appear as important as liberality, constancy, or magnanimity, they are nonetheless a virtue for achieving the esteem of others. One must not mention, do, or think anything that invokes images in the mind that are dirty or disreputable. One should not reveal by one's gestures that said person has just returned from the bathroom, do not blow one's nose and look into the handkerchief, avoid spitting and yawning. Della Casa tells his reader that outward appearance is very important, so clothes must be tailored and conform to prevailing custom, reflecting one‚Äôs social status. In Chapter 7, Della Casa deals with a pivotal subject - conversation. Della Casa says to talk about topics of interest to all present and show respect to everyone, avoiding anything that is base or petty. Chapter 14 discusses being in places with other people, starting with types of ceremonies, false flatteries, and fawning behavior. Another matter is whether the ceremonies are made to us: never refuse because it could be taken as a sign of arrogance. Della Casa returns to illustrate the customs of conversation and public speaking. Language should, as much as possible, be \\"orderly and well-expressed\\" so that the listener is able to understand what the speaker intends. In addition to the clarity of the words used, it is also important that they sound pleasant. Before talking about any topic, it is good to have thought it out. It is not polite to interrupt someone while talking, nor to help him find his words. In the last three chapters, the author writes about behaviour in general: actions should be appropriate and done with grace. A gentleman should never run, or walk too slowly. Della Casa brings us to behavior at the table, such as not scratching, not eating like a pig, not using a toothpick or sharing food. In Della Casa‚Äôs vision, slight slips of decorum become taboo. Publication history and reception It was probably first drafted during his stay at the Abbey of Saint Eustace at Nervesa, near Treviso, between 1551 and 1555. Galateo was first published in Venice, and was edited by Erasmus Gemini in 1558. The first separate publication appeared in Milan a year later. The Vatican manuscript (formerly Parraciani Ricci), in Latin with autograph corrections, was edited and published by Gennaro Barbarisi in 1990. The manuscript contains neither the title nor the division into chapters. Many variants in the first edition are attributed to Erasmus Gemini. The Spanish Galateo of Lucas Graci√°n Dantisco was very influential in the seventeenth century. In the Enlightenment, the letters of Lord Chesterfield show the influence of Galateo, as does a self-help manuscript of George Washington. The first American edition was published in Baltimore in 1811, with a short appendix on how to slice and serve meats.

The first car of the Renault 4CV manufactured by FASA-Renault at the factory of Valladolid. The factory was opened in 1951. This copy is located in this museum. Description This municipal museum was designed by the architects Rafael Moneo and Enrique de Teresa with the help of Francisco Romero and Juan Jose Echevarria. The museum is to the south west of the city on the right bank of the River Pisuerga with an emblematic footbridge it is seen as a symbol of the city and for the region of Castilla y Le√≥n. North Plaza P√≠o del R√≠o Hortega was born in the city and after qualifying as a doctor went on to investigate what are now called neurons. He was responsible for discovering microglia. There is a statue of him outside (and a permanent exhibition inside about neurons). Also in the plaza is a statue of Albert Einstein sitting at a bench with his calculations. The plaza also has a weather station. Lobby The permanent exhibition in the lobby includes two cars. The fastest is a Williams-Renault Formula 1 car that won the constructors prize. The earlier car is the only car that has been declared of cultural interest to Spain. This is a Renault 4/4 which were constructed in the city at the FASA plant. The lobby has temporary exhibitions and also displays local meteorites and a large model of the DNA molecule. Besides an area dedicated to Castilla y Le√≥n inventions and inventors there is an eleven metre high 80 kg Foucault Pendulum as well as a display of Louis Pasteur's work improving wine production. First Floor The periodic table The first floor has a number of interactive displays. One explains the different ways of generating electricity whilst a model of the town shows the cycle of water usage. A large display illustrates Mendeleev and his periodic table whilst another has a three eyed guide called Tripos who explains aquatic life. River House The River House (Casa del Rio) was first opened in 2007, but it has since been extended to allow more aquariums, terrariums and interactive displays. The house exploits the museum's location on the banks of the River Pisuerga to explain geography and ecology with reference to the city of Valladolid. The entire ecosystem is illustrated and includes examples of the important species of fish, amphibians and shellfish that should thrive in the region's rivers. Displays illustrate metamorphosis of frogs and toads. The water cycle is explained and its importance in a time of climate change. Planetarium The museum claims the honour of having the first digital planetarium in Spain. The 11 metre dome is inclined at an angle of 15 degrees and s used to display astronomical animations of the solar system, galaxies and stars which are described by resident astronomers. The picture on the dome is created by 11.5 million pixels created by six aligned projectors.New graphical planetarium of the Science Museum of Valladolid immerses visitors in 3D universe, barco.com, accessed December 2012 References Category:Museums in Valladolid Category:Planetaria in Spain Category:Science museums in Spain Category:2003 establishments in Spain Category:Rafael Moneo buildings ","title":"Valladolid Science Museum"},{"id":"37974244","text":"Elegia tectorum, previously Chondropetalum tectorum or Restio tectorum, more commonly Cape thatching reed, or dakriet (in Afrikaans), is a member of the restio family, Restionaceae. It is a tufted perennial growing to between 1.5 and 2.25 m, with deciduous leaf sheaths. Flowers are less than 3 mm long. Petals are smooth or hairy in the upper half. E. tectorum is found in marshes and seeps on deep sand in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape of South Africa. The species was originally noted by Carl Linnaeus the Younger. In 1838, E. tectorum was noted by Irish botanist William Henry Harvey (as R. Tectorum) for its use as a thatching material, and in the making of brooms and baskets. Historically, only the taller forms of the species, growing in the surroundings of Malmesbury, was used for thatching; the more popular thatching reed was Thamnochortus insignis. Carl Peter Thunberg also noted the use in thatching in 1793, as did English botanist John Lindley in 1846. Thurnberg notes the Dutch East India Company had a farm at Zeekoe Valley (17 km SSE of the Castle of Good Hope), where the reed was cultivated. He describes its use at the Cape of Good Hope as follows: Elegia tectorum was later called Chondropetalum tectorum, but cladistic analysis, conducted by Moline and Linder (2005) found that the genera of Chondropetalum and Dovea were imbedded in Elegia.

It was developed in some haste under the manufacturer's Technical Director, Ferdinand Porsche in parallel with the smaller Mercedes-Benz W 01 (which never progressed beyond the prototype stage) and the larger three-litre-engined Mercedes-Benz W03 following the creation of Daimler-Benz, formally in July 1926, from the fusion of the Daimler and Benz & Cie auto-businesses. The new company's models for 1926 were unencumbered by an excess of technical sophistication, but came from a company with a long-standing reputation for quality: serious teething problems afflicting the early cars were the focus of conflict between Daimler-Benz Chairman, Wilhelm Kissel and the Technical Director responsible for the new models: Porsche's employment contract was not renewed beyond 1928, which led to an acrimonious litigation.Oswald, p. 217  Naming conventions  The manufacturer applied the widely followed German naming conventions of the time. On the Mercedes-Benz 8/38 PS the \\"8\\" defined the car's tax horsepower, used by the authorities to determine the level of annual car tax to be imposed on car owners. The \\"38\\" defined the manufacturer's claims regarding car's actual power output as defined in Horsepower#Metric horsepower (PS, cv, hk, pk, ks, ch). In Germany tax horsepower, which had been defined by statute since 1906, was based on the dimensions of the cylinders in the engine. Unlike the systems used elsewhere in Europe, the German tax horsepower calculation took account both of the cylinder bore and of the cylinder stroke, and there was therefore a direct linear relationship between engine size and tax horsepower. The model was effectively relaunched in 1929, and although there were not many changes on paper, the car was now more modern and cultivated, thanks to the attentions of Hans Nibel, who from January 1929, newly appointed as Technical Director, held sole responsibility for model development.Oswald, p. 217 Nibel \\"... √úbernahm am 1. Januar 1929 die Alleinverantwortung f√ºr Konstruktion und Technik bei Daimler-Benz. Nibel modernisierte und kultivierte den 8/38 PS-Wagen der nun Typ Stuttgart hie√ü.\\" The relaunch was accompanied by a new name, and the car was now sold as the Mercedes-Benz Typ Stuttgart 200. In retrospect the car is sometimes referred to by its company works number, as the Mercedes-Benz W02, which minimises the risk of confusion with other Mercedes-Benz models with names similar to \\"Mercedes-Benz Typ 200\\".  Mercedes-Benz Typ 8/38 PS (1926‚Äì1928)  The car was offered in bare chassis form for customers wishing to purchase a car body from an independent coach builder. Standard bodies from the manufacturer started with a Torpedo-bodied \\"Tourenwagen\\" and included 2 or 4-door \\"Limousine\\" (sedan/saloon) bodies. There was also a choice from (initially) two different Mercedes-Benz cabriolet bodies.Oswald, p. 219 The side-valve six-cylinder 1,988 cc engine delivered a maximum output of at 3,400 rpm, which translated into a top speed of 75 km/h (47 mph). Power was transmitted via a three-speed manual transmission to the rear wheels, which were fixed to a rigid axle suspended from semi-elliptic leaf springs. The braking applied to all four wheels, mechanically controlled using rod linkages.Oswald, p. 219 From 1927 a small delivery van version branded as the Mercedes-Benz Lieferwagen Typ L 3/4 was offered, intended either as a load carrier or, with ten seats, as a small bus. During its early years the manufacturer pursued an inappropriate pricing strategy. Initially the prices were set much too high, and when they were reduced by between 500 and 1,000 Marks, which fed a rumour that the model was about to be replaced and existing cars were being priced as \\"run-out\\" models. This was part of the backdrop to the boardroom conflicts that led to the departure of Technical Director Porsche at the end of 1928.  Mercedes-Benz 8/38 PS Typ Stuttgart 200 (1929‚Äì1933)  The relaunched car, now branded as the \\"Mercedes-Benz Typ Stuttgart 200\\" retained the 1,988 cc side-valve engine fitted the previous year. Claimed maximum output was also unchanged at of . However, this level of output was now achieved at a slightly reduced engine speed of only 3,200 rpm. The compression ratio was substantially raised from 5 : 1 to 6.2 : 1, and the carburetor type (though apparently not its diameter) was changed from a \\"Zenith 30 HKG\\" to a \\"Solex 30 MOHLT\\". The three-speed transmission was available as before, but customers could now also specify a four-speed manual transmission. The lower ratios were unchanged, and the same on both the gearboxes now offered, the fourth speed on the four-speed box being effectively an overdrive ratio of 1 : 0.76 while the more conventional \\"top\\" 1 : 1 ratio was achieved, as before, by selecting third gear. The combined impact of these engine and transmission changes enabled the manufacturer to increase the listed top speed to 80 km/h (50 mph) though at this time actual achievable top speed would have depended on a number of variables including the body type used. The delivery van option was no longer listed for the Typ 200, and the two-door version of the \\"Limousine\\"-bodied car also disappeared with this upgrade, but the four-door \\"Limousine\\", now priced at only 80 Marks above the entry level Torpedo-bodied \\"Tourenwagen\\"-bodied car, remained as the mainstay of the range. 1929 also saw the introduction of the Mercedes-Benz W11, which in effect was virtually the same car, but offered with a larger engine and a wider range of body options. Between 1927 and 1931 the \\"8/38 PS / Typ Stuttgart 200\\" and the more powerful but broadly similar \\"Typ Stuttgart 260\\" were the mainstays of the Mercedes-Benz range. The period was a particularly difficult one for the German auto industry, with passenger car sales badly depressed. The 4,788 cars produced in 1927 represented 61% of the manufacturer's output.Oswald, pp. 206‚Äì209: Note that in some editions the totals at the foot of Page 208 are misaligned, apparently due to the omission of totals for 1926. Otherwise there is no plausible explanation for the mismatch between five column headings at the top of Page 208 and the four column totals at its foot. Corresponding figures for the next five years (excluding van and military versions) are: ::1928: 3,938 cars / 63%, ::1929: 5,640 cars / 56%, ::1930: 4,453 cars / 69%, ::1931: 2,320 cars / 70%, ::1932: 885 cars / 15% (1932 saw the launch of the all-new and smaller W15 model. ) Production of the 1,988 cc Mercedes Benz 8/38 PS / W02 ended with a trickle in 1933, by which time 16,956 had been produced. (If the volumes are combined with those for the more powerful W11 the total comfortably exceeds 20,000.) The replacement W21 model was introduced in 1933, by which year the auto industry faced a much less bleak immediate-term outlook. Not included with these passenger car statistics are \\"K√ºbelwagen\\" (quasi-Jeep) versions of the model, which continued to be produced until 1936.

Cygnus-X is a massive star formation region located in the constellation of Cygnus at a distance from the Sun of 1.4 kiloparsecs (4,600 light years). As it is located behind the Cygnus Rift and its light is heavily absorbed by Milky Way's interstellar dust, it is better studied in other wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that penetrate it such as the infrared.  Physical properties  As studies done with the help of the Spitzer Space Telescope have shown, Cygnus-X has a size of 200 parsecs and contains the largest number of massive protostars as well as the largest stellar association (Cygnus OB2, with up to 2,600 stars of spectral type OB and a mass of up to 105 solar masses) within a radius of 2 kiloparsecs of the Sun. It is also associated with one of the largest molecular clouds known, with a mass of 3 million solar masses. Its stellar population includes a large number of early-type stars as well as evolved massive stars such as luminous blue variable candidates, Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars, and supergiant stars of spectral types O and B. Ongoing research has shown Cygnus X includes two stellar associations: Cygnus OB2 and Cygnus OB9 as well as an additional large number of early-type stars that include BD+40¬∞4210, a blue supergiant star and luminous blue variable candidate that is one of the brightest stars of the association, as well as more supergiant stars of spectral types O and B. The same study shows that star formation has been taking place there during at least 10 million years, continuing to the present day.

Career   Association, 1916 to 1945  The pupil Josef Wendl, who joined Anton L√∂ffelmeier in May 1916: The \\"L√∂wen\\" under the swastika, p. 129. went through the youth section of the Munich \\"L√∂wen\\" youth section completely through the youth age groups of the white and blue sixties and was used for the first time at the age of 17 in the league team playing at that time in the district league Bavaria. In the 1926/27 season, the defensive hope had its first successes in 1860. In Bavaria, he won the runner-up championship with his club, with third place in the games for the southern German championship, the ‚ÄúL√∂wen‚Äù moved into the final round of the German Football Championship. There, the young player sat alongside his teammates Alois Pledl, Eugen Kling and Josef Hornauer against FC Schalke 04 and VfB Leipzig and only failed in the semifinals with 1: 4 goals to the future German champion 1. FC N√ºrnberg. Wendl had been the left-wing outrunner in all finals. In the season 1930/31 Wendl qualified for the second time with the SV 1860 Munich for the final matches for the German championship , The Elf from Giesing also skipped the hurdle in the semi-finals, knocking out the Holstein Kiel with a 2-0 win and moving into the final of the German football championship for the first time in club history. The final was lost in front of 50,000 spectators on June 14, 1931 at the M√ºngersdorfer Stadion in Cologne with 2: 3 goals after a 2: 1 halftime lead against Hertha BSC. Wendl formed with Max Sch√§fer in front of goalkeeper Alfred Riemke the pair of defenders and acted in his previous left runner position Fritz Eiberle. Two years later, in 1932/33, Wendl and his teammates Georg Ertl, Fritz Neumaier, Ludwig Stiglbauer and Ludwig Lachner lost the semi-finals in the final tournament with 0: 4 goals in Leipzig against Schalke 04. In the Gauliga era he came again as a 34-year-old veteran 1941 into the final tournament , As the middle runner in the group matches against the Stuttgarter Kickers, the VfL Neckarau and SK Rapid Wien he directed the defense of the \\"L√∂wen\\". The 2-1 home win on April 27 in front of 30,000 spectators was outstanding when he had to assert himself particularly against the rapid scorer Franz Binder and attacked Heinz Kr√ºckeberg and Ludwig Janda provided the impulses. The relatives of the Wehrmacht and team captain Wendl were prevented from playing the decisive second leg in Vienna and Rapid won the first group place with a 2-0 victory by two points ahead of 1860 Munich. The Viennese prevailed in the later final on June 22 through a 4: 3 victory against Schalke 04 and won the German championship in 1941. When his club was able to bring the Tschammer Cup to Munich on November 15, 1942, after a 2-0 win in the final against Schalke 04, he had only 5: 3 home success on July 19 due to the war 1942 participated in the first final round against SK Rapid Vienna as a left-back alongside Georg Pledl. In total, the defensive player who held the captain's office for ten years was active for 1860 Munich as a league player and played over 1,000 games.Anton L√∂ffelmeier: The \\"Lions\\" under the swastika, p. 129. The last time was Wendl in spring 1945 was in a competitive game for the \\"lions\\" during a front holiday.  Selection and appointment, 1927 to 1935  At the age of 19, the man for the left defensive side was already called into the Munich City Selection, for which he played a total of 28 games in his career. In the South German selection, the 1960 made its debut on October 9, 1927 in the Federal Cup competition in the 3: 4 defeat in Duisburg against West Germany. The game played a complete Munich city selection, with six \\"Bayern\\" actors (Adolf Schwab, Hans Schmid, Emil Kutterer, Ludwig Hofmeister, Josef P√∂ttinger, Ludwig Hofmann), four \\"L√∂wen\\" representatives (Alois Pledl, Ludwig Stiglbauer, Josef Hornauer, Josef Wendl) and the Wacker player Fritz Neubauer. With the association selection from Bavaria, Wendl became Gaupokalsieger in 1933. He was part of the Bavarian selection, which defeated Saxony with 2: 1 goals in Chemnitz and 6: 2 goals in Munich North Hesse. In the replay of the final, Bayern won 6-1 on August 6, 1933 in Munich against Brandenburg. The final triangle was formed by goalkeepers Hans Jakob and the pair of defenders Sigmund Haringer and Josef Wendl. In the national football team, the \\"L√∂wen\\" player made his debut with goalkeeper Hans Jakob on November 2, 1930 at the international match in Wroclaw against Norway. On his second appointment on October 30, 1932 in Budapest against Hungary, Paul Janes celebrated his national team debut. In his third and fourth international matches - in January and March 1933 against Italy and France - he formed the German defense pair in front of goalkeeper Jakob with Haringer. With his fifth international appearance on November 19, 1933 in Zurich, Wendl said goodbye to the national team in a 2-0 victory against the Confederates. The Bayern player Ludwig Goldbrunner, on the other hand, opened his international career in the game against \\"Nati\\".  Profession, soldier and honors  Wendl, who was named honorary captain, received the city honorary letter Anton L√∂ffelmeier: The \\"Lions\\" under the swastika, p. 129 in 1934 for outstanding sporting achievements. Wendl took over the city of Munich on August 31, 1934 as a workshop clerk, and on March 1, 1935 he was given a job as a road construction supervisor. On June 17, 1940 he was called up to the Wehrmacht and was on the front lines until the end of the war. In May 1945 he was captured by the Soviet Union and was only able to return home on January 5, 1950, where he returned to the Munich Roads Department.Anton Loffelmeier: The \\"Lions\\" under the swastika, p. 131.  Trainer  Soon after returning from captivity, he began working as a trainer at TSV 1860 Munich in the youth department. At the sports university in Cologne, he successfully completed his training as a football teacher in 1953.

Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2011. Print. Biography Background Balluti's exact date of birth is disputed, with historians listing the year as both 886 and 887. He was born and raised in Los Pedroches in the mountainous region of Cordoba Province, northwest of C√≥rdoba, Andalusia. Balluti's family, however, was originally from North Africa of Berber origins. He came from a religiously active family, and his sister was notable as a Muslim woman who founded her own monastery known as a Ribat where she and other women could devote their lives solely to piety and religious scholarship.Linda Gale Jones and Madeleine Cosman, \\"Handbook to Life in the Medieval World,\\" pg. 154 Education Balluti initially studied Islamic studies in the capital of Andalus, later traveling east both for the sake of his education and to perform the Muslim pilgrimage at Mecca, which he completed in 921. He studied in various regions under a number of different teachers before traveling to Cairo in order to study Arabic grammar and literature. Later gaining some renown as a linguist in his own right, he was also known as a poet. Death Balluti died in his hometown of Cordoba in 15 November 966. He was 82 years old.William Montgomery Watt and Pierre Cachi, \\"History of Islamic Spain,\\" pg. 66. Edinburgh University Press. Judicial career As Chief Judge Initially, Balluti served as the chief judge of M√©rida. Later, he served as the judge of the Umayyad Caliph of Cordoba Abd-ar- Rahman III from 949 until his death under the reign of Al-Hakam II.Maribel Fierro, \\"Madinat al-Zahra, el para√≠so y los fatim√≠es\\", Al-Qantara XXV, 2 (2004) 299-327W. Montgomery Watt and Pierre Chachia, A History of Islamic Spain, pg. 66. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2001. During the zenith of Byzantine-Andalusian relations, Emperor Constantine VII joined a succession of Christian rulers meeting with Muslim officials.Muhammad Abdullah Enan, \\"Decisive Moments in the History of Islam,\\" pg. 143-144. Lahore: The Lion Press, 1943. 2nd Edition. During one of these meetings, Balluti delivered an oration upon the reception of a group of Byzantine envoys at Abd-arRahman III's palace, expressing his extremely positive views of the caliph and the obligation of the people of Spain to obey their ruler; he was subsequently appointed to the position of the caliphate's top judicial official.Janina M. Safran, \\"The Second Umayyad Caliphate: The Articulation of Caliphal Legitimacy in Al-Andalus,\\" pg. 72-73. Harvard University Press. Balluti's speech is still preserved as an accurate description of the caliph's court and palace at the time. Legalistic Views Although he did not adhere to the Maliki school of law favored by the Umayyad dynasty, Balluti was still the chief judge of Cordoba during his twilight years; it is thought that he kept his Zahirite views to himself and his family without attempting to spread them.Mohammad Sharif Khan and Mohammad Anwar Saleem, Muslim Philosophy And Philosophers, pg. 35. New Delhi: Ashish Publishing House, 1994. In addition to his position on the judge's bench, Al-Hakam II also appointed him as a professor. Balluti's appointment despite his personal convictions was considered by Islamic scholar William Montgomery Watt to indicate that while the Umayyad remnants favored the Malikite school, they were not willing to grant it absolute monopoly. Although Balluti was willing to keep his juristic views to himself, he was not as soft-spoken regarding his views on morality. When Abd-ar-Rahman III attempted to cover the ceiling of his palace Medina Azahara in gold and silver, the extravagance was too excessive for Balluti to accept, prompting him to encourage the caliph to stop; he even went as far as to say the Devil was tempting the caliph with such excess.Robert Hillenbrand, \\"The Ornament of the World: Medieval Cordoba as a Cultural Center.\\" Taken from The Legacy of Muslim Spain, pg. 126. Ed. Salma Jayyusi. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1994. Legacy Balluti was considered by Ibn Khaldun to be one of the six individuals from the Berber people who became well known throughout history for a strong knowledge of Islamic studies. Creed Balluti was accused of holding to the doctrine of the Mu'tazilites, a sect within Islam which had mostly become extinct at the time. Historian Maribel Fierro has argued that this is not possible due to Balluti's polemics regarding Christian-Muslim dialogue.Alexander Mallett and David Thomas. \\"Christian-Muslim Relations. A Bibliographical History. Volume 2 (900-1050),\\" pg. 361. Brill Publishers. When reviewing the conversion document of a former Christian, Balluti rejected the individual's Muslim testimony of faith due to the wording: \\"Muhammad is God's messenger, and Jesus is God's messenger and His word.\\" The wording as an incomplete quote of a verse from the Qur'an.Qur'an, Balluti argued that if Jesus is God's word, but also a mortal, created being, then God's word - meaning the Qur'an - would also be created, rather than eternal; he also pointed out that a Byzantine Emperor - likely Theophilos - rebuked the Abbasid caliph Al-Ma'mun for believing Jesus is the word of God, and that the Qur'an is uncreated, yet also believing that Jesus was a mortal man. Thus, if the individual wanted to use the aforementioned verse in their testimony of faith, they would need to quote the verse in its entirety for the sake of context before Balluti would be willing to approve the conversion documents.Maribel Fierro, \\"Risala, 'Letter'.\\" Included in the bibliographical study of Mallett and Thomas. The belief that the Qur'an was created rather than eternal was championed by the Mu'tazilites and opposed by textualists such as Ahmad bin Hanbal, thus negating the claim that Balluti could have been the former rather than the latter. Later documents of Christian conversions to Islam in Spain were written in the same formula proposed by Balluti, indicating that his argument had gained official acceptance.

Jan D≈Çugosz claims he was the son of prince Theodoric Kietlicz, and Eudocia, the daughter of Duke Konrad I Mazowiecki.This is unlikely as the dates do not entirely agree with the proposition and Eudocia married Count Dietrich I of Brehna and Wettin. In his earlier life he was an administrator for Mieszko III. He became Archbishop in 1198 or 1199,There is some suggestion that He may have studied theology at the Sorbonne in Paris with Innocent III. and had political skills and influenced both the secular and church politics of his day. He instigated a program of church reform which included the introduction of celibate clergy, the exclusion of clergy from the authority of secular courts and privileges in the selection of bishops. At the in June 1210 he gained church privileges including its own courts and tax exemptions, in exchange for his support in gaining the Pope's recognition of the King. Here he negotiated with Leszek the White, Konrad I Mazowiecki and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic to renounce jus spolii. These privileges were enshrined in a papal bull of 1211, and were confirmed and expanded at the Wolb√≥rz Synod in 1216. He attended Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215, at which the mission to Prussia was approved and Henryk was made Papal legate to Prussia. Henry Kietlicz Here he met with Innocent III who confirmed his support for Henryk's reforms. At the synod of Wolborz in 1216 he gained further privileges for the church from Leszek I the White, Konrad of Masovia, Duke Wladyslaw and Casimir I of Opole. He then convened similar meetings in 1217 at Da≈Ñkowie and SƒÖdowlu 1218, where a pact was formed between the Polish rulers. Henryk was also active in secular politics, giving his support to the claims of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic over W≈Çadys≈Çaw III Spindleshanks and advocated to Pope Innocent III to reverse the excommunication of High Duke Leszek I the White. He emerged as an advocate of the younger dukes in the divided kingdom period.Mikolaj Gladysz, The Forgotten Crusaders: Poland and the Crusader Movement in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries, BRILL, 2012 page151 His activism, however, did produce enemies and he had to spend some time in exile with Henry the Bearded of Silesia. Despite his success, however, the death of Innocent III in 1216 and the succession of Honorius III saw Henryk lose Papal support. Resentment among Polish nobles and clergy resulted in Gedko Powa≈Ço Bishop of P≈Çock complaining to the new pope that Henryk was guilty of apparent excess and pride.

Two of Ketton-Cremer's godchildren criticised the decision, claiming that a public outing would have been against Ketton-Cremer's wishes and accusing the Trust of using their godfather's private life to generate publicity. Fry defended the Trust's decision, arguing that Ketton-Cremer had only kept his sexuality a secret because of pervasive homophobia and fear of prosecution during his lifetime.

Juste coined the name, \\"Little Haiti,\\" for the neighborhood in Miami, Florida which is a center of the Haitian American community in Florida. He is considered the father of the Haitian American community in Miami. Biography Early life Viter Juste was born on the island of La Gon√¢ve, a Haitian island in the Gulf of Gon√¢ve, on December 15, 1924. His father was a businessman. Viter Juste received a college degree in business and accounting. In 1946, Juste opened his first business, a supermarket located in the Haitian capital, Port-au- Prince. He later shuttered his supermarket in order to take a position with a disease eradication program operated by the United Nations. Move to the United States Juste's life in Haiti changed in the aftermath of the 1957 Haitian presidential election, which was won by Fran√ßois \\"Papa Doc\\" Duvalier. Duvalier would become a dictator, responsible for the deaths of thousands and the flight of many professionals from the country. Juste, who had openly supported Duvalier's main opponent, Louis D√©joie, in the election decided to leave Haiti for the United States for the safety of himself and his family. He initially moved to Texas, before living in New York City for several years. In 1973, Juste, his wife, Maria, and their children moved to Miami, Florida. Advocacy In 1972, one year before Juste moved to Miami, the first known, documented boat carrying Haitian refugees landed in South Florida. Two years later, Viter Juste held a 1974 meeting with Monsignor Bryan O. Walsh of the Roman Catholic Church in an effort to help the refugees. The 1974 collaboration between Walsh and Juste resulted in the creation of the Haitian- American Community Association of Dade, which was one of the first social service organizations founded specifically to cater to the needs of the Haitian community in Miami. Juste served as one of the Association's first directors. The meeting between Juste and Walsh effectively launched Juste's career as an advocate and activist on behalf of South Florida's Haitian immigrant and Haitian American community. Juste led a community boycott against a local branch of the Winn-Dixie supermarket, which had openly discriminated against Haitians. He also protested against the Miami-Dade County Public Schools during the 1970s after the Miami-Dade School Board refused to allow undocumented Haitian students to enroll in the school district. Juste's fight with the Miami-Dade School District led him to coin the term \\"Little Haiti\\" for the largely Haitian American neighborhood of Miami, historically known as Lemon City. According to Jean-Claude Exulien, a retired professor of history and friend of Juste's since 1977, Juste authored an article in the Miami Herald in which he first referred to the neighborhood as \\"Little Port-au-Prince.\\" However, editors at the Miami Herald found the name, \\"Little Port-au-Prince,\\" too long, so the newspaper shortened the term in the headline to \\"Little Haiti.\\" The name stuck and has been widely used for the neighborhood. Juste also worked to advance the Haitian American community in business and media. Juste was the first person in Miami to establish a French-language weekly newspaper targeted to Haitian Americans. His newspaper, which consisted of twelve pages, cost readers just 25 cents. Juste also opened Les Cousins Records and Books, which was the first store in Miami to sell Haitian Creole and Frans-language music and books. Juste moved Les Cousins Records and Books to Little Haiti. Juste is also considered a pioneer in adult education in Miami. He was the first person to establish an adult education program held in the evenings, which allowed working people to attend his classes. Juste taught both English language classes and skills to assimilate into larger American society. Later life Juste, who suffered from diabetes and dementia during his later life, died at an assisted living facility in North Miami, Florida, on November 19, 2012, at the age of 87. He was survived by Juste by two daughters, Chantal Juste Watson and Maria Blain; three sons, Carl Juste, a photojournalist for the Miami Herald, Wagner, and Patrick Juste; fifteen grandchildren; and fifteen great-grandchildren. Juste was predeceased by his wife of sixty years, Maria, died in 2008, and two sons. Archbishop Thomas Wenski of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami, who had known Viter Juste since in 1979, said of him following his death, \\"He was a man passionate for making his mark in the Haitian community; both as a businessman and a community leader...He was a pioneer, and paved the way for young generations of Haitians to follow.\\" Former Haitian political prisoner and history professor, Jean-Claude Exulien, who first Juste in 1977, also paid tribute to Juste, telling the Miami Herald, \\"This is a huge loss for the community...We didn't always agree on Haiti, but on the plan for the community here, we were together.\\" References Category:1924 births Category:2012 deaths Category:American newspaper founders Category:Businesspeople from Florida Category:Businesspeople from Miami Category:Haitian businesspeople Category:American educators Category:American activists Category:Haitian emigrants to the United States Category:People from Ouest (department) Category:People from Port-au-Prince ","title":"Viter Juste"},{"id":"37974609","text":"Tomoyasu (written: Êô∫‰øù, Êô∫ÂÆâ, Êô∫Èùñ, ÊúùÊ≥∞, ÂØÖÊ≥∞ or Áü•ÂÆâ) is a masculine Japanese given name.

HU- GO, is a single-seater ultra-light concept electric vehicle designed and built at the Automotive Engineering Department of Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey by a team led by Prof. Engin Tanƒ±k and Prof. Volkan Parlakta≈ü. The main goal of the project is to prove that a light electric vehicle can have an acceptable range without requiring heavy and expensive batteries.HU-GO Official Page Design Chassis and body HU-GO's chassis weighs only 24 kg. HU-GO has a very light (24 kg) space frame chassis made of aluminum tubes. The body, which is mounted on the chassis is made of fiberglass. Windscreen and wheel covers are made from Plexiglas. All of the components are designed (or selected) within a narrow range of safety factors to keep the weight low. As a result, HU-GO has a competitive weight of only 257 kg in total.HU-GO Official Page Technical Specs While reducing the weight, rollover and torsional stiffness calculations have done by using finite elements method software for safety, and successful simulation results were obtained. Batteries LiFePO4-type batteries are used in HU-GO. Contrary to its rivals, HU-GO has a battery pack that weighs only 53 kg, which is sufficient for a range of 100 kilometers. With its energy consumption of 50 Wh/km, HU-GO is one of the least energy-consuming four-wheeled vehicles in the world. HU-GO can be fully charged in 4 hours, from a standard household outlet. Also with regenerative braking, the vehicle can charge its batteries by converting the kinetic energy to the electric energy, when the throttle pedal is released off. Performance and handling Beside the lightness, ‚Äúfun handling‚Äù is the other design philosophy of HU-GO. For that reason, double wishbone suspensions are implemented for both axles as in the sport cars. HU-GO has a total power of 17 hp produced by two separate electric motors. This power brings HU-GO to a maximum speed of 100 km/h. HU-GO can accelerate 0 to 50 km/h in 5 seconds. Build 90% of the production of the parts and assembly was done in the Hacettepe University Automotive Engineering Department laboratories. The project is sponsored by Hacettepe University, Hacettepe University Technopolis and Mutlu Batteries . Total cost of the prototype was about US$17,000.

His career began in 1963, when he joined the Foreign Service as a clerical officer. Two years into his career, he was posted to the British embassy in Bonn, West Germany, and two years after that to Nigeria. From 1970 to 1972, Penfold served as a \\"floater\\" in Latin America, filling in as necessary for staff at British missions in the region. He served in Mexico during the 1970 football world cup, and on St Vincent, where he was responsible for organising an evacuation after a volcanic eruption. After Latin America, Penfold briefly served in Canberra, before returning to London to take a post in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). He earned early promotion to second secretary in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he was responsible for reporting on the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the Eritrean War of Independence and was still in the country during the revolution, in which the pro-Western emperor was overthrown. After completing his tour in Ethiopia, Penfold served as information officer in Port of Spain and then as first secretary in the West Africa Department of the FCO. Penfold's next overseas posting was to Kampala, Uganda, as deputy high commissioner. There, he persuaded President Milton Obote to attend the queen's birthday party for the first time. Two months later, Obote was overthrown in a coup, after which Penfold led an evacuation of foreign citizens to Kenya. The high commission remained open, and Penfold was still present six months later when a second coup took place. In 1987, he again returned to the FCO, this time serving in the West Indian and Atlantic Department, and four years later, he was appointed Governor of the British Virgin Islands. The main issues of Penfold's tenure were the establishment of the territory as an offshore financial centre and the smuggling of drugs through its waters until the sudden death of the chief minister. Penfold resolved the subsequent constitutional crisis by appointing the deputy chief minister as an interim replacement. Penfold's term as governor expired in 1996, after which he spent a year as a drugs adviser to the Caribbean before being appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone in 1997. Six weeks into Penfold's term, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was overthrown in a military coup and Penfold organised an evacuation of foreign citizens. After a hotel housing the remaining foreign nationals was attacked, Penfold organised a further evacuation, which was conducted by an American warship. The ship transported the evacuees‚Äîincluding Penfold‚Äîto Conakry in neighbouring Guinea. While in Conakry, Penfold advised Kabbah on re-establishing his government in exile, and leased a disused restaurant for the government's headquarters. Kabbah was restored in February 1998, but the role of the private military company Sandline International in assisting Kabbah created controversy in the United Kingdom, as its services were alleged to violate an arms embargo on Sierra Leone. After an HM Customs investigation, a parliamentary inquiry, and a select committee investigation, Penfold was reprimanded but allowed to return to his post. Later in the year, violence began to intensify again in Sierra Leone, and Penfold was ordered to evacuate foreign nationals (the eight evacuation of his career and the second in Sierra Leone) over Christmas 1998. He requested an extension to his term as high commissioner, but the request was denied and he left Sierra Leone in April 2000. He spent the last year of his career working for the Department for International Development and retired in 2001. In retirement, Penfold has spoken on issues concerning Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, and has been critical of the FCO. His support of Kabbah, and his role in returning him to power in 1998, earned Penfold folk hero status in Sierra Leone. Early life Penfold was born to Alfred and Florence (n√©e Green) in 1944 and educated at Sutton Grammar School for Boys, where he stayed on until 19. He left school with A-levels in French, German, and geography, and took casual employment to earn money. Having a desire to make use of his language qualifications, he began applying for jobs at multi-national companies. He applied to Her Majesty's Civil Service and passed the civil service exam, but was keen to join the Foreign Service. He took and passed a second exam to join the Foreign Service, but had to enter at a lower grade than he would have held in the Civil Service.Cullimore, p. 2. Early career 1963‚Äì1984: career beginnings Penfold's diplomatic career began as a clerical officer at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in London in 1963. In 1965, two years into his career, Penfold was posted to the British embassy in Bonn, West Germany, where he served as a clerical officer until 1968. At the end of his posting, he was sent to Kaduna, Nigeria, where he was one of only six staff. Penfold admitted that‚Äîhad he been able to choose his posting‚Äîhe would probably not have chosen Kaduna and may not have considered Africa, but the posting \\"started [his] love affair with Africa\\". He spent two years in Kaduna as one of the three junior staff who, unlike the senior staff, had no diplomatic privilege.Cullimore, p. 3. From 1970 to 1972, Penfold was a Latin American \\"floater\\"‚Äîpart of a pool of five staff who could be sent to assist diplomatic missions to provide support during busy times or to cover for staff leave.Cullimore, p. 4. Penfold's first assignment as Latin American floater was in Mexico City, where he acted as vice consul during the football world cup while many of the diplomatic staff were in Guadalajara, where the English national team were based. After the conclusion of the world cup, Penfold was sent to Ecuador, where he was responsible for overseeing renovation work to the ambassador's residence. He was in Ecuador for six months, after which he was sent to Uruguay to assist in the aftermath of the kidnapping of Ambassador Geoffrey Jackson. Six weeks later, he was ordered to Paraguay, where the British mission was staffed by a single diplomat, for whom Penfold would cover while they took leave. Penfold's final posting as a \\"floater\\" was to St Vincent, which at the time relied on the United Kingdom for defence and foreign policy matters. Three weeks after his arrival, the volcano on the island erupted, and Penfold was responsible for co-ordinating an evacuation by the Royal Navy.Cullimore, pp. 5‚Äì6. Of his term as Latin American floater, Penfold stated that he found the variety of tasks he performed \\"valuable experience\\" for his later career. After Latin America, he was immediately sent to Canberra in 1972, having been told that the passport officer there was dying. He arrived to find that there had been a misunderstanding regarding the passport officer's health. He stayed to assist for three months before returning to London, where he became a desk officer in the Pacific and Dependent Territories Department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). Working with the Overseas Development Administration, he was responsible for several small territories in the Pacific. During his tenure, Penfold turned down a job inside 10 Downing Street as part of a European Commission secretariat being set up by Prime Minister Ted Heath, believing the position to be inferior to the one he held.Cullimore, pp. 6‚Äì7. 1975‚Äì1987: Ethiopia and Uganda In 1975, while serving at the FCO, Penfold volunteered to learn a difficult language in the hope of advancing his career. After passing an aptitude test, he was assigned a professional language tutor and began learning Amharic‚Äîthe official language of Ethiopia‚Äîand after six weeks of tuition, was sent to Gondar to continue learning the language by living in Ethiopia. Shortly after, he was posted to Addis Ababa as second secretary, because the British ambassador to Ethiopia, Sir Willie Morris, was keen to have an Amharic-speaking second secretary. Penfold was responsible for monitoring and reporting on internal Ethiopian affairs and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), as the latter was based in Addis. As part of the role, Penfold was required to attend and report on meetings of the OAU, which took place all over Africa.Cullimore, pp. 8‚Äì9. On the instruction of Foreign Secretary David Owen, Penfold met with the leaders of the independence movement in Southern Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) at an OAU conference in Gabon in 1977. There he met separately with Bishop Muzorewa, Joshua Nkomo, and Robert Mugabe.Cullimore, p. 9. Penfold believed Mugabe to be difficult to work with, but later stated that it should have been obvious that Mugabe would come to power in Zimbabwe and that the British government could have made a greater effort to work with him.Cullimore, p. 10. Penfold's tenure in Ethiopia coincided with the Eritrean War of Independence, which Penfold was responsible for monitoring. To that end, he was required to covertly meet with Eritrean informants, sometimes smuggling them back to the British compound in the boot of his car, to keep up to date on the progress of the war. Penfold was also in the country during the Ethiopian Revolution, in which the pro-Western Emperor Haile Selassie I was overthrown by a faction of the military‚Äîwhich became the Derg‚Äîsympathetic to the Soviet Union. He remained in Ethiopia until 1978, when he was sent to Port of Spain as information officer, with responsibility for editing a magazine aimed at promoting British trade.Cullimore, pp. 10‚Äì11. Penfold returned to London in 1981, serving as first secretary in the West Africa Department of the FCO. At the time, the FCO had two career \\"streams\\"‚Äîone for non-graduates and a faster one for university graduates‚Äîand during his time in the West Africa Department, Penfold \\"bridged\\" into the faster stream.Cullimore, pp. 11‚Äì12. After \\"bridging\\", Penfold was promoted and posted to Kampala, Uganda, in 1984 as deputy high commissioner. He had attended an OAU conference in Uganda in the 1970s and was pleased to be posted there. Within a few weeks, the high commissioner took leave and Penfold became acting high commissioner. One of his first tasks was the 1985 high commission's queen's birthday party, which he postponed to allow President Milton Obote to attend‚Äîthe first time Obote attended a national day. Two months after the birthday party, Penfold was still acting high commissioner when he was informed of an impending coup. He notified the American, French, and UN representatives, after which he instructed all the British staff to move into the high commissioner's residence until the fighting was over.Cullimore, pp. 12‚Äì13. As shooting broke out on the outskirts of Kampala, Obote fled the country along with most of his ministers, leaving the country in chaos. The following day, Penfold travelled into the city centre with the American and UN representatives to determine who was in charge of the country and make contact with the new regime. He met a Ugandan Army major, to whom he expressed his concerns about the security situation and explained that foreign citizens would likely be evacuated, which happened three days later when Penfold led an evacuation by road to Kenya.Cullimore, p. 17. Although most foreign citizens had left, Penfold kept the British High Commission open and all the staff remained.Cullimore, p. 18. The Ugandan military began forming a government and attempted to include all tribes in the country, to which end Penfold assisted by meeting with Yoweri Museveni, leader of the National Resistance Army. Museveni refused to join the government and six months later led another coup and declared himself president.Cullimore, pp. 19‚Äì20. Penfold was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1986. 1987‚Äì1997: FCO and the British Virgin Islands Penfold returned to the FCO in 1987, where he was appointed to a position in the West Indian and Atlantic Department, which was responsible for the Caribbean and South Atlantic. The department was divided between British Dependent Territories (for which Penfold was responsible) and independent nations.Cullimore, p. 23. In the years before and during Penfold's tenure, the British dependencies had been the subject of several diplomatic incidents and were causing problems for the British government, to whom the international community looked to resolve problems with its dependent territories. The FCO had struggled to find new governors for the territories since the winding-up of the Colonial Service‚Äîwhich had historically provided most governors and many civil servants‚Äîin the 1960s. Thus, Penfold recommended in a policy paper that the Diplomatic Service be considered as a recruiting pool, and that governors be recruited earlier in their career rather than at the end. He also identified several posts which could be used for training potential governors, including the one he occupied and deputy governor posts such as that in Bermuda.Cullimore, p. 24. The government accepted Penfold's recommendations, to the extent that he was appointed Governor of the British Virgin Islands in 1991, which, at the age of 48, made him the youngest serving governor of a British territory. The governor represents the monarch and the British government, as well as presiding over the cabinet, but is also required to swear an oath to the constitution of the territory, which Penfold believed complicated the governor's role as a representative of the British government. Among Penfold's duties as governor was the purchase of an aeroplane to assist in combating drug smuggling through the territory and assisting in establishing the British Virgin Islands as an offshore financial centre; the number of registered companies in the Islands rose to 35,000 (more than double the population) during Penfold's tenure.Cullimore, pp. 25‚Äì26. As governor, Penfold became increasingly aware of growing resentment among the citizens of the British dependencies regarding their rights of entry and abode in the UK. He proposed that the territories be renamed \\"British overseas territories\\", and that their citizens be given equal rights of entry and abode‚Äîproposals that were eventually accepted.Cullimore, p. 30. At the end of Penfold's term, a constitutional crisis arose after Chief Minister Hamilton Lavity Stoutt died suddenly. The constitution of the territory contained no provision for the chief minister dying in office, and the death left the governing party without a majority in the assembly, so Penfold asked Deputy Chief Minister Ralph O'Neal to become \\"Chief Minister ad interim\\" to provide political stability.Cullimore, p. 28. Penfold was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1995 Birthday Honours for his service in the British Virgin Islands. After he had completed his term as governor in 1996, the FCO struggled to find a post for Penfold, so they appointed him to the newly created post of special drugs adviser to the Caribbean, in which he worked as part of a team of advisers from across the European Union assisting Caribbean governments in developing policies to combat the smuggling of illegal drugs.Who's Who Sierra Leone Military coup and first evacuation Although he enjoyed the posting as drugs adviser, Penfold was keen to go back to Africa. He applied for a post as high commissioner in Namibia, but the post was downgraded and the application fell through. Penfold was then offered a posting to Sierra Leone. Although it was a lower-ranking post than the British Virgin Islands, Penfold was assured that taking the position would not adversely affect his career, so he accepted and, in March 1997, was appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone. He later stated that he believed his previous experience in Africa, particularly in Uganda, stood him in good stead for the events of his posting to Sierra Leone.Cullimore, p. 31. The country was in the middle of a bloody civil war in 1997, and on 25 May‚Äîsix weeks into Penfold's tenure‚ÄîPresident Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's government was overthrown in a military coup. Although the coup itself did not come as a surprise, the timing caught the international community off-guard. As in Uganda a decade earlier, Penfold gathered all the high commission staff and their families under one roof.Fowler, p. 42.Cullimore, pp. 31‚Äì32. Kabbah was evacuated to Conakry in neighbouring Guinea almost as soon as fighting broke out, and the coup-makers established the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) with Johnny Paul Koroma as its chairman. The following day, Penfold invited Koroma and several of his associates, along with representatives of Nigeria, the United States, and the UN, to a meeting at the British high commissioner's residence. He found it remarkable that they all attended, but believed it epitomised the esteem in which the office of British high commissioner was held in Sierra Leone.Cullimore, p. 34. At the meeting, Koroma agreed to open the country's main airport temporarily the next day, which allowed Penfold to organise the evacuation of several planeloads of foreign nationals.Cullimore, p. 35. The men agreed to reconvene the following day and the meetings continued throughout the week, though almost all diplomatic missions‚Äîincluding those of the UN and US‚Äîclosed over the course of the week, leaving just the British and Nigerians in Freetown. In that time, Penfold believed he had persuaded the coup-makers to stand down and allow Kabbah to return but, unbeknownst to the diplomats, the AFRC had invited the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)‚Äîthe main rebel group in the civil war‚Äîto form a joint government in Freetown.Cullimore, pp. 36‚Äì37. Days after the arrival of the RUF, on 2 June, rebels and soldiers attacked the Mammy Yoko hotel‚Äîwhere around 800 foreign citizens had gathered under the protection of Nigerian soldiers‚Äîin response to a Nigerian naval bombardment of Freetown.Fowler, p. 44. Penfold was able to see the firefight from the high commission building, and telephoned the Sierra Leonean defence headquarters to demand an end to the violence, threatening to request the deployment of US Marines from the USS Kearsarge, which was anchored offshore. The defence headquarters promptly ordered an end to the shooting, and the occupants of the hotel were evacuated to another nearby hotel for the night and then to the USS Kearsarge the next morning (3 June).Dorman, p. 40. In addition, Penfold and the remaining members of his staff (most of the staff and all their families had already left) were ordered to evacuate on the Kearsarge, despite Penfold's objections. The Kearsarge sailed to Conakry, where Kabbah had been staying since the beginning of the coup.Cullimore, pp. 38‚Äì40. No country recognised the military junta, and the international community continued to recognise the exiled Kabbah government as the legitimate government of Sierra Leone. Kabbah re-established his government in Conakry, basing it in a former Chinese restaurant leased by the British government through Penfold. There, Penfold advised Kabbah on keeping up the government's presence on the international stage, such as by ensuring that a representative was sent to international meetings.Cullimore, p. 41. He also continued to run the British diplomatic mission in Freetown; the high commission continued to pay its local staff and began smuggling food and money into Sierra Leone. During the ten months in which the Kabbah government was exiled, Penfold‚Äîwith funds from the British Department for International Development (DfID)‚Äîalso assisted in the setting up of a covert radio station, which broadcast on behalf of the exiled government.Cullimore, p. 42. Sandline affair From Conakry, Penfold also assisted Kabbah in negotiations with Sandline International‚Äîa private military company led by Tim Spicer, a former British Army officer‚Äîwhom Kabbah intended to hire to lead a counter-coup. Sandline had been contracted to provide assistance to the Nigerian-led forces in Sierra Leone at a time when relations between the UK and Nigeria were poor, so Penfold used Sandline personnel to liaise with the Nigerians to provide intelligence for Kabbah and the British High Commission. In February 1998, a coalition of Nigerian troops and local militia‚Äîassisted by Sandline‚Äîrestored Kabbah to power, and Penfold was transported back to Freetown by a British warship. The role of Sandline, however, sparked a political controversy in the United Kingdom, as the company was accused of violating an international arms embargo on Sierra Leone. Penfold was ordered back to the UK, where he was investigated by HM Customs and Excise for allegedly assisting Spicer in violating the embargo.Cullimore, p. 44. Customs dropped their investigation after deciding it was not in the public interest to prosecute anybody, but Foreign Secretary Robin Cook ordered a parliamentary inquiry into what the FCO knew about Sandline's contract with Kabbah.Gberie, p. 117.Cullimore, p. 46. Penfold received a reprimand for failing to report adequately on his dealings with Sandline,Cullimore, pp. 46‚Äì47. and the inquiry‚Äîled by Sir Thomas Legg‚Äîrecommended better communication between the FCO and the high commissioner.Kampfner, p. 68. In Sierra Leone, Penfold was widely considered a hero for his role in restoring Kabbah. While he was giving evidence to the inquiry, 20,000 people took part in a demonstration demanding his return to Sierra Leone, and upon his arrival at Lungi airport, he was appointed an honorary Paramount Chief‚Äîbecoming only the third person to be granted the honour since Sierra Leone's independence‚Äîand was greeted by large crowds.Cullimore, p. 48. Shortly after his return, Penfold was again summoned back to London to face an investigation by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee. He gave evidence in a televised session in which he stated his belief that the Sandline controversy was a peripheral issue and that the FCO should be focusing on supporting the newly restored Kabbah government. The committee's report expressed concern about Penfold's role with regard to Sandline, but believed he \\"acted as he thought was in the best interests of the United Kingdom and of Sierra Leone, and that he did not consider that his actions went beyond government policy\\".Dorman, p. 41. Penfold stated after his retirement that he felt Sierra Leone became a \\"political football\\" in the UK and that, had the FCO's focus not been distracted by the Sandline issue, later problems in Sierra Leone might have been avoided.Cullimore, pp. 48‚Äì49. Second evacuation, Lom√© Accord, and replacement Towards the end of 1998, the RUF began to re-mobilise in northern Sierra Leone. As tensions escalated, the FCO ordered an evacuation of British citizens just before Christmas. Penfold believed the evacuation‚Äîthe eighth of his career‚Äîwas unnecessary and argued against it; his objections were over-ruled and he was ordered to evacuate his staff, though he was allowed to remain in Freetown with his military protection detail. The Royal Air Force evacuated approximately 35 people, but many British people chose to stay. Penfold travelled to Abidjan after Christmas for an international summit on Sierra Leone, but the FCO refused to allow him to return to Sierra Leone, so he again based himself in a hotel in Conakry. The RUF attacked Freetown on 6 January 1999. After 10 days of fighting, the rebels were pushed back and Penfold was transported back to Sierra Leone by a British warship. He flew to Freetown for daily meetings with Kabbah, but was not allowed to move back into his residence and so temporarily lived on the ship.Cullimore, p. 50. Later in 1999, the Sierra Leone government entered into negotiations which resulted in the Lom√© Peace Agreement. Penfold opposed power-sharing with the RUF, and believed he was excluded from the talks in Lom√© because of his views. The agreement did not hold, and violence again broke out in early 2000.Cullimore, p. 51. Penfold's term as high commissioner expired in April 2000. He requested a British military adviser be sent to Sierra Leone, as well as an extension to his own term, both of which were denied. He left the country on 30 April and was succeeded by Alan Jones. After returning to the UK, he applied for multiple posts but was turned down for each. He was asked to take early retirement, but was keen to retire on his own terms. He eventually took a job as a conflict adviser to DfID, having developed what he described as \\"a very good relationship with ... [the] DfID\\".Cullimore, p. 52. Retirement In retirement, Penfold has been critical of the FCO's attitude towards Africa, and has expressed the view that it does not give high enough priority to the continent. He stated in an interview that he felt the FCO was keen to develop experts in other areas, such as Europe and the Middle East, but \\"Africa is the place where anybody can do it so long as they have average intelligence\\". Since retiring, he has taken on roles with various charities and other organisations focusing on Africa and Sierra Leone, including New Africa Analysis, the UK Association for Schools for the Blind, Sierra Leone (which supports the Sir Milton Margai School for the Blind in Freetown), and the Dorothy Springer Trust. He is considered a folk hero in Sierra Leone,Kampfner, p. 67.Fowler, p. 53. and continues to speak on issues relating to Sierra Leone. He was vocal in his opposition to indictment of Samuel Hinga Norman‚Äîa pro-Kabbah militia leader during the civil war‚Äîfor war crimes by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and to the special court itself.Gberie, pp. 117‚Äì118. He described the special court as an \\"expensive and divisive piece of judicial machinery\\" which served little purpose following the deaths of most of the prominent defendants, and believed that its continuation \\"could undermine the fragile peace\\" in Sierra Leone.Gberie, p. 123. Penfold was granted the Freedom of the City of Freetown and given the honorary title of Paramount Chief for his role in Sierra Leone,Gberie, p. 124. and has written a book about his experiences in the country, Atrocities, Diamonds and Diplomacy (). Personal life Penfold met his first wife-to-be while serving on St Vincent as Latin American floater. He was planning his wedding at the end of his term in Latin America but was persuaded to postpone it due to the urgency with which he was required in Canberra, and the wedding eventually took place later in 1972. The couple had three children, but his wife did not enjoy the overseas postings. They divorced in 1984 and Penfold travelled to Kampala alone. While in Uganda, Penfold met his second wife-to-be, Celia, who was working for the World Bank. They married while Penfold was Governor of the British Virgin Islands, making Penfold the first British governor to get married in-post. Both Penfold and his wife consider themselves committed Christians,Cullimore, p. 49. and Penfold has stated that, \\"as a Christian, I have felt more at home in Africa\\".Gberie, p. 125.

Postgraduate training, providing the opportunity to get a PhD, is also available. History St. Petersburg State Pediatric Medical University (SPbSPMU), formerly known as Leningrad Pediatric Medical Institute (LPMI) is the oldest independent pediatric university in the world. It was founded in 1925 as the Institute for Protection of Maternity and Infancy. The main building of University was settled on the territory of City Children's Hospital, which had been founded in 1905. The Children's Hospital was built as a series of separated pavilions to prevent spreading of infectious diseases. There were 650 beds in the hospital which had a staff consisting of 28 physicians, 2 paramedics, 56 sisters of mercy, 232 nurses and a number of other staff. During the period of Russian Civil War(1918‚Äì1920) the hospital was neglected, but the large number of orphaned children after the war led authorities to provide more funding, and on January 7, 1925, the Scientific- Practical Institute of Maternity and Infancy Protection, named after Clara Zetkin, opened. The structure of the institute was remodeled and included 11 clinical departments, a baby house, an infant house, the department to qualify children conditions, 3 clinics with up to 500 beds in each of them, an outpatient clinic, a children consulting center, and milk stations. From the year of 1925 until 1949, the institute was headed by Yulia Aronovna Mendeleeva. The chief of hospital was D.S. Tumarkin. In 1928, the scientific work began in the institute. The first departments of science and the PhD department emerged. Later, the institute became the Scientific Research Institute of Maternity and Infancy Protection and kept this status till 1932. The newly created departments of Physiology, Social Hygiene of Woman and Child, Hygiene and Nutrition Science Early Ages, Pathology of Children, Roentgenology, Child Phthisiatry, Acute Child Infections got involved in intensive teaching and research activities. In 1932 the institute was transformed into the higher medical educational institution- \\"the clinic-med school\\". The country struggled with getting enough qualified medical specialists, and the child mortality still remained high. The government had to expand a net of clinical and preventive institutions and to establish health care in houses and correctional institutions for orphans. Soon, the whole department of maternity and infancy protection with professors and students of the First Leningrad Medical Institute was transferred to the Pediatric Institute. 82 students were registered for the fall semester of their first year. In 1935 \\"the clinic-med school\\" was reorganized into Leningrad Pediatric Medical Institute (LPMI), the first in the world specialized medical school for pediatricians training. There was the first graduate class of 51 child doctors in 1936. Upon the beginning of WWII, the institute trained 530 and improved training of 300 physicians. There were somatic, surgical, infectious, neurological, tuberculosis, venereal, obstetric, gynecological departments in the institute. Special attention was paid to prevention of infectious diseases. The quantity of beds in the hospital approached 1215 in 1940. Throughout all years of World War II, the institute continued clinical, research, educational and organizational work. The majority of faculty and clinical staff remained in Leningrad, surrounded by German troops. On the German military maps, the pediatric institute had a specific number of 708 and had to be vanished. On the territory of institute, surgical and infectious hospitals were opened to treat soldiers and citizens. The Siege of Leningrad captured more than 400 thousands of children, interrupting their evacuation. Many of those children survived only because of self-sacrificing work of Leningrad's pediatricians. To save lives of little citizens of Leningrad, there were created 18 baby formulas with soy, malt, and other components. Every day, the institute's milk station fed more than 8000 babies. The main theme of research work changed and became closely related to the wartime. Distrophic conditions in children, vitamins deficiencies, war traumas were studied, described in monographies and PhD works. There were opened classes with studying of blood transfusion, the system of \\"the only pediatrician\\", nutrition of healthy and sick children, and infectious diseases and classes of continuing education for state infection control and prevention controllers, district pediatricians, and school physicians. Two times a month, pediatricians of Leningrad visited clinical rounds. Moreover, the institute trained staff of factories for diseases control and prevention. In the 50s, the institute increased quantity of applicants up to 600. Experience and knowledge of faculty members became a base of Russian pediatrics and were summarised in medical textbooks and monographies: Studies of Child, Diagnosis and Prognosis, M.S.Maslov's Textbook of Child Diseases and Handbook of Dietetics of Yearly Child Ages, A.F.Tur's Child Hematology, M.D. Danilevitch's Basics of Child Infections, G.A.Bairov's Urgent Surgery of Newborns, N.P.Shabalov's Neonatology. According to the order of Ministry of Healthcare, the institute became Saint-Petersburg Pediatric Medical Institute in 1992 and then received a status of academy in 1994. In 2012 received a status of university. Currently, the University has 70 departments. More than 700 applicants become students of the University every year. To the year of 2000, more than 25000 physicians graduated from SpbSPMU, including 2000 physicians from foreign countries. The training of foreign students started in 1949. More than 3500 physicians improved their qualification on the Faculty of Continuing Education. Now, the University hospital is a multiprofile healthcare institution with 815 beds and contains 5 clinics of a somatic profile and 10 specialized departments. Scientists of the University have significantly influenced the development of basic science studies and clinical pediatric studies. The most famous of them were E.S.London in Pathophysiology; F.I.Valker, D.D.Lokhov, A.G.Knorre in Morphology; A.G. Gynecinsky in Physiology; B.M.

Thus, the optimization of a linear objective over the integral points of such a polyhedron can be done using techniques from linear programming. A linear system Ax\\\\le b, where A and b are rational, is called totally dual integral (TDI) if for any c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^n such that there is a feasible, bounded solution to the linear program : \\\\begin{align} &&\\\\max c^\\\\mathrm{T}x \\\\\\\\\\\\ && Ax\\\\le b, \\\\end{align} there is an integer optimal dual solution.

Thus, if a linear program as above is solved by the simplex algorithm, the optimal solution returned will be integer. Further, Giles and Pulleyblank showed that if P is a polytope whose vertices are all integer valued, then P is the solution set of some TDI system Ax\\\\le b, where b is integer valued.

Little is recorded about Nyarroh prior to the 1880s; however, British reports in the 1880s consider her one of the main chiefs in the area with control over important roads from the coast to inland areas. Nyarroh's position at a critical juncture led her to host many negotiations between British officers and the Mende chiefs in the interior of the country. Like many of the other Mende chiefs, she took an active role in warfare and in 1887 she was taken captive and held for many months. She signed a friendship agreement with the British in 1890 and became part of their administration of the colony until her death in 1914. Chieftainship Nyarroh was the chief of the town of Bandasuma (modern Bandajuma) and gained other land to become the chief of the entire Barrie region on the Moa River in the present-day country of Sierra Leone. Not much is recorded about Nyarroh's life prior to 1885 when she became a key mediator in British efforts in the interior of Sierra Leone. Oral histories say that Nyarroh became the chief of Bandasuma after the death of her husband Kahjay who was the chief of the village. She expanded her control over a greater land area and became the chief of the entire Barrie region. Most of the addition was the result of a gift from Boakie Gomna the Tunkia chief who had become her Nyarroh's lover after the death of her husband. A separate oral tradition contends that she at one point controlled land on the East side of the Moa River (the land around modern wildlife sanctuary of Tiwai Island), but that that land was gifted to another chief who became her lover as well. The Barrie region controlled by Nyarroh was bordered by the Tunkia chiefdom to the north and the Moa river to the West. The area gained significance with British efforts to bring the interior Mende country into its colonial government because it was at a key crossroads leading from the coastal towns to the important Mende chiefs in the far interior. Although in official British reports she was referred to as Queen Nyarroh, this is likely due to indiscriminate usage of the title by British officers when dealing with indigenous authorities, and she was a chief under the power of Mendengla, one of the four primary Mende kings. Her authority is contested by different historians with Arthur Abraham claiming that Nyarroh saw increased power largely to serve British colonial efforts and she had limited power prior to British colonial involvement. In contrast, Lynda R. Day argues that Nyarroh was able to play a unique role as a mediator between British and indigenous interests because women had a traditional role as mediators in Mende society. Mediator Nyarroh became important in British reports as a key mediating force in negotiations between the British, the coastal chiefs, and the chiefs in the interior during the 1880s and 1890s. Her first recorded involvement was with Nyarroh as the key chief mediating the fighting over control of the Massaquoi kingdom, which was a key location on the Moa river in between the coastal chiefs and the interior chiefs. Two chiefs were trying to gain control over the kingdom with Boakie Gomna supported by the inland chiefs, including Jabati, Nyarroh and Mendengla. Fawundu, in contrast, was supported by the coastal chieftains such as Momo Kai Kai and others. Most of the coastal chieftains were under British treaties of protection and so when these communities began being attacked during the struggle the British sent officers to the inland chiefs to negotiate an end to the violence. The mission entered Bandasuma where they reported that Nyarroh spoke English quite well and that she was willing to organize a meeting between Samuel Rowe, the British governor of the territory, and many of the chiefs of the interior. Nyarroh cleared the roads for Rowe's arrival and hosted the meetings in Bandasuma for two weeks. Since Mendengla was not in attendance, she arranged to have messengers keeping him in contact throughout the meeting. Rowe convinced many of the chiefs of the interior to sign peace agreements with the coastal chiefs. Mendengla did not sign the agreement but did not prevent its signature by the chiefs in the area either. Following this peace agreement though, Kubah, a war chief (a mercenary who controlled his own troops and aligned with different leaders) who had been one of the primary participants in the conflict over the Massaquoi kingdom became upset because of the decreased opportunities for raiding that this would offer him. Perceived as a threat to her rule, Nyarroh killed Kubah in November 1885 in Bandasuma. Another war chief, Ndawa, had been a key ally of Kubah (brother in some reports) and so began a series of campaigns against Nyarroh to avenge Kubah's death. On 11 April 1887, Ndawa succeeded by sacking Bandasuma and taking Nyarroh hostage. The British took an active role in trying to negotiate her release from Ndawa but Ndawa refused most of the gestures. Information about her release are not recorded but she was released and returned as the Barri chief by 1888. In the years which followed, Bandasuma became a key neutral site for meetings between the British and the inland chiefs under Mendengla. This was followed with an 1893 meeting hosted by Nyarroh between the British governor of the territory, now Francis Fleming, and all the chiefs of the interior, including Mendengla. These meetings yielded gradually increased British prominence in the region. In 1890, she signed a treaty of friendship with the British and as a result was provided a British government stipend as chief of the region. She remained chief under British rule until her death in 1914. Her daughter followed her as chief but the importance of Bandasuma decreased significantly in the early 20th century.

Seven were built in 1926 and 1927, and were used to operate airmail services. Design and development In early 1925, Eiji Sekiguchi, chief designer of the aircraft department of Kawanishi Kikai Setsakuho (Kawanishi Machinery Manufacturing Works), started work on a long- range floatplane for use by Nippon Koku K.K. the airline subsidiary of Kawanishi on airmail services. The resulting design, the Kawanishi K-8A, was a single-engined monoplane with a fabric covered wooden structure. It was powered by a Maybach Mb.IVa water-cooled inline-engine, as used in Kawanishi's successful K-7 biplane, but was larger and heavier than the K-7. The aircraft was fitted with a twin-float undercarriage, while the crew of two sat in open cockpits. The first prototype was completed in January 1926 with a shoulder- wing layout, but following aircraft had the wing raised to a parasol wing arrangement. The aircraft demonstrated relatively poor performance, but showed good stability, making it popular for long-distance flights. A total of 5 K-8As were completed in 1926, all going to Nippon Koku K.K.. The design attracted the attention of the Teiko Kaibo Gitai, (the Imperial Maritime Defence Volunteer Association), a patriotic organization, who placed an order for two modified aircraft, the Kawanishi K-8B, with reduced span wings, a slimmer fuselage and the crew cockpits moved rearwards. These two aircraft were completed in 1927, demonstrating improved performance. Operational history The five K-8As were all used by Nippon Koku for its airmail service between Osaka and Fukuoka. The two K-8Bs were used to carry out two formation tours around Japan in April and May 1927 in an effort to promote aviation. They were then leased free-of-charge to Nippon Koku on the condition that they would be transferred to the Imperial Japanese Navy on request. They joined the K-8As on the Osaka‚ÄìFukuoa airmail route, and were heavily used before they were retired in April 1929.

It belongs to the family of monomethine cyanine dyes and is a tetracationic homodimer of Oxazole Yellow (abbreviated YO, hence the name YOYO), typically available as tetraiodide salt. In aqueous buffer, free YOYO-1 dye (absorption: Œªmax 458 nm, emission: Œªmax 564 nm) has very low fluorescence quantum yield, however the intensity of fluorescence increases 3200 times upon binding through bis- intercalation to double-stranded DNA (absorption: Œªmax 489 nm, emission: Œªmax 509 nm). Synthesis YOYO-1 is prepared by alkylation of N,N,N‚Äô,N‚Äô-tetramethyl-1,3-propanediamine with 2 equivalents of N-(3-iodopropyl) analogue of Oxazole Yellow, which is available in three steps from 2-mercaptobenzoxazole: YOYO-1 synthesis Photophysics The molar attenuation coefficient at the absorption peak of YOYO-1 is nearly 105 cm‚àí1M‚àí1, among the high values of typical organic dyes. The fluorescence quantum yield of YOYO-1 in water is very small (<0.1%) and thus nonfluorescent. Upon binding to DNA, its quantum yield enhances >1000 fold and reaches up to 50%, among the brightest fluorescent organic dyes. Under light excitation, photoblinking and photobleaching are observed for YOYO-1 in DNA. The latter is also believed to be the cause of the photocleavage of the host DNA molecules by generating reactive free radicals. Two major mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to explain why YOYO-1 is not fluorescent in the polar solvents but is fluorescent when intercalated in the DNA base pairs. The first one is intramolecular charge transfer and the second is intermolecular charge transfer. Both are still actively under examination on which one being dominating. The intramolecular charge transfer mechanism was established around the 1980s. Under light illumination in water, the excited electron in the molecule shifts its probability across the methine group which enables the molecule to rotate along with the methine group, a photoisomerization reaction. This rotation relaxes the energy nonradiatively thus the molecule is not fluorescent. However, when YOYO-1 is intercalated into the DNA base pairs, it gets stuck and cannot rotate. Thus the molecule stays fluorescent. The intermolecular charge transfer mechanism was proposed in 2018. YOYO-1 is weakly bonded with the polar solvent molecules. When it is excited by light, an electron-hole pair is created in the molecule. The hole is able to get an extra electron from the solvent that created a negatively charged YOYO-1 radical and a positively charged radical in the solution. Most time the radical neutralize each other very quickly and nonradiatively. This is a Dexter electron transfer process that quenches the fluorescence and creates the rotation of the YOYO-1 molecule. As such, the rotation is a product of the quenching, not the cause of the quenching proposed in the intramolecular charge transfer mechanism. There is a small probability that the radicals separate each other and diffuse away, which then makes the YOYO-1 molecule susceptible to photobleaching. When the YOYO-1 molecules are intercalated in the DNA molecule, the hydrophobic base pairs greatly reduce the radical formation because DNA is a poor electrical conductor. Thus the fluorescent quenching by the solvent is greatly reduced. The small number of leaking charges create long-lived radicals and cut the DNA backbones that results in a DNA photocleavage. This mechanism has been supported by the data in femtosecond ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. If the intramolecular charge transfer mechanism dominates the fluorescent quenching of YOYO-1 in water, then one can add bulky ligand to stop or slow down the rotation to increase its quantum yield in water. However, if the intermolecular charge transfer dominates, one can modify the molecule to stop the charge transfer between YOYO-1 and water either by charge passivation, or ligand modification to shift its redox potentials. Applications The major applications of YOYO-1 are for DNA staining. Under normal conditions and pH level, the four positive charge of each YOYO-1 molecule makes it very easy to bind to DNA molecules which have negatively charged backbones. The dye then readily intercalates into the DNA either with one end or two ends depending on the annealing temperature and room available. The DNA then lights up under a fluorescence microscope with very small background from the unbound YOYO-1. The measurement can be at bulk ensemble level or at the single-molecule level. The latter has enabled ultra-high resolution using a super-resolution microscopy. With high illumination power, the dye is known to generate free radicals which then photocleave DNA strands.

Prior to amalgamation in 2001, the neighbourhood was in the City of Nepean. It is bounded east by row houses off Bayshore Drive, to the north Carling Avenue, to the west Holly Acres Drive and the Lakeview neighbourhood, and to the south Ontario Highway 417. The main street in Bayshore is Woodridge Crescent, while the Bayshore Station is the major bus transit station. According to the Canada 2016 Census, the neighbourhood had a population of 5,585.Statistics Canada, Population for Dissemination Blocks 35061387036 and 35061388001 The neighbourhood is characterized by rental communities. The homes are townhouses (row houses), garden homes and high-rise condominiums buildings. Most of the population in the community features different ethnic groups. Most immigrants are from the Philippines (330), Iraq (315), and Afghanistan (205). The neighbourhood has a large Muslim population. The 2011 National Household Survey reported that 34% of the people in Bayshore's Census Tract were Muslim.http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp- pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1;=CT&Code1;=0917&Data;=Count&SearchText;=5050138.00&SearchType;=Begins&SearchPR;=01&A1;=All&B1;=All&Custom;=&TABID;=3 History The community was first built in 1963-1965. The developer was the Minto Group which is a significant developer of rental and non-rental communities in Ottawa. In the 1970s and 1980s more townhouses and high-rises were built. In the early 2000s, the community changed ownership to Ferguslea Properties Inc, which is owned by Dan Greenberg. In 2013, Ferguslea announced that they would manage Accora Village, and all staff became employees of Ferguslea. The main attraction is the Bayshore Shopping Centre which was built in 1973 and had two floors extended in 1987. Bayshore underwent a $270 million renovation, that included a new parking garage, updates to the mall, and the addition of several stores such as H&M;, Victoria's Secret and Zara. Target was supposed to open a location in the mall, but plans were cancelled when Target pulled out of the country in 2015. This space is now occupied by Walmart. In 2011, Ferguslea Properties Ltd, the owner of 2,465 units in the area, announced their plan to invest $40 million into the community. They also announced the community would be renamed Accora Village. Accora Village Accora Village is home to 2,465 units, with approximately 7,000 residents. The community features 10 high-rise apartment buildings, and a range of townhomes and garden homes. Accora Village also offers its residents a recreation centre, named the Accora Centre. The Accora Centre holds an indoor pool, a gymnasium, a weight room, a lounge, and party rooms. The community is undergoing renovations to revamp the buildings. Its first apartment building to undergo complete renovations is Cobalt, located at 90 Woodridge Crescent. Accora Village was the 2013 recipient of the Crime-Free Multi-Housing Program's Rental Owner of the Year award, for its commitment to ensuring safety and security in the community. Education Within the bounds of the community there are two elementary schools. Bayshore Public School is an English Public elementary schoolhttp://www.ocdsb.ca/sch/20102011%20Elementary%20School%20Profile/BAYS.pdf providing Grade JK-6. The school's programs include a Regular English Program and an English as a Second Language program.http://www.ocdsb.ca/sch/Lists/Elementary%20Schools/DispForm.aspx?ID=8&Source;=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ocdsb.ca%2Fsch%2FPages%2Fdefault.aspx&IsDlg;=1 Parent resources are available in Arabic, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Persian, Polish, Punjabi and Urdu. St. Rose of Lima School (formerly Bayshore Catholic School) is a somewhat smaller English Catholic elementary school providing Grade JK-6 The school's programs include English, and French Immersion programs.http://ros.ocsb.ca/our-school Recreation For recreation, there is the Bayshore Community Centre, with an indoor gym and an indoor swimming pool. Bayshore Park features a baseball diamond and a few soccer fields. There is a National Capital Commission (NCC) bike path that goes along the western border of the neighborhood. The bike path goes to Kanata in the west and central Ottawa to the east. In late 2013, Ferguslea Properties, the Senators Foundation, and the City of Ottawa announced their commitment to build the next rink of dreams, to be located in the middle of Accora Village, in Bayshore Park. Entertainment There is a movie theater owned by Cineplex Entertainment called \\"Cineplex Cinemas\\", previously called \\"the Coliseum\\" on Carling Avenue just outside the neighborhood. In that location there was once a drive-in movie theater and a 6-plex movie theatre called Britannia 6. In 1998 they were both demolished to make way for the Coliseum.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Condover, the archdeaconry of Ludlow, and the diocese of Hereford. Its benefice is united with those of St Michael and All Angels, All Stretton, and All Saints, Little Stretton to form the parish of Church Stretton. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History The nave of the church dates from the 12th century, and the transepts from the following century. The chancel and the upper stage of the tower are from the 15th century. The south vestry was added in 1831, and west aisles were added to the transepts during a restoration by S. Pountney Smith in 1867‚Äì68. There were further restorations in 1882 and in 1932. In 2010 the interior of the church was modernised by replacing the pews with movable chairs, and by installing new heating, lighting and sound systems. Architecture Exterior Constructed in stone with tiled roofs, the church has a cruciform plan, consisting of a nave and chancel, north and south transepts, each with a west aisle, and a tower at the crossing. The nave is Norman in style, and the rest of the church is Early English, other than the top stage of the tower, which is Perpendicular. The tower is in three stages, with corner and central gargoyles. There are lancet windows in the lower and middle stages, and a clock face on the east side of the middle stage. The top stage contains two-light, flat-headed, louvred bell openings, and at the summit is a battlemented parapet with elaborate corner finials. The tower has diagonal buttresses, that at the southeast angle being carved with the figure of St Laurence. The nave has Norman buttresses, and two Norman doorways, one on the north and the other on the south. Above the north doorway is a re-set sheila-na-gig. The other doorways are Early English. The west window and windows in the transepts contain Decorated-style tracery, the tracery in the east window being Perpendicular. Interior Inside the church, all the roofs are medieval. In the southwest corner of the chancel is a window with a piscina in its sill. The reredos was constructed in about 1820, re-using 17th- century panelling. The font is octagonal and Perpendicular in style. The pulpit dates from 1880, is made of stone and different marbles, and was designed by Samuel Pountney Smith. In the ceiling of the tower is a sculpture dating from about 1970 depicting St Laurence and his attribute, a gridiron. Some of the windows on the north and south sides of the chancel contain medieval glass, and others have Flemish roundels. The glass in the east window is by Betton and Evans of Shrewsbury, and in the nave is an early window by Burlison and Grylls. In the west side of the south transept is a memorial window to Lord Leighton of Stretton, former President of the Royal Academy, commemorating the fact he took his title from the town.The Story of St. Laurence Parish Church, Church Stretton by A.H. Horrocks (1979 edition), publisher Tower Publications, Cheltenham; unpaginated. Another memorial window, with plaque, commemorates writer Hesba Stretton, depicting the central character of her novel, Jessica's First Prayer. The church contains within the north transept framed rolls of honour to the respective parish dead of both World Wars and a plaque to 2nd Lieutenant Guy Barnett, killed at Battle of Neuve Chapelle in World War I. The two-manual pipe organ was made in 1883 by Nicholson of Worcester, and restored by the same company in 1987. There is a ring of eight bells. Four of these were cast in 1711 by Abraham Rudhall I of Gloucester, and the other four in 1890 by John Taylor and Company of Loughborough. External features In the churchyard are 13 listed structures, each of which is designated at Grade II. To the north and west of the church are walls, stiles and gates. To the south of the south transept is a sundial. This originated as a medieval churchyard cross, whose shaft is sunk into a former mill wheel. On the top are two brass dials, one overlying the other. The gnomon is missing. The other items are all memorials, which stand to the east and the south of the church.

It declared itself the supreme authority in Ukraine after the October Revolution. The committee was created on the night November 7-8, 1917 at the closed door session of the Executive Committee of Central Council of Ukraine with representatives of revolutionary organizations of Ukraine. It was dissolved in couple of days and transferred its authority of the General Secretariat of Ukraine. Composition The committee consisted of the following representatives from: * Central Council of Ukraine * All-Ukrainian Soviet of soldiers deputies * Ukrainian General Military Committee * Chief Railway Committee * National political parties * Soviets of workers and soldiers deputies of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa, Yekaterinoslav List of members: Mykola Porsh (chairman), Mykhailo Tkachenko, Oleksandr Sevryuk, Mykola Kovalevsky, Andriy Nikovsky, Fedir Matushevsky, Yuriy Pyatakov, Mykyta Shapoval, Solomon Goldelman, S.Saradzhev, Anatoliy Pisotsky, Symon Petlyura, Mykola Shumytsky, Mykhailo Telezhynsky, Hryhoriy Kasyanenko, Isaak Kreisberg, Volodymyr Zatonsky, Moisei Rafes, Moisei Zilbelfarb. Development On November 9, 1917 in its announcement to residents of Ukraine the committee reported that it concentrate functions of central power in its hands and being responsible to the Central Council of Ukraine. The committee created a revolutionary headquarters for organization of military forces and presented a request to the commander of Kyiv Military District Mikhail Kvetsinsky that all military units will be subordinated to the orders of the Ukrainian General Military Committee (UHVK), while orders of a commander and district headquarters were controlled by a commissariat of nine people that the committee created. The committee also requested to depose the representative of the Provisional Government Ivan Kiriyenko. The committee, however, was not able to control the situation. The administration of the Kyiv Military District (KVO) refused to recognize the committee and after the fall of the Provisional Government of Russia considered itself the only legitimate power in the city. It rejected the committee's request and arrested its members of commissariat who were sent for negotiations. In order to reach a consensus with the headquarters of KVO, Symon Petlyura personally as the chairman of UHVK arrived for negotiations. The district administration refused any further negotiations with the committee that included bolsheviks. Committee dissolved After the executive committee of Central Council of Ukraine condemned the Bolshevik coup d'√©tat in Petrograd on November 8, 1917 adopting an appropriate resolution, next day bolsheviks left the committee. The same day in support of the Petrograd Uprising, they conducted a united session with representatives of soviets, trade unions and military units in the building of Bergogne Theater. The assembly created the Kyiv city bolshevik revolutionary committee in preparation to overthrow the power led by Leonid Pyatakov, brother of Yuri Pyatakov. On November 11, 1917 the members of the new Bolshevik Kyiv revolutionary committee were arrested. In protest against further negotiations with the Kyiv Military District, the members of the rest Ukrainian political parties left the regional committee as well. Due to such situation the committee was forced to dissolve and on November 10, 1917 transferred its authority to the General Secretariat of Ukraine. Bibliography * 1917 in Kyiv: chronology of events.

Grover, and D. Stamatelakis.Asthana, R.; Singh, Y.N.; Grover, W.D.; , \\"p-Cycles: An overview,\\" IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials , vol.12, no.1, pp.97-111, First Quarter 2010  Overview of the p-Cycle  In Transport communication networks two methods were developed and introduced for restoration and recovery, one was a ring- based protection and the other was mesh restoration.Claus G. Gruber and Dominic A. Schupke.; , \\"Capacity-efficient Planning of Resilient Networks with p-Cycles,\\". 2002. The ring based protection offered a quick recovery time at the expense of higher capacity redundancy, while the mesh restoration offered better capacity-efficiency at the expense of slower recovery times. In 1998 the p-Cycle became a promising technique for recovery in mesh networks because of the combined benefits of ring network recovery speed and mesh like capacity efficiency. In a mesh network, the spare capacity is used to create the ring like structures as shown in Figure 1. Due to the nature of the rings assuming bi-directional line switched ring (BLSR), only 2 end nodes are involved in a case of a link failure to switch traffic to a pre-planned cycle (path) and recover, as it is demonstrated in Figure 2. Fig 1. p-Cycle in a mesh network creating ring like structure. Fig 2. Failure on a p-cycle showing the 2 nodes involved in recovery. Fig 3. Failure of straddling span and recovery of that link by the p-cycle. Fig 4. A Hamiltonian p-cycle, the protection path passes through all the nodes in the network only once Fig 5. A Non-Simple p-cycle, the protection path passes through the blue node more than once. One of the key differences between a ring-based scheme and the p-cycle scheme is the ability of the p-cycle to protect links that are not on the p-cycle ring as shown in Figure 3. The ability to protect two channel for every spare channel that is assigned to the p-cycle allows to achieve mesh-like capacity efficiency. This feature gives the p-cycle the additional efficiency over the ring-based schemes.Kodian, A.; Sack, A.; Grover, W.D.; , \\"p-cycle network design with hop limits and circumference limits,\\" Broadband Networks, 2004. BroadNets 2004. Proceedings. First International Conference on , vol., no., pp. 244- 253, 25-29 Oct. 2004 \\"Another over looked feature of the p-Cycle is that working paths may be freely routed over the network graph and are not limited to follow the ring-constrained routings\\".  P-Cycle Types  The p-cycles come in few variations depending on how they protect a given network and their underlying architecture. The types of p-cycles that are available are: Hamiltonian, Simple, Non-Simple, Span, Node encircling, Path, and Flow. The Hamiltonian, Simple, and Non-Simple are named after their underlying architecture (In relationship to the Network). The Span, Node, Path, and Flow p-cycles are named after the type of protection offered to the network. :*Hamiltonian - a p-cycle in which the protection path passes through all nodes in a network only once. This p-cycle is illustrated in Figure 4. :*Simple - a p-cycle in which the protection path is not required to pass through all the nodes in the network. The p-cycle is allowed to pass through any one node only once shown in Figure 1. :*Non-simple - a p-cycle in which the protection path is allowed to pass through any given node more than once. This is shown in Figure 5. :*Span p-cycle - a p-cycle whose primary job is to protect spans or links not on the p-cycle itself. This type of p-cycle is shown in Figure 3. :*Node encircling - a p-cycle that protects in case of a node failure. In this type, the traffic that used to pass through that node before a failure is rerouted to an adjacent node(s) encircling the failed node, but not through the failed node. :*Path protecting p-cycle - a p-cycle that protects a complete path, from source to destination as long as all the nodes are on the p-cycle. :*Flow p-cycle - a p-cycle that offers protection for links that are on the p-cycle, the opposite of the Span p-cycle protection scheme.  Designs & Formation of p-cycles  To design p-cycle, a few methods may be used. The two main categories in which the p-cycles are formed are: Centralized or Distributed. Further categorization is based on a number of factors including order of the p-cycle and working demands based on routing. The p-cycles can be created after the working demands are routed in the network or at the same time depending on the needs and requirements. There are a number of papers dealing with the p-cycle design, and the idea that p-cycle networks are based many times on the single Hamiltonian cycle seems to float around. While the idea may be good from management simplicity, it does not mean it is the best possible solution.Onguetou, D.P.; Grover, W.D.; , \\"p-cycle network design: From fewest in number to smallest in size,\\" Design and Reliable Communication Networks, 2007. DRCN 2007. 6th International Workshop on , vol., no., pp.1-8, 7-10 Oct. 2007  Centralized  In the centralized method, the p-cycles can be determined and picked based on the possible candidate cycles from a large eligible set for the design in order to protect all the possible working channels and links. Another way in which the centralized method is used is based on network graphs. This way the p-cycles are chosen from a set of a network graph. For the centralized method, many techniques exist to accomplish the above computations. Some major ones are presented below: = Integer Linear Programming Models = In this model, there are a few techniques that are used for creating acceptable p-cycles in order to protect the network, some of those include: :*Spare Capacity Optimization - The objective of this technique is to optimize the capacity used for the creation of the p-cycles (minimize) while insuring that all of the working channels are protected. This method creates p-cycles that protect off-cycle paths or spans. This model is able to provide an acceptable set of p-cycles that guarantees 100% protection in case of a single failure. It is possible to have more constrains to further specify and meet the required design specifications. :*Joint Capacity Optimization - In this technique the optimization is extended not only to the spare capacity of the network but to the total capacity of the network. This includes the spare capacity and the working capacity of the network. Another difference is the routing on the working capacity is not done before the p-cycle formation. First a working route option is calculated for each source/destination pair, than from all the possible solutions found, a pair is selected along with the addition of spare capacity taken into consideration to optimize the total capacity of the network. The model for this technique can be found in [1]. :*Protected Working Capacity Envelope Optimization - This model different from the other 2 models because in this model the p-cycles are found first. There are some considerations when creating the p-cycles based on the idea of optimizing the general volume of the working channels which must be protected. After the p-cycles are found, the working demand is routed on the network within the p-cycle protection domain. This concept is known as protected working capacity envelope (PWCE). = Heuristic Method = The first method of creating p-cycles is computationally intensive when the number of nodes is large.Zhenrong Zhang; Wen-De Zhong; Mukherjee, B.; , \\"A heuristic method for design of survivable WDM networks with p-cycles,\\" IEEE Communications Letters , vol.8, no.7, pp. 467- 469, July 2004 The Heuristic method presented called the ER-based unity-p-cycle, shows an attractive solution to solve the problem with creating p-cycles without the use of ILP. This method also has a solution that is close to that of an optimal solution, but without the extra computational time required. The general idea of the algorithm is to identify unity p-cycles that are able to protect as many working links as possible, this essentially reduces the number of spare units required for protection. A \\"unit p-cycle is able to protect one working link in opposite direction for every on cycle span and two working units for every straddling span. The number of spare units of a unity-p-cyle is equal to the number of the spans on the cycle.\\" A ratio called ER is defined as the number of working links that are protected by the unity p-cycle to the number of spare units. The higher the ratio the better the efficiency of the protecting p-cycles and hence this is what the algorithm aims for. The method can be explained as follows as given in [6] is shown here: :#Based on algorithm in [7]H. Hwang, S. Y. Ahn, Y. H. Yoo, and S. K. Chong, ‚ÄúMultiple shared backup cycles for survivable optical networks,‚Äù in Proc. ICCCN‚Äô01, Scottsdale, AZ, Oct. 2001, pp. 284‚Äì289. Find the possible cycles, and determine the working capacity for each based on one of the shortest path algorithms. :#Calculate the ratio ER of the unit-cycles for the cycles computed in step 1. :#Based on the ER calculation select the cycle with the highest ER. :#Remove the working links that can be protected by the selected cycle from above, and update the working capacity. :#Repeat the above steps until the working capacity on every span is 0. = Straddling Link Algorithm = The Integer Linear Programming (ILP) method for creating p-cycles requires that all possible sets of cycles are found first up to a certain size or circumference of the network. As a result, this method is good for small or medium-sized networks.Doucette, J.; He, D.; Grover, W.D.; Yang, O.; , \\"Algorithmic approaches for efficient enumeration of candidate p-cycles and capacitated p-cycle network design,\\" Design of Reliable Communication Networks, 2003. (DRCN 2003). Proceedings. Fourth International Workshop on , vol., no., pp. 212- 220, 19-22 Oct. 2003 Because as the number of nodes increases, the network graph grows exponentially complicating the problem for ILP and substantially increasing the time required to compute the sets. Therefore, this method is not suitable for large networks and a different method must be used. One solution is a Straddling Link Algorithm (SLA) method. This method is fast and simple to create a set of cycles, but suffers from inefficiency for the overall network design. This is because the algorithm generates p-cycles that have only one straddling span. The key feature of the SLA is the ability to find the p-cyles quickly. The Algorithm works by finding the shortest path between the nodes of a span, and than find another shortest path between the same set of the nodes that is disjoint from the first route. The p-cycle is than created by combining the previously found two routes into one. The span is able to use the other route as a backup in case of a failure. This formation of p-cycle is called a primary p-cycle. The problem with this method is that most primary p-cycles contain only one straddling span, and therefore are inefficient as compared to other types of constructed p-cycles.  Distributed  The distributed method for creating p-cycles differs from the centralized approach in a number of ways. The major difference being in assumptions made in centralized methods. This assumption is based on the fact that p-cycles are always guaranteed to protect 100% of the working capacity. In other words, it is assumed that it is always possible to create the p-cycles that are able to protect the working capacity in full. The distributed method deals with logical configuration and assignment of already in-place physical capacities. this means that the distributed method is aimed towards real life operations where the physical links are fixed but logical distinction can be made of how the spare and working capacity can be used and or decided. This method does not always make it possible to be able to protect 100% of the working capacities as there may not be enough of the spare capacity to create the required p-cycles in order protect all of the working links on the network. The distributed method can be done in one of the two ways: = Distributed cycle pre-configuration = This method is based on rules and concepts adopted from the Selfhealing Network protocol.Grover, W.D.; Stamatelakis, D.; , \\"Cycle-oriented distributed preconfiguration: ring-like speed with mesh-like capacity for self-planning network restoration,\\" Communications, 1998. ICC 98. Conference Record. 1998 IEEE International Conference on , vol.1, no., pp.537-543 vol.1, 7-11 Jun 1998 The idea behind the (DCPC) is as follows: each spare link has a state associated with it called a statelet with a number of states. The node sees each logical link with an incoming state and an outgoing state. The incoming state from the link to the node originates from an adjacent node that is connected by that link. Also each outbound state from a link has an incoming state which forms its precursor. Based on this idea, a number of statelets is sent throughout the network (broadcast) and forms a tree of states. \\"Each node in the tree, is rooted at the precursor port from which the outgoing statelets are propagated.\\" This is called a state route. There are two node options in the algorithm namely Cycler and the Tandem, each having it specific role. The Cycler is a sender/chooser role, in this mode the Cycler sends and receives parts of a state it initiated. All of the nodes adopt this behavior and this is accomplished in a round-robin scheme. The other role is the Tandem, which works by mediating the state broadcasts competition with new rules and criteria not found in Selfhealing networks. Simply put, each node is allowed to explore the network and discover possible p-cycles. The Tandem role also dictates allowed discovery of p-cycles by the Cycler node type. Based on the DCPC, the p-cycles are self-organized in the spare capacity of the network and are found in a distributed way. The algorithm can be re-run each time a network change occurs to create an optimum use of spare capacity. For more information the reader is encouraged to read [9]. = Swarm Intelligence System = This method is based on an intelligent system that is found in nature. It is a distributed method that relies on agents working independently, yet communicating with each other by a means of messages that are left or collected at each node which was visited by that agent. This behavior is similar to that of ants, and so called a p-cycle ant system. The aggregation of the messages left or generated by those ants is the basis of forming p-cycles in the system. This technique has high adaptability and redundancy in the network and as a result optimal solutions are possible.  Efficiency of p-cycles  The efficiency of a p-cycle is based on type of p-cycle in use. The Hamiltonian p-cycle, where the p-cycle passes through all the nodes only once, can be very efficient when the working capacity that is unprotected is able to have all the relationships required by a full Hamiltonian implementation.W.D. Grover, Mesh-based Survivable Networks: Options for Optical, MPLS, SONET and ATM Networking, Prentice-Hall, Aug. 2003. While the Hamiltonian seems to float around as the choice of p-cycle formation, it is not the only type allowed. In some network configurations a mix of the Hamiltonian p-cycle with other types is required to achieve optimal efficiency in the network design. A study performed last years showed that an efficient way to create p-cycles can be achieved in mesh networks that are flat. This means that the number of links not on the p-cycle or spans is identical. A type of network called a homogeneous network, where all of the spans have equal working capacity, showed an efficiency that was not quite optimal in terms of spare to working capacity ratio. This is due to the loss of an ability for a p-cycle to protect more than one straddling span. As an alternative a concept of semi-homogeneous mesh networks was developed. In this type of network the ability of the p-cycle to protect more than one straddling span allowed it to reach an efficiency of 1 / ( \\\\bar{d}-1 ) which is a lower limit. Thus it was proven that with the use of Hamiltonian p-cycles in the semi-homogeneous networks, the theoretical efficiency could be reached, but with some exceptions as real network are different and a mix of different p-cycle is required to achieve optimal solutions for a given network topology and design.  Applications  The idea behind p-cycles protection was an ability to offer protection in mesh optical networks by combining the benefits of ring like recovery speed and the efficiency of a mesh network, however the concept is not only limited to transport optical networks and can be extended to higher levels and other network types: *IP *WDM *ASTN *ASON *SDH *MPLS *SONET *Segment protection *Optical Mesh Networks *Optical Multicast Media Traffic  References  Category:Fiber-optic communications Category:Network architecture Category:Network protocols ","title":"P-cycle protection"},{"id":"37975854","text":"The trefoil arch A trefoil arch, or three-foiled cusped arch, is an arch incorporating the shape or outline of a trefoil ‚Äì three overlapping rings.

Biography  Along with Mihovil Logar, Dragutin ƒåoliƒá, Ljubica Mariƒá, Vojislav Vuƒçkoviƒá, and Stanojlo Rajiƒçiƒá, Ristiƒá belonged to the so-called \\"Prague group\\" of composers that entered musical life of the Serbian capital at the onset of the 1930s. Following World War II the members of this circle played leading roles in Serbian and Yugoslav music. Given his affiliation with the pursuits of European contemporary music he acquired during his education in Paris and prior to relocating to Prague, Milan Ristiƒá occupies a special place among the Prague group. He received his first piano instruction in Belgrade from Ivan Brezov≈°ek. In 1927 he moved to Paris with his school friend, the author Oskar Daviƒço, where he began study of composition (1927‚Äì29) with G. Pierson. Upon his return to Belgrade, Ristiƒá continued his education with Miloje Milojeviƒá and Josip Slavenski at the Music School in Belgrade. Following his father's death, he supported his family by playing in the Belgrade jazz band The Jolly Boys. In 1929, Ristiƒá destroyed the score of his first composition, Four impressionistic pieces, but the second piano miniature of this work, \\"Invocation\\", survived. During his studies with Alois H√°ba at the Prague Conservatory, Ristiƒá became familiar and began to adopt ideas about 'athematicism', the continuous development of the thematic material, and accepted linear thinking that would become a significant characteristic of his future works. His early works (Sinfonietta, the single-movement Violin concerto, and piano Preludes) display the spirit of the Interwar modernism, leaning in certain cases on H√°ba's quarter-tone music teachings (Suite for four trombones and the Septet). Ristiƒá returned to Belgrade from Prague in 1939 due to the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Back home, he began working at Radio Belgrade, where he remained professionally connected going forward, but withdrew his public radio performances during the war period of the German invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia. He returned to Radio Belgrade after WWII, in the position of assistant editor-in-chief for music programs until 1963, when he became a consultant for music programs at the Radio-Television Belgrade (today Radio Television of Serbia). He was inducted into the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts as a corresponding member in 1961, and also served as President of the Composers' Association of Serbia from 1960 to 1962. Milan Ristiƒá received a Yugoslav Order of Labour with the Red Flag.  Works  Ristiƒá wrote his most boldest compositions, including those in quarter- and sixth-tone systems, during his studies. He is though, best known for his nine symphonies and other orchestral works, such as Sinfonietta, Man and war (symphonic poem), Symphonic movement, Suita giocosa, Symphonic variations, Burlesque, Seven bagatelles, The Suite, Three little pieces, Three polyphonic studies, and The Gallop. Along with his symphonic compositions, he wrote a number of concertante works, including Concerto for violin, two concertos for piano, Concerto for clarinet, Concerto for trumpet, Concerto for orchestra, and Concerto for chamber orchestra. His chamber oeuvre in the semitone system consists of notable works such as the five-string quartets, Wind quintet, Sonata for two violins and piano, two sonatas for violin and piano, Sonata for viola and piano, Duet for violin and piano, Duet for violin and viola, and twenty-four fugues for various instrumental ensembles. Among Ristiƒá's quarter-tone works are: Suite for four trombones, the Septet, Suite for ten string instruments, Sonata for solo violin, and his Duet for violin and cello, which is based upon the sixth- tone microtonal system. Ristiƒá also composed stage music for the ballets Cinderella and The Tyrant (unfinished). His works Through the blizzard, The Poplar, The Death of Smail-aga ƒåengiƒá, and A Song about the hawk, for narrator and chamber or large orchestra, aligned him with a few Serbian composers who fostered the melodrama genre. Ristiƒá left behind a certain number of folk-song and dance arrangements and orchestrations of compositions by Josif Marinkoviƒá and Isidor Bajiƒá. The Second symphony from 1951 represents a paradigmatic example of Ristiƒá's compositional and technical skillfulness. Realized with limited means of expression, the symphony is oriented toward a balanced and perspicuous form achieved through transparent melodic content and functional harmonic relationships. The first, upbeat movement embraces a lyrical theme, defining in its further unfolding the contours of a sonata form. The second movement represents simulation of a serenade with a grotesque gesture embodied in the theme's orchestration, delivered by clarinet accompanied by tuba and bassoon. Featuring odd meters, the Scherzo and Trio imply folk origins, though lacking any unambiguous melodic relationships with a certain folk tune. The symphony's finale develops as a modernist fugue, in which Ristiƒá showcased his conduct of contrapuntal skills (inversions, augmentations, and stretti). Ethereal but effective orchestration and receptiveness of performers and audience, led to international performances of this work (Geneva, orchestra Suisse romande). In 1951, when the symphony was premiered (September 5, 1951, Symphonic Orchestra of the People's Republic of Serbia, conductor ≈Ωivojin Zdravkoviƒá), a transition from the dominant socialist realism toward (moderately socialist) modernist‚Äîsocialist aestheticism took place and \\"the Second symphony marked the beginning of the 'new epoch' in Serbian music and culture at large\\" (Mikiƒá 2009, 119). In its structural aspects, Ristiƒá's Second symphony corresponded with the unfolding cultural changes. The symphony's neoclassic expression represents a fostering of tradition of 'healthy' classicism, contrary to the daily vulgarization of art for political purposes. Lacking the programmatic underpinnings, but skillfully developed in terms of canonic craft and simulation of certain models with folkloristic connotation (Scherzo in 5/8 and Trio in 7/8 meter), by its completeness and wholeness, this symphony does not oppose the then governing doctrine, while at the same time it represents a work of modern expression. By its optimistic spirits the Second symphony embodies the momentum of transition of the entire Yugoslav society from a Warsaw Pact country to one of self-governed socialism. Suita giocosa, but particularly The Seven bagatelles for orchestra, both underscore Ristiƒá's \\"optimism\\"; \\"with clear forms and free but still present tonality and clarity of polyphonic procedures (‚Ä¶) these works carry extraordinary communicativeness\\" (Bergamo 1977, 80). Periƒçiƒá states that Ristiƒá's Bagatelles are \\"humorous, of clear formal structure, and transparent sound,\\" and labels the composer \\"a master of neoclassic expression,\\" to whose works are attributed \\"gaiety, lyricism, and amiable humor,\\" but always \\"rationally controlled\\" (Periƒçiƒá 1969, 471-72). Evoking his Second symphony's Scherzo, Ristiƒá in Bagatelles utilizes 5/8 meter, thus \\"implying folklore,\\" but also includes a very important modernist epithet which by its \\"unusual harmonies\\" speaks about the composer's \\"individuality\\" and \\"contemporaneousness\\" (Periƒçiƒá 1969, 472). The published reviews of Ristiƒá's works at the time of their performances reinforce \\"the closeness with the man of our reality,\\" \\"the results yielded by the synthesis of talent, healthy life outlook, and studious, hard work,\\" and a \\"sound orchestral style in our music\\" (Bergamo 1977, 80). In the Third symphony, from the position acquired in his previous works, Ristiƒá selects and re-adopts certain procedures from his student compositions. The Symphony is dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the Revolution, and was performed on the eve of the celebration of the Uprising Day, 6 July 1961, and then at the concert of the Belgrade Philharmonic with conductor ≈Ωivojin Zdravkoviƒá. The same year it was conferred the Belgrade October Award. The example of the Third symphony offers numerous compromises characteristic for socialist aestheticism. Expressively far from soc-realism, this work is indeed dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the Revolution. But it does not feature quotations of the songs from the National Liberation War (Narodnooslobodilacka borba, NOB) or procedures known from the 1940s. The only connection with the Revolution is found in the movements' subtitles (Youth‚ÄîUnrests‚ÄîOccupation‚ÄîNew world (Mladost‚ÄîNemiri‚ÄîOkupacija‚ÄîNovi svet)), but in synthesis with Ristiƒá's biography. The \\"classic\\" four-movement symphonic cycle with the \\"appropriate\\" order of movements (second movement Scherzo, third movement slow) is realized with \\"contemporary\\" language. The language \\"contemporaneousness\\" however, is not unambiguous since it does not pertain to dodecaphony or tonal means, while at the same time both the procedures with twelve tones and clear \\"tonal\\" centers exist in the work. Here, Ristiƒá also demonstrated his contrapuntal and orchestration skills, though without indication of communicating an extra musical narrative. This composition does not contain a \\"strict, determined program,\\" but, as Periƒçiƒá states \\"it operates by its sole musical content.\\" The \\"non-discursive\\" trait of this symphony is emphasized by its traditional four-movement formal plan: Allegro moderato‚ÄîVivace, Come una Marcia funebre, Tempo I‚ÄîAndante mosso‚Äî Allegro assai, in which individual movements follow the sonata form (first and fourth movements), and binary‚Äîternary architectural patterns (second and third movements). Concerto for piano and orchestra from 1954 is conceived simply, without the usual virtuosity. The micro plan of the work, with order of movements‚Äîfast-slow-fast‚Äîdoes not deviate from traditional concept. Ristiƒá here also utilizes C. Franck's cyclical principle. Following the first subject in C-major, the appearance of the second subject in A-flat major, as well as meter changes in the second movement (4/4, 5/4, 4/4, and 5/4) depart from \\"classical\\" solutions. The second, lyrical movement begins with a polyphonic excerpt with meter changes, thus implying folk connotations. The third movement, featuring chords brisker then used previously, flows in an upbeat motion. The oeuvre of Milan Ristiƒá additionally includes Concerto for violin (1944), Concerto for clarinet (1964), the Fourth (1966), Fifth (1967), Sixth (1968), Seventh (1972), Eighth (1974), and Ninth (1976) symphonies, Concerto for piano from 1973, and Concerto for trumpet from 1978.

It began as a comedy club in Islington, London, twice went to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and was eventually given a Channel 4 television pilot. It is also the subject of a 2012 book called You Are Nothing. Cluub Zarathustra was set up by comedians Simon Munnery and Roger Mann. Its remit was to showcase unconventional and avant garde comedy, without the acts ever resorting to traditional comedy. Stewart Lee soon joined and helped in the vision and organisation of the Cluub. Other members were Johnny Vegas, Julian Barratt, Lor√© Lixenberg, Richard Thomas, Richard Herring, Jason Freeman, Sally Phillips and Kevin Eldon. It directly led to the television series Attention Scum! and to the production of Jerry Springer - The Opera. Book The Cluub is the subject of You Are Nothing, a history book written and researched by Robert Wringham and published in 2012 by Go Faster Stripe. It is suggested in the book that Cluub Zarathustra was the progenitor of much British comedy from the 1990s to the present day.

The pistol is chambered for the 9√ó19mm Parabellum and .40 S&W; cartridges. Design details The FNS pistol is based on the FN FNX. The FNS has similar ergonomics to the FNX but introduces a double-action, striker-fired functionality. Operating mechanism Like other FN pistols, the FNS is a short-recoil-operated pistol. It is a pre-set striker fired semi- automatic pistol, meaning the trigger system is of the hammerless short double-action-only type. The trigger pull is between and . All variations also include a hammer-forged stainless steel barrel, Picatinny rail, fixed three- dot combat sights (standard or night sights), and a loaded chamber indicator on the right side. Standard features The FNS series of the pistols all include ambidextrous magazine releases, and slide stop release levers. Safety The FNS has four standard safety features: #A trigger safety, similar to that seen on a Glock, which prevents the weapon from discharging without pressure on the trigger. #A firing pin safety which prevents the striker from hitting the primer without the trigger being pulled. #A drop safety which prevents the sear from rotating to release the striker unless the trigger is pulled. #An out-of-battery safety which prevents the sear from releasing the striker if the slide is not fully forward. As a fifth safety feature, the FNS pistols can also have an optional manual safety. Variants A \\"long slide\\" version, known as the FNS-9LS and FNS-40LS, was introduced in 2012 designed in partnership with the Baltimore County Police Department specifically for the department. A compact version, known as the FNS-9C and FNS-40C, was introduced in 2015. The compact version comes with two short magazines. One has a \\"pinkie rest\\" baseplate while the other has a flat baseplate. Magazine capacity for the 9mm version is 12 rounds and for the .40 S&W; version is 10 rounds. The compact versions can also use full size magazines with the addition of a removable grip sleeve. A full size 9mm pre- loaded striker pistol, known as the FN 509, was introduced in early 2016 with it being part of the XM17 Modular Handgun System competition. It was released for public sale in 2017. It is fully ambidextrous and comes in two versions, one version having manual safety and another without it. It also comes with a Picatinny rail for various attachments. All versions are available in two finishes: a standard black finish featuring a dark colored/nitrided slide and matte black frame or a two-tone finish featuring a silver colored stainless steel slide and matte black frame. At least one variant, the FNS-9C (compact) is available in solid dark earth coloration. Users *: The Custer City Police Department in Custer County, Oklahoma has named the FNS-9/.40 as the department standard carry sidearm paired with either a TLR-1 or TLR-2 weapon mounted flashlight. *: A few police agencies in Kansas use the FNS pistol, such as the Salina, Kansas Police Department and Osawatomie, Kansas Police Department. The Salina Police Department uses the FNS-40, while Osawatomie Police Department uses the FNS-40LS. *: The local police of Li√®ge (Zone de Police de Li√®ge) uses the FN FNS-9 pistol.

The Tirailleurs indochinois saw active service in Indochina, China (Boxer Rebellion), Russian Siberia (Allied intervention 1918‚Äì19), Syria (1920‚Äì21) and Morocco (1925‚Äì26). During World War I the French Army was initially reluctant to deploy its Indochinese units of the Troupes coloniales on the Western Front but eventually 40,000 Annamite and Cambodian tirailleurs were sent to France.The majority were employed behind the lines in guard, depot and factory-worker duties. However several battalions fought at Verdun, the Chemin des Dames, and in Champagne. Indochinese troops were also deployed to the Macedonian front.http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205213283 On 10 February 1930 fifty soldiers of the Tonkinese Rifles rose in support of the VNQDD during the Yen Bai mutiny, which was quickly suppressed by loyal tirailleurs of the same regimentMaurice Rives, pages 72-73 Les Linh Tap, but resulted in increased recruitment of non-Vietnamese soldiers.

In 1996, after being appointed manager of the under-20s, he led the side to the first Copa S√£o Paulo de Futebol J√∫nior title of their history. Moreira later was in charge of local lower clubs, and after another stint at Am√©rica, was appointed as Atl√©tico Mineiro's under-20 manager. He later moved to the latter's fierce rivals Cruzeiro, again finishing first in Copinha. On 26 October 2008 Moreira was appointed Ipatinga manager, after previously being the club's assistant manager. After failing to avoid relegation with the club, he subsequently returned to youth football. On 23 December 2009, after a spell at Atl√©tico Paranaense, Moreira was named Sport Club Internacional B manager. On 21 March 2011 he was appointed assistant manager at Fluminense, but acted as the club's interim for two months. On 28 September 2011 Moreira was appointed at the helm of Goi√°s. He led the club to a S√©rie B title in 2012, and also achieved an impressive sixth position in the following year's S√©rie A, but opted to not renew his contract in December 2013. On 16 December 2013 Moreira signed for Gr√™mio, but was relieved from his duties on 27 July 2014. On 3 September he was appointed Santos manager, replacing fired Oswaldo de Oliveira. On 5 March 2015 Moreira was sacked, despite the club's unbeaten status in the year. On the 16th he was named manager of Atl√©tico Paranaense, replacing fired Claudinei Oliveira. His spell at the latter didn't last long, and he was relieved from his duties on 20 April. On 21 May 2015 Moreira returned to Fluminense, after Ricardo Drubscky's dismissal. Dismissed on 15 September after a 1‚Äì4 heavy loss against Palmeiras, he returned to Goi√°s on 15 December ahead of the 2016 campaign. Moreira was fired by the Esmeraldino on 8 June 2016, with the club in the relegation places. On 20 July he signed for Am√©rica Mineiro, seriously threatened with relegation in the top tier; after improving the club's performance overall, he still failed to avoid the drop three matches before the end of the tournament. In 2017, Moreira led Am√©rica back to the S√©rie A, after winning the S√©rie B tournament. On 16 June 2018, he resigned from the club, and was announced after accepting an offer from fellow top division club Bahia. On 1 April 2019, after being knocked out of the year's Copa do Nordeste, Moreira was dismissed by Bahia. Late in the month, he replaced fired Lisca at the helm of Cear√°, but was himself sacked on 1 October. On 10 February 2020, Moreira returned to Cear√°, replacing sacked Argel Fucks, but resigned on 17 March to take over Cruzeiro the following day.

The school was founded in 1746 and is the oldest girls' boarding and day school in continuous operation in the United States.  History  The school traces its history to November 1746, when a Moravian congregation was established in Warwick, Pennsylvania, now known as Lititz. The congregation's original building was a \\"Gemeinhaus,\\" a log structure that could serve as a combined chapel, schoolhouse, and parsonage. The school educated both boys and girls. As of 1758, it reportedly enrolled \\"70 to 77 children.\\" Brethren's and Sisters' Houses were built by the Moravian congregation between 1758 and 1761 to separate the activities and education of the community's unmarried men and women. The original Gemeinhaus building was taken down in 1766. For the next few years, girl's schooling occurred in the Sisters' House, while boys' schooling was closely associated with the Brethren's House. Church diaries from this period mention that girls from Moravian families in Lancaster (several miles from Lititz) were enrolling in the school and boarding with local families. The local Moravian congregation was a country congregation whose members lived on scattered farms, so it is likely that some of their daughters boarded at the school or nearby due to its distance from their homes. In May 1769 the cornerstone was laid for a new building for the girls' school, apparently to accommodate a growing student body. This building, now named Stengel Hall, is still standing as of 2020. The school's first recorded non-Moravian boarding student, Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Marvel of Baltimore, Maryland, was enrolled in 1794. The name of the school was changed from Lititz Seminary to Linden Hall in 1883. The new name referred to plantings of basswood (linden) trees on the campus. Linden Hall added a junior college, known as Linden Hall Junior College, in 1935. Its offerings included a secretarial program. The Junior College was discontinued in 1961. Linden Hall is now nonsectarian. The school handbook states that the school's weekly chapel services are held in the Lititz Moravian Church and incorporate \\"readings, commentaries, and music that represent many of the major philosophies and religions,\\" along with \\"the School's Moravian heritage.\\" Pages 42 and 62  Program  Linden Hall's academic program is entirely aimed at college preparation. Athletic offerings include an extensive equestrian program. Team sports include soccer, tennis, volleyball, riding, cross country, golf, basketball, archery and dance. A cooperative program with Warwick High School enables Linden Hall students to participate in field hockey, lacrosse, swimming, track and field, softball, and bowling teams. Upper school students can participate in an aviation program through which they can earn a pilot's license.  Historically related school  The Beck School for Boys, now defunct, also was related to the Moravian church schools established in Lititz in the 1700s..

The strong presence of geometry in Spain's mathematical curriculum, even to this day, can be traced back to Torroja's influence.Jos√© Javier Escribano Benito, Eduardo Torroja Caball√© from Real Sociedad Matematica Espa√±ola. In 1869, Torroja became a research fellow at the Astronomical Observatory in Madrid, where he contributed to the geodesic triangulation of Spain, initiated by the General Carlos Ib√°√±ez. While working at that Research Institute, he became Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Sciences. In 1873 he became a full professor of Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry at the University of Valencia. In 1876 he obtained the professorship in Descriptive Geometry at Complutense University, where he remained until his retirement due to terminal illness in 1916. During his tenure he promoted research in synthetic geometry, influencing a generation of Spanish mathematicians, including Miguel Vegas, Cecilio Jim√©nez Rueda, Jos√© √Ålvarez Ude, Antonio Torroja, and Julio Rey Pastor. His books became highly regarded textbooks, expanding the scope of his influence and that of his inspiration, Karl von Staudt. At that time Complutense University was the only University in the Spanish Empire entitled to grant Doctor degrees, so that most Spanish mathematicians can trace their academic genealogy to Dr. Torroja Caball√©. In the year 1900, Torroja and his disciple Miguel Vegas, prepared the Curriculum for the studies of Sciences, which had an overwhelming focus on Descriptive and Analytic Geometry. In the year 1891, Torroja was elected member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences, where he was formally inducted in the year 1893 after offering his speech \\"Rese√±a de los medios empleados por la geometr√≠a pura actual para alcanzar el grado de generalidad y de simplificaci√≥n que la distingue de la antigua\\". This speech argued that the work of Karl Georg Christian von Staudt is the unifying contribution to Geometry. In 1911 he became a founding member of the Spanish Mathematical Society, where he was vice president, with Echegaray and Garc√≠a de Galdeano.

Both series were drawn; all three Tests were draws, and each side won one of the ODIs, tying the series 1‚Äì1. The other ODI, which was held on 25 December, was abandoned after three overs had been bowled, when after discussion between the two captains and the match referee, it was determined that the inconsistent bounce of the pitch was too dangerous for the players. This was the first occasion on which an international cricket match had been called off for this reason. The third ODI was marred by umpiring controversy and disruption from the crowd. During India's innings, Ajay Jadeja was given out, after being caught behind. The umpire initially raised his finger to dismiss the batsman, but then changed his mind, and continued raising his finger to adjust his hat. He then turned down the appeal, and Jadeja continued to bat. Elmo Rodrigopulle, writing for Cricinfo, reported that \\"it was a mockery on the umpiring fraternity and what umpiring stands for.\\" Later, in Sri Lanka's reply, when they were 205 for four, needing just 29 more runs for victory, the game was held up because spectators threw bottles onto the field. After a ten- minute delay, the match resumed, and Sri Lanka won by five wickets. The tour began on 13 November, when the Sri Lankans played an Indian XI for Anshuman Gaekwad's benefit match, and concluded with the third ODI on 28 December. Sourav Ganguly was named player of the Test series, in which he was the leading run-scorer from either side, aggregating 392 runs.

The mansion was originally built as a private residence of the Hume family. It is currently owned by American billionaire John C. Malone. Built of granite, the three-story main building is flanked by a tall, round turreted tower at one end and a more angular tower at the other. The ground floor consists of a drawing room, dining room, salon and ballroom banqueting hall and a lower ground floor a billiard room, smoking room and wine cellar. The upper floors contain 12 bedrooms. History The Hume family had settled at Humewood and built a castle there in the 15th century. The estate passed down through successive generations to Fitzwilliam Hume (1805‚Äì1892) who was the wealthy MP for Wicklow from 1852 to 1880. He commissioned architect William White to design a country retreat for the summer and the shooting season and White hired Albert Kimberley to build the castle. White exceeded his brief and the final result, built between 1867 and 1870, was today's Gothic fantasy which far exceeded the budget, bankrupting White in the process. Fitzwilliam Hume assumed the surname of Dick in 1864 under the terms of a legacy. His only son William Hume inherited the property and was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Wicklow and served as High Sheriff of Wicklow for 1896. After William Hume's death the estate passed to his daughter Catherine Marie-Madeleine (Mimi), who had married Jacques Weygand, son of the French General Maxime Weygand. They had no children. Shortly before her death in 1992, Mimi Weygand presented the majority of the estate cottages, including several in Kiltegan, to her tenants. The castle and 450-acre estate were subsequently sold at auction to the German businesswoman Renata Coleman for ¬£1 million. Renata Coleman developed the house into an upmarket private hotel and introduced duckshooting and polo in the grounds. She marketed it in 2004 at an offering price of EUR 16 million. Coleman sold it to the Galway developer John Lally‚Äôs company, Lalco, to be further developed. Economic conditions were unfavourable, however, and in 2012 it was sold at a loss for 8 million euros to American billionaire John Malone.

Lehtonen holds five Finnish records in the same stroke, including a 1500 m freestyle record that dated back to 1983, before she set a mark of 17:18.16 at the 2007 USA Junior National Meet in Indianapolis, Indiana. Representing her birth nation Finland, Lehtonen competed in a long-distance freestyle double at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She finished with a top-eight fastest time of 4:19.53 (400 m freestyle) and 8:52.20 (800 m freestyle), respectively, to beat the FINA B-cut at the Texas Senior Circuit in College Station, Texas. In the 400 m freestyle, Lehtonen rallied from behind at the start to hold off a fast- charging Puerto Rican swimmer Kristina Lennox-Silva to take the third spot in heat two and thirty-fifth overall by a tenth of a second (0.10) with 4:20.07. Five days later, in the 800 m freestyle, Lehtonen tried to maintain her pace smoothly over El Salvador's Golda Marcus throughout the race with only 250 metres to go in heat one, before fading down the stretch to touch the wall with a third-place time and thirty-third overall in 8:53.50. Since 2008, Lehtonen was previously a member of the swimming team for the Florida Gators swimming and diving team of the University of Florida, before she transferred to Florida Gulf Coast University and joined the Florida Gulf Coast Eagles in 2011. She is currently a biomedical engineering major at the Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers, Florida. Lehtonen currently resides with her family in Rochester, Michigan, and trains full-time at the Oakland Live Y'ers Swimming Club under her coaches Jeff Cooper and Dan Hafner.
