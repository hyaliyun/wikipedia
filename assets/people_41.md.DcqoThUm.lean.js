Kotzk is a branch of Peshischa Hasidism, as Menachem Mendel Morgenstern was the leading disciple of Simcha Bunim of Peshischa (1765–1827). Following Simcha Bunim's death he led the divided Peschischa community, which he eventually incorporated into his own Hasidic dynasty. Kotzk follows a Hasidic philopshy known for its critical and rationalistic approach to Hasidism and its intense approach to personal improvement which is based on a process of harsh constructive criticism and total transparency of self. Kotzk is closely connected to other branches of Peshischa Hasidism such as Ger and Aleksander and is currently based out of Jerusalem, Israel.  History  Nearing the end of his life Menachem Mendel Morgenstern lived in total seclusion from his followers. After his death, he had already amassed a large following. His eldest son, Dovid Morgenstern (1809–1893) succeeded him as the Kotzker rebbe, despite minor criticism from his followers who wanted Yitzchak Meir Alter (1799–1866) to succeed him as Kotzker rebbe. It was around this time that Avrohom Bornsztain (1838–1910), a leading disicple of Menachem Mendel Morgenstern founded the Sochatchov Hasidic dynasty based in Sochaczew. This alongside the rejected leadership of Yitzchak Meir Alter led to several minor splits amongst the community. Before the Holocaust, Kotzk was of the largest Hasidic groups which number in the tens of thousands. The last Kotzker rebbe before the Holocaust, was Yitzchak Zelig Morgenstern (1866–1939), the fourth Kotzker rebbe who served as a member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. During the Holocaust a huge percentage of the community was murdered, and following the atrocities of the Holocaust, the remaining Hasidim of Kotzk immigrated to Chicago alongside the sixth and last Kotzker rebbe, David Solomon Morgenstern (1904–1962).\\"In Maydanek and Auschwitz, too, their faces were glowing\\" (in Hebrew), Beit Ya'akov, No. 47, Nisan, 1963, page 9, on the HebrewBooks site. After his death, the community split into several fractions, the largest of which was led by Mendel Meir Morgenstern (1921–2013) who was a grandson of Yitzchak Zelig Morgenstern and the founder of the Israeli branch of Kotzk based out of Bnei Brak.

With a summit elevation of , the peak of Mount Baldy rises above the tree line and is left largely bare of vegetation, lending the mountain its current name. The Mount Baldy Wilderness occupies the eastern slope of the mountain and is managed by the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest.https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/?ID=372 The summit of Mount Baldy is within the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. It is the highest point in the White Mountains and Apache County. It is the fifth-highest point in the state, and the highest outside the San Francisco Peaks in the Flagstaff area. An unnamed sub-peak with an elevation of exists approximately to the north of the summit that is off reservation and accessible to the public via maintained trail. A third peak, Ord Peak, sits about three miles northwest of Baldy Peak, not to be confused with Mount Ord (Apache County, Arizona). Mount Baldy is one of the most sacred mountains to the Apache of Arizona. The Western Apache of Arizona inhabited the areas within their most four sacred mountain ranges: the White Mountains of Eastern Arizona, the Pinaleno Mountains near the town of Safford in southeastern Arizona, the Four Peaks near the City of Phoenix and the San Francisco Peaks near Flagstaff. When Captain George M. Wheeler visited the mountaintop in 1873, he described the view as \\"The most magnificent and effective of any among the large number that have come under my observation\\". Wheeler named the mountain Mount Thomas after General Lorenzo Thomas, who fought in the Mexican–American War. It later became Mount Baldy. The name Mount Thomas has been assigned to a nearby peak by the U.S. Geological Survey. Mount Baldy also contains the headwaters of the Little Colorado River and Salt River and produces the most abundant trout fishing streams in Arizona. No other mountain in Arizona produces as many rivers and streams. Along its slope are numerous man made lakes. The area around Mount Baldy also averages the most abundant precipitation in Arizona. Wildlife is abundant on the mountain and includes the recently introduced Mexican Grey Wolf. While looking northeast from Historic Fort Apache (elevation ), Mount Baldy rises in elevation.

Aspavarma (or Aspa) was an Indo-Scythian ruler of the clan of the Apraca, who ruled from around 15 to 45 CE. He ruled in the Bajaur area of modern Pakistan, and is considered one of the Apraca rulers. He is essentially known through his coins and a few inscription. Inscriptions Asparvama was a son of Apraca king Indravarman, as known from an inscription discovered in Taxila,On the Cusp of an Era: Art in the Pre-Kuṣāṇa World, Doris Srinivasan, BRILL, 2007, p.269-270 who himself is known to be the son of Vispavarma according to Indravarman's Silver Reliquary. Indravarman's Silver Reliquary, which is known for sure to be before the Bajaur casket, hence before 5-6 CE, and is therefore usually dated to the end of the 1st century BCE, describes Aspavarma's grandfather Vispavarma as a general, and not yet a king at that time. This tends to confirm that his grandson, Aspavarma, probably ruled quite some time later, in the middle of the 1st century CE. Aspavarman is also referenced in Gāndhārī texts, written in Kharoṣṭhī script, dating from the period.The British Library Kharosthi Fragments, The British Library/University of Washington Early Buddhist Manuscripts Project. Coinage The coinage shows the king on a horse, holding a whip in his right hand, in a style consistent with that of Azes II (who possibly is identical with Azes I). On the reverse, Athena makes a benediction gesture, and is flanked by a Buddhist triratna symbol.

Life Sibour was born at Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux in Drôme in 1792. After his ordination to the priesthood at Rome in 1818, he was assigned to the Archdiocese of Paris. He was named canon of the cathedral of Nîmes in 1822, became known as a preacher, and contributed to L'Avenir. In 1837, during a vacancy, he was chosen administrator of the Diocese of Nîmes, and two years later was made bishop of the Diocese of Digne.Weber, Nicholas. \\"Marie- Dominique-Auguste Sibour.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 28 June 2019 His administration was marked by his encouragement of ecclesiastical studies, a practical desire to increase the importance of the functions exercised by his cathedral chapter, and an observance of canonical forms in ecclesiastical trials. The same principles actuated him in his rule of the Archdiocese of Paris, to which he was called largely because of his prompt adhesion to the new government after the Revolution of 1848. Sibour was part of the ministerial commission which prepared the draft project for the Falloux Laws on education, which highly increased the clergy's influence in schools. He held in 1849 a provincial council in Paris, and in 1850 a diocesan synod. In 1853 he officiated at the marriage of Napoleon III, who had named him senator the previous year. Although in his answer to Pope Pius IX he declared the definition of the Immaculate Conception inopportune, he was present at the promulgation of the decree and shortly afterwards solemnly published it in his own diocese. The benevolent co-operation of the imperial government enabled him to provide for the needs of the poor churches in his diocese and to organize several new parishes. In 13 May 1856, he granted Peter Julian Eymard, permission to found in the Archdiocese of Paris a new Religious Institute which became known as the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament.\\"3rd January 1857 Archbishop Marie- Dominique-Auguste Sibour\\", Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament, Province of Saints Peter and Paul He also aimed at introducing the Roman Rite in Paris and was progressing favorably in this direction at the time of his death.  Assassination  Sibour was assassinated at the church of St. Etienne du Mont by an interdicted priest named Jean-Louis Verger, who openly admitted to the crime. Archbishop Sibour may be the only cleric murdered in modern times due to his assassin's views on papal doctrine. Verger was an opponent of the newly defined doctrine of immaculate conception as well as celibacy for the clergy. However, he was a continuous troublemaker, frequently complaining about his assignments, most of which he was unable to accomplish due to his temper. The trial became, in his mind, a sounding board for his notions. He was found guilty on the day of the trial (17 January 1857) and sentenced to death. To the end, Verger had convinced himself that Emperor Napoleon III would pardon him. When he was executed at La Roquette Prisons on 30 January 1857, he was in a state of panic and fear due to the failure of the pardon to come.

The route runs from PA 82 in West Nantmeal Township, Chester County north to U.S. Route 422 (US 422) near Birdsboro, Berks County. The route is a two-lane road its entire length, passing through the community of Warwick, Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site, French Creek State Park, and the borough of Birdsboro. PA 345 intersects PA 401 in East Nantmeal Township, PA 23 in Warwick, and PA 724 in Birdsboro. PA 345 was first designated by 1973 between PA 82 in West Nantmeal Township and PA 724 in Birdsboro. The route was extended north to US 422 in 2008, replacing a former section of PA 82 north of Birdsboro that was initially designated in 1928. Route description PA 345 begins at an intersection with PA 82 and Little Conestoga Road in the community of Loag in West Nantmeal Township, Chester County, heading northeast on two-lane undivided Bulltown Road. The road heads through agricultural areas and comes to a bridge over the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76). The route heads into East Nantmeal Township and passes woodland and homes, curving north to reach an intersection with PA 401. PA 345 passes between a pair of golf courses and enters Warwick Township, where it intersects PA 23. Past this, the route continues north before it turns east onto Warwick Road and passes through the residential community of Warwick. PA 345 turns north onto Pine Swamp Road and heads into a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. PA 345 winds northeast into forested areas and crosses into Union Township in Berks County, where it heads through the Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site and crosses French Creek. The road curves to the northwest and continues into French Creek State Park, running through more dense forests. The route leaves the state park and winds north through the community of Kulptown, with the name changing to Chestnut Street. PA 345 turns northwest before it runs north along the border between the borough of Birdsboro to the west and Union Township to the east, passing through residential areas and heading to the west of Daniel Boone Area High School. The route comes to an intersection with PA 724, at which point it turns west into Birdsboro to form a concurrency with PA 724 on East Main Street. The road passes more homes and heads into the commercial center of Birdsboro. Both routes turn north onto North Furnace Street before PA 724 splits from PA 345 by heading to the west, crossing Hay Creek. PA 345 crosses the Schuylkill River into Exeter Township and soon passes over Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line. The route heads north on South Center Road and heads through residential areas and woods. In the community of Baumstown, PA 345 intersects the eastbound lanes of US 422 before it comes to its northern terminus at a junction with the westbound direction of US 422. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, present-day PA 345 was not part of a route. By 1928, the present alignment of the route existed as an unpaved road; the road was unnumbered south of Birdsboro and was numbered as part of PA 82 between Birdsboro and Baumstown. The portion of PA 82 between Birdsboro and Baumstown was paved by 1930. What is now PA 345 south of Birdsboro was paved by 1940. PA 345 was designated by 1973 to run from PA 82 in Loag north to PA 724 in Birdsboro.

In 1897, Henri d'Orléans, Duke of Aumale and son of Louis- Philippe I, bequeathed the château and its collections to the Institut de France. It included both rooms remodeled as museum spaces and those left as residential quarters in the styles of the 18th and 19th centuries. Collections Museum map The collection of old master paintings is among the most important in France. It consists predominantly of Italian and French works and includes three paintings by Fra Angelico, three by Raphael, five by Nicolas Poussin, four by Antoine Watteau and five signed by Jean-Auguste- Dominique Ingres. The museum harbors a collection of 2,500 drawings and a library including 1,500 manuscripts, of which 200 are illuminated. The most renowned of the latter are the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. In addition to these, there are collections of prints, portrait miniatures, sculptures, antiques, old photographs, decorative arts, furniture and porcelain. The collection may only be seen at Chantilly due to the conditions attached to the bequest by the Duke d'Aumale. These conditions forbid the loaning of artworks to other institutions as well as insisting that the exhibition spaces not be modified in any way. As a result, the museum remains almost unchanged since it was opened in 1898. About 250,000 visitors come to the museum each year.

Ai-Ren is a departure from most of Tanaka's light-hearted slice-of-life stories in that there is a dark and philosophical sci-fi undertone to the whole story. He comments about this at the start of the story. Ai-Ren was serialized in the bi-weekly magazine Young Animal from June 1999 to May 2002. The chapters for this manga were collected into five tankōbon volumes, released by Hakusensha. These chapters were also collected into two aizōban collector's edition volumes in January 2009.  Synopsis  Ikuru is going to die soon. He lives today, because of another girl's body parts that were grafted to him long ago. The parts that had once saved his life now threatens to take it away. Weighed by the pain and loneliness of his condition and his dilemma, he decides to request the companionship of an AGH-RMS, an \\"Ai-Ren.\\" These artificially generated humans have their personality and disposition artificially engineered to specification. Their origins are a mystery, but they currently serve to comfort terminally ill patients. When Ikuru's AGH-RMS first arrives, he is surprised by her decisively childish naivite. He names her \\"Ai\\" and rediscovers life, love, and how moments he once took for granted can take new meaning when shared with someone else. However, the futuristic human society seems to be on the edge of an unavoidable apocalypse while Ikuru and Ai live in their own sweet little bit of paradise. Ikuru finds solace in Ai's love, but AGH-RMS can only maintain their engineered persona and memories for a short time. Ai faces death as well.  Characters  ;Ikuru Yoshizumi :The introspective main character of the series. He seems like the stereotypical character of a Ren-ai game, but he is also very intelligent and cynical at times. Ever since the traffic accident, which killed his parents and left him living on borrowed time, Ikuru is haunted by memories of his death and his body's self-destruction, which leaves him occasionally unable to eat and paralyzed in place. :He is good at cooking and housekeeping. Ikuru grows a vegetable garden in his yard, where he later nurtures tomato plants with Ai. He is very kind and tolerant by nature, but he often feels left out and alienated from the rest of the world. :He outlives Ai. He is later killed by a stray missile blast, but he dies happily knowing that he will finally be re-united with Ai. ;Ai :She is the \\"Ai-Ren\\" Ikuru requests to be his companion near his death. Ai is very precocious and inquisitive, but naive and resembles many of Rumiko Takahashi's heroines. When she first arrived, she was more of an annoyance, drawing all over the walls and never staying still. Even though her personality is \\"engineered\\", she seems to prefer the louder and flashier things in life (rock and roll music, cropped asian outfits) unlike Ikuru. :She keeps a journal where she draws out what happens in her life and her feelings. Ikuru teaches her how to play piano, but soon she surpasses Ikuru and learns to play guitar as well. Ai has a special charm that brings hope to other people. Ai dies peacefully in her sleep. ;Haruka Nagi :Ikuru's Teacher and a \\"perfect being.\\" She forced Ikuru to want to live and be self-reliant after his operation with his implanted body parts. She was attracted to Ikuru before and seems to be somewhat reluctant to accept Ai now. Haruka is a very esteemed doctor at the hospital where Ikuru is treated, and appears to be connected to the precarious state of the earth at the moment. :Haruka worries about Ikuru and his well-being a lot. She also takes care of Ikuru and Ai's child, releasing her from the incubator she stayed in at the end of the story.

It is located in a privately owned public space (POPS) controlled by Brookfield Properties and Goldman Sachs. Zuccotti Park is bounded by Broadway to the east, Liberty Street to the north, Trinity Place to the west, and Cedar Street to the south. The park was created in 1968 by Pittsburgh-based United States Steel, after the property owners negotiated its creation with city officials. It was named Liberty Plaza Park because it was situated one block south of One Liberty Plaza. The park's northwest corner is across the street from Four World Trade Center. It has been popular with local tourists and financial workers. The park was heavily damaged in the September 11 attacks and subsequent recovery efforts of 2001. The plaza was later used as the site of several events commemorating the anniversary of the attacks. After renovations in 2006, the park was renamed by its current owners, Brookfield Office Properties, after company chairman John Zuccotti. In 2011, the plaza became the site of the Occupy Wall Street protest camp, during which activists occupied the plaza and used it as a staging ground for their protests throughout the Financial District. History The site was the location of the first coffeehouse in colonial New York City, The King's Arms which opened under the ownership of Lieutenant John Hutchins in 1696. It stood on the west side of Broadway between Crown (now Liberty) Street and Little Queen (now Cedar) Street.Burrows and Wallace (1999), p.108 On November 5, 1773, summoned by the Sons of Liberty, a huge crowd assembled outside the coffee house to denounce the Tea Act, and agents of the East India Trading Company who were handling cargoes of dutied tea. It was perhaps the first public demonstration in opposition to the Tea Act in the American colonies.Burrows and Wallace (1999), p.214 The park was created in 1968 by Pittsburgh-based United States Steel, after the property owners negotiated its creation with city officials, in return for a height bonus for an adjacent building at the time of its construction. The structure, One Liberty Plaza, replaced the demolished Singer Building and City Investing Building. = September 11 attacks and renovation = The park was one of the few open spaces with tables and seats in the Financial District. Located one block from the World Trade Center, it was covered with debris, and subsequently used as a staging area for the recovery efforts after the destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. As part of the Lower Manhattan rebuilding efforts, the park was regraded, trees were planted, and the tables and seating restored. On June 1, 2006, the park reopened after an $8 million renovation designed by Cooper, Robertson & Partners. It was renamed Zuccotti Park in honor of John E. Zuccotti, former City Planning Commission chairman and first deputy mayor under Abe Beame and the then- chairman of Brookfield Properties, which used private money to renovate the park. Currently, the park has a wide variety of trees, granite sidewalks, tables and seats, as well as lights built into the ground, which illuminate the area. With its proximity to Ground Zero, Zuccotti Park is a popular tourist destination. The World Trade Center cross, which was previously housed at St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, was featured in a ceremony held in Zuccotti Park before it was moved to the 9/11 Memorial. The park won the 2008 American Institute of Architects Honor Award for Regional and Urban Design and was featured in Architectural Record and International New Architecture magazines. = Occupy Wall Street = occupied by protesters during Occupy Wall Street During the Occupy Wall Street movement, many protesters inhabited Zuccotti Park and spent their days and nights there, despite park rules prohibiting staying overnight. Attempts were made by the NYPD to disperse the protesters, but not until November 15, 2011 were they substantially evicted. At that time, police officers lit up the area with floodlights and began to clear out the park. Tents, tarps, and other forms of shelters were immediately removed, but protesters began to resist being driven out of the park. This led to the pepper-spraying and detainment of some protesters. After the park was reopened to the public, it was made known that protesters were still permitted to exercise their civil rights, but that this did not include sleeping and camping out at the park. Some protesters attempted to remain at the site after this, which led to continuing conflict with the police. After the complete eviction of the protesters from Zuccotti Park, they rallied again and attempted to take over other locations. Sculptures The park is home to three sculptures: Joie de Vivre by Mark di Suvero; Double Check, a bronze businessman sitting on a bench, by John Seward Johnson II; and Rose III by Iza Genzken.Joie de Vivre, a 70-foot-tall sculpture consisting of bright-red beams, was installed in Zuccotti Park in 2006, having been moved from its previous installation in the Storm King Art Center. Benjamin Genocchio, an Australian art critic, commented that the sculpture suited the location, \\"nicely echoing the skyscrapers around it.\\"  See also  * * List of privately owned public spaces in New York City * Occupation of Alcatraz * People's Park (Berkeley) References Notes Bibliography * External links * Category:Broadway (Manhattan) Category:Brookfield Properties buildings Category:Financial District, Manhattan Category:Occupy Wall Street Category:Parks in Manhattan Category:Privately owned public spaces Category:Squares in Manhattan Category:Urban public parks ","title":"Zuccotti Park"},{"id":"11869667","text":"François-Nicholas-Madeleine Morlot (28 December 1795 - 29 December 1862) was a French prelate of the Catholic Church.

It could be interpreted as \\"vanguard\\". was primarily a Brazilian musical television show first aired by Rede Record in 1965, though the term soon expanded so as to designate the entire movement and style surrounding it. The members of the program were singers who had been influenced by the American rock n' roll of the late 1950s and British Invasion bands of the 1960s, though the music often became softer, more naïve versions with light, romantic lyrics aimed at teenagers. They were Roberto Carlos, Erasmo Carlos and Wanderléa, with other bands and musicians appearing on the show as guests. The style became popularly known as \\"iê-iê-iê\\", a term that, like French yé-yé, is most likely based on the frequent \\"yeah\\" cries heard in songs of the period (for instance, the Beatles' \\"She loves you/Yeah yeah yeah\\"). Iê-iê-iê was often considered a lesser genre, inferior to the more sophisticated bossa nova and MPB music of the period. Jovem Guarda also became a lucrative business thanks to merchandise that explored its theme and even a couple of themed motion pictures were shot during the period, thus reinforcing the idea of its lack of artistic integrity.

It was released on 13 October 2003 on the Real World label. The album was recorded while Bennett was ill and unable to play his instruments, so instead he brought together samples of unaccompanied traditional Scottish folk singers, his own bagpipe and fiddle playing, and electronic drum beats. The opening track, Move, samples a recording of traditional singer Sheila Stewart performing Ewan MacColl’s Moving On Song. Stewart was delighted that he was taking her music to a new audience. The album features many other traditional Scottish singers, including Lizzie Higgins and Scottish Gaelic singer Flora MacNeil, as well as Michael Marra narrating an English translation of psalm 118 in the track Liberation. In Bennett's sleeve notes for Grit, he wrote, “In recent years so many representations of Scotland have been misty-lensed and fanciful to the point that the word ‘Celtic’ has really become a cloudy pigeon hole. This album was a chance for me to present a truthful picture, yet face my own reflection in the great mirror of all cultures.” The album skillfully interweaves old and new sounds and has been \\"credited with starting the musical evolution of Celtic fusion\\". The song \\"Blackbird\\" was used in the soundtrack for Danny MacAskill's 2014 film, The Ridge. The album cover shows a photo of the artist standing on top of a hill, right behind a Trig - an Anagram of the album title.

Early life Eder was born to a Lithuanian Jewish family in Goldingen in the Duchy of Courland in the Russian Empire. He was the son of Martin Sass Eder and Dorina Kaiser, and was the youngest of their seven children. In 1851 Santiago Eder immigrated from Courland to New York City where his older brother and most of his siblings already lived. He completed his education and after some work experience entered Harvard Law School in 1858. In 1861 he moved to San Francisco, and from there moved to the Colombian sea port of Buenaventura where he worked as a lawyer and a commercial representative for Panamanian trading firms when Panama was still part of Colombia. In 1864 he bought the Manuelita sugar and coffee farm near the city of Palmira in the Cauca Valley of Colombia. He bought this farm at a public auction in Cali from the father of leading Colombian novelist Jorge Isaacs. In 1866 Eder became the consul of the United States in Buenaventura, as well as the vice-consul of Chile. In 1867 he traveled to London where he met and married Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Benjamin in the New Synagogue. In their marriage certificate, the name of don Santiago's father is given as 'Moses Eder'. From this marriage were born his children Henry, Charles, Luisa, Walter, Phanor, Fanny and Edith Eder. Industrial pioneer in Colombia In 1901, Manuelita became the first Colombian sugar mill to move from mule to steam powered mills. As such, don Santiago became one of Colombia's first industrialists. In 1903 he left his children Charles James and Henry James Eder in charge of his business interests and moved with his wife to New York. He remained there until his death at 83 in 1921. Eder is buried at the Shearith Israel Cemetery in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn. His nephew Montague David Eder was one of England's Leading Zionist. After his death, the Manuelita sugar company saw further expansions in 1927 and 1939. In 1952 under management of Harold Henry Eder, Santiago's grandson, Manuelita became the first sugarcane mill in Colombia to make refined sugar. Under Santiago Eder's great grandson Henry James Eder Manuelita started an international expansion, and today is one of Colombia's leading agro/industrial companies with operations in Colombia, Peru, Brazil and Chile. The current president of Manuelita is Harold Eder Garcés, is don Santiago's great-great-grandson and belongs to the fifth generation of the Eder Family in Colombia. Much of Santiago Eder's correspondence, mostly business related, but also dealing with the Colombian government and personal family matters, are preserved at the Phanor James Eder Collection at the University of Miami.

It used the 9×19mm NATO cartridge and was used by the Belgian Army until the 1980s. The Vigneron is a selective-fire weapon for short-range street and brush fighting. It remains reasonably accurate up to 100 m using sighted semi- automatic fire. For close-range combat, 2- or 3-shot bursts are recommended. History =Pre-production= After World War II the Belgian Army was equipped with a mixture of British and American guns. The army, wanting to replace them with a modern and, if possible, Belgian design, held tests between several prototypes: * the Imperia, an improved Sten gun; * the RAN, a design by \\"Repousmetal S.A.\\"; * several FN prototypes; and * The Vigneron M1 =M1= The Vigneron M1 was designed by a retired Belgian army Colonel, Georges Vigneron, and officially adopted by the Belgian army in 1953. (this adoption date needs to be confirmed, one known survivor serial 002212 is stamped ABL 1952, indicating it was in Belgian army service a year before this date) The first series of Vignerons was manufactured by the Societe Anonyme Precision Liegeoise in Herstal. Some parts were subcontracted to the State Arsenal at Rocourt in Liège, who eventually began making complete guns. Other Vignerons were fabricated by the company Ateliers de Fabrications Electriques et Metalliques or AFEM in Brussels. An unconfirmed story says that the CMH inscription on the grip means Compagnie de Manufacture Herstal, and this company is supposed to have made the plastic lower receiver. The first model Vigneron was made until serial number 21300 in 1954. (This date needs to be confirmed since known M2 survivors have serial numbers indicating that at least 90,530 M2's had been built by 1953). Some sources state that many M1's were reworked to M2 standard by fitting hood over foresight, changing the rear sight and fitting a stronger spring to the ejection port cover and that when this upgrade was done the M1 designation was overstamped M2, but examples of M1's that have been upgraded to the M2 exist where the original M1 stamp has not been over stamped. =M2= The M2 version was an improvement in several ways, it was in production by 1953: (One known Vigneron M2 is stamped as serial 086916 and is dated 1953) * a front sight protector was installed * a rear sight notch was used instead of a peep sight * the dust cover closing spring was made stronger Design and influence The Vigneron is a simple blowback design and was made out of stamped sheet metal and a plastic grip frame. It uses the standard 9×19mm NATO round out of a 32-shot double-column, single-feed, box magazine. Army doctrine recommends to shortload the magazine to 28 rounds to prevent failures. A box type loading tool is used to assist loading the magazine. The gun was designed with a long barrel (305mm) which featured a compensator and cooling fins. The replaceable barrel was held in by a knurled nut, but a design fault meant that the barrel could be fitted upside down (a famous picture exists of a member of the I.R.A. brandishing a Vigneron, with the foresight below the barrel). This fault was never corrected. Empty casings are ejected out of the ejection port on the right which has a hinged dust cover. This cover opens automatically when cocking the gun. If the gun is to be kept cocked in dusty conditions the cover can be manually closed after cocking to exclude dust and grit, and it will open automatically when the gun is fired. The bolt handle is on the left side and is non-reciprocating. A cover plate excludes dust and grit when the lever is returned forward. The stock is heavy steel rod and it telescopes along the receiver; one end is slotted for swabs and the other is threaded for a cleaning brush. The sights are fixed and set for a range of 50 m. The M2 has a simple notch rear sight and a hood cover that protects the front sight. The pistol grip contains a grip safety which must be held before the weapon can be cocked or fired. There are three selector positions: safe, single round and full automatic fire. When set to full-auto; it is still possible to squeeze off single rounds with good trigger control. Influence by some popular WW-II- era designs is apparent. The \\"Cutts\\" type barrel compensator and cooling rings are reminiscent of the Thompson submachine gun, the wire stock looks like the M3 submachine gun, the bolt design is nearly identical to the Sten and the magazine is almost the same as the one designed for the MP40. However MP40 magazines will not interchange with Vigneron magazines. Neither will fit the other weapon. A blank firing barrel and a grenade launcher attachment were also made for this gun.

A geosynchronous satellite is a satellite in geosynchronous orbit, with an orbital period the same as the Earth's rotation period. Such a satellite returns to the same position in the sky after each sidereal day, and over the course of a day traces out a path in the sky that is typically some form of analemma. A special case of geosynchronous satellite is the geostationary satellite, which has a geostationary orbit – a circular geosynchronous orbit directly above the Earth's equator. Another type of geosynchronous orbit used by satellites is the Tundra elliptical orbit. Geostationary satellites have the unique property of remaining permanently fixed in exactly the same position in the sky as viewed from any fixed location on Earth, meaning that ground-based antennas do not need to track them but can remain fixed in one direction. Such satellites are often used for communication purposes; a geosynchronous network is a communication network based on communication with or through geosynchronous satellites. Definition The term geosynchronous refers to the satellite's orbital period which enables it to be with the rotation of the Earth (\\"geo-\\"). Along with this orbital period requirement, to be geostationary as well, the satellite must be placed in an orbit that puts it in the vicinity over the equator. These two requirements make the satellite appear in an unchanging area of visibility when viewed from the Earth's surface, enabling continuous operation from one point on the ground. The special case of a geostationary orbit is the most common type of orbit for communications satellites. If a geosynchronous satellite's orbit is not exactly aligned with the Earth's equator, the orbit is known as an inclined orbit. It will appear (when viewed by someone on the ground) to oscillate daily around a fixed point. As the angle between the orbit and the equator decreases, the magnitude of this oscillation becomes smaller; when the orbit lies entirely over the equator in a circular orbit, the satellite remains stationary relative to the Earth's surface - it is said to be geostationary.  Application  , there are approximately 446 active geosynchronous satellites, some of which are not operational. A geostationary satellite is in orbit around the Earth at an altitude where it orbits at the same rate as the Earth turns. An observer at any place where the satellite is visible will always see it in exactly the same spot in the sky, unlike stars and planets that move continuously. Geostationary satellites appear to be fixed over one spot above the equator. Receiving and transmitting antennas on the earth do not need to track such a satellite. These antennas can be fixed in place and are much less expensive than tracking antennas. These satellites have revolutionized global communications, television broadcasting and weather forecasting, and have a number of important defense and intelligence applications. One disadvantage of geostationary satellites is a result of their high altitude: radio signals take approximately 0.25 of a second to reach and return from the satellite, resulting in a small but significant signal delay. This delay increases the difficulty of telephone conversation and reduces the performance of common network protocols such as TCP/IP, but does not present a problem with non- interactive systems such as satellite television broadcasts. There are a number of proprietary satellite data protocols that are designed to proxy TCP/IP connections over long-delay satellite links—these are marketed as being a partial solution to the poor performance of native TCP over satellite links. TCP presumes that all loss is due to congestion, not errors, and probes link capacity with its \\"slow-start\\" algorithm, which only sends packets once it is known that earlier packets have been received. Slow start is very slow over a path using a geostationary satellite. RFC 2488, written in 1999, gives several suggestions on this issue. There are some advantages of geo-stationary satellites: *Get high temporal resolution data. *Tracking of the satellite by its earth stations is simplified. *Satellite always in same position. A disadvantage of geostationary satellites is the incomplete geographical coverage, since ground stations at higher than roughly 60 degrees latitude have difficulty reliably receiving signals at low elevations. Satellite dishes at such high latitudes would need to be pointed almost directly towards the horizon. The signals would have to pass through the largest amount of atmosphere, and could even be blocked by land topography, vegetation or buildings. In the USSR, a practical solution was developed for this problem with the creation of special Molniya / Orbita inclined path satellite networks with elliptical orbits. Similar elliptical orbits are used for the Sirius Radio satellites. History The concept was first proposed by Herman Potočnik in 1928 and popularised by the science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke in a paper in Wireless World in 1945. Working prior to the advent of solid-state electronics, Clarke envisioned a trio of large, crewed space stations arranged in a triangle around the planet. Modern satellites are numerous, uncrewed, and often no larger than an automobile. Widely known as the \\"father of the geosynchronous satellite\\", Harold Rosen, an engineer at Hughes Aircraft Company, invented the first operational geosynchronous satellite, Syncom 2. It was launched on a Delta rocket B booster from Cape Canaveral July 26, 1963. The first geostationary communication satellite was Syncom 3, launched on August 19, 1964, with a Delta D launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral. The satellite, in orbit approximately above the International Date Line, was used to telecast the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo to the United States. Westar 1 was America's first domestic and commercially launched geostationary communications satellite, launched by Western Union and NASA on April 13, 1974.

The fires are below the surface, where the peat is smoldering. The Southeast Asian haze is a fire-related large-scale air pollution problem that occurs regularly. Generally, it is worst between July and October. These haze events have caused adverse health and economic impact on Brunei Darussalam, in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and, to a lesser degree, the Philippines and Thailand. The problem flares up every dry season, in varying degrees. Transboundary haze in Southeast Asia has been recorded since 1972. The haze is largely caused by illegal agricultural fires due to industrial-scale slash- and-burn practices in Indonesia, especially from the provinces of South Sumatra and Riau in Indonesia's Sumatra island, and Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo. Burned land can be sold at a higher price illegally, and eventually used for activities including oil palm and pulpwood production. Burning is also cheaper and faster compared to cutting and clearing using excavators or other machines. Causes Most haze events have resulted from smoke from fires that occurred on peatlands in Sumatra and the Kalimantan region of Borneo island. Undisturbed humid tropical forests are considered to be very resistant to fire, experiencing rare fires only during extraordinary dry periods. A study published in 2005 concluded that there is no single dominant cause of fire in a particular site and there are wide differences in the causes of fires in different sites. The study identified the following direct and indirect causes of fire: > * Direct causes of fire ** Fire as a tool in land clearing ** Fire as a > weapon in land tenure or land use disputes ** Accidental or escaped fires ** > Fire connected with resource extraction * Indirect causes of fire ** Land > tenure and land use allocation conflicts and competition ** Forest degrading > practices ** Economic incentives/disincentives ** Population growth and > migration ** Inadequate fire fighting and management capacity =Fire as a tool in land clearing= Fire is the cheapest and fastest method to clear land in preparation for planting. Fire is used to clear the plant material left over from logging or old crops. Mechanically raking the plant material into long piles and letting them rot over time, is expensive and slow, and could harbour pests. Clearing land with machines and chemicals can cost up to US$200 per hectare while using fire costs US$5 per hectare. After a peat swamp forest has been cleared and drained, the peat soil is still unsuitable for agriculture, because peat soil is nutrient-poor and acidic (pH 3 - 4). To make the soil suitable for agriculture, the pH has to be neutralised and nutrients added. Pests and plant diseases also have to be removed. One method is to use chemicals such as limestone to neutralise the acidity, as well as fertilisers and pesticides. This method costs about Rupiah 30 - 40 million per hectare. Alternatively, fire is used to clear the plant material left over from logging. The fire kills pests and the resulting ash serves to fertilise the soil and neutralise the acidity. This method costs Rupiah 2 million per hectare. =Land conflicts= In Indonesia, the Basic Forestry Law grants the Ministry of Forestry authority over all land classified as forests. Approximately 49% of the nation (909,070 square kilometres) is covered by actual forest, although the government classifies 69% of the land area (1,331,270 square kilometres) as forest. The land rights of traditional communities that live on land classified as forest cannot be registered and are generally unrecognised by the state. Therefore, these communities do not really have the ability to enforce rules at the village level and exclude outsiders such as oil palm plantations, logging companies, residents of other villages, migrants, small-scale loggers or transmigrants. Competing claims in turn leads to land conflicts. As the number of new, external actors increases, so does the likelihood that fire will be used as a weapon. =Role of peat= Peat forms under waterlogged conditions in peat swamp forests such as this one in Raja Musa Forest Reserve, Selangor, Malaysia. A peatland is an area where organic material such as leaves and twigs had accumulated naturally under waterlogged conditions in the last 10,000 years. This layer of organic material, known as peat, can be up to 20m deep. Indonesia has 265,500 km2 of peatland, which comprises 13.9% of its land area. Malaysia also has significant peatland, at 26,685 km2, covering 8.1% of its land area. Although originally a wetland ecosystem, much of the peatland in Southeast Asia have been drained for human activities such as agriculture, forestry and urban development. A report published in 2011 stated that more than 30% of peat swamp forests had been converted to agricultural land and a further 30% had been logged or degraded in the past 20 to 30 years. Excessive drainage in peat results in the top layer of peat drying out. Due to its high carbon content, dry peat is extremely susceptible to burning, especially during the dry season. Studies have shown that peat fires are a major contributor to the haze. In 2009, around 40% of all fires in Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo, Sumatra and Java were detected in peatlands, even though they cover only 10% of the land area studied. The concentration of sulphur in rain falling over Singapore in 1997 correlated closely with the PM2.5 concentration, which can be attributed to the strong sulphur emission from peat fires. Effects Haze related damages can be attributed to two sources: the haze causing fire and the haze itself. Each of the two factors can create significant disruption to people's daily lives and affect people's health. As a whole the recurring haze incidents affected regional economy and generated contention between governments of nations affected. =Fire damage= Haze fires can cause many kinds of damage that are local as well as transboundary. These include loss of direct and indirect forest benefits, timber, agricultural products and biodiversity. The fires also incur significant firefighting costs and carbon release to the atmosphere. =Haze damage= Some of the more direct damage caused by haze include damage to people's short term health and regional tourism during haze periods. The haze also leads to industrial production losses, airline and airport losses, damage to fisheries, and incurs the costs on cloud seeding. In addition, severe haze weather can lead to long-term health damage, reduced crop productivity, reduced visibility, avertive expenditures, accidents, loss of life, evacuations, and the loss of confidence of foreign investors. Health effects of haze The health effects of haze depend on its severity as measured by the Pollutants Standards Index (PSI). Levels above 100 are classified as unhealthy and anything above 300 - as hazardous. There is also individual variation regarding the ability to tolerate air pollution. Most people would at most experience sneezing, running nose, eye irritation, dry throat and dry cough from the pollutants. However, persons with medical conditions like asthma, chronic lung disease, chronic sinusitis and allergic skin conditions are likely to be more severely affected by the haze and they may experience more severe symptoms. Children and the elderly in general are more likely to be affected. For some, symptoms may worsen with physical activity. The transboundary Southeast Asian haze has been linked to various cardiovascular conditions including acute ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest. These studies found dose-dependent effect of PSI on the risk of development these conditions. There appears to be increased susceptibility amongst the elderly and those with past history of heart disease and diabetes mellitus. The risk is elevated for several days after exposure. PSI during periods of haze has also been correlated with all-cause mortality, as well as respiratory-illnesses that presented to Emergency Departments and hospital admissions. Proposed solutions The below solutions are proposed by Dennis et al. to mitigate the direct and indirect causes of fires which result in haze. =Reduce the use of fire as a tool in land clearing= Indonesian law prohibits the use of fire to clear land for any agriculture but weak enforcement is a major issue. Many companies have also claimed that zero burning is impractical and uncompetitive given the lack of meaningful penalties for illegal burning. =Land-use allocations and tenure= Research shows that the most common cause of fire was related to competition and conflict about land tenure and land allocation. Land-use allocation decisions made by central government agencies often overlap with the concession boundaries of local jurisdictions and indigenous communities’ territories. Regional reforms are needed to resolve the resource conflicts and they offer opportunities for the regional government to reconcile decisions with those of local and customary institutions. Regional reforms should also ensure that land and resource allocations and decisions at all levels are compatible with physical site characteristics, prominently taking fire risks into account. However, Indonesia's legacy of inaccurate maps, overlapping boundaries, and a lack of technical expertise at the Provincial and District levels will make this a difficult task. =Reduce forest degrading practices= Policies to improve land management and measures to restore ecological integrity to degraded natural forests are extremely important to reduce the incidence of repeated fires. Promoting community involvement in such rehabilitation efforts is critical for their success in reducing fire risks. =Capacity to prevent and suppress fires= The fires in Kalimantan and Sumatra highlight the need to develop fire management systems that address concerns of specific areas. Sufficient resources must be made available to improve fire management in regions that need them, while recognising the diverse needs of different regions and the people within them. Technology such as remote sensing, digital mapping, and instantaneous communications can help to predict, detect, and respond to potential fire crises. However, such technology should be broadly accessible, widely used, and transparently controlled before they can be effective in improving fire management in remote regions. =Economic disincentives and incentives= In addition to effective criminal and monetary penalties for illegal burning and liability for fire damage, some policy analysts believe in the potential for economic policy reforms and market-based incentives. A combination of eco-labeling and international trade restrictions could reduce markets for commodities that posed high-fire risks in their production. The government could also provide fiscal advantages to support companies’ investments in fire management. History It generally refers to haze occurring in Southeast Asia.

Clutter is a term used for unwanted echoes in electronic systems, particularly in reference to radars. Such echoes are typically returned from ground, sea, rain, animals/insects, chaff and atmospheric turbulences, and can cause serious performance issues with radar systems.  Backscatter coefficient  What one person considers to be clutter, another may consider to be a target. However, targets usually refer to point scatterers and clutter to extended scatterers (covering many range, angle, and Doppler cells). The clutter may fill a volume (such as rain) or be confined to a surface (like land). In principle, all that is required to estimate the radar return (backscatter) from a region of clutter is a knowledge of the volume or surface illuminated and the echo per unit volume, η, or per unit surface area, σ° (the backscatter coefficient).  Clutter- limited or noise-limited radar In addition to any possible clutter there will also always be noise. The total signal competing with the target return is thus clutter plus noise. In practice there is often either no clutter or clutter dominates and the noise can be ignored. In the first case the radar is said to be Noise Limited, in the second it is Clutter Limited.  Volume clutter  Rain, hail, snow and chaff are examples of volume clutter. For example, suppose an airborne target, at range R, is within a rainstorm. What is the effect on the detectability of the target? Figure 1. Illustration of illuminated Rain Cell First find the magnitude of the clutter return. Assume that the clutter fills the cell containing the target, that scatterers are statistically independent and that the scatterers are uniformly distributed through the volume. The clutter volume illuminated by a pulse can be calculated from the beam widths and the pulse duration, Figure 1. If c is the speed of light and \\\\tau is the time duration of the transmitted pulse then the pulse returning from a target is equivalent to a physical extent of c\\\\tau, as is the return from any individual element of the clutter. The azimuth and elevation beamwidths, at a range R, are \\\\theta/2 and \\\\phi/2 respectively if the illuminated cell is assumed to have an elliptical cross section. The volume of the illuminated cell is thus: :\\\\ V_m=\\\\pi R \\\\tan(\\\\theta/2)R \\\\tan(\\\\phi/2)(c\\\\tau/2) For small angles this simplifies to: :\\\\ V_m\\\\approx\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}(R\\\\theta)(R\\\\phi)(c\\\\tau/2) The clutter is assumed to be a large number of independent scatterers that fill the cell containing the target uniformly. The clutter return from the volume is calculated as for the normal radar equation but the radar cross section is replaced by the product of the volume backscatter coefficient, \\\\eta, and the clutter cell volume as derived above. The clutter return is then :\\\\ C=\\\\frac{P_tG_tA_r}{(4\\\\pi)^2R^4}\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}(R\\\\theta)(R\\\\phi)(c\\\\tau/2)\\\\eta where *P_t = transmitter power (Watts) *G_t = gain of the transmitting antenna *A_r = effective aperture (area) of the receiving antenna *R = distance from the radar to the target A correction must be made to allow for the fact that the illumination of the clutter is not uniform across the beamwidth. In practice the beam shape will approximate to a sinc function which itself approximates to a Gaussian function. The correction factor is found by integrating across the beam width the Gaussian approximation of the antenna. The corrected back scattered power is :\\\\ C=\\\\frac{P_tG_tA_r}{2\\\\log2(4\\\\pi)^2R^4}\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}(R\\\\theta)(R\\\\phi)(c\\\\tau/2)\\\\eta A number of simplifying substitutions can be made. The receiving antenna aperture is related to its gain by: :\\\\ A_r=\\\\frac{G\\\\lambda^2}{4\\\\pi} and the antenna gain is related to the two beamwidths by: :\\\\ G=\\\\frac{\\\\pi^2}{\\\\theta\\\\phi} The same antenna is generally used both for transmission and reception thus the received clutter power is: :\\\\ C=\\\\frac{P_tG\\\\lambda^2}{1024(\\\\log2)R^2}c\\\\tau\\\\eta If the Clutter Return Power is greater than the System Noise Power then the Radar is clutter limited and the Signal to Clutter Ratio must be equal to or greater than the Minimum Signal to Noise Ratio for the target to be detectable. From the radar equation the return from the target itself will be :\\\\ S=\\\\frac{P_tG^2\\\\lambda^2}{(4\\\\pi)^3R^4}\\\\sigma with a resulting expression for the signal to clutter ratio of :\\\\ \\\\frac{S}{C} = \\\\frac{1024(\\\\log2)G\\\\sigma}{(4\\\\pi)^3R^2c\\\\tau\\\\eta} The implication is that when the radar is noise limited the variation of signal to noise ratio is an inverse fourth power. Halving the distance will cause the signal to noise ratio to increase (improve) by a factor of 16. When the radar is volume clutter limited, however, the variation is an inverse square law and halving the distance will cause the signal to clutter to improve by only 4 times. Since :\\\\ G=\\\\frac{\\\\pi^2}{\\\\theta\\\\phi} it follows that :\\\\ \\\\frac{S}{C} = \\\\frac{16(\\\\log2)\\\\sigma}{\\\\pi R^2\\\\theta\\\\phi c\\\\tau\\\\eta} Clearly narrow beamwidths and short pulses are required to reduce the effect of clutter by reducing the volume of the clutter cell. If pulse compression is used then the appropriate pulse duration to be used in the calculation is that of the compressed pulse, not the transmitted pulse. = Problems in calculating signal to volume clutter ratio = A problem with volume clutter, e.g. rain, is that the volume illuminated may not be completely filled, in which case the fraction filled must be known, and the scatterers may not be uniformly distributed. Consider a beam 10° in elevation. At a range of 10 km the beam could cover from ground level to a height of 1750 metres. There could be rain at ground level but the top of the beam could be above cloud level. In the part of the beam containing rain the rainfall rate will not be constant. One would need to know how the rain was distributed to make any accurate assessment of the clutter and the signal to clutter ratio. All that can be expected from the equation is an estimate to the nearest 5 or 10 dB.  Surface clutter  The surface clutter return depends upon the nature of the surface, its roughness, the grazing angle (angle the beam makes with the surface), the frequency and the polarisation. The reflected signal is the phasor sum of a large number of individual returns from a variety of sources, some of them capable of movement (leaves, rain drops, ripples) and some of them stationary (pylons, buildings, tree trunks). Individual samples of clutter vary from one resolution cell to another (spatial variation) and vary with time for a given cell (temporal variation). = Beam filling = Figure 2. Illustration of High and Low Angle Surface Clutter Illumination For a target close to the Earth's surface such that the earth and target are in the same range resolution cell one of two conditions are possible. The most common case is when the beam intersects the surface at such an angle that the area illuminated at any one time is only a fraction of the surface intersected by the beam as illustrated in Figure 2. = Pulse length limited case = For the pulse length limited case the area illuminated depends upon the azimuth width of the beam and the length of the pulse, measured along the surface. The illuminated patch has a width in azimuth of :\\\\ 2R\\\\tan\\\\theta /2. The length measured along the surface is :\\\\ (c\\\\tau/2)\\\\sec\\\\psi. The area illuminated by the radar is then given by :\\\\ A = 2R(c\\\\tau/2)(\\\\tan\\\\theta/2)\\\\sec\\\\psi For 'small' beamwidths this approximates to :\\\\ A = R(c\\\\tau/2)\\\\theta\\\\sec\\\\psi The clutter return is then :\\\\ C=\\\\frac{P_tG^2\\\\lambda^2}{(4\\\\pi)^3R^4}A\\\\sigma^o Watts Substituting for the illuminated area A :\\\\ C=\\\\frac{c}{2^7\\\\pi^3}\\\\frac{P_tG^2\\\\lambda^2}{R^3}\\\\tau\\\\theta\\\\sec\\\\psi\\\\sigma^o Watts where \\\\sigma^o is the back scatter coefficient of the clutter. Converting \\\\theta to degrees and putting in the numerical values gives :\\\\ C=1300\\\\frac{P_tG^2\\\\lambda^2}{R^3}\\\\tau\\\\theta^o\\\\sec\\\\psi\\\\sigma^o Watts The expression for the target return remains unchanged thus the signal to clutter ratio is :\\\\ \\\\frac{S}{C}=\\\\frac{1}{1300}\\\\frac{R^3}{P_tG^2\\\\lambda^2}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau\\\\theta\\\\sec\\\\psi\\\\sigma^o}\\\\frac{P_tG^2\\\\lambda^2}{(4\\\\pi)^3R^4}\\\\sigma Watts This simplifies to :\\\\ \\\\frac{S}{C}=4\\\\times10^{-7}\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\psi}{R\\\\tau\\\\theta}\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sigma^o} In the case of surface clutter the signal to clutter now varies inversely with R. Halving the distance only causes a doubling of the ratio (a factor of two improvement). = Problems in calculating clutter for the pulse length limited case = There are a number of problems in calculating the signal to clutter ratio. The clutter in the main beam is extended over a range of grazing angles and the backscatter coefficient depends upon grazing angle. Clutter will appear in the antenna sidelobes, which again will involve a range of grazing angles and may even involve clutter of a different nature. = Beam width limited case = The calculation is similar to the previous examples, in this case the illuminated area is :\\\\ A=\\\\pi R^2\\\\tan^2\\\\theta/2 which for small beamwidths simplifies to :\\\\ A \\\\approx\\\\pi R^2\\\\theta^2/4 The clutter return is as before :\\\\ C=\\\\frac{P_tG^2\\\\lambda^2}{(4\\\\pi)^3R^4}A\\\\sigma^o Watts Substituting for the illuminated area A :\\\\ C=\\\\frac{P_tG^2\\\\lambda^2}{(4\\\\pi)^3R^4}\\\\pi R^2(\\\\theta/2)^2\\\\sigma^o Watts This can be simplified to: :\\\\ C=\\\\frac{P_tG^2\\\\lambda^2}{4^4\\\\pi^2R^2}\\\\theta^2\\\\sigma^o Watts Converting \\\\theta to degrees :\\\\ C=\\\\frac{P_tG^2\\\\lambda^2}{4^4R^2}(\\\\theta^o/180)^2\\\\sigma^o Watts The target return remains unchanged thus \\\\ \\\\frac{S}{C}=\\\\frac{4^4R^2}{P_tG^2\\\\lambda^2}(180/\\\\theta^o)^2\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma^o}\\\\frac{P_tG^2\\\\lambda^2}{(4\\\\pi)^3R^4}\\\\sigma Which simplifies to \\\\ \\\\frac{S}{C}=5.25\\\\times 10^4\\\\frac{1}{\\\\theta^{o2}R^2}\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sigma^o} As in the case of Volume Clutter the Signal to clutter ratio follows an inverse square law. = General problems in calculating surface clutter = The general significant problem is that the backscatter coefficient cannot in general be calculated and must be measured. The problem is the validity of measurements taken in one location under one set of conditions being used for a different location under different conditions. Various empirical formulae and graphs exist which enable an estimate to be made but the results need to be used with caution.

Operation Phantom Thunder began on 16 June 2007, when Multi-National Force-Iraq launched major offensive operations against al- Qaeda and other extremist terrorists operating throughout Iraq. Operation Phantom Thunder was a corps level operation, including Operation Arrowhead Ripper in Diyala Province, Operation Marne Torch and Operation Commando Eagle in Babil Province, Operation Fardh al-Qanoon in Baghdad, Operation Alljah in Anbar Province, and continuing special forces actions against the Mahdi Army in southern Iraq and against Al-Qaeda leadership throughout the country.Current Press Releases - MISSING SOLDIERS RECOVERED The operation was one of the biggest military operations in Iraq since the U.S. invasion in 2003. Background In mid-October 2006, al-Qaeda announced the creation of Islamic state of Iraq (ISI),Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.183 replacing the Mujahideen Shura Council (MSC) and its al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). From January to June 2007, as part of the \\"surge\\", an additional five U.S. brigades arrived in Iraq and were deployed throughout the Baghdad Belts in preparation for the upcoming operation. At the same time, U.S. forces launched \\"shaping\\" operations to set the conditions for the operation. On 14 June, the Diyala Operational Command was established, an Iraqi corps-level command allowing coordination between Iraqi security forces throughout Diyala. The Operation U.S. and Iraqi forces launched attacks on Baghdad's northern and southern flanks mid-June to clear out Sunni insurgents, al-Qaida fighters and Shiite militiamen who had fled the capital and Anbar during the four- month-old security operation. The U.S. wanted to take advantage of the arrival of the final brigade of 30,000 additional U.S. troops to open the concerted attacks. =Operation \\"Law and Order\\"= Operation Law and Order had already begun on 14 February in an attempt to take back Baghdad which had come more than 70 percent under insurgent control. It became part of Phantom Thunder when that operation started and during the period of Phantom Thunder 311 insurgents, including 26 bombers, were killed in fighting in Baghdad. =Operation \\"Marne Torch\\"= Operation Marne Torch began on 16 June in the Arab Jabour and Salman Pak area, conducted by the new Multinational Division Central. Arab Jabour, being only 20 kilometers southeast from Baghdad, is a major transit point for insurgent forces in and out of Baghdad. By 14 August, 2,500 Coalition and Iraqi forces had detained more than five dozen suspected extremists, destroyed 51 boats, killed 88 terrorists and discovered and destroyed 51 weapons caches. =Operation \\"Arrowhead Ripper\\"= Operation Arrowhead Ripper began on 18 June, when Multi-National Division-North commenced offensive operations against Al-Qaeda positions in Baquba in Diyala province where fighting had already been going on for months. The operation started with air assaults under the cover of darkness in Baquba. Heavy street fighting lasted throughout the first day of the operation, mainly in the center of the city and around the main city market. On 22 June, Coalition attack helicopters killed 17 al-Qaeda gunmen and the vehicle they were using southwest of Khalis in Diyala province. By 19 August, at least 227 insurgents had been killed in Baquba. =Operation \\"Commando Eagle\\"= Operation Commando Eagle began on 21 June in the Mahmudiyah region southwest of Baghdad, conducted by Multinational Division Central. This region contains the notorious Triangle of Death and was the location where three US soldiers were kidnapped in mid-May 2007. The operation has so far resulted in 31 detainees and the seizure of multiple large weapons caches. The operation was described as \\"a mix of helicopter borne air assaults and Humvee-mounted movements.\\" =Operation \\"Alljah\\"= Operation Alljah was being conducted by Multi- National Forces West. In the western Al Anbar province operations attacked insurgent supply lines and weapons caches, targeting the regions of Fallujah, Karma and Tharthar. Commanders of the operation expressed belief that Fallujah would be cleared by August and that the regions of Karma and Tharthar would be cleared by July. On 17 June, a raid near Karma killed a known Libyan Al-Qaeda fighter and six of his aides and on 21 June six al-Qaeda members were killed and five were detained during early-morning raids also near Karma. Also on 23 June, a U.S. airstrike killed five suspects and destroyed their car bomb near Fallujah. Insurgents also struck back in Fallujah with two suicide bombings and an attack on an off-duty policeman that left four policemen dead on 22 June. On 29 June, U.S. forces killed a senior al-Qaeda leader east of Fallujah. Abu 'Abd al-Rahman al-Masri, an Egyptian, was a veteran of both battles of Fallujah. On 6 July a raid west of Fallujah resulted in the killing of an Al-Qaeda in Iraq battalion commander and two of his men and the captured of two more insurgents.Aswat Aliraq =Actions taken against the Mahdi Army= On 21 June, a joint Iraqi-American operation was under way near Hilla to capture or kill members of Moktada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army. Iraqi Special Forces raided Sadr City and captured a \\"key insurgent leader\\" on 20 June, along with two associates. =Additional operations= Numerous smaller operations had also been conducted against insurgents, which included attacks on retreating insurgent forces from Baquba in the town of Khalis and other insurgents targets throughout Diyala province. In the fighting in Diyala province an additional 234 insurgents were killed by 14 August beside those killed in operation Arrowhead Ripper, mainly in clashes in and around the town of Khalis. The fiercest of the clashes happened when the U.S.-allied insurgent group 1920th revolution brigade and Al-Qaeda fought a battle at Shrween village in Muqdadiya on 4 July killing 20 members of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.McClatchy Washington Bureau  07/04/2007 Roundup of daily violence, Wednesday 4 July 2007 The Operation ends On 14 August, it was announced that the operation ended. Coalition and Iraqi security forces pushed into areas previously not under their control, and they also ejected insurgent groups from their strongholds in Northern Babil, eastern Anbar and Diyala provinces and on the southern outskirts of Baghdad. During the operation, Iraqi and Coalition forces conducted intelligence raids against al Qaeda in Iraq and the Iranian-backed cells nationwide, with a heavy emphasis on cells in Baghdad, Diyala, and central and northern Iraq. Operation Arrowhead Ripper continued for another five days until 19 August with more intense street fighting in Baquba. The operations continued into operation Phantom Strike.

C. bairdi is closely related to Chionoecetes opilio, and it can be difficult to distinguish C. opilio from C. bairdi. Both species are found in the Bering Sea and are sold commercially under the name \\"Snow crab\\". Tanner crabs have suffered from overfishing and as a result strict controls have been placed on tanner crab fisheries. Biology mouthparts, other sensory organs, and pincers of an adult male Tanner crabs are considered a short-tailed or \\"true\\" crab. They are decapods with pincer claws on their frontmost pair of legs. They can live over a decade with most adults reaching by the time they reach adulthood, usually after about five years. Females will incubate fertilized eggs for a full year before hatching during spring plankton blooming season. The larvae are at first able to swim, but lose this ability and settle to the bottom after about two months. The tanners' diet consist mostly of other ocean bottom crustaceans, clams and worms. Bottomfish and humans are their main predators. Little is known about their social structure except that the sexes remain mostly separate except during mating season.Wildlife Notebook: Tanner Crab Alaska Department of Fish and Game Tanner crabs are vulnerable to the parasite dinoflagellate, species of Hematodinium, that cause bitter crab disease. Fisheries Tanners are normally caught through the use of crab pots similar to those used to catch the larger King crab. The Bering Sea fishery for tanners opened in 1961 and soon became a major fishery in the North Pacific, with record catches as high as . New fisheries regulations limit the catch and ensure that a portion of crab be available to local Alaskan communities Before the passage of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 much of the Bering Sea tanner crab was caught by Japanese and Soviet fishing vessels. Due to the massive harvests, numbers declined sharply, with only harvested in 1984. Sensing the danger of overfishing tanner crab to the point of extinction, legislators and fisheries managers closed tanner crab fishing entirely in 1986 and 1987. Policy adjustments were made to limit the catch, but the fishery was closed again in 1997 due to a very poor harvest in 1996. In the mid-2000s fisheries managers introduced a \\"Crab Rationalization Program\\" based on similar programs in the North Atlantic and New Zealand. The program introduced individual fishing quotas based on each crab fishing boat's previous catches and a requirement that a percentage of the catch be offered for sale in the regions where it was caught. This program was popular with environmental and conservation groups, although some small-scale crab fisherman complained that it placed them at a disadvantage as they could never catch more than their allotted share even if there were more crab available.Alaska’s Crab Fishery: Big Money Days are Gone Amy Carroll, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Division of Wildlife Conservation In addition to overfishing, researchers from the School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences have hypothesized that prevailing winds may affect crab population numbers from one year to the next.

Browne with Don Turnbull The module was first published by TSR, Inc. in 1982 and contains a 32-page adventure set in the World of Greyhawk campaign setting. It was designed for 6-10 characters of level 1-4. Plot summary In the adventure, the player characters must track down Lizardmen to their lair, to stop them from massing for an assault on the town of Saltmarsh. Saltmarsh is a small fishing village facing serious problems. Lizard Men are gathering a force nearby and buying many sophisticated weapons. A party of adventurers is hired by the town council to investigate the Lizard Men so the villagers can live in peace. Publication history Danger at Dunwater was written by Dave J. Browne with Don Turnbull, and art drawn by Tim Truman; it was published in 1982 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder. Designed and developed in the United Kingdom, it was intended for 6–10 characters of level 1–4. The module has been described as a low-level scenario that carries on where The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh leaves off. (preview) It is the second module in the \\"Saltmarsh\\" series. The second of three related adventures in an underwater campaign set in the town of Saltmarsh, the module is a sequel to U1 – The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh and is followed by U3 – The Final Enemy, which concludes the series. Reception Doug Cowie gave Danger at Dunwater a positive review in Imagine magazine, noting that \\"modules are currently being turned out to a very high standard and this one is no exception\\". He felt that the module provides clear and well organized details as well as \\"well rounded\\" NPCs but that it should be run by an experienced DM who can do justice to its subtleties. Cowie's only reservation was that the town of Saltmarsh plays a central role in all of the modules of the U1-3 series, but that DMs are expected to create it themselves with the help of \\"minimal outline material\\". Cowie felt that this is the sort of detail one expects to find in a module. Nevertheless, he found this to offer a \\"rewarding set\\" of adventures which are best played as part of the series. In conclusion, Cowie praised the careful design and \\"fresh approach\\" and urged his readers to \\"play it\\". Jim Bambra reviewed Danger at Dunwater for White Dwarf, and gave it 8/10 overall, commenting that the module was evidence that a low level adventure can be still be interesting and challenging. Bambra felt that this adventure was meant for players who enjoy a mental challenge; \\"Players who attack everything they meet will find the adventure entertaining but will not realise its full potential. Those who do not overlook obvious clues will realise that there is something more afoot here than immediately meets the eye.\\" Bambra concluded by praising the module further feeling that \\"A lot of thought has gone into this module, monsters are not there to be slain, they have personalities and feelings which come across very well.\\" Ken Denmead of Wired's GeekDad listed the module as one of the \\"Top 10 D&D; Modules I Found in Storage This Weekend\\". According to Denmead, this is \\"another module where the challenge is not what it seems, which is always fun.

It crosses the central part of the country, from the coal mines and steelworks of Upper Silesia in the South to the Baltic Sea port of Gdynia in the North. The line is used mostly by freight trains: passenger connections on it are few. Constructed in the late 1920s and early 1930s, it was one of the biggest investments of the Second Polish Republic. Route The Coal Trunk-Line starts at the station Chorzów Batory, in the Upper Silesian city of Chorzów, heading north. After crossing almost 30 kilometers it reaches Tarnowskie Góry – a very important freight station located on the northern outskirts of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. Then, the line goes towards Kalety and Herby Nowe. In Herby , the Coal Trunk-Line proper begins. The connection Chorzów Batory – Kalety had been built before the 1920s, by the Germans, as these lands had belonged to Germany until 1921. Then, in 1926 a Kalety – Herby Nowe – Wieluń – Kępno line was constructed, thanks to which Upper Silesia and Poznań got a direct connection, without the necessity of using the then-German junction at Kreuzburg (Kluczbork). From Herby , crossing the strategic junctions of Chorzew Siemkowice and Zduńska Wola Karsznice, the Coal Trunk-Line reaches Inowrocław. From there it goes to Bydgoszcz, which had already been connected to Gdańsk and Gdynia (via Laskowice and Tczew), but the creation of Free City of Danzig made it difficult to keep regular Polish freight movement in the interbellum. Thus, another part of the Coal Trunk-Line between Bydgoszcz and Gdynia was constructed in the early 1930s, via Wierzchucin and Kościerzyna and the sparsely populated forests and hills of Kashubia. The Coal Trunk-Line ends in the Baltic Sea port of Gdynia, after crossing all of Poland from south to north (appr. 550 kilometers). History =Beginnings and interwar period= In 1921–1922 the borders of the Second Polish Republic were finally established. Upper Silesia was divided (see: Silesian Uprisings) and the boundary left in German hands several crucial junctions, including Kluczbork (Kreuzburg) and Fosowskie (Vossowska). Without these centers, rail communication between Polish Silesia and the Baltic Sea was virtually impossible. As coal was one of the main Polish exports, and transit through Germany was not allowed (due to the German–Polish customs war in the late 1920s and early 1930s), construction of the new line was necessary. Brda river in Bydgoszcz On February 17, 1928, the President of Poland Ignacy Mościcki signed a bill which ordered construction of the 255-kilometer line Herby – Inowrocław. For unknown reasons, the important industrial center of Łódź, located just a few kilometers east of the route, was not included in it. Instead, the Coal Trunk-Line crossed the main East- West route (Warsaw – Łódź – Ostrów Wielkopolski – Poznań) in the vicinity of the town of Zduńska Wola. As a result, a huge nexus was built in Zduńska Wola- Karsznice, which until today is one of the most important junctions of the whole country. Also, a new settlement was built there, with several condominiums for rail workers and their families. Apart from the line itself, numerous stations along the way were built. Most of them resemble traditional Polish manor houses, with a very interesting architecture. The Herby – Karsznice connection was completed by 1930, soon afterwards the route reached Inowrocław. As the line between Inowrocław and Bydgoszcz already existed, the next step was the construction of the last part – from Bydgoszcz to Gdynia, through the Polish Corridor, without entering the territory of the Free City of Danzig. The whole Coal Trunk-Line was completed by 1933, and in 1939 it was connected with Częstochowa, due to the Chorzew Siemkowice – Częstochowa route, which was finished on April 23, 1939. Also, on the same day, the second track was completed on the sector between Zduńska Wola Karsznice and Chorzew Siemkowice. Among the guests, invited for a celebration of the opening of the Częstochowa – Siemkowice connection, were the Polish minister of transportation, Juliusz Ulrich and the minister of public works of France, Anatole de Monzie. Between the wars, long-distance passenger trains still used the Bydgoszcz – Danzig – Gdynia connection, crossing the territory of the Free City of Danzig. =Second World War and afterwards= During the Second World War German occupiers did not regard the Coal Trunk-Line as a strategic one. For them, the West – East routes were most important, along which military transports were carried. Besides, since the pre-1939 borders were voided, part of the line between Bydgoszcz and Gdynia was replaced by the Bydgoszcz – Tczew – Danzig – Gdynia connection. In spite of this, in the early 1940s, the Germans laid a second track on the routes Herby – Siemkowice (55 km) and Karsznice – Inowrocław (156 km). After the war, the Coal Trunk-Line again gained importance. Transports of Silesian coal to Gdansk and Gdynia were crucial for the Polish economy, so by 1966 electrification of the whole route was completed. However, the original connection Bydgoszcz – Kościerzyna – Gdynia was abandoned by freight trains which go on the route Bydgoszcz – Tczew – Gdansk – Gdynia, and today is used only by local traffic. Today, the Coal Trunk-Line is one of the most prosperous rail routes in Poland. Passenger trains are few (many passenger trains on Tczew - Inowrocław part of this line), but freight trains are very numerous, as this is the fastest way from the industrial areas of Upper Silesia, Zagłębie Dąbrowskie and Częstochowa to the Baltic ports. Investor The Coal Trunk-Line was constructed by order of the Polish Government by a private company, the French-Polish Rail Association (FPTK – Francusko-Polskie Towarzystwo Kolejowe). This company maintained the route Herby – Gdynia from April 24, 1931, until September 1, 1939. During that time, the line was not under the authority of the Polish State Railways (PKP), the FPTK directed it from its headquarters in Bydgoszcz. After the war, the whole line was nationalized. Main stations The most important stations on the original route are Chorzów, Tarnowskie Góry, Kalety, Herby Nowe, Chorzew Siemkowice, Zduńska Wola Karsznice, Inowrocław, Bydgoszcz, Wierzchucin, Kościerzyna, Somonino and Gdynia. Distances The length of the line is measured from the junction at Herby to the port of Gdynia (e.g. from South to North). Not included is the connection Chorzów Batory – Herby (65 km.) * Herby Nowe (0 km.), * Chorzew Siemkowice (55 km.), * Zduńska Wola Karsznice (99 km.), * Inowrocław Rabinek (247 km.), * Inowrocław Glowny (254 km.), * Bydgoszcz Glowna (299 km.), * Wierzchucin (347 km.), * Bąk (392 km.), * Kościerzyna (413 km.), * Somonino (438 km.), * Gdynia Glowna (480 km.).

It has thus almost entirely replaced dynamite. There are numerous versions ranging from shearing charges to aluminized common blasting agents. Tovex is used by 80% of international oil companies for seismic exploration. Tovex Firebreak II used on Upper Bear Creek Trail in the Angeles National Forest History The Tovex family of products, sometimes generically called \\"water gels,\\" were developed by the Explosives Department at DuPont (E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, Inc.) in the mid-to-late 1960s when pelletized TNT was included in aqueous gels to create a slurry form of ANFO that displayed water-resistant properties in wet bore holes.E. I du Pont de Nemours & Company. Blasters' Handbook. Fifteenth Edition, 1966, p. 68. TNT-sensitized water gels were commercially successful, but the TNT led to problems with oxygen balance: namely elevated amounts of combustion by-products such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen-dioxide complexes. Not only was TNT \\"dirty,\\" it was also expensive. TNT was eliminated through the work of DuPont chemists Colin Dunglinson, Joseph Dean Chrisp Sr. and William Lyerly along with a team of others at DuPont's Potomac River Development Laboratory (PRDL) at Falling Waters, West Virginia, and at DuPont's Eastern Laboratories (EL) at Gibbstown, New Jersey. These chemists and engineers formulated a series of water gel-base products that replaced the TNT with methyl ammonium nitrate, also known as monomethylamine nitrate, or PR-M, (which stands for \\"Potomac River – monomethylamine nitrate\\"), creating the \\"Tovex Extra\\" product line. In late 1973, DuPont declared \\"the last days of dynamite\\" and switched to the new Tovex formula. The \\"Tovex\\" (that replaced nitroglycerin-based dynamite) had evolved into a cap-sensitive product. Even though it bore the same name as the earlier \\"Tovex,\\" it was quite different from the precursors, which could only be initiated in large diameters (5 inches) with a one pound TNT booster. The new Tovex of the mid-to-late 1970s could be detonated in (critical) diameters much smaller than 5-inches by utilizing DuPont's Detaflex, thus making the new Tovex a realistic replacement for dynamite. Until then, only nitroglycerin-based explosives were commercially feasible for blasters who wanted cap-sensitive explosives that could be initiated with a #6 blasting cap in bore holes as small as 3/4 of an inch in diameter, sometimes less. The new Tovex satisfied that requirement. Atlas, Hercules, IRECO, Trojan-US Powder and several other explosives manufacturing firms of the era created emulsions, gels and slurries which accomplished the same end, but it was the DuPont patent of PR-M based explosives () that gave the DuPont Company a competitive edge. DuPont stopped producing nitroglycerine-based dynamite in 1976, replacing it with Tovex. In 1980, it sold its Tovex technology to Explosive Technology International (ETI), a Canadian company. One ETI licensee is Biafo Industries Limited, headquartered in Islamabad, Pakistan. , explosives sold under DuPont's original \\"Tovex\\" trade name are distributed in Europe by Societe Suisse des Explosifs, Brigue, in Switzerland.Kohler, Josef and Rudolf Meyer, Explosives, 4th edition, p. 377. (VCH Publishers). Properties Tovex is a 50/50 aqueous solution of ammonium nitrate and methylammonium nitrate (sometimes also called monomethylamine nitrate, or PR-M), sensitized fuels, and other ingredients including sodium nitrate prills, finely divided (paint-grade) aluminum, finely divided coal, proprietary materials to make some grades cap sensitive, and thickening agents to enhance water resistance and to act as crystal modifiers.Guide for the Selection of Commercial Explosives Detection. The detonation velocity of Tovex is around 4,000 to 5,500 m·s−1. The specific gravity is 0.8–1.4. Tovex looks like a fluid gel which can be white to black in color.MSDS .

The blasting product is malleable to the extent that it can be cut to length, laid out, or bundled for a wide variety of applications. Because the material requires heat and fast compression to detonate, it is safe to transport and manipulate once in the field, even if dropped from high altitudes, set on fire, or peppered with high velocity rifle bullets. For dead trees which are considered too hazardous to remove utilizing crosscut saws or chainsaws, one or two wraps of Tovex around the base of the trunk is often enough to fell the tree safely so that the remains may be safely bucked and removed from hiking trails, parks, or other places where people recreate. For firebreaks, the product is simply uncoiled and laid along the ground to follow the ridge line or contours of the hillside or mountain along which the fire crews wish to establish a line of defense. Fire crews then follow-up by clearing debris along the blasted line to establish a fuel-free line. For more technical blasting which requires greater planning and finesse, Tovex is often bundled according to weight into or up against a solid material, then a detonation cord is applied to the Tovex to create a fast moving, heated dynamo effect within the Tovex when one or more blasting caps ignite the detonation cord, thus accelerating the Tovex, which causes it to detonate. Blasting caps are ignited utilizing hand-held intrinsically safe control boxes which employ a series of safety interlocks and switches which require a strict radio sessioning handshake protocol between the unit which ignites the cap and the unit used by the Master Blaster controlling the shot, ensuring that the emplaced Tovex, detonation cord, and caps cannot ignite prematurely. After detonation, the material is completely utilized; there is no discernible residue, unless one employs microscopic analysis. Typically, Tovex and other commercial explosives employ embedded taggants which identify the product and often the agency which purchased the material.

Completed in 1934, the steel-hulled cutter operated on the Great Lakes between 1934 and 1941, attached to the 9th Coast Guard District and homeported at Cleveland, Ohio. She was named after the Tahoma Glacier on the western slope of Mount Rainier in the state of Washington. As the United States moved closed to full participation in World War II, President Roosevelt issued an executive order on 1 November 1941 transferring the Coast Guard from the United States Treasury Department to the Navy. Accordingly, Tahoma was sometime thereafter reclassified as a gunboat and designated WPG-80. By July 1942, the former cutter had left the Great Lakes to escort Allied convoys in the North Atlantic in the vicinity of Casco Bay, Maine; Ivigtut, Greenland; St. John's and Argentia, Newfoundland; and Sydney, Nova Scotia; into the spring of 1944. The remainder of her naval service was spent in serving on weather and ice patrol duties between Greenland and Iceland and plane guard operations in the same waters. In the latter service, she alternated with the Coast Guard cutters Frederick Lee (WPC-139), Algonquin (WPG-75), and Mohawk (WPG-78) into 1945. At the time of the Japanese surrender in mid-August 1945, Tahoma was at sea on a plane guard station.

He drew for the Victoria Times, Toronto Star and The Albertan. His drawings were typically apolitical showing the views of the common person. They often contained a biplane with its landing gear falling off towing a banner with the words \\"Mild, isn't it?\\" and a striped cat, known as \\"puddy tat\\", leaning on its elbow holding a card bearing a wry comment. Biography Barron was born in Toronto on June 13, 1917, the son of Daisy Hilda Wormald. His family moved to Victoria in 1919 where he grew up around the shipping port at Victoria’s breakwater. He began working as an artist in 1940, painting in watercolour and tempera (as he was allergic to oil paints). His painting subjects were harbours, ships and beach scenes. Barron worked in the Canadian comic book industry during the 1940s before entering the world of editorial cartooning. Known as “the poet of the mundane,” Barron soon transformed into \\"one of the funniest and most stylistically distinctive cartoonists to emerge in the post-war editorial cartoon world.\\"Munn, B.K.

First described by Carl Chun in 1915, with a second subspecies discovered by Guy Coburn Robson in 1924, it was named for the distinctive membranes on its arms. Described as being similar to members of the genera Pareledone, Eledone, and Enteroctopus, V. togata has a large body with large eyes and extensive membranes that link the octopus' arms together. The species has a single line of suckers on each arm, and its head, mantle, and part of its arms are covered in warts. Although the reproductive habits of V. togata have not been extensively studied, the species is believed to be one of the most fecund among octopuses in its region and depth level, despite the species possessing large eggs and extremely large spermatophores. The species is found in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of South Africa, Mozambique, and Tanzania. The species has been captured from depths between 400 and 750 meters below sea level, and a 2009 study found the species most heavily concentrated between 400 and 600 meters below sea level. V. togatas conservation status has not been assessed. Taxonomy Velodona togata is a species of octopus, and the sole member of the genus Velodona. It belongs to the family Megaleledonidae, in the order Octopoda. The species was first discovered by Carl Chun in 1915. It has two subspecies, Velodona togata togata -- the subspecies originally identified by Chun in 1915 -- and Velodona togata capensis, which was first described by Guy Coburn Robson in 1924. The genus and species were named after the distinctive membranes on Velodona togata togatas arms. Velo is Latin for \\"veil\\" and toga is Latin for \\"gown\\" or \\"mantle\\". Description A top-down view of V. togata, showing the membranes connecting the arms Chun described the first specimen he caught, a male, as looking similar to the genus Eledone, but with larger membranes, a differently shaped hectocotylus, and a differently shaped funnel organ (siphon). The specimen had \\"a sac-shaped body and very large eyes\\", with arms that \\"are folded back and have very large membranes which enclose the whole animal\\", and had a \\"characteristic pale coloration\\". Reiterating Chun, Guy Robson summarized the differences between Eledone and V. togata as \\"the possession of (a) a funnel organ composed of two separate pieces, (b) a sigmoid bend in the hectocotylized arm, and (c) the development of extensive lateral membranes on the arms\\". Robson, however, was not fully convinced that the shape of the hectocotylized arm was of value in identifying the species, positing that the curve could have been caused by a shrinkage of the membrane. In comparing the distinctive features of V. togata with other known octopus species, Robson found similarities between V. togata and species in the genera Moschites (now considered a synonym for Pareledone and Eledone, the former now considered to be in the family Megaleledonidae and the latter in the family Eledonidae), and Polypus (now considered a synonym for Enteroctopus, in the family Enteroctopodidae). He found V. togata closest to the southern species of Moschites, such as M. charcoti (now Pareledone charcoti) and M. brevis (now Eledone massyae), due to having similar funnel organs and suckers as those species. The specimen's head, mantle, and dorsal arms were covered in warts of varying sizes. Chun measured the specimen's mantle as being 99 millimeters wide and 80 millimeters long. The specimen's head was as wide as the mantle, and was dominated by large eyes, which were measured as 38 millimeters wide and 53 millimeters long, with sickle-shaped pupils. Chun described the arms as being \\"well developed\\", and noted that the dorsal arms were the longest, and the arms got shorter as they moved to the ventral end. V. togata has a single line of suckers on each arm. Chun described the membranes on the arms in detail, stating that \\"The arms bear dorsal and ventral membranes. The ventral margins are unusually large and extend to the tip of all arms. They are not restricted to the ventral surface but also extend to the dorsal margin of the neighboring ventral arms, where they again continue to the tip, but are more weakly developed.\\". The hectocotylus is on the third arm. V. togata contains an ink sac, but it is tiny and does not contain any ink, a common trait in cephalopods that live in deep water where there is little or no light. Velodona togata capensis, the subspecies first described by Guy Coburn Robson in 1924, differs from Velodona togata togata in three areas that Robson considered significant. Where the mantle of Chun's specimen (Velodona togata togata) was significantly wider than it is long, the mantles of Robson's specimens had a much smaller difference between width and length, with one specimen having a mantle with identical width and length. The length of the membrane that links the octopus's arms -- the umbrella -- was shorter in Robson's specimens than in Chun's, and there were additional warts with papillates on his specimens that were not described in Chun's specimen. Robson also noted a significant difference in the hectocotylus in Chun's specimen and those in his specimens. He noted that while two of his specimens appeared to be fully sexually developed, their hectocotyli looked comparatively underdeveloped. Owing to the difference in overall size between Chun's and Robson's specimens, however, Robson conjectured that the difference in hectocotyli may be due to the specimens' ages. Robson described the coloring of the specimens as \\"a rather deep reddish brown (verging in a distinctly purple shade in one)\\" for the males, with a \\"darker brown\\" for the female. Reproduction Little is known about the reproductive habits of V. togata. A 2009 study, the first to focus on V. togata, conjectured that \\"The high proportion of immature females obtained in the survey (76%) and the low proportion of mature females (10%) could indicate that the spawning season is finishing at the beginning of the autumn. Moreover, the wide size range of the sampled population, with a considerable number of small individuals (possibly only a few days old), suggests the existence of an extended reproduction period.\\". Analyzing the spermatophores and eggs of the captured specimens, the 2009 study found that V. togata had a low fecundity value, with females having large eggs and males producing a low number of large spermatophores (the largest reported of any deep-sea member of the suborder Incirrina). Despite this, the species was still one of the most fecund among \\"deep-sea octopods that inhabit the Southern Ocean\\". Habitat and distribution The first specimen of Velodona togata (Velodona togata togata) was captured off the east coast of Africa at a depth of 749 meters below sea level. The four specimens described by Guy Robson as being members of a separate subspecies (Velodona togata capensis) were caught off the \\"Natal coast\\" (modern KwaZulu-Natal coast, South Africa) at depths of between 220 fathoms (402.3 meters) and 250 fathoms (457.2 meters). According to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) database, Velodona togata togata is possibly located in the waters north of Zanzibar, Tanzania, while Velodona togata capensis is located off of the \\"Natal coast, South Africa\\". In 2009, a Spanish research vessel conducted a study of the cephalopod population off the coast of Mozambique. The study found populations of V. togata across the entire study area, which ran most of the coast of Mozambique, with especially high concentrations at the very southern end of the Mozambiquan coast, in the waters near the city of Maputo. The study performed trawls in four depth groups, 200–400, 400–500, 500–600, and 600–700 meters below sea level. While V. togata was found in all four depth ranges, they were most abundant between 400 and 600 meters below sea level. The study also noted that males were most common in the shallower two groups, while females were more common in the deeper two groups. Status The conservation status of V. togata was assessed as data deficient by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2018.

Environment Exmouth Gulf is a rich marine environment. It is a nursery for humpback whales, dugong and turtles. The mangrove systems on the eastern margins are areas of high primary productivity feeding and restocking both the Gulf and the nearby Ningaloo Reef.

In honor of Mianowski, after his death, in 1881, a foundation was inaugurated to support scientific and scholarly research, named Kasa imienia Józefa Mianowskiego — \\"the Józef Mianowski Fund\\" or, more simply, \\"the Mianowski Fund.\\" Life In his youth, Mianowski graduated from Wilno University. He served as a clinical assistant to Jędrzej Śniadecki, was a friend of Polish Romantic poet Juliusz Słowacki, and in 1831 married (his wife died only a year later, in childbirth). A rising star in medicine, in 1838 Mianowski became an assistant professor at the Wilno Medical-Surgical Academy (a school detached from Wilno University, which had been closed in the aftermath of the November 1830 Uprising. A lecturer in animal and human physiology and general therapeutics in 1839–42, he thrice received a prestigious \\"diamond ring\\" from the Russian Tsar. In 1840, as physician to Polish independence activist Szymon Konarski, Mianowski was arrested and harshly interrogated, but half a year later he was declared innocent and rehabilitated. He accepted a position at the Saint Petersburg Medical-Surgical Academy, where he oversaw the gynecology and pediatrics wards. He worked at the Academy from 1842 to 1860. In 1848 he was appointed personal physician to the Tsar's daughter, Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaievna, Duchess of Leuchtenberg. He was also chief physician at the Second Hospital of Land Forces. In 1860 he retired, but remained physician to the Grand Duchess and had extensive contacts at the Russian Imperial court. In 1862 Mianowski became rector of the Warsaw Main School (Szkoła Główna Warszawska), then the only institution of higher learning in Russian Poland (all others having been closed after the November 1830 Uprising). The Main School was a reincarnation of the closed University of Warsaw. Mianowski gained popularity among students and faculty for his liberal views; his inaugural speech stressed the links between Polish and western cultures. Seal of the Imperial University of Warsaw During the January 1863 Uprising, Mianowski lent clandestine support to the insurgents. In later stages of the uprising, he participated in the falsification of academic records to provide alibis of attendance to many students who took part in the uprising. He also supported enrollment of others for purposes of alibi. Thanks to his connections at the Saint Petersburg court, these efforts succeeded, and the Main School became a refuge for many insurgents. In 1868 Mianowski won another victory, albeit a Pyrrhic one: the Main School was enlarged and regained the name \\"Warsaw University\\" — however, it was russified (its full name was now \\"Imperial University of Warsaw\\" — Императорский Варшавский Университет). Mianowski, disappointed with this turn of events, emigrated to Italy, where he lived out the remainder of his life. Mianowski Fund In 1881, alumni of the Main School established a foundation, named after Józef Mianowski, to support scholarly activity in the sciences and humanities. The foundation was known as Kasa imienia Józefa Mianowskiego (\\"the Józef Mianowski Fund\\" or, more simply, \\"the Mianowski Fund\\"). This institution became, in the late 19th century, the major Polish organization that sponsored research and publication of scholarly works, and (renamed the \\"Institute for the Promotion of Science\\") it continued its activities after Poland regained independence in 1918. Liquidated in the post World War 2 People's Republic of Poland, the Mianowski Fund was re- established after the fall of communism in 1991.

He was an acclaimed designer and a pioneer of branding and consumer research techniques widely used to this day. Landor, the company he founded in 1941, has offices around the world. \\"Products are made in the factory, but brands are created in the mind,\\" Walter Landor memorably stated. He had a particular gift for creating designs with broad popular appeal, such as the Coca-Cola script. Brands as diverse as General Electric, Japan Airlines, Levi Strauss, and Shell Oil all benefited from his vision and commitment. Early years Landor was born to Fritz and Elsie Landauer, a Jewish family, in Munich in 1913. Fritz Landauer was a prominent architect, and Landor grew up drawing in his father's studio; he realized he wanted to study industrial design instead of architecture early on.Gallagher, Bernard. \\"Walter Landor\\". In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German- American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 5, edited by R. Daniel Wadhwani. German Historical Institute. Last modified November 8, 2012. In early life Landor's aesthetic sense was influenced by the Bauhaus and Werkbund design movements. Landor left Munich for London in 1931, studying at London University's Goldsmith College School of Art and changing his surname from Landauer to Landor. He interned at W. S. Crawford, Ltd in London in 1932, and decided to that he wanted to live in Britain. Following his studies at London University, Landor would help to found Industrial Design Partnership with Misha Black and Milner Gray in 1935, and one year later, the 23-year-old Landor became the youngest Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. In 1939 Landor traveled to the United States as part of the design team for the British Pavilion at the New York World's Fair. After the Fair, he continued west to San Francisco and quickly decided to settle there. \\"For me it was a city that looked out on the whole world, a city built on the cultural traditions of east and west,\\" he later said. \\"How could I live anywhere else?\\" Landor became associate professor of industrial design and interior architecture at the California College of Arts and Crafts in 1940. In June, Landor married the former Josephine Martinelli. Landor Walter Landor working on the deck of the Klamath docked in San Francisco Bay (1960s). In 1941, Landor and his wife, Josephine, launched a design firm in their small flat, working from the living room table. Passionate about his work, he succeeded in attracting clients from a wide variety of fields, adding staff and relocating to larger offices as the need grew. In a move characteristic of his ebullient personality and original business style, Landor bought a retired ferryboat, the Klamath, in 1964 and turned it into his company's corporate headquarters, renting space to six other companies; Klamath had operated from 1924 to 1956, retiring after the opening of the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge. The firm moved from Klamath to their present headquarters at 1001 Front Street in the late 1980s, but retains the Klamath as their corporate symbol, although the boat itself was purchased by Duraflame and was moved to Stockton. His work included brands like Del Monte (1965), Levi Strauss & Co. (1968), Cotton Incorporated (1973), Marlboro (1977), Virginia Slims, Tab (1979), Dole Foods (1984), Coca-Cola (1985), Fujifilm (1987), and Bank of America. He also designed the corporate identities for many airlines, including Alitalia, British Airways, Garuda Indonesia, Japan Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Cathay Pacific Airways, and Singapore Airlines.

Landor received a commission for branding San Francisco Muni, resulting in the \\"worm\\" logo and orange-and- yellow \\"sunset\\" livery for vehicles; the designs were unveiled on January 27, 1975. Although the Landor color scheme was phased out gradually starting in 1995 with the introduction of the gray-and-red Breda LRV2 light rail cars, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, which took over operation from Muni in 1999, retained the \\"worm\\" Muni logo for vehicles, despite selecting a winner in a contest in 1996 for Academy of Art College students which proposed replacing the logo with a green, silver and orange winged circle. In 1985, Walter Landor gave the commencement address at Art Center College of Design (Pasadena, California), where he shared his five secrets for a successful design career; he was also presented with an honorary degree. Landor retired in 1989. In 1994 the Smithsonian Institution honored Walter Landor by establishing a permanent collection of his designs and packaging. Landor died in 1995 at the age of 81.

He was favourite court painter of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor.Fajt J, 1998, p. 226 and the first Bohemian painter whose name can be linked to a body of work.Vítovský, Několik poznámek k problematice Karlštejna, Zprávy památkové péče 11, 1992. pp 1-14 Theodoric is considered the chief representative of the phase of International Gothic known as \\"the Soft style\\". His masterpiece is the Chapel of the Holy Cross at Charles' newly completed Karlštejn Castle near Prague, containing a large series of slightly over- lifesize half-length panel portraits of saints and other notable figures on a gold ground. The whole decoration of the Chapel was commissioned in 1359 and completed over a number of years. Decoration of the Chapel of the Holy Cross was unique and unprecedented north of Alps.V. Kramář, in: Fajt J, 1998, p. 219 Theodoric´s oeuvre is not comparable to anything in European art after the mid-14th century (1360th).A. Matějček, in: Fajt J, 1998, p. 219  Life  He most likely came to Prague from the Rhineland (workshop of William of Cologne?)Jiří Fajt, in: Drake Boehm B, Fajt J, 2005, p. 13-14 following a study trip to northern Italy in the 1350s. PujmanováPujmanová O., 1982, s. 226 states that in about 1309 a sculptor described as ‘Magister Theodoricus de Alemania’, who could have been an ancestor of his and his brother - the painter Giletto, were active at the court of Charles II of Anjou in Naples.Vinni Lucherini, La Cappella di San Ludovico nella Cattedrale di Napoli, le sepolture dei sovrani angioini, le due statue dei re e gli errori della tradizione storiografica moderna, Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte 70. Bd., H. 1 (2007), pp. 1-22 The waiting period for civic rights in Prague was three years, and the newly arrived person wasn’t able to become a member of the fraternity of painters straightaway. The date he was entered in the list of the Prague painters’ fraternity (Brotherhood of Saint Luke, established 1346), where he was described as a superior (\\"primus magister\\") and as \\"malerius imperatoris\\",Barbara Drake Boehm, in: Drake Boehm B, Fajt J, 2005, p. 76 is uncertain. Earlier it was assumed to be 1348, however it is possible that an honorary function was only offered to him when he executed the painting of the royal palace at Prague Castle in 1360. Ferdinand Tadra - Josef Patera, Pražské malířské bratrstvo a jeho cechovní kniha In 1359 he is mentioned as \\"malerius imperatoris\\" and owner of a house in Hradčany in the Records of the Hradčany town.Fajt J, 1998, p 228 His house was mentioned once again in 1368 (house no. 185/IV above Úvoz on Hradčany Square.Fajt J, 1998, p. 229 Between 1359 and 1367 he worked as the leading court painter of Charles IV in Prague and at Karlštejn Castle. The emperor called his painter and courtier Pictor noster et familiaris. In a special document of 28th April 1367, Charles IV certified that Theodoric’s court and fields in the village of Mořina would be freed of all taxes and other charges. This privilege also applied to Theodoric’s heirs and was granted in recognition of his decoration of the royal chapel at Karlštejn. Theodoric’s court was mentioned again in 1381, when it was sold, in a letter by Wenceslaus IV. Mikuláš Mendl of Jílové, father of the goldsmith Jorg, and the goldsmith Jan Waczenser, sold the court to Zdena, the widow of Ješek Mráz of Lazevice. This document is the only one that establishes Theodoric’s death before the 8th March 1381 and indicates that he left no descendants.Josef Teige, Listiny děkanství karlštejnského, Praha 1906, s.24-25, č.14.Aleksandr Mikhaĭlovich Prokhorov. Great Soviet encyclopedia, Volume 25. New York: Macmillan, 1973. p 584  Work  Theodoric’s magnum opus is a collection of panel paintings and wall paintings that were done on the commission of Charles IV for the Chapel of the Holy Cross at Karlštejn. All together, there are 129 works, all of saints, prophets, or angels. The National Gallery in Prague said that they “only few equals in the world: we believe that it is no exaggeration to say that they bear comparison with such artistic monuments and phenomena as the Arena in Padua, the churches at Assisi or Sta, Croce in Florence and the palace of the popes in Avignon.”\\"Magister Theodoricus, court painter of Emperor Charles IV\\" by Jiri Fajt & Jan Royt, published by the National Gallery in Prague in 1998 Known for his bold and vigorous style, he is seen as a central figure in the development of Bohemian art. As many other Gothic painters, he used very bright and attention-grabbing colors and bold lines. He painted powerful figures in small frames, filling the viewer with the notion of monumentality. Famous for his use of light and reflection, he created the illusion of endless space in his work by allowing light to travel beyond the frame. Art historians have disagreed on several aspects of Theodoric’s career. One historian noted that Theodoric was a “unique phenomenon” whose works could not be explained by stylistic evolution, as there were no precedents for his art work, making one believe that he may have been self-taught. Another scholar holds an opposite opinion—that he was influenced both by Italian and French contemporary art. Theodoric followed on from the work of his predecessor in the service of Charles IV, the Master of the Luxembourg Genealogy,Jiří Fajt, in: Drake Boehm B, Fajt J, 2005, p. 10 who painted the decoration of the imperial castle-palace at Karlštejn and the ‘relic scenes’ in the Chapel of the Virgin Mary between 1356 and 1357.Jiří Fajt, Jan Royt, in: Fajt J, 1998. p. 136 This master was familiar with Franco- Flemish art of the 1350thJiří Fajt, in: Drake Boehm B, Fajt J, 2005, p. 12 and brought major innovations to mural painting in Bohemia. Several panel paintings ascribed to Theodoric’s workshop repeat the typology of faces and patterns of movement in figures of the Genealogy. According to Homolka, two heavily damaged panel paintings of SS Peter and Paul from the Chapel of the Holy Cross could have directly originated in the workshop of the Master of the Luxembourg Genealogy, since the technology of their foundation layers is more typical of mural painting and thus differs significantly from the other paintings.Homolka J, 1997, p. 354Hana Blochová, The medieval art techniques of the painted decoration of Karlštejn, in: Fajt J, 1998, p. 532 Theodoric’s workshop carried out the unique overall decoration of the Chapel of the Holy Cross at Karlštejn Castle between 1360 and 1365. The chapel belongs to the tradition of lavishly decorated reliquiary chapels that include the emperor chapel in Constantinople, Sancta Sanctorum in the Lateran Palace, or Sainte Chapelle in Paris. The decoration comprises 129 (originally 130) panel paintings in four rows, portraying the half-length figures of male saints, female saints and prophets who represented the ‘Army of Heaven’ guarding the relics kept in the chapel. Several of the picture frames had small openings into which reliquaries could be inserted. The depiction of the saints in the Holy Cross Chapel was directly linked to the veneration of their relics. The presence of relics of the Passion perhaps served to guarantee, that on his return Christ would descend to the Chapel. With the stylisation of the figures, the abandoning of the Gothic linear style and the modelling of the faces and drapery using light and shade, Theodoric’s paintings surpass the preceding artistic style. It is clear that he was acquainted with French grisaille painting.Homolka J, 1997, p. 362 The pictures can be attributed to Theodoric on the basis of analysing the underdrawings and comparing the execution of the painting. The drawn designs of the compositions, details of the faces and drapery, as well as the overall completion of the most important portraits in the Chapel of the Holy Cross were ascribed to Theodoric. Theodoric´s brush drawing on the heads of the paintings is delicate and firm. On the draperies it is strong and energetic and overlaps onto the frame.Věra Frömlová, Notes on the decoration of the Chapel of the Holy Cross, in: Fajt J, 1998, pp. 508-515 Study of the typology of the heads showed that the shape of the head and the details of the face, i.e. eyes, nose, are completely identical in a number of cases, as though they originated through tracing.Radana Hamsíková, Theodoric´s Workshop Practice: Composition and Form Patterns, Technologia Artis 3, 1993Radana Hamsíková, Variations of preparatory drawings and questions of workshop practice, in: Fajt J, 1998, pp. 526-527 However, some of the faces of saints captivate the viewer´s attention with their prominent, seemingly individualized features and psychologized expressions, which anticipate portrait painting of 15th century. The portrait of St Luke the Evangelist might even be the autoportrait of Theodoric himself.Fajt J, 1998, p. 243 Specialised craftsmen took care of a series of secondary tasks such as preparing the picture panels, the plastic decoration and goldsmith’s elements.Mojmír Hamsík, Master Theodoric technique, in: Fajt J, 1998, pp. 506-507 There are no records of the painters employed at Theodoric’s workshop, however there must have been several of them judging by the scale of the commission and the short time frame of execution,Radana Hamsíková, Master Theodoric´s Preparatory Drawings, Technologia Artis 2, 1992 as well as by the assertained types of underdrawings, confirmed by infrared reflectography.Fajt J, 1998, p. 247 Certain art historians even suppose that several masters and their workshop collaborators were involved. In the Chapel of the Holy Cross there are two places that testify to the juxtaposition of different painting styles. They can be found in the perfectly executed preparatory drawings on the altar wall that is then repeated in a simpler form or in mirror reverse in the underdrawings of the paintings.Hana Hlaváčková, 1998, pp. 206-215 Theodoric’s predecessor, the Master of the Luxembourg Genealogy, in all likelihood created the drawn designs on the wall of the Chapel of the Holy Cross. Theodoric presumably devised the concept of the entire Chapel about 1360, establishing the composition and palette of all the paintings. His distinctive painting style can be identified in several portraits of the prophets, kings and knights that are part of the overall series. Innovations in the form of painted still lifes appear in the panel paintings of the Church Fathers that originate in Theodoric’s workshop (Saint Augustine, Saint Ambrose, Saint Gregory). Clearly made by another talented artist, these paintings stand out with their unusual degree of realism, the spatial design of their still lifes and their sophisticated colour scheme. With these qualities, they anticipate the development of painting progressing towards the early 15th century and the northern European Renaissance.Homolka J, in: Fajt J (ed.) 1998, p. 289Fajt J, 1998, p. 458 Master Bertram, who was later active in Hamburg, evidently worked in Theodoric’s workshop. The Master of the Třeboň Altarpiece and the artist who painted the Votive Panel of Jan Očko of Vlašim most probably also came out of Theodoric’s workshop as well. In terms of its technology and composition, the mural painting of the Adoration of the Three Kings in the Saxon Chapel of St Vitus Cathedral is similar to Theodoric’s paintings.Homolka j, in: Fajt J (ed.), 1998, p. 295 According to Homolka, the illuminators of the A2 and A3 Chapter House Bibles had much in common with Theodoric or else came out of his workshop.Homolka J, in: Fajt J (ed.), 1998, p. 284 Although the International Gothic \\"Soft style\\" had no direct successors, the context of the workshop itself influenced succeeding generations of Bohemian Gothic painters. = The technique of Theodoric’s panel paintings = The preparation of the panels (beechwood),Radana Hamsíková, Master Theodoric - St Claire, Technologia Artis 2, 1992 including a double-layered siliceous and chalk base, is identical to practice in France and Germany but doesn’t appear in Italy. The preparatory black underdrawing in brush is linear and highly detailed in places. In the final painting, however, numerous divergences have been found, for example in the position of hands. The preparatory drawing is covered with a layer of oil-based lead white paint. This layer also reflects diffuse light falling on it through translucent lazure layers and shines through the uppermost parts of the drapery. The painting itself is executed in egg tempera alternating with layers of oil.Mojmír Hamsík, Jindřich Tomek, Technical Parallels between the 14. Century Mural and Panel paintings, Technologia Artis 2, 1992 The oil base enabled both the arranging of contrasting colour layers and the gradual modelling of the volume. Theodoric’s painting is characterised by laying down of semi-lazure layers with the help of the slow-drying oil (possibly walnut) base that enabled wet-on-wet painting.Mojmír Hamsík, Master Theodoric´s Painting Technique ant its Origin, Technologia Artis 2, 1992 In the flesh tones, the moist oil base allows the modelling of smooth transitions into a single layer by adding pigment alla prima (Charlemagne).Blochová H, in: Fajt J (ed.), 1998, p. 533 It was necessary for other specialised artists, who created a complex system of decorations, to collaborate on the final form of the pictures. These included relief decoration of the background and frame of the pictures (pastiglia),Mojmír Hamsík, Pastiglia - Origin and Their Technical History, Technologia Artis 2, 1992 glued plastic decoration, small goldsmith’s applications cast from tin and lead into moulds, the gilding of the background and goldsmith’s products as, for example, small crosses attached to the panel with silver nails.Hamsík M, in: Fajt J (ed.), 1998, p. 507 File:Mistr Theodorik, Sv.

The drapery of the figures is characterised by the soft modelling of light. With its muted colour tones, it has an affinity to the grisaille painting method. The faces are closely related to several of Theodoric’s panel paintings and repeatedly feature the characteristic motif of hair and whiskers coiled into individual strands. The painting is embellished with gilded relief decorations and the backgrounds of the scenes are filled out with gold plastic star shapes.Jan Pasálek, Master Theodoric - Mural Paintings in the Holy Rood Chapel at Karlštejn Castle, Technologia Artis 2, 1992  The apocalyptic God in a mandorla is surrounded by choirs of angels (the west niche)  The painting’s colour scheme is adapted to the opposite wall depicting the Adoration of the Twenty-four Old Men (twelve prophets and twelve apostles, or 24 world rulers) ascribed to the Master of the Luxembourg Genealogy. The monumental painting of God is executed in grisaille. In his hand, God is holding seven stars and a book above which there hang seven candleholders.  The Annunciation to the Virgin Mary (north-east niche, north vault)  With the high quality of its execution, the scene of the Annunciation has much in common with the most advanced techniques used in panels paintings by Theodoric’s workshop (St Ambrose). Archangel Gabriel’s wings are made from strips of tin sheet decorated with lazure painting and gilded plastic decoration. The space is deepened by polygonal Gothic architecture of a cathedral and by the Virgin Mary’s diagonal reading stand.  The Adoration of the Three Kings (north-east niche, south vault)  The largest and best- preserved painting depicts the holy family in a hut with animals and three kings bearing gifts. The high artistic quality of the execution, the specific typology of the faces and the painting style attest to Master Theodoric as the artist of this work. The painting is characterised above all by the careful execution of the details (the figure of the Infant Christ, the strands of whiskers and hair, the woven wicker fence, the plastically executed royal crown and fine gifts). The figure of the third king, considered to be a cryptoportrait of Charles IV, is the very first such appearance of a monarch in European art.  Christ meeting Mary Magdalene and Martha / The anointing of Christ in the home of Simon (south-east niche, north vault)  The paintings are heavily damaged, however the chiaroscuro modelling of the clothes, typology of the faces and execution of the hands has closely related counterparts in the panel paintings of Master Theodoric.  The Raising of Lazarus / Noli me tangere (south-east niche, south vault)  The rich composition with its landscape scenery in the background is badly damaged, however numerous similar formal analogies rank it alongside Master Theodoric’s mural paintings in the Chapel of the Holy Cross.

His reign was from 1770 to 1785. He was a great scholar who was well versed with the Vedas and the Upanishads. His yogic powers were extraordinary and he was regarded and revered as an avatār (incarnation) of Lord Dattātreya (). Very many miracles have been attributed to him (See Miracles). Many people in that period experienced that in case of difficulty, if they prayed earnestly for his help, his help never fails to come. He also founded the matha (monastery) at Mallāpur. In this article henceforth Swamiji will refer to Swami Shankarāshram II.  Pattābhishekha (\\"Crowning Ceremony\\")  Swami Shankarāshram was crowned as the head guru or Mathādhipati (Head of the Chitrapur Math) of the Sāraswats after the Mahā- samādhi (death) of his guru Swami Parijnānāshram II (on Ekadashi day of the Bhādrapad month in 1770). During the Anushthān (ceremony), Swamiji was suffering from high fever due to Malaria. But his yogic powers were so great that he transferred his fever onto the danda (stick) that he carried so that the ceremony could be performed without inconvenience. Being the true Yogi that he was, after the ceremony, he transferred the sickness back onto him. When devotees asked him why he would not keep the illness in the danda permanently he replied \\"Even a Jnāni (All-knowing one) has to go through the ups and downs of life. Even the Lord ordains that and this is a fact of life.\\" Swamiji was a person who was always absorbed in spiritual pursuits. He was continuously seeking more knowledge so much so that he would neglect his health. His diet was frugal and he wished for only simple porridge (mostly as Bhikshāor meal offered by devotees).  Shri Gurumath, Mallāpur  Under Swami Shankarāshram II, a new matha ('Monastery') was established in the hamlet of Kumta near Mallapur. This place is a small valley tucked away amidst lots of greenery. It was named Shri Gurumath. Swamiji started residing there after the construction was over. Everyday Swamiji would go for a walk in the mornings to Hoovinhittal a place near the Chandāvar village. There he would meditate for long hours in a garden that was full of Jasmine flowers. Devotees would wait on the road-side for his darshan and blessings. Swamiji would randomly point to a devotee, who would then offer Swamiji bhiksha. Swamiji preferred simple porridge and some payasa (sweet rice pudding). The samādhi (shrine) of Swami Shankarāshram II is located in the premises of the Guru Matha. Swamiji would constantly hold satsangs (\\"gatherings for discussions of the scriptures\\") at the Chitrapur Matha. Devotees would \\"flock to listen to the discourses filled with wisdom\\". Swamiji would educate all the people about the essence of the Indian scriptures.  Shishya Sweekār  The frail health of Swamiji had the devotees anxious with fear. They requested Swamiji to choose a shishya (disciple) who would continue the Guru Parampara. So the search started for a suitable disciple. Eventually Swamiji chose a young man from the Kandlūr family to be his successor. In the month of Maagha in 1781, Swamiji ordained the new shishya and named him Keshavāshram. Records say that the Shishya Sweekār ceremony took place at the Shri Ganapati Temple at Mallāpur.  Miracles  Swami Shankarāshram has been attributed to many miracles. Two of the most popular ones are mentioned here. = The unfried Vadas = Swamiji preferred to have only porridge as his meals. But during the Punyatithī (death anniversary) of his guru, Swami Parijñānāshram II, his shishya (disciple) Keshavāshram asked the cooks not to prepare porridge. (It is customary in Sāraswat Brahmins tradition that during the death anniversary of a person, a grand feast is prepared and it is first eaten by crows. Crows are supposed be an embodiment of persons who have died and hence a grand feast is prepared to honour the ancestors).' The shishya forgot to tell Swamiji about this. The cooks were preparing Vada but however much they tried, the Vadas would stick to the bottom of the frying pan and just would not get fried. When Swamiji got to know of it, he said \\"As the fire within is burning intensely, perhaps the Vadas are not getting fried\\". Keshavāshram Swami suddenly understood his folly and asked the cooks to prepare the porridge immediately and serve Swamiji. Once Swamiji was served with the porridge, the Vadas were frying crisp and hot. This incident (miracle) has also resulted in the Ksheeranna Seva (a special Seva or service) at the Shri Guru Matha at Mallāpur. Ksheeranna means rice gruel (porridge) in Kannada. = Priest from Narsobawādi = Even after his death, the shrine of Swamiji was supposed to be powerful. People go with in deep agony and return with a sense of calmness. In the village of Narsobawādi there lived a priest, who along with his son, were afflicted by a strange disease that could not be cured by any medication. One night, in a dream, a holy saint (known as Narasimha Saraswat Swami) appeared and asked the priest and his son to go to Mallāpur and pray with full devotion at the shrine of Swamiji. The grace of the guru was such that both father and son were cured of their illness. = Renovation of Samādhi = Under Swami Pandurangāshram (The Eighth Head of the community) the shrine (samādhi) of Swami Shankarāshram II was renovated. During the renovation work, the stone slab covering the samādhi was removed. Everyone was surprised to find leaves of Tulsi and Bael that were placed hundreds of years ago still fresh. The fragrance of tulsi spread all across the shrine when it was uncovered. The leaves had defied age and were preserved intact.  Death  In 1785, Swamiji went to Gokarn to pray at the shrine of Ādi Parijñānāshram despite being in very poor health. On the way back to Chitrāpur, the residents of Mallāpur asked Swamiji to stay at the Guru Matha at Mallapur for a few days to bless the people. It was during this stay that Swamiji's health took a turn for the worse very rapidly. Swami Shankarāshram II died on the Shudh Tritiya (Holy 3rd day) of the month of Maagha in 1785 with his shishya Keshavāshram by his side. His samādhi (Shrine) is located at Mallāpur.  Avatar of Lord Dattātreya  There lived a very famous Avatar of Lord Dattātreya in Akkalkot in Maharashtra by the name Swāmi Samarth Maharāj. He died in 1878. A devotee of his by name Sahasrabudhe Maharāj got a vision in Pune in 1983. In that vision Swami Samarth Maharāj advised him to visit a sacred samādhi of a Datt avatar in Mallāpur. In the vision, Swami Samarth Maharāj showed him the shrine of the Datt Avatar at Mallāpur and told him that urgent repairs were due at the shrine. Sahasrabudhe Maharāj had not even heard of this place. The vision was too strong and compelling to be ignored. So he figured out where this place was and when he reached Mallāpur, he found the samādhi just as it was shown in his vision. After offering his services to the shrine, Sahasrabudhe Maharaj became a devotee of Swamiji. This proved that Swami Shankarāshram was a true avatār of Lord Dattātreya.

He spreads the teachings of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov among Sephardic and Ashkenazic baalei teshuva, as well as many non-Jews, around the world through his books and speaking appearances. Early life Arush was one of nine children born to his parents in the town of Beni Mellal, Morocco. He learned in the local Jewish Alliance school and studied Hebrew in the evenings. His eldest brother married and immigrated to Israel before the rest of the family; Arush, his parents, and other siblings immigrated to Israel when he was 13. Inside cover text The family settled in Petah Tikva, where his parents enrolled Arush in a state-religious school; he later attended a secular high school. In 1970 he joined the Israel Defense Forces as an airborne combat medic, taking part in many missions, including missions during the Yom Kippur War in 1973. During that time, five of his closest friends were killed in a helicopter crash while carrying out an army mission. This event was one of the catalysts for his personal teshuva. Following his army service, Arush studied economics and accounting at Tel Aviv University. Introduction to Breslov Arush's quest for spirituality led him to Rabbi Eliezer Berland, who introduced him to Breslov practices such as hitbodedut and hosted him for Shabbat meals. Together with Berland, Arush learned with such Breslov giants as Rabbi Levi Yitzchok Bender and Rabbi Shmuel Shapiro. Arush next enrolled at Yeshivat Dvar Yerushalayim as he took on more mitzvah observance. Eventually he cut his long hair and became a practicing Torah Jew. He was introduced to his wife, Miriam, on a shidduch, and the newlyweds moved to Moshav Chazon Yechezkel. Later he moved to Bnei Brak to join Berland's new yeshiva there, and when the yeshiva moved to Jerusalem, he and his family followed. Upon the directive of Berland, in 1985 Arush opened his own yeshiva with 15 students; a year later, he had 80 students and moved into his present quarters in the Musrara neighborhood of Jerusalem. Chut Shel Chessed Institutions Partial view of the Chut Shel Chessed yeshiva building on Shmuel HaNavi Street in Jerusalem (left), with its large \\"Sukkah Hashalom (Sukkah of Peace) at Sukkot time. The Chut Shel Chessed Institutions includes a yeshiva, a kolel for married men, a boarding school for teenage boys, and a Talmud Torah for younger boys. The organization specializes in nurturing youth at risk, and its alumni have gone on to become noted writers, actors, and musicians. Among Arush's celebrity students is Shuli Rand, star of the film Ushpizin. In 1998 Arush opened a branch of Chut Shel Chesed in Ashdod, Israel, and appointed his student Rabbi Lazer Brody, another combat soldier-turned- baal teshuva, to head the rabbinic ordination program. In 2006 this branch merged with the Jerusalem yeshiva and Brody became the mashpia (spiritual guide) for Arush's students and the translator of Arush's books into English. Works Arush has authored many works which have been translated from Hebrew into English, Spanish, French, Russian, German, Portuguese, and Yiddish. Brody claims that combined, they have sold more than a million copies. * Garden of Peace: A Marital Guide for Men Only * Garden of Peace - Hebrew * Garden of Emuna * Garden of Emuna - Russian * Garden of Emuna - Spanish * Garden of Emuna - Hebrew * Garden of Emuna - German * Garden of Emuna - French * Garden of Emuna - Portuguese * Women's Wisdom - English (Garden of Peace for women only) * Women Wisdom - Russian (Garden of Peace for women only) * Women's Wisdom - Hebrew (Garden of Peace for women only) * In Forest Fields: A Unique Guide to Personal Prayer * The Garden of Yearning: The Lost Princess * Garden of Joy * Garden of Gratitude * Garden of Riches: A Guide to Financial Success * Be-Gan HaOsher - Hebrew * Shaarav Be-Toda - Garden of Gratitude References External links *Breslev Israel (official site) *Teachings of Rebbe Nachman - Blog Category:Breslov rabbis Category:Israeli Hasidic rabbis Category:Sephardic Haredi rabbis in Israel Category:Moroccan emigrants to Israel Category:Moroccan Jews Category:Baalei teshuva Category:20th-century rabbis Category:People from Beni Mellal Category:1952 births Category:Living people ","title":"Shalom Arush"},{"id":"11870517","text":"The Saint Lawrence rift system is a seismically active zone paralleling the Saint Lawrence River. The rift system trends northeast and southwest and forms a half-graben that links the Ottawa-Bonnechere and the Saguenay grabens. The rift system extends more than along the Saint Lawrence valley from the Ottawa – Montreal area. Within the system, fault reactivation is believed to occur along late Proterozoic to early Paleozoic normal faults related to the opening of the Iapetus Ocean. Two significant historically active seismic zones occur along this system associated with northwest trending intersecting graben structures. The Charlevoix region has been the location of at least five magnitude six or larger earthquakes over the last 350 years, including the 1925 Charlevoix–Kamouraska earthquake. At the Lower St Lawrence zone the largest recorded earthquakes are about magnitude five. Seismic studies indicate a crustal convergence across the Saint Lawrence valley of about per year. The earthquakes of the Charlevoix Seismic Zone are thought to be related to the re-activation of ancient fault structures by the Charlevoix impact event.

It was released as a track on the group's nineteenth album, Give the People What They Want, in August 1981, and was the album's lead single in the US. It was not released as a single in the UK. The song features references to the band's earlier hits, including the riff from 1964's \\"All Day and All of the Night\\" and lyrics inspired by 1970's \\"Lola.\\" Like other Kinks songs of the period, \\"Destroyer\\" features a heavier, rock-based sound. After being abandoned during the Low Budget sessions, the song was finally released on Give the People What They Want. Background \\"Destroyer\\" was initially planned to appear on the band's previous album, Low Budget, appearing in early track listings of the in-progress album. However, the song was dropped from Low Budget because the band could not create a satisfactory mix. \\"Destroyer\\" was ultimately recorded at the Power Station studio. Drummer Mick Avory attributed the song's dense sound to the studio's audio dynamics; he said, \\"We recorded that at the Power Station in New York in the ambient room, which had a great drum sound. The sound of the room can really affect what you’re doing. When you hear that sound slapping around that big room, you want to cut loose. That’s what I did.\\" Music and lyrics \\"Destroyer\\" features many callbacks to previous Kinks songs, both lyrically and musically. The track borrows the main riff from The Kinks' 1964 song, \\"All Day and All of the Night\\", which was one of the band's first hits. The lyrics feature the return of the transvestite title character from The Kinks' 1970 hit song, \\"Lola\\"; in \\"Destroyer,\\" the singer brings Lola to his place where he becomes increasingly paranoid. According to Modern Drummer's Patrick Berkery, the song features a \\"metallic\\" sound that reflects the band's \\"louder and more riff oriented\\" sound during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Berkery notes Mick Avory's \\"trashier fills\\" and \\"bigger [drum] sound that was miles removed from the lighter touch of his early days.\\" Release and reception The track was chosen as the lead single from the album in the US (\\"Better Things\\" was the lead single in the UK), although it was released after the album in September.

After high school, McAnally fulfilled his mandatory military service with the United States Air Force and attended the University of Cincinnati for two years, studying electrical engineering. He began his career in horse racing working at Rockingham Park racetrack in Salem, New Hampshire for his uncle, trainer Reggie Cornell. As a licensed trainer working at California racetracks, in 1958 he got his first win at Hollywood Park Racetrack and in 1960 at Santa Anita Park he got the first of his more than 2,000 stakes race wins. He is noted, perhaps because of his childhood experiences, for patiently looking after horses with unique quirks such as the one-eyed Cassaleria, and the tail- less Sea Cadet. As well, he conditioned Silver Ending, a \\"worthless\\" horse bought for $1,500 who under McAnally's care won a number of stakes races including the Arkansas Derby and the then GI Pegasus Handicap. In the early 1980s Ron McAnally gained considerable national recognition as the trainer of John Henry, the two-time United States Horse of the Year and the first of three Hall of Fame horses he would train. John Henry came under McAnally's care at age four having earned $239,613. For McAnally he won 27 of his 45 races and earned $6,358,334. Other Hall of Fame horses McAnally trained were Bayakoa, who won back-to-back Breeders' Cup Distaffs in 1989 and 1990 and was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Female Horse both years. Two years later, he conditioned his third Hall of Famer, another filly named Paseana who also won the Breeders' Cup Distaff in 1992 and who too was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Female Horse Eclipse for two years running. McAnally's best result in the American Classic Races was a fourth in the 1980 and 1982 Kentucky Derby, a fourth in the 1989 Preakness Stakes, and a fifth-place finish in the 1989 Belmont Stakes. Personal honors include the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Trainer three times and induction in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. Married with three daughters, the McAnally family make their home in Tarzana, California.

Rambert played only one season in Spain before returning to his homeland to sign with Boca Juniors. This move was followed by stints at River Plate, Independiente and then a return to Europe for a brief season in Greece with Iraklis. He returned to Argentina to sign with Arsenal de Sarandí, where he ended his playing career in 2003. Since then, he has been an assistant coach to manager Ramón Díaz at Club América and San Lorenzo.

This statue is on the southwest corner of the bridge. The University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning can be seen in the background. A panther (cougar/Puma concolor) is the animal that serves as the official mascot of the University of Pittsburgh and used as a nickname for both athletic teams as well as other organizations and affiliates of the university. The mascot is generally referred to as the Pittsburgh Panther or Pitt Panther, while the costumed panther mascot is also named \\"Roc\\". Up to 20 physical representations of panthers can be found in and around the university's campus and athletic facilities. History Cheerleader with \\"the Pitt Panther\\" at the 1956 Sugar Bowl. \\"Roc\\" the Panther costumed mascot, 2007 The University of Pittsburgh adopted the Panther as its official animal and mascot on November 16, 1909 at a meeting of students and alumni. This adoption occurred shortly after the university, previously known as the Western University of Pennsylvania, obtained an alteration to its charter in the summer of 1908 in order to change its name to the University of Pittsburgh. When named the Western University of Pennsylvania, the university had been referred to by the nickname of \\"Wup\\" (pronounced Whup) and athletic teams referred to as the \\"Wups\\", a play on the school's abbreviation W.U.P. At this time, the university also began the process of moving from what is now Pittsburgh's North Side to its current location in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. According to George M. P. Baird (class of 1909), who made the suggestion for the Panther as the university's mascot, the reasons it was chosen were: > 1\\\\. The Panther was the most formidable creature once indigenous to the > Pittsburgh region. > 2\\\\. It had ancient, heraldic standing as a noble animal. > 3\\\\. The happy accident of alliteration. > 4\\\\. The close approximation of its hue to the old gold of the University's > colors (old gold and blue), hence its easy adaptability in decoration. > A costumed Panther character has made appearances at University of Pittsburgh athletic events for decades. Although the Panther costume has changed over time, the mascot was nicknamed \\"Roc\\" in 1990s to honor Steve Petro, former football player, assistant coach, athletic department assistant, and long-time fan, whose nickname from his playing days under Jock Sutherland was \\"the Rock\\". The Panther mascot appears at various university events, both athletic and other. Statues and other representations Detail of one of Moretti's Panther statues There are 20 representations of Panthers (cougars) in and about Pitt's campus, including ten painted fiberglass panthers decorated by various student groups that are placed around the campus by the Pitt Student Government. The oldest representations of panthers are four Panther statues that guard each corner of the Panther Hollow Bridge. Other Oakland locations include both inside and in front of the William Pitt Union, outside the Petersen Events Center, \\"Pitt the Panther\\" on the carousel in Schenley Plaza, the Panther head fountain on the front of the Cathedral of Learning, and the Pitt Panther statue outside Heinz Field on Pittsburgh's North Shore. This does not include the large image of a Panther embedded into Litchfield Towers Fifth Avenue entrance plaza pavers (best seen from high above) or the panther depicted in a neon artwork \\"Tree of Knowledge\\" by Jane Haskell inside the William Pitt Union. =Panther Hollow Bridge Panthers= Giuseppe Moretti's (1859–1935) four cast bronze Panther statues created in 1897 guard each corner of Panther Hollow Bridge in Schenley Park adjacent to the Pitt campus. Panthers were once found abundantly throughout the region and became to symbolize it. These statues, and Panther Hollow, existed prior to the university's move by 1909 to Oakland which includes the neighborhood of Panther Hollow adjacent to the school's campus. Moretti's Panther statues soon became adopted representations of the university and of the Pittsburgh Panthers and became a popular photographic site for visitors and students of the university and were widely used in university and student publications.See the depiction of Moretti panthers on the Athletic section pages in the Owl yearbooks: e.g. See the lead photo in Hail to Pitt article. Representations of Moretti statues were also used in university logos. At one time, painting or defacing the Moretti sculptures was a popular form of vandalism committed by the fans of rival universities prior to the schools' football games. =William Pitt Union Moretti Panther= The Panther Fountain in front of the Cathedral of Learning. An 1897 panther sculpture by Giuseppe Moretti, the same artist who sculpted the Panther Hollow Panthers, sits inside a paneled wood case in the Tansky Family Lounge on the first floor of the William Pitt Union. =Panther Fountain= A panther head spews water in this fountain located at the base of the Cathedral of Learning, which was constructed from 1926-1937. Joseph Gattoni did the Cathedral's stone work, although no information is available on whether he specifically worked on the fountain. =Millennium Panther= This Panther outside the William Pitt Union is ten-and-a-half-feet long and was cast with a sleek and muscular tone in pure bronze by sculptor Miriani Guido in Parma, Italy. With one paw poised in the air, the panther is designed to appear ready to pounce on an unsuspecting enemy. The statue arrived on campus in May 2001 and was stored over the summer in a University warehouse until placed outside the William Pitt Union at the end of August 2001. A time capsule to be opened in the year 2051 was buried beneath the statue. The project, a gift to the university from the Student Government Board to commemorate the beginning of the 3rd millennium, began with deliberations in April 1999, cost $72,000 ($62,000 plus a $10,000 base), the most student government has ever spent on one project up until that time. The plaque on the statue reads > The Pitt Panther Millennium Panther outside the William Pitt Union and > across from the Cathedral of Learning. Dedicated August 31, 2001 with the > belief that scholarship, > integrity and the unyielding spirit of our past will carry us > into the new millennium and beyond. > > A gift from the 1999 Student Body > > George J. Mongell > President, Student Government > > Mark A. Nordenberg > Chancellor Students, alumni, and fans rub the nose of the Millennium Panther in order to bring good luck to the university's teams prior to athletic contests. This tradition was featured in a national television advertisement for the 2012 Hyundai Tucson automobile. =Panther outside Heinz Field= Panther outside Heinz Field across from downtown Pittsburgh This Panther sits outside Gate A of Heinz Field across the Allegheny River from downtown Pittsburgh. It is based on the design by Thomas N. Mitrakos, who played football for The University of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Steelers, for the award for the Pitt Varsity Letter Club Awardees of Distinction. Dedicated on September 6, 2002. The statue, long is set on a granite base. Paved in the stone around the base is an image of the Cathedral of Learning. The statue was made possible by a donation from Charles “Corky” (ENGR ’58) and Frances M. (CAS ‘58) Cost. =Panther outside the Pete= This Panther sits at the main entrance of the Petersen Events Center. Similar to the Panther outside Heinz Field, it is based on the design by Thomas N. Mitrakos for the award for the Pitt Varsity Letter Club Awardees of Distinction. Paving stones surrounding the nine-foot- long panther are etched with images of the former Pitt Stadium. The retired jerseys of Panther football greats, including Mike Ditka, Tony Dorsett, Dan Marino, Hugh Green, and Bill Fralic, are carved into the panther's base. The statue was made possible by a donation from Charles “Corky” (ENGR ’58) and Frances M. (CAS ‘58) Cost, who also donated the panther statue at Heinz Field. =Pitt the Panther= \\"Pitt the Panther\\" on the carousel at Schenley Plaza adjacent to Pitt. “Pitt the Panther”, adopted by Henry and Linda Haller, is one of the animals on a Victorian-style carousel, opened in 2006 and built by Chance Rides Manufacturing of Wichita, Kansas, and funded by the PNC Financial Services Group. It holds 20 people, on 15 1950s-style animals or in a handicapped-accessible chariot and a spinning tub suitable for small children and their parents. The carousel is Schenley Plaza’s feature family attraction and the menagerie of animals, including \\"Pitt the Panther\\", symbolizes the fellowship and diversity of Pittsburgh. However, it is not the first carousel in Schenley Park. In 1913 the original Schenley Park Carousel was opened to the public at the corner of Panther Hollow and Greenfield roads. The original carousel also had a menagerie of animals. The PNC Carousel in Schenley Plaza operates April through October and is open seven days a week. =Homecoming Panthers= The Pitt Pathfinders' Homecoming Panther located on the Pitt's campus In order to create a new homecoming tradition, the Pitt Student Government board purchased ten fiberglass panther statues in 2007 for $60,000 from Heavy Industries of Calgary, Canada. Proposed to be an annual homecoming event, the approximately tall by wide panthers are to repainted and redecorated by student organizations that will be selected from applications on an annual basis. Originally planned for a 2007 homecoming introduction, manufacturing delays prevented initial decoration and first unveiling until a ceremony on January 10, 2008. Following the ceremony, the panthers were placed in and around Pitt's campus. In a Fall 2008 article of The Pitt News, it was announced that the statues decorated by the Black Action Society, The Pitt News, the Pitt Pathfinders, and the Pitt Band would be spared another year due to their designs. Both The Pitt News and the Pitt Pathfinders have paid to have their panther statues kept permanently in their respective locations, while the Pitt Band is attempting to raise money to purchase its panther in time for its centennial in 2011.

Personal life In June 1922 Nicholas Dunaew, actor and leading man with Pauline Frederick, sued Byron for divorce. Dunaew was also a film director who desired to produce a series of anti-Bolshevist motion pictures. He resided at the Green Room Club in New York at the time. In his divorce petition he stated that he had \\"attempted to lift his wife from poverty to his own level, but failed.\\" He concluded by saying \\"one cannot make a silk purse from a sow's ear.\\" Dunaew met Byron in New York when she was at the Auguste and Louis Lumière studio having some pictures taken. He quickly fell in love with her and brought her, together with mother, to Los Angeles. Byron and Dunaew married in September 1918 and resided at 1504 McCadden Place in Hollywood. They separated on January 4, 1920. Dunaew claimed Byron deserted him. It was during the time she was a member of the Hitchykoo troupe that he did not see her again. Dunaew made reference to Byron's reprehensible conduct which he later became aware of through his friends. Her second marriage was to cinematographer Harold Rosson in 1924. The two divorced in 1926, and she married set designer Frank Hotaling in 1939, with whom she remained married to until his death.

The eyalet had been created specifically for him as a reward for helping to suppress the local Gradaščević Rebellion against the Ottoman Empire. However, he was deposed and summarily executed when the authorities in Constantinople discovered that he was hatching plans to rule Herzegovina independently of the Porte.  Early life  Ali-paša Rizvanbegović was born in the Begovina neighbourhood of Stolac in 1783. In 1813, being thirty years old, he was appointed as the captain of his native city, a position he would hold until 1833 and which would turn out to have a crucial importance. Ali Pasha was a heterodox Muslim, belonging to a sect led by certain Shekih Sikirica from Visoko, who found a skull with a few strands of hair, and proclaimed it a saint. Ali Pasha and his sons, as well as some other beys from Bosnia and Herzegovina visited Sikirica once a year for worship, which looked like a \\"small Kaaba\\". The local mufti of Mostar considered Sikirica a heretic. Ali Pasha later became a Sufi dervish. In 1822, the Ottoman governor of Bosnia Celaludin Pasha executed Ali Pasha's father. Opposition to the Bosnian uprising Territories under the control of Ali-paša Rizvanbegović and his allies (in darker shade). Ali-paša Rizvanbegović was strongly opposed to the 1831 Bosnian uprising, led by Husein Gradaščević. He made Stolac a rallying point for the forces loyal to the Ottoman government – in conjunction with fellow loyalist Smail-aga Čengić, Captain of Gacko, who acted similarly in his own place. In the early phase of the uprising, Ali-paša gave refuge in Stolac to the Ottoman governor Namik-paša, who had fled after the rebels' capture of Travnik. A rebel army set out from Sarajevo to attack Stolac, but this was put on hold when the rebels found that Namik-paša had left the city. In the final months of 1831, however, the rebels launched an overall offensive against the loyalist captains, aimed at ending domestic opposition to the uprising and bringing the whole of Herzegovina under rebel rule. Rebel forces led by the captain of Livno, Ibrahim-beg Fidrus, attacked and defeated Sulejman-beg, captain of Ljubuški. That victory placed most of Herzegovina in rebel hands, leaving Stolac isolated and under a rebel siege. Ali-paša Rizvanbegović conducted well the city's defense. In early March 1832 he received information that the Bosnian rebels' ranks were depleted due to the winter and broke the siege, counterattacking the rebels and dispersing their forces. At the time, a rebel force under the command of Mujaga Zlatar had been sent from Sarajevo with the intention of reinforcing the force besieging Stolac – but was recalled by the rebel leadership on 16 March 1832, after news arrived of an impending major Ottoman offensive. With the Ottoman armies closing in on Sarajevo in a following months, Ali-paša Rizvanbegović advanced with his own forces, as did his fellow loyalist Smail-aga Čengić of Gacko. Their armies arrived on 4 June at Stup, a small locality on the road between Sarajevo and Ilidža, where a long, intense battle had already been going on between the main Ottoman armies and the rebel army led by Gradaščević himself. Herzegovinian reinforcements sent by Ali-paša Rizvanbegović eventually captured the Tsar's Mosque in Sarajevo and overthrew Bosnians disloyal to the Sultan. The Herzegovinian loyalist troops broke through defenses Gradaščević had set up on his flank and joined the fighting. Overwhelmed by the unexpected attack from behind, the rebel army was forced to retreat into the city of Sarajevo itself, where their leaders decided that further military resistance would be futile. The imperial army entered Sarajevo on 5 June and Gradaščević went into exile in Austria. As a reward for confronting Husein Gradaščević and Bosnia Eyalet, Ali-paša Rizvanbegović was awarded his very own Pashaluk of Herzegovina by Mahmud II, it was later dissolved in the year 1851. =Vizier of Herzegovina= His loyalty to the Ottoman government in the moment of crisis, and his considerable military success in that cause, clearly entitled Ali-paša Rizvanbegović to a suitable reward. In 1833 Sultan Mahmud II conferred on Ali-paša the title of vizier, as well as giving him the choice of which territory he wanted to rule. Ali-paša then asked the sultan to separate Herzegovina from Pashaluk of Bosnia, creating the new Pashaluk of Herzegovina and make him its vizier, a wish duly fulfilled by the sultan. Given that Bosnia had just broken out in a mass uprising while a considerable part of Herzegovina remained loyal, the separation – and the rewarding of Herzegovina with a greater amount of autonomy – were an obvious imperial policy. However, though at the time Ali-paša hoped to make this position as vizier of Herzegovina hereditary in his family, it would in fact only last for his own lifetime, being abolished at his death. Proclamation In 1833, the new vizier of Herzegovina came to Mostar, announcing to the people: > \\"Our honest emperor loves me and therefore made me a third near himself. He > offered me to become a vizier of wherever I wanted, but I did not want to be > a vizier of anything but of Herzegovina, separated from the Pashaluk of > Bosnia. These are the counties of Herzegovina: Prijepolje, Pljevlja with > Kolašin and Šaranci with Drobnjak, Čajniče, Nevesinje, Nikšić, Ljubinje- > Trebinje, Stolac, Počitelj, Blagaj, Mostar, Duvno and half of the county of > Konjic which is on this side of Neretva. This was given to me, my children > and my kin, and I have done this to prevent that some bad pasha rule over > Herzegovina. I thought that it is better that I, as a native, should rule > over Herzegovina, instead of some alien – nobody could be fiend to his own > house. I will judge everybody by justice...\\" Ali-paša further stated: > \\"From today on, nobody need any longer go to the emperor in Istanbul. Here > in Mostar is your Istanbul, and here in Mostar is your emperor.\\" =Administration of Herzegovina 1833–1851= As the new vizier of Herzegovina from 1832 to 1851, Ali-paša Rizvanbegović made special efforts to promote agriculture and attempted to recuperate the strong economy of the once famed Bosnia Eyalet. During the administration of Ali-paša Rizvanbegović olives, almonds, coffee, rice, citrus fruits and new vegetables became staple food sources. He was in good terms with the Herzegovinian Franciscans. Friar Petar Bakula was his personal physician and Friar Andrija Šaravanja his economic adviser. He also supported the establishment of the Apostolic Vicariate of Herzegovina, an initiative of the Herzegovinian Franciscans. He helped Bishop Rafael Baršić to build an episcopal residence in Mostar, buying a private land from a Muslim and granting it to the Vicariate, despite the fierce opposition from the local Muslims. He also provided the protection during the construction of the residence. During his rule, the Catholics of Mostar returned to the city and became involved in the public, cultural and political life of the city. Death While Ali-paša Rizvanbegović hoped to establish a long lasting hereditary viziership, whereby he would eventually transfer power to his descendants, this was at odds with the Ottoman government's plans for the region. Despite Ali-paša's earlier support against the Gradaščević rebellion, Sultan Abdülmecit I felt that Ali-paša was beginning to act too independently and feared that Herzegovina would secede from the Empire (the sultan who had empowered Ali-paša, Mahmut II, had already died in 1839). Furthermore, Omar Pasha, who had then been put in command of the military in Bosnia, got wind that Ali-paša was conspiring against him at a secret meeting in Sarajevo. On orders from the Porte, Ali-paša was preemptively arrested and subsequently executed on 20 March 1851 by Omar Pasha in a humiliating and cruel manner, and the Pashaluk of Herzegovina was abolished and its territory was merged with the Pashaluk of Bosnia, forming a new entity known as Bosnia Vilayet.

The term should not be confused with show trial. United States The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution establishes the right of the accused to a public trial. The right to a public trial is strictly enforced, but is not absolute. Trials may in exceptional cases be regulated. Closures are decided case-by-case by the judge evaluating a claimed danger to a substantial or legitimate public interest. But whatever the interest at stake, the likelihood of danger to that interest must meet a \\"‘substantial probability’ test\\".Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court (1986) Examples of cases presenting closure issues include organized crime cases (overall security concerns), rape cases (decency concerns), juvenile cases,Overview of the Sixth Amendment rights and through the Silent witness rule and/or Classified Information Procedures Act, cases involving sensitive or 'classified' information.See Ellis' decision in the US V Rosen case, who calls the Silent Witness Rule a 'partial closing' of the trial Trials may be closed at the behest of the government only if it can show \\"an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest\\".Waller v. Georgia (1984) The accused may also request a closure of the trial; in such a case, it must be demonstrated that \\"first, there is a substantial probability that the defendant's right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that closure would prevent, and second, reasonable alternatives to closure cannot adequately protect the defendant's fair trial rights\\". But before a judge can close a courtroom, the judge must consider all potential alternatives to closure. This is a very strict standard; the Supreme Court has held that \\"trial courts are required to consider alternatives to closure even when they are not offered by the parties,\\" or by anyone else.Presley v. Georgia (2010) In other words, a judge who does not want to be reversed on appeal must be confident that there cannot possibly be any alternative to closure that might later be conjured up by some appellate lawyer. Canada Pursuant to the open court principle and related legislation, legal proceedings are generally open to the public and the media. Section 135(1) of the Courts of Justice Act (Ontario) states the general principle that \\"all court hearings shall be open to the public\\". In Quebec, however, under the Quebec Act 1774 the French legal system (including non-public trials) was allowed to remain intact and there is no requirement in Quebec that trials be public. Soviet Union In Soviet Union the terms \\"open trial\\" (открытый процесс) and \\"public trial\\" (публичный процесс) differed. The term \\"open trial\\" implied the possibility for public to be present at the hearings. The term \\"public trial\\" implied the purposeful presentation of the process to wide public. Public trials were usually widely discussed in media and hearings were often arranged in larger auditoria. While the Soviet public trials are commonly associated with Stalin era show trials, such as Moscow Trials, nevertheless in Russian culture the term \\"public trial\\" did not acquire negative connotations, despite the apparent attributes of a show, primarily because the publicity of any information in pre-glasnost era was severely limited by the Soviet state. The term \\"show trial\\" corresponds to Russian \\"показной процесс\\" (pokaznoy process).

The song was introduced by Erskine Hawkins & His Orchestra, a college dance band previously known as the Bama State Collegians. RCA released it in 1939 and it climbed to #7 on the American pop charts. The song was a No. 1 hit for Glenn Miller & His Orchestra in 1940. Background In the late 1930s Hawkins and his Orchestra were one of the house bands at the Savoy Ballroom. They alternated with the Chick Webb band and often used \\"Tuxedo Junction\\" as their sign-off song before the next band would take the stage so that the dancing would continue uninterrupted. A live 6 1/2 minute version of the song by the Hawkins Orchestra exists, with extended solos from Hawkins on the trumpet, Paul Bascomb and Julian Dash on tenor saxophones, and Heywood Henry on the clarinet. It was recorded as an aircheck in the summer of 1942 at the Blue Room club in New York City. The song was written as an instrumental. When it was given to Lewis Music Publishing, they sent it to several prospective lyricists to see who could write the best words for the song. Buddy Feyne asked Erskine Hawkins why he titled it \\"Tuxedo Junction.\\" Erskine explained that the Junction was a whistle stop on the \\"Chitlin' Circuit\\". That information inspired Feyne's lyrics, which Hawkins preferred to the other submissions. Once the song had been published, \\"white\\" bands added it to their playlists. 1940 Glenn Miller recording Glenn Miller and His Orchestra had the most successful recording of the song (Billboard No. 1). Miller's arrangement slowed down the tempo and added trumpet fanfares. The trumpet lick in the original recording was played by band member Johnny Best. The main soloists on that recording were Best and Bobby Hackett. The Glenn Miller recording sold 115,000 copies in the first week.Simon, George T. Glenn Miller and His Orchestra. NY: Crowell, 1974. It was featured in the 1953 Glenn Miller biopic The Glenn Miller Story starring James Stewart and Harry Morgan. The Glenn Miller Orchestra recorded the song on February 5, 1940 in New York.

The Glenn Miller single on Bluebird Records Other recordings \\"Tuxedo Junction\\" was covered by numerous bands and swing orchestras and solo artists, including The Andrews Sisters, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Harry James, Frankie Avalon and Joe Jackson. Stan Kenton included it on his 1961 Mellophonium Magic album. It became the theme song for The Manhattan Transfer, first recorded on their album The Manhattan Transfer in 1975. Bob Marley used this song as an inspiration for his hit \\"Kaya\\". It was also the inspiration for an all-girl disco group, entitled \\"Tuxedo Junction\\". The song is about a jazz and blues club in the Birmingham, Alabama suburb of Ensley. The area is referred to as \\"Tuxedo Junction\\", though the building is called the \\"Nixon Building\\" (built in 1922). This is due to the location of a streetcar crossing at Tuxedo Park, hence \\"Tuxedo Junction\\". A punk rock venue bearing the same name operated near there briefly in the mid-1980s.

Manor Wigod of Wallingford held the manor of Weston at the time of the Norman conquest of England. Wigod died shortly after the conquest, leaving his estates including Weston to his son-in-law, the Norman baron Robert D'Oyly. Weston descended via Robert's younger brother Nigel D'Oyly to his nephew Robert (II) D'Oyly, who in 1129 founded the Augustinian Osney Abbey and included Weston parish church among its endowments. He or his heirs granted parts of the manor lands at Weston to Osney Abbey, including six virgates given by Robert (II)'s wife Edith and son Henry, and confirmed by his grandson Henry (II) D'Oyly. In 1137 Edith gave at Weston to the new Otley Abbey at Oddington, which later moved to Thame. Henry (II) D'Oyly sold most of the remainder of the manor to Osney Abbey in 1227, retaining only the house, watermill and demesne lands. He gave the final parts of the manor to the abbey shortly afterwards, probably in 1228. The abbey retained the manor until it surrendered all its lands to the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539. Weston Manor, re-fronted 1820 and renovated 1851 Weston Manor House is a 15th- or early 16th-century building built for Osney Abbey's bailiff. It was built within a 13th-century moat, two sides of which survived until they were filled in. The house was re- fronted in the 16th century and entrance hall has a Tudor fireplace from about this period. In 1665 the house was assessed at 20 hearths for Charles II's hearth tax. The panelling of the drawing room dates from the reign of William III and Mary II just before the end of the 17th century. In about 1780 the 16th-century great hall was renovated with a timber roof frame and linenfold panelling transferred from Notley Abbey in Buckinghamshire. The 16th century front was replaced in about 1820 and the Hon. Rev. F.A. Bertie had the house altered and renovated in 1851. Weston Manor is now a hotel.The Manor Country House Hotel Parish church Altar of Blessed Virgin Mary parish church, with Pompeo Batoni altar piece The earliest surviving parts of the Church of England parish church of the Blessed Virgin Mary are the Norman font and the ground stage of the west tower, which was built around 1200. By 1741 the medieval building was in ruins, and in 1743–44 all but the 13th century bell tower was rebuilt. The replacement is a characteristically box-like Georgian church, with what were originally plain round-arched windows on the north and south sides. The Georgian building had an ornate plaster ceiling, but this collapsed in 1810. The surviving ornate Georgian surroundings of the south door are of a very high quality. There is no east window. Instead the blank east wall is dominated by an altarpiece of the Ten Commandments thought to have been painted by the Italian master Pompeo Batoni (1708–87), although this has not been substantiated. Weston-on-the-Green is not the only Oxfordshire parish church thought to have a painting by Batoni. The parish church of Saint Peter, Marsh Baldon, south of Weston-on-the-Green, has a Batoni painting of the Annunciation. The architect R. Phené Spiers restored the building in the 1870s, repairing the tower and adding the south porch and new seating. A plan to rebuild the east end with an apse \\"to make the building more churchlike\\" was not executed. In 1885 Spiers added a heavy tracery to the Georgian windows and the organ was installed. The tower used to have three bells, one each cast in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. They were replaced in 1870 with ring of five, now six, all of which were cast by Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. There is also a Sanctus bell cast in 1834 by W. & J. Taylor, presumably at their Oxford foundry. The ecclesiastical parish is now a member of the Church of England Benefice of Akeman, which includes the parishes of Bletchingdon, Chesterton, Hampton Gay, Kirtlington, Middleton Stoney and Wendlebury.

It is also known as the wetland tapaculo or tall-grass wetland tapaculo. It is endemic to Brazil. Description It is a small, dumpy bird with broad tail-feathers and a total length of approximately 12.5 cm. The upperparts are plain blackish in colour while the underparts are dark grey. The flanks are slightly barred with brown, at least in young birds. The legs are reddish-brown and the bill is dark. The song includes a long series of short 'tchek' notes. The birds run rapidly and will fly short distances when flushed. Distribution and habitat It was first sighted on April 19, 1997 in wetlands beside the Iraí River near Curitiba in southern Brazil. Until recently it was generally believed to be restricted to about two dozen sites in the eastern part of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul, but has now been discovered in the highlands of Minas Gerais – far north of its previously known range. It occurs in seasonally flooded grassland in the floodplains of rivers. It inhabits areas of tall (60–180 cm), dense vegetation dominated by sedges (such as Eleocharis) and grasses. It forages at or near ground-level and feeds on small arthropods, mainly insects such as bugs and beetles. Breeding occurs in late spring. Status and conservation It is classified as an endangered species due to its small and declining population and destruction of its habitat. Threats include drainage, sand extraction, burning of grassland and the flooding of land due to the construction of dams. Despite the recently discovered populations in Minas Gerais, some of which are within protected areas (the national parks of Serra do Cipó and Serra da Canastra, and the private reserve Serra do Caraça), it has been recommended not downgrading it to a lower threatened status, but it remains to be seen if this will be followed.

It is a nonparametric test and appropriate to use when the data are right skewed and censored (technically, the censoring must be non-informative). It is widely used in clinical trials to establish the efficacy of a new treatment in comparison with a control treatment when the measurement is the time to event (such as the time from initial treatment to a heart attack). The test is sometimes called the Mantel–Cox test, named after Nathan Mantel and David Cox. The logrank test can also be viewed as a time-stratified Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test. The test was first proposed by Nathan Mantel and was named the logrank test by Richard and Julian Peto. Definition The logrank test statistic compares estimates of the hazard functions of the two groups at each observed event time. It is constructed by computing the observed and expected number of events in one of the groups at each observed event time and then adding these to obtain an overall summary across all-time points where there is an event. Consider two groups of patients, e.g., treatment vs. control. Let 1, \\\\ldots, J be the distinct times of observed events in either group. Let N_{1,j} and N_{2,j} be the number of subjects \\"at risk\\" (who have not yet had an event or been censored) at the start of period j in the groups, respectively. Let O_{1,j} and O_{2,j} be the observed number of events in the groups at time j. Finally, define N_j = N_{1,j} + N_{2,j} and O_j = O_{1,j} + O_{2,j}. The null hypothesis is that the two groups have identical hazard functions, H_0 : h_1(t) = h_2(t). Hence, under H_0, for each group i = 1, 2, O_{i,j} follows a hypergeometric distribution with parameters N_j, N_{i,j}, O_j. This distribution has expected value E_{i,j} = N_{i,j} \\\\frac{O_j}{N_j} and variance V_{i,j} = E_{i,j} \\\\left( \\\\frac{N_j - O_j}{N_j} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{N_j - N_{i,j}}{N_j - 1} \\\\right). For all j = 1, \\\\ldots, J, the logrank statistic compares O_{i,j} to its expectation E_{i,j} under H_0. It is defined as :Z = \\\\frac {\\\\sum_{j=1}^J (O_{i,j} - E_{i,j})} {\\\\sqrt {\\\\sum_{j=1}^J V_{i,j}}}\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{d}\\\\ \\\\mathcal N(0,1) (for i=1 or 2) By the central limit theorem, the distribution of Z converges to that of a standard normal distribution as J approaches infinity and therefore can be approximated by the standard normal distribution for a sufficiently large J. An improved approximation can be obtained by equating this quantity to Pearson type I or II (beta) distributions with matching first four moments, as described in Appendix B of the Peto and Peto paper. Asymptotic distribution If the two groups have the same survival function, the logrank statistic is approximately standard normal. A one-sided level \\\\alpha test will reject the null hypothesis if Z>z_\\\\alpha where z_\\\\alpha is the upper \\\\alpha quantile of the standard normal distribution. If the hazard ratio is \\\\lambda, there are n total subjects, d is the probability a subject in either group will eventually have an event (so that nd is the expected number of events at the time of the analysis), and the proportion of subjects randomized to each group is 50%, then the logrank statistic is approximately normal with mean (\\\\log{\\\\lambda}) \\\\, \\\\sqrt {\\\\frac {n \\\\, d} {4}} and variance 1. For a one-sided level \\\\alpha test with power 1-\\\\beta, the sample size required is n = \\\\frac {4 \\\\, (z_\\\\alpha + z_\\\\beta)^2 } {d\\\\log^2{\\\\lambda}} where z_\\\\alpha and z_\\\\beta are the quantiles of the standard normal distribution. Joint distribution Suppose Z_1 and Z_2 are the logrank statistics at two different time points in the same study ( Z_1 earlier). Again, assume the hazard functions in the two groups are proportional with hazard ratio \\\\lambda and d_1 and d_2 are the probabilities that a subject will have an event at the two time points where d_1 \\\\leq d_2 . Z_1 and Z_2 are approximately bivariate normal with means \\\\log{\\\\lambda} \\\\, \\\\sqrt {\\\\frac {n \\\\, d_1} {4}} and \\\\log{\\\\lambda} \\\\, \\\\sqrt {\\\\frac {n \\\\, d_2} {4}} and correlation \\\\sqrt {\\\\frac {d_1} {d_2}} . Calculations involving the joint distribution are needed to correctly maintain the error rate when the data are examined multiple times within a study by a Data Monitoring Committee. Relationship to other statistics *The logrank statistic can be derived as the score test for the Cox proportional hazards model comparing two groups. It is therefore asymptotically equivalent to the likelihood ratio test statistic based from that model. *The logrank statistic is asymptotically equivalent to the likelihood ratio test statistic for any family of distributions with proportional hazard alternative. For example, if the data from the two samples have exponential distributions. *If Z is the logrank statistic, D is the number of events observed, and \\\\hat {\\\\lambda} is the estimate of the hazard ratio, then \\\\log{\\\\hat {\\\\lambda}} \\\\approx Z \\\\, \\\\sqrt{4/D} . This relationship is useful when two of the quantities are known (e.g. from a published article), but the third one is needed. *The logrank statistic can be used when observations are censored. If censored observations are not present in the data then the Wilcoxon rank sum test is appropriate. *The logrank statistic gives all calculations the same weight, regardless of the time at which an event occurs. The Peto logrank test statistic gives more weight to earlier events when there are a large number of observations. Test assumptions The logrank test is based on the same assumptions as the Kaplan- Meier survival curve—namely, that censoring is unrelated to prognosis, the survival probabilities are the same for subjects recruited early and late in the study, and the events happened at the times specified. Deviations from these assumptions matter most if they are satisfied differently in the groups being compared, for example if censoring is more likely in one group than another.

He was one of the founding members of the early dubstep scene with the late MC and former collaborator The Spaceape. He has released three full-length albums: Memories of the Future (2006) and Black Sun (2011), both with The Spaceape, and Nothing (2015). As owner of Hyperdub, Goodman has signed artists such as Burial, DJ Rashad, Zomby, and Fatima Al Qadiri. Goodman has a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Warwick and has published a book, Sonic Warfare: Sound, Affect, and the Ecology of Fear, in 2009. Early career Initially inspired by what he calls the \\"hardcore continuum\\" of British dance music, Kode9 was formatively influenced by styles such as jungle, drum and bass and 2-step garage; he has mentioned his first encounter with jungle, in Edinburgh, as being \\"the most important musical event of my life\\".Invisible Jukebox, The Wire no. 269, July 2006 Other genres that are common influences in his work include dub, dancehall (such as toasting), and Indian music. A move to Warwick and collaboration with the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit at University of Warwick studying rave culture, cybernetics, postmodernism and afrofuturism later led to a memetic philosophy regarding music, which he has spoken about at length in interviews. In the late nineties, Kode9 moved to London, and established a name as a disc jockey in clubs such as FWD>>. Current work In 2004, Kode9 appeared on the second grime compilation on Rephlex records.Derek Walmsley, \\"Dubstep\\", The Wire Primers: A Guide to Modern Music, ed. Rob Young, London: Verso, 2009, p. 89. That same year, Kode9 founded Hyperdub records; the first release was Sine of the Dub, a collaboration between Kode9 and Daddy Gee, which was a minimal, loose cover version of Prince's \\"Sign \\"O\\" the Times\\". Kode9 treated the vocals to fit his idea of their delivery by \\"a man on his deathbed\\".Derek Walmsley, \\"Dubstep\\", The Wire Primers: A Guide to Modern Music, ed. Rob Young, London: Verso, 2009, p. 92 Subsequent releases established the label as an important and influential label within the dubstep genre. Hyperdub have since released records such as Burial's self-titled debut album, which The Wire magazine named their number one album of 2006.Rewind 2006, The Wire no. 275, January 2007. Goodman has a Ph.D in philosophy from the University of Warwick and has also worked in academia. As of 2006 he was working at the University of East London as a lecturer in media production, and course tutor for a master's program in sonic culture and taught several musicians and DJs such as Pixel 82 & Shem Booth- Spain sound/music theory and production. In December 2009, his Sonic Warfare: Sound, Affect, and the Ecology of Fear, a book exploring the uses of acoustic force and how it affects whole populations was published by MIT Press. The book also explores how sound can be deployed to set moods of dread and fear, how sound can be used as torture, as a weapon and as a threat.

Plot Schlock is a prehistoric apeman who terrorizes Southern California. He emerges from his cavehole after a couple of teenagers venture into it. The police, under Detective Sgt. Wino, is informed where the creature lives, and Professor Shlibovitz ventures into the hole to study the habitat. Schlock returns to the cave, and after a few hijinks, the people realise what he is. The police tries to apprehend the creature, but are powerless. Schlock then ventures into the suburb. He is a menace to some, and a friend to others. He falls in love with the beautiful blind teenageer Mindy. She is kind to Schlock at first, but after she regains her sight, is terrified of him. Her boyfriend Cal defends her against Schlock, by using a flare. Schlock later crashes a school-party, and takes Mindy to the roof of the building. Cal uses a flare to get Schlock to drop Mindy. A small army regiment then shoots down the apeman, using two rounds of ammunition. Mindy quotes Love Story; \\"Love means never having to say you're sorry\\", while a police officer quotes King Kong; \\"It was beauty that killed the beast\\". Sgt. Wino asks him; \\"What's wrong with you?\\". At the end, Professor Shlibovitz emerges from the cave, carrying Schlock's son, teasing the potential sequel \\"Son of Schlock\\".

Its broadcast area includes southeastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia, western North Carolina, north Georgia and far northwest South Carolina. Tower The WIMZ FM-Tower (also called the WBIR TV-mast) is a 534.01-meter-high guy-wired aerial mast for the transmission of FM radio and television programs in Knoxville, Tennessee (Geographical coordinates: ). The tower was completed during 1963 September and at the time was the tallest structure in the world.Jack Neely, Knoxville's Secret History (Scruffy Books, 1995), p. 155. It is currently owned by South Central Communications. Originally, the tower was used for television broadcasts by WBIR-TV, but it was shielded by mountains from some audiences in the vicinity of Knoxville, especially those in the western towns of Farragut, Oak Ridge, and Lenoir City. WBIR relocated to Sharp's Ridge near downtown Knoxville during the 1970s, and the tower is now used by radio station WIMZ. Due to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations, the antenna itself is located 1,570 ft (479 m) AGL, about 180 ft (55 m) below the top of the tower. Originally before the tall WBIR-TV mast was built during 1963, the owner of the television station had planned the tower to be built on nearby House Mountain, the tallest point in Knox County, Tennessee. But WBIR's main competitor WATE-TV ended that idea. See the article House Mountain for details. Format history Known originally as WBIR-FM, the station had a country music format, switching to album-oriented rock music during 1979. Not long after the format switch it changed its call letters to the current WIMZ, and used the slogan \\"Rock 104\\". At the start of 1983 it altered its format somewhat to add more current new wave and heavy metal music acts and curtail much of the 1970s classic rock music; at that time it also stopped using the name Rock 104 and began identifying as \\"103.5 WIMZ\\", with a new logo modeled on that of MTV. The last song played with WBIR's Country format was \\"Waltz Across Texas\\" by Ernest Tubb. In the middle of the song, the turntable was switched off until the song spun to a stop. There was brief moment of silence and then a voice was broadcast that said, \\"WBIR FM, Rock 104. We Believe In Rock.\\" ...and Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" began playing. During 1982, WHEL on AM 1240 (formerly with a big band format) began simulcasting WIMZ-FM's programming, and became WIMZ. This simulcast on AM continued for much of the 1980s.

In a career spanning more than 50 years she is best known for her wordless improvisations. Biography Born as Norma Short in Bow, East London,Odeen-Isbister, Sara, \\"Jazz star Norma Winstone on growing up in Dagenham\\", Barking and Dagenham Post, 5 October 2012. she began singing in bands around Dagenham in the early 1960s, before joining Michael Garrick's band in 1968. Her first recording came the following year, with Joe Harriott. In 1971 she was voted top singer in the Melody Maker Jazz Poll. She recorded the album Edge of Time under her own name in 1972. Winstone contributed vocals to Ian Carr's Nucleus on that band's 1973 release Labyrinth, a jazz-rock concept album based on the Greek myth about the Minotaur. Her 1987 album Somewhere Called Home was well reviewed by AllMusic, which said: \\"It's not only a watermark of Winstone's career but, in the long line of modern vocal outings released since the romantic vocal tradition of Fitzgerald and Vaughan ended with free jazz and fusion, the disc stands out as one most original yet idyllic of vocal jazz recordings. ... A must for fans looking for something as cozy as a golden age chanteuse, but without all the gymnastic scatting and carbon copy ways of many a contemporary jazz singer.\\" Winstone has worked with many major European musicians and visiting Americans, as well as with most of her peers in British jazz, including Garrick, John Surman, Michael Gibbs, Mike Westbrook and her former husband, the pianist John Taylor. With Taylor and trumpeter Kenny Wheeler she performed and recorded three albums for ECM as a member of the trio Azimuth between 1977 and 1980; their fifth and last album How It Was Then… Never Again was given four stars by DownBeat magazine. In addition, she made albums with the American pianists Jimmy Rowles (Well Kept Secret, 1993) and Fred Hersch. In February 2018, Winstone released Descansado: Songs for Films, a collection that AllMusic described as \\"an unusual and provocative album\\".

At the time of her decommissioning, Jason was (with the exception of ) the oldest ship in continual commission in the United States Navy, and the final ship in continual commission from World War II onward.  World War II, Pacific Theatre operations  She was laid down on 9 March 1942, at Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, San Pedro, California, as Heavy-hull Repair Ship ARH-1, and launched on 3 April 1943. Jason was commissioned on 19 June 1944, with Capt. A.O.R. Bergesen in command. After brief shakedown and fitting out, the repair ship arrived Pearl Harbor on 6 July 1944 on the first leg of her journey to the Pacific battle area. She arrived Purvis Bay in the Solomon Islands on 17 August to commence operations with Service Squadron 10. Two months later she arrived Ulithi, where she was to spend the greater part of the war, performing the task of keeping the U.S. Navy's ships at peak strength and operating efficiency. USS Randolph after a Kamikaze hit at Ulithi, 1945.Photographed from a USS Miami (CL-89) floatplane For seven months at Ulithi, as American forces captured island after island from the Japanese, Jason, many times under enemy attack, repaired broken hulls, buckled decks and twisted bulkheads of every type of ship in the U.S. Navy. This floating shipyard turned seemingly hopeless battle wrecks into rejuvenated fighting ships again able to stand out gallantly in the final victorious months. As the action crept closer to Japan, Jason sailed for Leyte arriving there on 28 May 1945. She remained there for the duration of the war continuing to service ships of the Pacific Fleet.  Post-World War II operations  After the surrender of Japan, she joined a convoy of units from the U.S. 7th Fleet and arrived Jinsen, Korea, on 8 September with the first occupation troops. She operated out of Jinsen, and Tsingtao, China, until mid- February 1946, performing repair services and assisting in the evacuation of Japanese nationals. Jason returned to Terminal Island, California, on 9 March for overhaul. Her rest was a brief one, however, as she sailed once again in May for the Far East. For the next four years she serviced the U.S. Pacific Fleet, alternating between Japan and California.  Korean War operations  Jason with HMS Unicorn (I72), USS Juneau (CLAA-119), USS Valley Forge (CV-45), USS Leyte (CV-32) and USS Hector (AR-7) at Sasebo, Japan, 1950. Jason departed Oakland, California, on 22 July 1950 for Sasebo and immediately began service duties upon her arrival in August. Throughout the war she remained at Sasebo for extended periods performing the repair tasks at hand, with only brief overhaul periods in the United States. Following the cessation of hostilities in Korea, Jason returned to San Diego, California, on 6 November 1953. Six months later she sailed for another WestPac deployment which included a goodwill tour to Chin Hae, Korea. It was during this cruise, that the Chinese Communists began to provoke the Nationalist-held Tachen Islands. The U.S. 7th Fleet, which Jason helped maintain, sent units into the area to make certain the peace was not violated. Jason returned to San Diego, California, on 13 February 1955 and commenced repair services off the West Coast of the United States. Her next Far Eastern tour began January 1956, and she operated, in Japan, Okinawa, and Formosa before returning to San Diego, in late October. While on still another deployment to Sasebo she was redesignated AR-8 on 9 September 1957. Following her return to San Diego on 14 February 1958, she operated there throughout the year.  Vietnam War operations  Jason was dispatched to the Far East on 6 January 1959 and operated there until returning to San Diego, on 18 August. Following her return to San Diego, on 7 March 1961, Jason operated along the West Coast of the United States providing repair services through 1962. Another deployment with WestPac began on 3 January 1963, with the growing insurgency in South Vietnam. She returned to San Diego on 7 July 1963, and serviced the U.S. Pacific Fleet along the West Coast through 1964.  West Coast operations  Jason departed San Diego on 4 January 1965 and arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, on the 25th. After operations in Japan and at Okinawa, she reached Subic Bay 6 March and served ships of the 7th Fleet until heading home on 31 August. The repair ship operated in ports of southern California until entering the Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, for overhaul on 4 March 1966. Back in top trim by 6 June, Jason resumed West Coast operations until sailing for the WestPac on 9 January 1967. She served the ships of the 7th Fleet at Sasebo and in Subic Bay until returning to San Diego, on 19 August. Jason had her large guns removed to qualify it as a non-combatant ship, so women could become part of the ship's crew. In October 1980, while home ported in San Diego, the Jason and her crew deployed for WestPac and Indian Ocean cruise in support of troops for the Iran hostage crisis. She deployed with approximately 800 men and 45 women. The Jason repaired ships in Yokosuka, Japan, for about a month, and after a Thanksgiving stop in Subic Bay, Philippines, (with a very brief stop at Singapore to drop off a crewmember needing immediate surgery for appendicitis) the Jason entered the Indian Ocean. She was met there by a Russian warship, an oiler and two merchant ships. Soon thereafter she picked up the tail of a Russian submarine. Anchoring at Diego Garcia the Jason became the floating pier in the middle of the bay. She remained there repairing both ships and submarines. Jason returned to San Diego soon after, with a brief stop in Fremantle, Western Australia, on 27 February 1981 with four-day R&R; in the city of Perth, and a resupply at Pearl Harbor. Soon the crew was to receive word that the Jason would be moving homeports to Pearl Harbor. The Jason was to replace the as the Tender for the Harbor. Captain Johnson was replaced by Captain Martin, the former CO of the Bryce Canyon. While stationed at \\"Pearl\\" the Jason underwent a \\"light\\" overhaul costing several millions of dollars. The crew moved ashore for the overhaul and upon return had to requalify to take her to sea. In 1983 the Jason deployed for West Pac 1983 to Yokosuka and Sasebo, Japan, Olongapo, Philippines, and to Pusan, S.Korea. On 10 February 1986, Jason was run into by the oiler about 100 km southwest of Pearl Harbor, while steaming across and through a formation centered around Willamette, in an attempt to take up a position in the formation astern of Willamette. One crewmember was killed and eight others of Jasons crew were injured. A large vertical rupture from the deck to waterline on the port side of the Jason forced the ship to be towed back to port by the . As a result of the collision both captains were relieved of command. Following repairs, Jason moved to a new home port in San Diego. By this time the Jason was the most decorated ship in the Navy.  Gulf War operations  When \\"Operation Desert Shield\\" began in August 1990, Jasons operating schedule was accelerated to allow for deployment as soon as possible. Under Captain Roy Tobin, the Jason departed for the Persian Gulf in early December, arriving with an amphibious assault force off the coast of Oman on 14 January 1991 – the day before Congress had authorized the use of force to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. Two weeks into the Air War, the Jason moved into the Persian Gulf, mooring pierside along with other US and Coalition ships in Manama, Bahrain, in support of \\"Operation Desert Storm\\". Ballistic missile alerts were common over the next few weeks, until the cessation of hostilities on 28 February. The Jason played a vital role in the emergency repair of the two warships that suffered mine damage in the Persian Gulf, the and the . The Battle Damage Assessment and Repair teams that flew out to the crippled ships earned combat action awards for their service in Desert Storm – including the first combat action awards ever earned by female sailors. Additionally, a Battle Damage Assessment Team went ashore in Kuwait and recorded damage to their designated area of responsibility. The personnel included in this team also earned combat action awards.

The Dragon Lady, also known as Madam Deal, was a well-known character in the U.S. comic strip Terry and the Pirates, created by Milton Caniff, and in the movie serial, comic books, and TV series based on the comic strip. Her real name is Lai Choi San, a real-life 20th century pirate. Origin The Dragon Lady first appeared in December 1934, in the first Sunday strip story. She began as a stereotypically beautiful, seductive and evil Asian, but as the comic strip became more realistic, the character grew more complex. Fans of the strip recall her passionate love for the journalist and man-of-action Pat Ryan, and the time she taught Terry how to dance. In the years leading up to World War II, she became a heroic, though Machiavellian figure, leading the resistance against the Japanese invasion of China. She was described as \\"beautiful as Aphrodite, wise as Athena, swifter than Mercury, and stronger than Hercules.\\" According to Milton Caniff: Conversations, she \\"was modeled from a real person, as are all Caniff's characters\\", in this case a succession of them, starting with professional model Phyllis Johnson. In other media Various actresses played the Dragon Lady in the radio series of Terry and the Pirates (1937–48), including Agnes Moorehead, Adelaide Klein and Marion Sweet. In the 1940 film serial, the part was played by Sheila Darcy. Gloria Saunders was cast as the Dragon Lady in the brief 1953 television series. Radio actress Marion Sweet as the Dragon Lady Agnes Moorehead's portrayal of the Dragon Lady is mentioned in Harlan Ellison's \\"Jeffty is Five\\" as a comment marking the passage of time and things past.

These accessory lacrimal glands are located in the upper border of the tarsus, approximately in the middle between the extremities of the tarsal glands. Sometimes they are situated slightly above the tarsus. There are usually 2 to 5 of these glands in the upper eyelid, and their function is to produce tears which are secreted onto the surface of the conjunctiva. They are named after Italian anatomist Giuseppe Vincenzo Ciaccio (1824–1901), who described these glands in 1874. They are sometimes called \\"Wolfring's glands\\" after Polish ophthalmologist Emilj von Wolfring (1832-1906), who described them during the same time period as did Ciaccio.

Cassell's Latin Dictionary The usage may be compared with the common usage in Classical Latin literature of Carthago, genitive Carthaginis, the city of Carthage, with its adjectival form Carthaginiensis. Usage It is thus used in the modern age in formal ecclesiastical and academic Latin contexts, most commonly as the post-nominal suffix given to honorary and academic degrees from the University of Exeter and of even more ancient origin as the official signature of the Bishop of Exeter, who signs with his Christian or forename followed by the word Exon.

Glen Parva was operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. The prison closed in June 2017, following an announcement at the end of 2016 that it would be replaced with a newly built category C adult prison. It will be completely demolished and redeveloped with a new built prison on the site. It became an adult and young offenders institution in July 2011. History Glen Parva was constructed on the site of the former Glen Parva Barracks in the early 1970s as a borstal and has always held young offenders. Since its opening in 1974 the establishment has seen considerable expansion and change and now serves a catchment area of over 100 courts, holding a mixture of sentenced, unsentenced, and remand prisoners. In 1997, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons walked out of an inspection at Glen Parva because conditions were so bad. After a subsequent inspection a year later, the report stated that there was \\"hope for the future\\" for the prison but added that a lot of work still needed to be done, and recommended that some staff should be moved because of their attitude towards inmates. In July 2002, four inmates from Glen Parva escaped whilst on a two-day camping trip in the Peak District. Two were caught soon after, but two inmates managed to evade police capture for some time. In its annual report in 2003, the Board of Visitors revealed two serious cases of unrest at Glen Parva Prison. On one occasion, 16 inmates barricaded themselves inside a building. The report blamed an unprecedented rise in the number of inmates at the prison, and also the fact that some inmates were bored and unsettled, finding themselves hundreds of miles from home. In November 2004, the Prison Reform Trust condemned Glen Parva for the high amount of time inmates spent in their cells and for the lack of time spent in \\"useful activity\\" at the prison. Statistics for 2003–2004 showed that on average inmates spent just 17.3 hours a week in useful activity, and an average of just another seven hours a week out of their cells. In February 2010 the prison's Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) described conditions there as \\"deplorable\\". Their report said \\"water from the prison's poorly-maintained toilet plumbing system leaked out of the pipes and seeped through the walls,\\" causing \\"a horrible smell that fills the corridors and cells on regular occasions\\" and that the prison \\"operates within the confines of a sprawling campus of largely shabby buildings which continue to degrade over time, despite the best efforts of the management and staff.\\" The board also warned that the policy of transferring prisoners into Glen Parva from other regions \\"has recently introduced an increasing level of gang rivalry, thereby adding yet another dimension to an already toxic melting pot\\". In August 2016, ambulance personnel called to prison criticised staff for their lack of urgency when faced with a life-threatening medical emergency. The prison today Glen Parva Prison was a closed Young Offenders Institution and Remand Centre. At the time of its closure accommodation was divided into ten residential units each having a mixture of single and double cells. All cells had integral sanitation and most had televisions which could be rented by prisoners. The Healthcare Centre at Glen Parva had 14 inpatient beds with 24-hour nursing cover. Many health services at the prison were provided by Leicestershire Primary Care Trust. Education and training provision at Glen Parva was delivered through six skills academies. Courses and programmes on offer included Information Technology, Computer Aided Design, Business Studies, Home Economics, Catering, ESOL, Art, Engineering, Carpentry, Barbering, Bricklaying, Painting and Decorating, Forklift Truck Driving, Horticulture, Gardening, Physical Education, Plastics, Laundry, Recycling and Industrial Cleaning. The prison also had links with organisations such as The Prince's Trust, Age Concern and National Grid plc to provide employment for Young Offenders on release. It was announced towards the end of 2016 that HMP Glen Parva would close and be replaced with a newly built category C adult prison.

Its 4720+ feet, (1439+ m) main summit is located in Lake County, west of the town of Cobb. Like nearby Mount Saint Helena, Cobb Mountain is tall enough to receive winter snowfall. The mountain also has a sub-peak named Cobb Mountain – Southwest Peak with an elevation of about 4483+ feet, (1367+ m); Southwest Peak lies on the Sonoma- Lake county line and is the highest point in Sonoma County. Nearby tall peaks like Mount Saint Helena and Snow Mountain can be seen from this summit.Height and visual lines-of-sight are based on Google Earth images. The east end of Cobb Mountain drains into the headwaters of Putah Creek, then into the Sacramento River, the San Francisco Bay, and the Pacific Ocean. The south slopes of Cobb Mountain drain into Anderson Creek, and thence into Putah Creek. The southwest slopes of Cobb Mountain drain into Cobb Creek, thence into Big Sulphur Creek, the Russian River, and into the Pacific. The northwest slopes of Cobb Mountain drain into Alder Creek, thence into Kelsey Creek, Clear Lake, Cache Creek, and the Sacramento River. The northeast slopes of Cobb Mountain drain into Kelsey Creek. Much of Cobb Mountain lies within The Geysers Geothermal Field, and several geothermal plants are located on the mountain. Other areas on the mountain are owned by Cobb Mountain Spring Water (now sold as Mayacamas Mountain Spring Water) or are privately held timberlands. Because much of Cobb Mountain is privately owned, it is largely not accessible to the general public.  History  The mountain is named after John Cobb, the first pioneer to settle in the area. Cobb was born in Henry County, Kentucky on May 19, 1814. In 1853 he arrived in California and homesteaded in Cobb Valley and went on to become the county assessor and the road overseer for the Clearlake District in 1855. He built a combined saw and gristmill in 1859, which was later destroyed by fire. He sold his interests and moved to Napa County around 1860. The Cobb Mountain area was devastated in 2015 by the Valley Fire, including much of the town of Cobb, as well as several geothermal facilities.

It is located at Germantown Pike and Hickory Road, near the Mid-County Interchange where the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) crosses the Northeast Extension/Blue Route (I-476). The mall was built by The Rouse Company in 1966. The mall features a fountain and a carousel. Plymouth Meeting Mall currently contains more than 80 specialty stores and restaurants, including a central Food Court, and outlying restaurants California Pizza Kitchen, P.F. Chang's, Redstone American Grill, Dave & Buster's, Benihana, Bertucci's, and King Buffet. Its original anchor stores Strawbridge & Clothier and Lit Brothers are now occupied by Burlington, Dick's Sporting Goods, Michaels, and Edge Fitness - which all occupy an anchor space that was Macy's until 2017 - and Boscov's. The Boscov's site was once home to one of the largest branches of Hess's. There is also a AMC Theatre on the property, featuring 24 screens and stadium seating. The Plymouth Meeting Mall was one of the first malls in North America which, among its mixture of various stores, offered a church within the mall. The mall is owned and managed by Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PREIT). The mall is recognizable from a considerable distance away due to an adjoining nine-story office tower, One Plymouth Meeting. The tower, containing of office space, is managed by Mack-Cali Realty Corporation. The mall is currently anchored by Boscov's, Burlington, Dick's Sporting Goods, Michaels, Edge Fitness, Whole Foods Market and an AMC Theatre. History Legoland inside the mall in 2018 Second floor of the mall, looking from Burlington, in 2020 The Plymouth Meeting Mall was built by The Rouse Company in 1966, it was the third fully enclosed shopping mall in the Philadelphia area. The original two anchor stores were Strawbridge & Clothier and Lit Brothers. The One Plymouth Meeting office tower was added on an outparcel in 1969. The mall suffered a major fire on January 10, 1970 at the east end (near Lit Brothers): \\"Approximately one third of the 100 stores in the suburban Philadelphia mall were damaged by either smoke, water or the fire.\\"\\"Plymouth Meeting Mall Damaged by Fire,\\" The Reading Eagle, January 11, 1970. Lit Brothers closed in 1976 and was replaced by Hess's in 1979. The Hess's, which was the only location in the Philadelphia area, saw poor sales and closed in March 1993 as part of the restructuring of the chain. The former Hess's became Boscov's on October 13, 1996. In 2003, The Rouse Company sold the Plymouth Meeting Mall along with the Cherry Hill Mall, Echelon Mall (renamed Voorhees Town Center in 2007), Exton Square Mall, Moorestown Mall, and The Gallery at Market East to PREIT for $548 million. In 2005, Federated Department Stores purchased May Department Stores, the owners of Strawbridge's, and converted several Strawbridge's locations to Macy's, including the store at Plymouth Meeting Mall. Strawbridge's became Macy's in 2006. A redevelopment of over $100 million in 2007-2009 added new restaurants and an open-air \\"Lifestyle\\" wing featuring LOFT, Coldwater Creek (now closed), Jos. A. Bank, Chico's and Olly Shoes. During the redevelopment, in April 2009, a 2-story chain arcade called Krazy City was constructed in the mall's interior, right near Boscov's, taking up several store spaces. A Whole Foods upscale grocery market was included in the redevelopment and anchors the \\"Outdoor Lifestyle Wing\\" of the property, which also includes an underground parking area. Previously, this location gained fame in 1985 when Swedish furniture company IKEA purchased and renovated an outparcel space for its first U.S. location. IKEA later moved in early 2003 to its current site at 400 Alan Wood Road, off of the \\"Blue Route\\" in nearby Conshohocken. In recent years, the interior of the Plymouth Meeting Mall has seen an increase in vacancies, with sales of $320 per square foot in the three months ending September 2015. The Plymouth Meeting Mall has seen a rise in vacancies due to declining mall traffic and competition from the larger King of Prussia mall located less than away and the Willow Grove Park Mall located away. In 2019, the non-anchor occupancy rate at Plymouth Meeting Mall is 81.3%. In December 2009, Krazy City closed its doors in accordance with the chain's folding. In 2012, it was converted to Mercy Health Center as part of Mercy Suburban Hospital. In late 2013, a casual Mexican chain restaurant opened in the second floor mall entrance wing right next to Macy's and across from Dave & Busters, called Uncle Julio's. In 2015, Mercy Suburban Hospital was sold to Prime Healthcare Services, which re-branded the hospital and renamed the center Suburban Health Center. That year, it was announced that a Legoland Discovery Center would be constructed at the Plymouth Meeting Mall, replacing a portion of the food court. Construction began in the summer of 2016 with a planned opening in 2017. On January 4, 2017, Suburban Health Center was announced to have closed. On the same day, Macy's announced that its store would be closing in spring 2017 as part of a plan to close 68 stores nationwide. On January 28, 2017, Uncle Julio's closed its restaurant. On March 26, 2017, Macy's officially closed its store. In July 2017, it was announced that a 5 Wits amusement center would open on the lower level of the mall, just across from Legoland Discovery Center, taking up almost 5 store spaces. The 5 Wits center opened on October 20, 2017. In August 2018, it was announced that Burlington, Dick's Sporting Goods, Michaels, and Edge Fitness would occupy the former Macy's space, with all tenants opening in October 2019.

It is considered analogous to the gross margin of non-financial companies. Net interest spread is expressed as interest yield on earning assets (any asset, such as a loan, that generates interest income) minus interest rates paid on borrowed funds. Net interest spread is similar to net interest margin; net interest spread expresses the nominal average difference between borrowing and lending rates, without compensating for the fact that the amount of earning assets and borrowed funds may be different. Example For example, a bank has average loans to customers of $100, and earns gross interest income of $6. The interest yield is 6/100 = 6%. A bank takes deposits from customers and pays 1% to those customers. The bank lends its customers money at 6%. The bank's net interest spread is 5%.

Harpending received his A.B. degree from Hamilton College and his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1972. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Education and career Harpending was born in Dundee, New York in 1944. He graduated from Dundee Central High School in 1961, Hamilton College in 1964, and received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1972. Harpending studied population genetics. After graduating from Harvard, he worked at Yale (1972-1973), the University of New Mexico (1973-85), Penn State (1985-1997), and the University of Utah (1997-2016). Over his career, he contributed to over 120 publications. Harpending's first wife was Patricia Draper, with whom he had two children. He married his second wife, Renee Pennington, around 1995. They had one son. He died on April 3, 2016 at the age of 72, following a stroke.West Hunter blog – Henry Harpending Work = Population genetics = According to a biography by Alan R. Rogers, in the 1970s Harpending pioneered the study of the relationship between genetics and geography, developing methods that are still in use. He also overturned the prevailing understanding of group selection, by showing that group selection is most likely to operate when there is strong gene flow between groups, rather than when they are isolated from one another.Rogers, Alan R. Henry C. Harpending: 1944-2016.\\" Biographical Memoirs. National Academy of Sciences, 2018. Harpending also developed the approach of analyzing populations using R-matrix methods, and together with Trefor Jonkin, wrote the most highly cited chapter in the 1973 handbook Methods and Theory of Anthropological Genetics.Crawford, Michael H. \\"History and Evolution of Anthropological Genetics\\". In A Companion to Anthropological Genetics (2019), edited by Dennis H. O'Rourke, pp. 3-15. = !Kung and Herero = Harpending did fieldwork in Southern Africa (Botswana, Namibia) and spoke the !Kung language. In 1981, while with the University of New Mexico, Harpending studied the group during the South African Border War. Harpending described the !Kung society as \\"like Rorschachs\\" because anthropologists could draw contradictory conclusions. His fieldwork was the basis of the 1993 monograph The Structure of an African Pastoralist Community, with Pennington. Harpending also did extensive fieldwork on the Herero people, a cattle-herding group in the Botswana area. Herero are locally known for \\"their traditionalism, their wealth in cattle and their dominating older women\\". Harpending's previous experience with the !Kung people was useful because many Herero are bilingual in !Kung. Harpending had previous contact with Herero from earlier research trips. In 1973, Harpending helped start the Kalahari People's Fund. The KPF was an outgrowth of the multidisciplinary Harvard Kalahari Research Group led by Richard Lee and Irven DeVore. Newsweek described the KPF as one of the first people's advocacy organizations in the US with professional anthropological expertise behind it. = Ashkenazi intelligence = Harpending's hypothesis about Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence has attracted both praise and criticism, with some scientists regarding the theory as highly implausible, while others regard it as worth considering.\\"Researchers Say Intelligence and Diseases May Be Linked in Ashkenazic Genes\\". The New York Times, June 3, 2005. According to cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker, this theory \\"meets the standards of a good scientific theory, though it is tentative and could turn out to be mistaken.\\"Pinker, S. \\"Groups and Genes\\". The New Republic, June 26, 2006. On the other hand, geneticist David Reich has argued that the hypothesis is contradicted by evidence that the higher rate of genetic diseases among Ashkenazi Jews is in fact due to genetic drift.Reich. D. Who We are and How We Got Here. Pantheon books, 2018, p. 261. = The 10,000 Year Explosion = In The 10,000 Year Explosion, which he co-authored with Gregory Cochran, Harpending suggests a common belief that human genetic adaptation stopped 40,000 years ago is incorrect and that humans evolved increasingly rapidly in response to the new challenges presented by agriculture and civilization. The result was accelerating evolution which has varied according to new niches or environments that particular populations inhabit. The final chapter of The 10,000 Year Explosion expands on their paper from the Journal of Biosocial ScienceG. Cochran, J. Hardy, H. Harpending. \\"Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence\\" , Journal of Biosocial Science 38 (5), pp. 659–693 (2006). on the issue of Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence. Harpending and Cochran argue the cause of the claim of Ashkenazim having higher mean verbal and mathematical intelligence than other ethnic groups (as well as having a relatively high number of genetic diseases, such as Tay–Sachs disease, Canavan disease, Niemann–Pick disease, Gaucher's disease, familial dysautonomia, Bloom syndrome, Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and mucolipidosis IV) is due to the historically isolated population of Jews in Europe.\\"Henry Harpending.\\" Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale, 2010. Biography In Context. Web. 1 Sept. 2013. Harpending and Cochran's book The 10,000 Year Explosion was reviewed in many several academic journals, including the American Journal of Human Biology, Evolutionary Psychology, Evolution and Human Behavior, Explorations in Anthropology, and the Journal of Anthropological Research. Reviews by Milford H. Wolpoff, Gregory Gorelik and Todd K. Shackelford, and Edward Hagen all praised the book as creative and insightful, and argue that it presents a valuable contribution to our understanding of human evolution. However, these reviewers criticized some of the book's hypotheses as not adequately supported.Milford H. Wolpoff (2010). Book Review: The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilizations Accelerated Human Evolution. Edited by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending. xiii 1 288 pp. New York: Basic Books. 2009. $27.00 (cloth). American Journal of Human Biology. 22:137–142. A pair of negative reviews by Cadell Last and Keith Hunley criticized the book for its regarding race as a biological category and for presenting an overly simplistic view of the influence of genetics on human behavioral variation.  Views on race  The Southern Poverty Law Center has documented Harpending's works and statements on race, noting his association with white supremacist groups and referring to his work as an attempt to perpetuate scientific racism. The SPLC notes he attributed stereotypes of different human populations to genetic differences, often saying that Africans, Papua New Guineans, and \\"Baltimore\\"Henry Harpending, quoted in (African-Americans) possess the same genetic temperamental predispositions which he said are characterized by \\"violence, laziness, and a preference for 'mating instead of parenting'\\",Double quotes: SPLC; single quotes: Henry Harpending; both quoted in while Europeans and northern Asians \\"have evolved higher intelligence and 'tend to be more disciplined than people who take life for granted'\\"; that he favored mass deportation of illegal immigrants from the United States using FEMA camps as part of the process and did not believe that more money should be spent on education in the United States because he thought the race-based disparities are based on genetics rather than disparities in funding; that he gave conferences at what the SPLC designates as white supremacist groups; and that he supported eugenics, crediting it in the form of the death penalty for the \\"genetic pacification\\" of the western European population. Harpending once stated that people of sub-Saharan ancestry do not have the same genetic propensity for \\"hard work\\" as Eurasians do. According to geneticist David Reich, \\"there is simply no scientific evidence to support this statement.\\" Harpending denied being a racist. During a talk on race and intelligence at the H.L. Mencken Club, a white nationalist conference founded by Paul Gottfried and Richard Spencer, he said that \\"somebody'll call you a racist, but that's the way the world is\\". In a 2012 blog post, he wrote \\"if [belief in witchcraft] is nearly pan-African then perhaps some of it came to the New World\\", with the result being that \\"talkers from the American Black population come out with similar theories of vague and invisible forces that are oppressing people, like 'institutional racism' and 'white privilege'\\".

After winning critical acclaim for his debut album Martyn Bennet (1996), Bothy Culture builds upon that album's mixing of Scottish Celtic music with farther, international folk music styles and contemporary electronic music. The album celebrates and draws upon the music of Bennett's native Gaeldom as well as the music of Islam and Scandinavia, with Bennett finding and emotionally connecting to the similarities between the geographically dispersed styles. It mixes the styles with contemporary electronic music such as breakbeat and drum and bass. Named for the traditional party culture of Highland bothies, which Bennett related to modern club music subcultures, Bothy Culture was released to critical acclaim, with critics praising the effectiveness of the album's unique blend of disparate styles. Bennett formed the band Cuillin, consisting of himself, his wife and two other musicians, to tour in promotion of the album. Several critics have gone on to regard Bothy Culture as a groundbreaking and pioneering album that established Bennett as a prominent musician within the evolution of Scottish music, and Bennett went on to win the Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Award for Music. In 2018, 13 years after Bennett's death, his friend, composer Greg Lawson, hosted the much publicised show Bothy Culture and Beyond at the SSE Hydro, Glasgow, with his GRIT Orchestra, to celebrate the album's 20th anniversary. Background Martyn Bennett, already a Celtic musician, having grown up within Scottish Gaelic culture and learning to play the fiddle and piano, became influenced by the electronic dance music scene of the early 1990s and began regularly attending clubs, soon working Martin Swan's Mouth Music project, combining traditional Gaelic songs and music with contemporary instruments. He made his debut at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on 14 January 1994 supporting them. His debut album Martyn Bennet (1995), released on the Edinburgh-based indie label Eclectic, was recorded in just seven days. The album had a large impact on Scottish music, and Bennett become one of a leading group of Scottish artists, others including Peatbog Faeries, Tartan Amoebas and Shooglenifty, who pioneered an \\"electro-ethnic-worldbeat\\" genre in which Scottish Celtic music was mixed with other folk influences from Europe and further afield like Asia, South America, Jamaica and Africa, and with contemporary music, especially electronic music. The Los Angeles Times lauded Bennett's \\"capitvating form of multi- culturalism,\\" while the Toronto Sun noted the mixing of Gaelic jigs, Turkish bagpipes and Penjabi melodies with synthesizers and drum machines in his music. After its release, he provided the live musical score for David Harrower’s play Knives in Hens, and after writing scores for stage and television, he went on tour to America, supporting Wolfstone, soon also playing at Edinburgh Hogmanay events in 1995 and 1996, performing to more than 90,000 people. It was with these events that his second album Bothy Culture started to piece together. More-so than his debut album, Bothy Culture developed as a result of his experiences of the early 1990s Glaswegian rave and house scenes and his experimentation with numerous types of world music. It was recorded solely by Bennett within his home studio. Compared to his debut album, Bennett described Bothy Culture as \\"less of a kind of virtuosic performance. It's a simpler kind of collage in a way. I think it's more complex and mature as well. The first album is full of testosterone.\\" Composition = Inspiration and themes = The traditional culture of Highland bothies gave the album its name. Bennett explained Bothy Culture celebrates not only his own country's Gaelic culture and music, but also the music of Islam, for which he held a long-lasting fascination due to its vocals, modes and instrumentation being \\"similar in emotion\\" to Gaelic music styles, and the music of Scandinavia, which he found to have the same heavy- beat rowdiness and \\"solitary sweetness\\" of the ceilidh music he played in his upbringing. He felt he understood Islamic and Scandinavian music as soon as he heard them due to them expressing themselves without words: \\"I recognised them to be some past life I had lived through perhaps, or they seemed to well up under my fingers without my awareness.\\" The album is named for bothies, the Highland huts where travellers and shepherds would traditionally meet, rest, swap tunes and party. Bennett had stayed in bothies when trekking the Highlands, and had over time taken note of the bothy songs and tunes written by shepherds and drovers over generations, and noted similar traditions in other worldwide mountainous cultures, especially those with bothy-style traditions, like Spain, Austria, Greece, China, Bulgaria and Turkey. He found comparisons between the atmospheres of bothies and urban nightclubs, where he had \\"spooky\\" experiences arriving for soundchecks when the clubs were cold and empty, but noted: \\"Although the music and songs that have been played in them are totally contrasting, it is this same sense of excitement that can transform four bare walls into a chamber of sheer sensual delight.\\" Mairi McFayden of Bella Caledonia noted the significance of the bothy as a totemic symbol within the album. She said, despite a bothy seeming \\"unremarkable in itself,\\" it nonetheless holds significant importance within Highland culture in that it they were the source of many memorable and important experiences for peoples' lives – \\"of gathering and companionship, of togetherness, of conviviality, of sharing stories, music and song. Of communitas.\\" She felt this was \\"at the heart\\" of Bothy Culture: \\"whether the rhythmic entrainment of the rave or nightclub or the cultural intimacy and conviviality of the bothy, both are a vital a source of this dynamic life force – a feeling of connection to something outside and beyond our own individual, corporeal existence.\\" = Music = First and foremost an album of dance music, Bothy Culture primarily celebrates and draws from the music of Bennett's native Gaeldom as well as Scandinavian music and Islamic music. Dave Sleger of AllMusic felt the album mixes music from Punjabi, Scandinavian, Turkish and Irish cultures with modern club music styles like rave, techno and hip-hop, creating what he calls a \\"assiduous hybrid.\\" Though Bennett's previous work used electronic dance beats, Bothy Culture developed upon the prominence of these beats considerably, with styles of drum and bass and trippy breakbeats. Billboard believed the album uses Bennett's native folk styles as the touchstone for what is essentially an \\"ultramodern\\" world music album, while CMJ New Music Monthly emphasised the album's mixing of Gaelic traditions with \\"skittering\\" electronic beats.\\" The Times felt the album was dominated by its Scottish and Islamic music elements. Bennett plays a doudouk on \\"Ud the Doudouk\\" Bennett plays all the instruments on the album, with instruments as eclectic as the flute and violin, the Turkish oud and dudek and numerous electronic and programming devices. As with Glen Lyon (2002), Bothy Culture is one of Bennett's more studio-based albums. Permeating throughout is a \\"flat\\" synth sound that is often minimised by the bagpipes, violin, unusual vocal snippets, samples and \\"other electronic curiosities.\\" The large amount of percussive breakbeats, as is common with contemporary dance music, augment Bannett's pipe and fiddle playing throughout, though the electronic beats are mostly unobtrusive, allowing the fiddles and pipes more room to permeate. Other electronic sounds on the album include ambient textures like in that of contemporary electronica, including modem-style squeals and micro-processed winds. Described by Bennett as \\"a party tune with a pile of twaddle over the top,\\" the opening \\"Tongues of Kali\\" is an upbeat number flavoured by Punjabi music, and contains funky grooves, bagpipes, sitar and \\"DJ tinged mayhem.\\" It starts with thick vocal gargling, keyboard work and percussion which journalist Scott Frampton compared to the sound of \\"someone whacking a caber tosser's thigh,\\" before the appearance of a house hi-hat rhythm and later a \\"sort of Gaelic scat.\\" Author Gary West compared the song's Eastern mouth music with the Gaelic styles of puirt à beul and canntaireachd. The second track, \\"Aye?,\\" features the word 'aye' muttered in numerous inflections; Kate Molleson of The Guardian called it \\"a stroke of deadpan brilliance, spoken word stripped back to a single redolent syllable. Bennett never overdid things.\\" \\"Sputnik in Glenshiel\\" is reminiscent of Stéphane Grappelli, and combines Celtic and Middle Eastern violin \\"rhapsodies.\\" The fourth track, \\"Hallaig,\\" features a sample of Gaelic poet Sorley MacLean reading his poem of the same name shortly before his death in 1996. The originally Gaelic language poem is named for the deserted township on Raasay, MacLean's birthplace, and reflects on the nature of time and the Highland Clearances' historical impact, leaving a desolated landscape. Mairi McFayden of Bella Caledonia felt it was \\"poetic that many of those lost lifelines from the diaspora have found their way back through music,\\" and called the track \\"quietly political in its beauty\\" and the album's \\"centrepiece.\\" The hypnotic \\"Ud the Doudouk\\" mixes melodies and Bennett's playing of the doudouk, a Middle Eastern woodwind instrument, with \\"techno club and Scottish folk beats\\". \\"4 Notes\\" is an ethnic-style techno track, while \\"Waltz for Hector\\" combines Bennett's traditional and modern playing styles, fusing Celtic and Mediterranean music elements atop a drum and bass rhythm, and finishes with Bennett playing the pibroch \\"Lament for Red Hector\\" on a lone bagpipe.  Release and reception Bothy Culture was released on 13 January 1998 by Rykodisc. A relative commercial success, the album topped the US college radio charts. On the CMJ New World chart, based on combined reports of reggae and world music airplay on American radio stations, Bothy Culture reached a peak of number 3. A music video for \\"Tongues of Kali\\" was directed by David Mackenzie and filmed at The Arches, Glasgow, in 1998. The music video was for many years unavailable, until The Martyn Bennett Trust uncovered the video and re-released it in January 2018 for the album's 20th anniversary. Although Bennett played all the instruments on Bothy Culture himself, he formed the band Cuillin when touring in promotion of the album, helping make the music sound \\"more organic\\" and helping to inject \\"even more energy\\" into his performances. In addition to Bennett, the band contained Deirdre Morrison (violin, vocals), Rory Pierce (Irish pipes, percussion and flutes) and Bennett's wife Kirsten (samples, backline and keys). The tour began in late 1997 at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut, Glasgow, and continued throughout 1998 in Europe, in which the group played their \\"heady mix of Scottish trad, club grooves and world beats.\\" Notable performances on the tour included a stint at T in the Park, and, after an official invitation from the Scotland national football team, a performance at the Buddha Bar in Paris ahead of the opening 1998 World Cup match between Scotland and Brazil, where Ewan McGregor, Sean Connery and Ally McCoist joined the band on stage to dance. Bothy Culture received positive critical reviews. Dave Sleger of AllMusic named it an \\"Album Pick\\", calling the album's mix of Punjabi, Scandinavian, Irish and Turkish cultures with rave, techno and hip- hop a \\"assiduous hybrid,\\" and concluding: \\"It's loud, it's unrelenting and it's insurgent.\\" Paul Verna of Billboard wrote that Bennett used his \\"native folk styles\\" as a \\"launching pad for a tastily idiosyncratic, ultramodern world music blend that ranks with the best of the progressives like Deep Forest or Wolfstone,\\" and called the album a \\"consistently entertaining set.\\" Scott Frampton of CMJ New Music Monthly felt that \\"Bothy Culture's filtering of traditional Highland sounds through urban modernity [is] more than equal to the sum of its parts.\\" Keith Witham of The Living Tradition wrote that Bennett was a rare a musician \\"who doesn't have to hide behind electronic gadgetry to cover a lack of technical proficiency. As a classically trained musician he really is a master of his chosen instruments.\\" Colin Irwin of The Independent reflected that Bothy Culture won Bennett many friends and marked him out as \\"a leading figure in the evolution of Scottish music,\\" calling the album a \\"storming mix of Gaelic tradition, raw emotion and glorious, full-blooded dance beats.\\" The album has been called \\"pioneering\\" by The Guardian, and \\"groundbreaking\\" by the BBC, and by The Scotsman. Readers of the Scotland on Sunday voted Bennett the winner of the 1998 Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Award for Music, while the album came close to earning a Mercury Music Prize nomination. In a retrospective review, Colin Larkin rated the album four stars out of five in The Encyclopedia of Popular Music and called it \\"hugely impressive album that encompassed Bennett's multicultural approach to modern music.\\" Neil McFayden of Folk Radio UK wrote in 2018 that \\"Bothy Culture still sounds as fresh and exciting as it did on the day of its release.\\" Bothy Culture and Beyond The SSE Hydro, where Bothy Culture and Beyond was performed. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Bothy Culture, and the 25th anniversary of the Celtic Connections festival, arranger and conductor Greg Lawson's GRIT Orchestra, named after Bennett's final album Grit (2003) and containing some 100 traditional folk, classical and jazz musicians, performed the show Bothy Culture and Beyond at the SSE Hydro, Glasgow as part of the festival on 27 January 2018. The shows were billed as a \\"music-vision-dance- bike spectacular,\\" and feature Lawson's rearrangements of the tracks from the album, as well as visual spectacles, including internationally famous Scottish stunt cyclist Danny MacAskill, whose appearance was inspired by the film The Ridge (2014), in which MacAskill performed a stunt to the soundtrack of Bennett's \\"Blackbird\\". The show was Lawson and the GRIT Orchestra's second tribute to a Bennett album, following their Celtic Connections tribute to his final album Grit in 2015, although the orchestra was even bigger for Bothy Culture and Beyond, adding a backline of Scottish fiddlers including Duncan Chisholm, Chris Stout and Aidan O'Rourke. Lawson was a friend of Bennett, and when asked why he chose to perform Bothy Culture, he said: The bulk of the music was the result of two separate string sections, with numerous Scottish fiddlers leading the traditional melodies in one string section while accompanying soundscapes were provided by classical violins, double bass and cellos in the other. The voice of \\"Aye?\\" was provided by Innes Watson of the Treacherous Orchestra. David Hayman read Sorley MacLean's English translation of \\"Hallaig,\\" while in a break from the album, Fiano Hunter and the Glasgow Chapel Choir recreated the Grit song \\"Blackbird\\", accompanied by Danny MacAskill's stunt cycle work. \\"Shputnik in Glenshiel\\" was accompanied by whistle from Fraser Fifeld, while “Ud the Doudouk” featured punches of brass, Innes’ spirited chants and a \\"perfectly-timed finish.\\" Meanwhile, the “impossibly whacky” intro for \\"Joik\\" was translated to strings, brass and percussion, unifying the folk and classical string sections. \\"Waltz for Hector\\" was heralded in by drum beats and soft whistles and featured a percussion section from James MacKintosh capturing the song's complex beats. The show was critically acclaimed from the likes of The Scotsman (\\"an epic arrangement of another Bennett album\\"), the BBC, The Times (\\"the effect can be like standing in the actual landscape famously captured by a master in oils\\"), The Guardian, who called the show a \\"multimedia celebration\\" and \\"a weird fusion of the deep-rooted and brazenly off-kilter\\", and Folk Radio UK, who said the show \\"brought Martyn’s incredible music back to a live audience and proved just how complex his ideas, how inclusive his influences and wide- ranging his imagination really were.\\" Bella Caledonia said: \\"If the original live show GRIT was about a celebration of lost voices – of remembrance – then this year’s event was an unapologetic and euphoric celebration of Bennett’s life, energy and vision. Bothy Culture is dance music first. Everyone was as high as a kite,\\" while McFayden of Folk Radio UK said: \\"As Greg Lawson said on the night – this was one man’s music, and it took this immense event to bring that music back to the stage. This week is the 13th anniversary of Martyn’s passing, and the music he was making 20 years ago continues to inspire today’s musicians. That's always worth remembering.\\" Track listing # \\"Tongues Of Kali\\" (7:07) # \\"Aye?\\" (6:22) # \\"Shputnik In Glenshiel\\" (5:50) # \\"Hallaig\\" (8:19) # \\"Ud The Doudouk\\" (5:44) # \\"4 Notes\\" (5:55) # \\"Joik\\" (3:26) # \\"Yer Man From Athlone\\" (6:25) # \\"Waltz For Hector\\" (9:20) Personnel *Martyn Bennett – instruments, production References External links * Category:Martyn Bennett albums Category:1998 albums Category:Rykodisc albums Category:Worldbeat albums Category:World music albums by Scottish artists Category:Dance music albums by Scottish artists ","title":"Bothy Culture"},{"id":"11871562","text":"Dharanindravarman I () was a king of the Khmer Empire, reigning from 1107 AD to 1113 AD.

Design and development First flown in 1935, it was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of wooden construction, with tandem open cockpits and fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The aircraft proved popular with Czechoslovakia's aeroclubs and was successful in international competitions. In 1937, the designers created a modernised version, the Be-51, which featured a reduced wingspan and fully enclosed cockpits. A final variant, the Be-52 Beta-Major retained the Be-50's open cockpits but featured improved aerodynamics and a more powerful Walter Major engine.

He was the son of Pierre-Tristan, Seigneur de Clermont et de Clermont-Lodève and Vicomte de Nébouzan, and Catherine d'Amboise. His father was a member of the Order of Saint Michael. François' grandmother had been heiress of Dieudonné Guillaume de Clermont. Aubery III, p. 82. He had an elder brother, Pierre de Castelnau, who was heir to the family estates. François was also the nephew of Cardinal Georges d'Amboise (1498-1510), who was largely responsible for François' swift rise to prominence in the Church. Cardinal d'Amboise had been Archbishop of Narbonne from 1491 to 1494.Gulik and Eubel, p. 6, no. 25; and p. 199. Education and early career Francois de Castelnau was appointed Major Archdeacon of the Church of Narbonne, before 1501, when he was appointed to the diocese of Saint-Pons. He already was Bachelor in Theology. He was appointed Administrator of the diocese of Saint- Pons-de-Thomières on 17 November 1501,Eubel II, p. 218. He was also an Apostolic Notary at the time of his appointment. for which he required a papal dispensation since he was only twenty-one years old (1502, 1511–14 and 1534–39).Saint Marthe, Gallia christiana VI, p. 109. He was elected Archbishop of Narbonne by the Cathedral Chapter on 4 June 1502, an act which was approved by Pope Alexander VI on 22 June 1502. The Pope dispensed François from the age defect, and allowed him to retain the benefices which he had already accumulated.Eubel II, p. 199. He was already a Canon and Prebend in the Church of Albi, Provost of Belle-monte, and he held two other priories. On 6 December 1502 he was also granted the Priory of Nôtre-Dame de Parco.Saint Marthe, Gallia christiana VI, p. 109. Cardinal On 23 November 1503 he made his first formal entry into the City of Rome, just in time for the Coronation of the new pope. He was created Cardinal by Pope Julius II on 29 November 1503, three days after his Coronation. On 6 December he was appointed Cardinal Deacon of S. Adriano. He held the diocese of Narbonne until he was appointed Archbishop of Auch on 4 July 1507.Gulik and Eubel, p. 125. He was named Bishop of Senez in 1508, upon the resignation of Cardinal Nicholas Fieschi, who held the bishopric as Administrator. Cardinal de Castelnau resigned the See in 1509. His successor, Bishop Jean Baptiste de Laigne d'Oraison was confirmed on 19 September 1509.Gulik and Eubel, p. 297. Considering the terms on which his predecessor held the diocese, and the brevity of his own service, Castelnau may have been only the Administrator. He is not listed as bishop in Gallia christiana III, p. 1260-1261. Cardinal de Castelnau served as Ambassador of King Louis XII of France to Pope Julius II beginning in 1507. On 2 May 1509, the Cardinal was elevated to the rank of Cardinal Priest and assigned the titulus of San Stefano al Monte Celio.Gulik and Eubel, p. 70. Unfortunately, his diplomatic skills were insufficient to deal with the volcanic temper of Pope Julius II. During the War of the League of Cambrai he was too forthcoming in his exchanges with the Pope on behalf of France and its King, and on 29 June 1510, when he demanded his passport, the Pope, in a fit of anger by no means becoming his high office, sent Cardinal de Castelnau instead to detention in the Castel S. Angelo.Aubery, III, p. 85. On the petition of the College of Cardinals he was released from the Castel S. Angelo, but was kept under arrest in the Vatican Palace, but the Pope indicated that he would not be released until the prelates who had been taken prisoner in the capture of Bologna by Louis XII were released. Shortly thereafter, after swearing not to adhere to the Conciliabulum of Pisa, he was given his passport and allowed to return to France. Church of Celestines, Avignon Cardinal de Castelnau was again appointed Administrator of the diocese of Saint-Pons-de-Thomières on 9 July 1511, and exercised that function until 28 July 1514, when Cardinal Alessandro Farnese was appointed.Gulik and Eubel, p. 277. Cardinal de Castelnau was Legate in Avignon 1513-1541.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana I, p. 843. He was Bishop of Valence from 11 January 1523 to 1531;He had a suffragan bishop, one Charles, titular Bishop of Caria in Turkey, who actually carried out the episcopal functions: Gulik and Eubel, pp. 153 and 343. his successor Antoine de Vasc was appointed on 10 May 1531, in an exchange of dioceses of Valence and Agde. Cardinal de Castelnau therefore became Bishop of Agde on 10 May 1531, and held the post until his death.Gulik and Eubel, pp. 97 and 326. B. Hauréau, Gallia christiana XVI (Paris 1856), p. 332. Conclave of 1523 François Guillaume de Castelnau participated in the Papal conclave, 1523. Despite his youth (he was forty-three), he was the senior Cardinal priest at the Conclave. He and two French colleagues, Louis de Bourbon de Vendome and Jean de Lorraine, arrived thirty-six days late, on November 6, 1523, missing in addition the nine days of mourning for Adrian VI (Novendiales), and, more importantly, the political discussions that took place during that critical time and the forming of various alliances.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1523. Retrieved: 2016-05-25. The Cardinals who were present, however, were in no hurry. Although the Conclave began on 1 October, they did not complete their Electoral Capitulations until October 5.\\"Convenzioni fatto e giurato dei Cardinali nel conclave di papa Clemente VII,\\" Giornale Storico degli Archivi Toscani Anno 1858 No. 2. Aprile-Giugno, pp. 107-117, in Voting finally began on 8 October, though during the first two weeks there were only eight Scrutinies. By 25 October voting positions had frozen, and, though votes continued to be taken, there were repeatedly the same results. On 12 November a delegation of Roman gentlemen appeared at the gate of the Conclave and exhorted the Cardinals to get on with their business and elect a pope. On the night of the 17/18 November, the deadlock finally broke, when Cardinal de'Medici threatened to nominate Cardinal Pompeo Colonna's worst enemy, Cardinal Franciotto Orsini. Rather than see that happen, Colonna and his followers joined the faction of Cardinal de'Medici and elected him pope. He chose the name Clement VII, and was crowned at the Vatican Basilica on 26 November 1523.F. Petruccelli della Gattina, Histoire diplomatique des conclaves Volume I (Paris: 1864), pp. 531-557. The new Pope named Cardinal de Castenal bishop of Frascati in December 1523, the vacancy having been created by the promotion of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese to the Bishopric of Palestrina.Gulik and Eubel, p. 58. Being the senior cardinal- priest, Cardinal de Castelnau had the first option on the office. In 1534 François Guillaume de Castelnau was named the first Abbot Commendatory (the thirty-ninth Abbot) of Saint-Aphrodise in the diocese of Béziers by King Francis I.Fisquet, La France pontificale: Montpellier II, p. 236 From the death of Cardinal Giovanni Piccolomini in 1537 until his own death in March 1541, François Guillaume de Castelnau de Clermont-Lodève was Dean of the College of Cardinals. It must be noted that he was still Bishop of Palestrina, not Bishop of Ostia. The Deanship and the Bishopric of Ostia did not become associated with one another until the reign of Pope Paul IV.Bullarum Diplomatum et Privilegiorum sanctorum Romanorum Pontificum Taurinensis editio. Tomus sextus (Turin 1860), pp. 502-504, no. VI \\"Cum venerabiles\\" (22 August 1555). Cardinal François Guillaume de Castelnau-Clermont-Lodève died in Avignon, where he was an Apostolic Legate in March 1541, perhaps on the 13th. He was interred in the Church of the Celestines.Aubery III, p. 86.

Director was the primary editor on the Adobe Shockwave platform, which dominated the interactive multimedia product space during the 1990s. Various graphic adventure games were developed with Director during the 1990s, including The Journeyman Project, Total Distortion, Eastern Mind: The Lost Souls of Tong Nou, Mia's Language Adventure, Mia's Science Adventure, and the Didi & Ditto series. Hundreds of free online video games were developed using Lingo, and published on websites such as Miniclip and Shockwave.com. Director published DCR files that were played using the Adobe Shockwave Player, in addition to compiling native executables for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Director allowed users to build applications on a movie metaphor, with the user as the \\"director\\" of the movie. Originally designed for creating animation sequences, the addition of a scripting language called Lingo made it a popular choice for creating CD-ROMs, standalone kiosks and internet video games content during the 1990s. As of 2015, Adobe Flash and Adobe AIR are preferred alternatives to Shockwave, with its 3D rendering capabilities, object-oriented programming language, and capacity to run as a native executable on multiple platforms.Adobe Director 11 review , Page 2, KEVIN PARTNER, 1 May 2008, PCPro Magazine, \\"Adobe's AIR technology makes it possible to deploy Flash as a desktop application\\" On January 27, 2017, Adobe announced that it was discontinuing Director. Sales of Director ceased on February 1, 2017; ongoing updates and support for the software ended on March 14, 2017.  Features  Director applications are authored on a timeline, similar to Adobe Flash. Director supports graphical primitives and playback controls such as video players, 3D content players, and Flash players. Director includes a scripting language called Lingo, and plug-in applications called Xtras, which are similar in functionality and design to ActiveX. Director supports a graphical user interface framework with basic controls and allows interaction with external files and certain Windows APIs. Director has been used to create applications, 2D and 3D video games, self-running kiosks, and CDs and DVD launchers. Director supports many different images, audio, and video formats. =Lingo= Director includes a scripting language called Lingo, and a suite of 2D image manipulation tools referred to as \\"imaging Lingo\\". This subset of Lingo allows authors to perform advanced operations such as to bitblit. While a vast majority of users rely on the score timeline for the development of their work, a number of expert developers create stunning projects, such as games, that take advantage of the speed of imaging Lingo. These advanced projects typically use only 1 frame on the score timeline using Lingo to control animation and interaction. Director 8.5 added the ability to import, manipulate, and display 3D objects. The 3D features were quite advanced for the time, unusual for an authoring environment. The 3D capability includes the ability to create geometry on the fly from code, hardware accelerated model display, and advanced lighting features. It also supports vector graphics and 3D interactivity through a Shockwave 3D file object. Since Version 6, Director has supported the import of Flash animation files and Lingo can be used to interact with Flash's Actionscript code for more control. =Xtras= One of the most powerful aspects of Director is its extensibility, which is achieved through plug-in applications named Xtras. For example, there are Xtras for OS desktop manipulations (creating folders, files, icons, shortcuts, registry editing) and Shell control, dedicated text processing (RegX), PDF readers, and many more. With Xtras, Director can be extended to support additional media types beyond those that the stock version of the software allows. These can be created by users or purchased from third party vendors. They are created using Adobe Director's XDK (Xtra Development Kit), a C++ SDK. With the change in new versions of Director, Xtra developers need to modify their products to maintain ongoing support. With changing industry trends, many third-party Xtra developers have discontinued products and dropped support due to the cost of development without a significant return. =Publishing= For online distribution, the Director can publish projects for embedding in websites using the Shockwave plugin. Shockwave files have a .dcr file extension. Other publishing options include a stand-alone executable file called projectors, supported on Macintosh and Windows operating systems, and with Director 12, output for iOS. Early versions also supported execution of the 3DO console. The Director score timeline can also be exported as a non-interactive video format, such as a QuickTime or sequence of images.  Comparison with Flash  The differences between Director and Flash have been the subject of much discussion, especially in the Director development community. Extensibility is one of the main differences between the two, as are some of the sundry codecs that can be imported. Director has tended to be the larger of the two, but that footprint has been part of its weakness. This weakness manifested into the erosion of Director's ubiquity as the leader of authoring tools, especially in the critical window of 1998 - 2000. The download footprint of the Director Shockwave plugin was significantly larger than the Shockwave Flash download footprint. Additionally, Macromedia partnered with distributors such as Dell, Apple, etc. to have the Flash plugin pre-installed on machines for users, so that they would not be prompted to install any additional software. At that point in time (1998–2000), broadband internet access was not the norm for most users, and the fivefold difference in size was significant. History Director started out as MacroMind \\"VideoWorks\\", an application for the original Macintosh. Animations were initially limited to the black and white of early Macintosh screens.

Name The planet and its host star are one of the planetary systems selected by the International Astronomical Union as part of their public process for giving proper names to exoplanets and their host star (where no proper name already exists). The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were Ægir for the planet (pronounced [Latinized] or [an approximation of the Old Norse]) and Ran for the star. James Ott, age 14, submitted the names for the IAU contest and won.  Discovery  The planet's existence was suspected by a Canadian team led by Bruce Campbell and Gordon Walker in the early 1990s, but their observations were not definitive enough to make a solid discovery. Its formal discovery was announced on August 7, 2000 by a team led by Artie Hatzes. The discoverers gave its mass as 1.2 ± 0.33 times that of Jupiter, with a mean distance of 3.4 AU from the star. Observers, including Geoffrey Marcy, suggested that more information on the star's Doppler noise behaviour created by its large and varying magnetic field was needed before the planet could be confirmed. In 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope made Astrometric measurements and confirmed the existence of the planet. These observations indicated that the planet has a mass 1.5 times that of Jupiter and shares the same plane as the outer dust disk observed around the star. The derived orbit from these measurements is eccentric: either 0.25 or 0.7. Meanwhile, the Spitzer Space Telescope detected an asteroid belt at roughly 3 AU from the star. In 2009 Brogi's team claimed that the proposed planet's eccentricity and this belt were inconsistent: the planet would pass through the asteroid belt and rapidly clear it of material. The planet and the inner belt may be reconciled if that belt's material had migrated in from the outer comet belt (also known to exist). Astronomers are still collecting and analysing radial velocity data, while also trying to refine existing upper limits from direct imaging, on Epsilon Eridani b and this has led to a recently published paper, as of January 2019, claiming that the planet's orbital eccentricity is an order of magnitude smaller than early estimates, at around 0.07, and consistent with a circular orbit, very similar to Jupiter's orbital eccentricity of 0.05. The updated measurements, amongst other things, also included new estimates for the mass and inclination of the planet, at 0.78 times the mass of Jupiter and an inclination of around 89 degrees. However, if the planet is later determined to be orbiting at the same inclination as the debris disc, that of 34 degrees, then its mass would be greater, at 1.19 times that of Jupiter.

The section throughout the entire route in Arizona is also known as the Purple Heart Trail to honor those wounded in combat who have received the Purple Heart. It enters Arizona from the west at a crossing of the Colorado River southwest of Kingman. It travels eastward across the northern portion of the state connecting the cities of Kingman, Ash Fork, Williams, Flagstaff, Winslow, and Holbrook. I-40 continues into New Mexico, heading to Albuquerque. The highway has major junctions with U.S. Route 93 (US 93) — the main highway connecting Phoenix and Las Vegas, Nevada — in Kingman and again approximately to the east and Interstate 17 — the freeway linking Phoenix to northern Arizona — in Flagstaff. For the majority of its routing through Arizona, I-40 follows the historic alignment of U.S. Route 66. The lone exception is a stretch between Kingman and Ash Fork where US 66 took a more northerly, less direct route that is now State Route 66. Construction of I-40 was ongoing in the 1960s and 1970s and reached completion in 1984. With the completion of I-40 in 1984, the entire routing of US 66 had been bypassed by Interstate Highways which led to its decertification a year later in 1985. Route description =California to Flagstaff= I-17 junction and exit 195 in Arizona I-40 enters Arizona from California at a bridge that crosses the Colorado River at Topock in Mohave County. It heads east from Topock and begins to curve towards the north at Franconia, completing the curve at Yucca. The interstate continues to head north until it reaches Kingman. In this city, I-40 has a junction with US 93 at exit 48. US 93 heads towards the northwest from this interchange to Hoover Dam and Las Vegas. US 93 south begins to run concurrently with I-40 east as they both swing eastward through Kingman. The two later separate at exit 71, as US 93 heads towards the south towards Phoenix while I-40 continues east toward Flagstaff. Along the way, I-40 passes through the town of Seligman, then at Ash Fork it meets State Route 89, the former U.S. Highway that heads south to Prescott. Next, it passes through Williams, where it has an interchange with SR 64 (exit 165), which heads north towards Grand Canyon National Park. I-40 continues to the east to Flagstaff, where it has a major junction with I-17 at exit 195. I-17 heads south from this interchange to Phoenix. =Flagstaff to New Mexico= East of Flagstaff, I-40 heads towards the east-southeast direction as it goes through the town of Winslow. It continues towards this direction until it reaches Holbrook, where it curves towards the northeast. Along this stretch, it passes through Petrified Forest National Park and continues to the northeast, passing through Chambers, and enters the Navajo Nation. The highway still continues to the northeast to the New Mexico border southwest of Gallup, New Mexico as it continues on towards Albuquerque. History With the exception of a stretch between Kingman and Flagstaff, I-40 directly replaced the famed US 66 across northern Arizona. Where possible, US 66 was upgraded to Interstate standards to become I-40 directly. Exceptions to this were through the central business districts of the cities and towns that US 66 passed through, and I-40 had to be built as a bypass outside the cities. On October 26, 1984, after the last section of I-40 was completed in Williams, US 66 was removed from the state highway system of Arizona. The portions through cities that did not overlap I-40 would become business loops of I-40. =Before the U.S. Highways= The routing of a road near the current corridor of I-40 in Arizona was first surveyed and built between 1857 and 1859. Lt. Edward Beale and his soldiers built the road along the 35th parallel that would come to be known as the Beale Wagon Road from Fort Smith, Arkansas to the Colorado River to serve as a military wagon road. The road was a popular route for immigrants during the 1860s and 1870s until the transcontinental railroad was built across northern Arizona in the 1880s. In the early 1900s, the road became part of the National Old Trails Road, a transcontinental route from Baltimore, Maryland to California, and the National Park to Park Highway, an auto trail linking the national parks of the west. =U.S. Route 66= In the 1920s, as a nationwide system of highways called the United States Numbered Highways was being developed, the route through was given the designation of U.S. Route 60. This designation was controversial since designations that are multiples of 10 are assigned to transcontinental east-west routes and this route was a diagonal route from Chicago to Los Angeles. As a compromise to states east of Chicago that felt US 60 should go through their state, a different route was given the number 60, while the route from Chicago to Los Angeles was given the number 66. I-40 westbound heading towards Flagstaff By 1927, the routing of US 66 through Arizona had been laid out, but none of it had been paved yet. By 1935, nearly the entire route had been paved, with the lone exceptions being a short stretch northeast of Valentine and a stretch between Peach Springs and Seligman. By 1938, the entire route in Arizona had been paved. In 1953, US 66 was realigned between the California border and Kingman to an alignment to the southeast to avoid the mountain curves and grades of the original alignment. By 1961, several sections of the highway had been expanded to a four-lane divided highway in anticipation of the coming Interstate Highway. Four-lane sections included a section near Ash Fork, another section east of Winslow and a section east of Holbrook near the Petrified Forest National Monument. =Planning= In Flagstaff, several different alternatives were considered as a potential routing of the new Interstate through the area. The alternatives consisted of a routing north of downtown, south of downtown, through downtown along the Santa Fe Railroad right-of-way near the alignment of US 66, and a more elaborate alternative of a routing above downtown on a long overpass. In January 1959, the Flagstaff Chamber of Commerce recommended to the Bureau of Public Roads that the route south of downtown be used which was approved by the Flagstaff City Council and the Board of Supervisors for Coconino County. This recommendation was accepted and would become the planned routing of I-40 in Flagstaff. Business owners along US 66 were opposed to this routing as it would draw motorists away from main through route of the time, US 66. As a result, they created the No By-Pass Committee and sent a proposal to the Chamber of Commerce’s Roads and Highways Committee to conduct a study of the feasibility of a route for I-40 through downtown along the Santa Fe railroad right-of-way. The Committee sent an inquiry to the railroad concerning the proposal. The railroad rejected the proposed rerouting of their main rail lines citing that it would result in worse grades than what currently exists and in order to reduce those grades, considerable lengthening of the rail line would be required. With a routing through town now out of the question, the business owners along US 66 drafted a city ordinance, known as Initiative 200, that was filed with the city of Flagstaff in November 1959 to appear on the general election ballot in March 1960. The ordinance would in effect ban all new commercial businesses on I-40, all routes leading from I-40 to US 66, and the area between I-40 and US 66. In a record voter turnout, voters overwhelmingly voted against the ordinance by a vote of 2,280 to 556. In 1965, the routing of I-40 west of Kingman was being reconsidered from the planned route through Needles, California to a route to the north passing through Searchlight in southern Nevada and connecting with I-15 further north of its present connection with I-15. The rationale for the proposal was that it would be an overall shorter route and would cost much less to construct. The proposal was met with stiff opposition including all four U.S. senators from California and Arizona sending the Secretary of Commerce letters requesting that the routing through Needles be retained. This proposal was eventually abandoned in 1966 and the routing through Needles was kept. =Construction= I-40 near the New Mexico border The construction of the route of I-40 across Arizona took nearly 25 years to complete with the last segment being completed in 1984, much longer than the ambitious goal of finishing by 1972. By the end of 1960, had been completed with an additional being worked on. In 1964, construction was still on schedule with complete and an additional under construction. Funding was becoming an issue at this time as the state lacked the available funds to stay on pace with a 1972 completion goal. By 1967, Arizona had completed almost half of the highway with complete and another under construction. In 1968, the bypass around Flagstaff was complete with three interchanges, two at each end of where US 66 split off from I-40 to enter the city and one at the I-17 interchange. An additional interchange at Butler Avenue was completed a year later. One of the big improvements of I-40 over US 66 was the construction of the segment between Kingman and Ash Fork. The section is a more direct route between the two cities and travels as far as south of the US 66 alignment, bypassing Hackberry and Peach Springs and creating ghost towns. Construction of the $69.1 million segment was also to be a much safer route as the US 66 alignment had one of the highest fatality rates of any section of highway in Arizona. This section of the Interstate was complete in 1978. Construction of the $7.7 million bypass around Winslow began in 1977. I-40 was completed in Arizona in 1984, with the completion of a section in Williams. This was also the last section of US 66 to be bypassed by the Interstate, which led to it being decertified by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) the following year.

She was of the VC2-S-AP5 Victory ship design type and named after Pickaway County, Ohio. Construction Pickaway was laid down 1 September 1944, under Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MCV hull 570, by Permanente Metals Corporation, Yard No. 2, Richmond, California; launched on 5 November 1944; sponsored by Mrs. William D. Schoning; converted into an APA; acquired by the Navy and commissioned on 12 December 1944, Commander Harry L. Bixby in command. Service history =World War II= After shakedown and amphibious exercises at Coronado Beach, California, Pickaway embarked some 1,500US Army troops at Seattle, Washington, departed on 9 February, arrived Pearl Harbor on 16 February, disembarked the troops and headed for Iwo Jima to evacuate Marine forces who were finishing off the remaining Japanese forces on the island. Pickaway reached Iwo Jima on 14 March, received on board the 24th Marine Regiment, sailed on 20 March, and returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 April. Pickaway participated in amphibious exercises until sailing for Guam on 4 May, with military passengers. Arriving Guam on 17 May, she embarked soldiers, sailors, and Marines; departed Apra Harbor on 22 May; and arrived San Francisco on 7 June. On 2 July she took on board Navy and US Coast Guard passengers and departed San Francisco for Noumea, New Caledonia. Following disembarking of personnel in Noumea on 8 July, Pickaway steamed to Espiritu Santo, the Russell Islands, and Guadalcanal to pick up passengers and sailed on 23 July, for San Francisco where she arrived on 6 August. While preparing for another transpacific voyage, the ship learned of the end of hostilities. During the remainder of 1945, Pickaway shuttled back and forth across the Pacific embarking passengers at bases in the western Pacific and returning them to the United States. Remaining in the Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, Pickaway visited both Japan and China in 1947 and participated in Operation Sandstone, the second atomic test in the Pacific, early in 1948. =Korean War= In the summer of 1950, a month after the North Korean forces marched against South Korea, Pickaway began shuttling US Army troops from Japan to Pusan to stem the tide of battle. On 15 September 1950, she saw her first real amphibious invasion at Inchon, when the United Nations (UN) forces flanked the North Koreans. During the Korean War, Pickaway was deployed to the Korean area four times. She landed troops on most of the major Korean beachheads. In March 1955, Pickaway left Korea for the last time, carrying troops of the same brigade she transported to Korea on her first trip. During 1957 and 1958, Pickaway made regular deployments to WestPac. During Pickaways 1958 WestPac tour, she took part in \\"Exercise Blue Star\\", which was the largest amphibious exercise conducted by Pacific Fleet forces since World War II. =Vietnam= After returning from the Far East in August 1963, Pickaway entered the Willamette Iron and Steel Works shipyard at Richmond, California, for Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM). In January 1964, the ship began extensive underway and amphibious training, and in March, departed San Diego for Hawaii, and large scale amphibious \\"Operation Westwind\\". On 18 June, she got underway from San Diego for a six-month cruise to the western Pacific. Soon after arriving in Yokosuka, she was ordered to proceed at once to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, to embark a Marine Battalion for transport to Vietnam to help build up American forces after the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. In March 1965, she participated in the US Pacific Fleet Exercise \\"Silver Lance\\". On 24 May 1965, she again bolstered the Allied military effort in Vietnam. On 7 July 1965, together with other elements of Amphibious Squadron 3, Pickaway landed the 2nd Battalion of the 9th Marine Regiment over the beaches of Da Nang, South Vietnam. During 1966 she participated in Operations \\"Jackstay\\", \\"Osage\\", \\"Deckhouse I\\", \\"Nathan Hale\\", \\"Deck House II\\", and \\"Hastings\\". After overhaul and training out of San Diego, Pickaway departed San Diego on 31 May, for the western Pacific and after offloading cargo at Da Nang, proceeded to Manila for participation in the SEATO training exercise \\"Sea Dog.\\" On 19 October Pickaway replenished at sea in the Tonkin Gulf. Pickaway spent 1968 operating out of San Diego, California. Decommissioning She was decommissioned 30 January 1970, with delivery to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) 26 August 1970. Pickaway was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay Group, Benecia, California. She was struck from the Navy Vessel Register on 1 December 1976. Fate On 15 February 1980, A. L. Burbank & Co., received Pickaway along with , , and to trade with Moore McCormack Lines, Inc., for SS Mormaccape and SS Mormactrade. She was then sold to Carol Shipping & Trading Corporation, Liberia, who sold her to Kang Hua Enterprise, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, to be scrapped. She was withdrawn from the fleet 26 March 1980.

Early life Timothy Allen was born in Tonbridge, Kent, England, the second son of two school teachers. He attended The Judd School and took further education at Leeds University where he received a BSc in Zoology. Whilst at university, Allen undertook a three-month ecological research project in remote jungle on the Indonesian Island of Sulawesi during which an encounter with a reclusive forest dwelling tribe proved to be a pivotal point in his life.Leeds Alumni Magazine. Issue 09 Subsequently, after graduating from university he returned to Indonesia where he spent a further 3 years travelling and studying. It was during this time that he discovered his passion for photography. At the age of 27 he began a part-time diploma in photography in Hereford and for his first year project he joined an aid convoy to Mostar during the town's struggle to rebuild itself after the Yugoslav Wars. Career After returning from Bosnia, Allen was offered his first job as a freelance photographer working at The Sunday Telegraph in London. A year later, after commissions from all of the British broadsheet publications, he eventually settled into a six-year position at The Independent. A member of Axiom Photographic Agency from 2002 to 2011 his more recent work has revolved around indigenous peoples. It was a personal project in Bhutan, India and Nepal designed to escape the \\"rat race back home\\" that lead the BBC to commission him as part of the Human Planet team. In 2012 Allen signed with the International film production company Great Guns who currently represent him worldwide. In 2017 Allen was the subject of a documentary on Animal Planet titled Epic Animal Journeys in which a film crew followed him on a midwinter nomadic migration across the Yamal Peninsula in Siberia with a Nenets family.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BkCoVQF-Cs In 2020 Allen was on the winning team of notable Alumni from the University of Leeds who won the Christmas edition of the BBC's University Challenge programme. They were the first non-Oxbridge team ever achieve first place in the tournament. Human Planet In 2008, the BBC commissioned Allen to work on the documentary project Human Planet. This was the first time that the BBC had employed a dedicated photographer on a landmark series. He spent over a year and a half travelling with 4 teams, covering stories of human endeavour in over forty countries around the world. Using the newly released first generation of DSLR cameras with HD video capabilities, Allen shot content for the programme and its accompanying multimedia projects as well as imagery that was published in a best-selling BBC book, formed an exhibition and was used in the program's worldwide branding and publicity. He wrote a weekly blog for BBC Earth, documenting his work during Human Planet.  Timothy Allen Photography Scholarship Award (TAPSA)  In 2016 Allen created a photography scholarship award in conjunction with the Sharjah Government Media Bureau. Each year the scholarship is awarded to 5 photographers from around the world and includes a 10-day trip to the United Arab Emirates to work alongside Allen.

The lead ship of her class of only two vessels, she was named after counties in Maryland and Georgia, and was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Design and construction The two Talbot County class tank landing ships had a displacement of , a length of , a beam of , and a draft of . They were fitted with two Babcock & Wilcox boilers connected to two geared turbines; a Westinghouse in the forward engine room, and a General Electric in the after engine room. These were intended to provide a top speed of , although was a more realistic flank speed. The landing ships were capable of transporting 197 troops, and were equipped with three LCVPs and one LCPL. The ship's company was 190-strong, and consisted of about six or seven line officers, a supply officer, the Captain and Executive Officer, and about 115–125 enlisted men. Talbot County was initially armed with two single 5\\"/38 caliber guns, two twin 40 mm Bofors guns, and two single 20 mm Oerlikon guns. The 20 mm and 40 mm guns were removed prior to 1958. The ship was laid down as LST-1153 on 19 July 1945 at the Boston Navy Yard. She was launched on 24 April 1947 with Mrs. Lena Mickelson as sponsor, and commissioned on 3 September 1947. She was not named until 1955. The Talbot County and her sister-ship, , were the only steam-driven LST's ever commissioned into the United States Navy, and were considered experimental due to their propulsion and armament. Apparently the experiment was not a success because no other steam driven LST's were ever built and no others had 5-inch guns.  Service history  = 1947–1970 = LST-1153 reported to the Fleet Training Group at Norfolk to begin her shakedown cruise on 21 September. She returned to Boston on 24 October for a post-shakedown yard period and put to sea again on 15 November. Eleven days later, she arrived at her home port, Little Creek, Virginia. For the next nine years, as a unit of the Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet, the tank landing ship operated along the east coast of the United States from New England to Florida and in the Caribbean. On 1 July 1955, LST-1153 was named USS Talbot County (LST-1153). Talbot County deployed to the Mediterranean on 31 August 1959, using her bulk fuel tanks to carry more than 240,000 gallons of aviation gasoline to refuel the helicopters of the amphibious squadron attached to the Sixth Fleet. After making port calls in France, Italy, Greece, Malta, Gibraltar, Algeria, and Morocco, she returned to the United States on 13 February 1958. The ship was deployed with the Sixth Fleet again from April to August 1959 and from October 1960 to May 1961. The remainder of her time, until 1970, was spent in operations along the Atlantic seaboard, ranging from Key West, Florida, to Nova Scotia and various ports in the Caribbean. = Decommissioning and sale = Talbot County was decommissioned on 3 April 1970 and assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange, Texas. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 May 1973, Talbot County was sold for scrapping by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service one year later, on 1 May 1974.

NRBQ ceased performing in 2004, leading Adams to form the Terry Adams Rock and Roll Quartet in 2007. In March 2011, Adams announced that he was changing the name of the band to NRBQ. A new NRBQ CD, Keep This Love Goin', heralded the move. Adams was born in Louisville, Kentucky where he met fellow resident Steve Ferguson, a singer and guitarist who also became a charter member of NRBQ. His older brother Donn Adams has served the band in various support roles, including originally coining the NRBQ name, playing the trombone (as part of the \\"Whole Wheat Horn\\" section), and writing liner notes. Career While Adams spent his early musical years playing in various rock and R&B; groups in and around Louisville, he and Ferguson eventually arrived in Florida, where they met up with three other musicians (singer/bassist Joey Spampinato, drummer Tom Staley, and singer Frank Gadler) who joined them to launch NRBQ in 1967. The group relocated to the northeast, and a recording contract with Columbia Records followed soon thereafter. However, most of NRBQ's subsequent recorded works have been released on smaller, independent labels. Although the group has made personnel changes over the years, Adams has remained in the lineup throughout the band's history. The band worked almost constantly, either in the studio or on the road, from their formation until 2004, when the group went on a hiatus for several years, interrupted only by a few select concert dates. After NRBQ stopped performing, Adams continued to record and tour as a solo artist and with other musicians. 2006 saw the release of Louisville Sluggers, a collaboration with former bandmate Ferguson, and an accompanying tour. Aftwerward, Adams released Rhythm Spell and Holy Tweet,https://www.amazon.com/Holy-Tweet-Terry-Adams/dp/B001VLBDJY and began touring with his new group, the Terry Adams Rock & Roll Quartet,https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112172600 In a March 2011 letter to his fans on NRBQ.com, Adams revealed that in 2004 he had been diagnosed with stage 4 throat cancer, which was at the time of the letter in remission. In the same letter, Adams also announced the rebranding of his quartet as the new NRBQ. The band's members are Adams, Scott Ligon on guitar and vocals, Casey McDonough on bass and vocals, and John Perrin on drums. Adams has focused much of his career on playing, writing, and singing with NRBQ, but he has found time to devote to other projects, including the discovery and production of the musically untrained sisters comprising The Shaggs; live and recorded work with jazz composer Carla Bley's band in the 1970s; collaborations with spoken word artist David Greenberger; solo recordings and performances; a duet recording with alto saxophonist Marshall Allen (known for his long career with the Sun Ra Arkestra); and the recent performances and recordings described above.

ITV produced two versions, in 1976 and 2003. The 1976 version was the first in a series of six single television plays called \\"Red Letter Days\\" each of which showed the events in a single, special day in someone's life. The 2003 version was a remake which was partly rewritten by Rosenthal.Maureen Paton, \\"Back to the write stuff\\", The Times, 13 January 2003, p. 15.  Plot  The Ready When You Are, Mr McGill story is centred on the making of a film. A television actor-extra (Joe McGill) is finally given a line to say to camera. While filming, a collection of comical mishaps occur to create chaos on-set.  1976 version  In the 1976 adaptation Joe Black takes the lead role of Joe McGill. It aired on ITV on 11 January 1976. The story revolves around a British soldier and his relationship with a suspicious School Mistress, set in 1940. McGill's line is \\"I've never seen that young Lady in my life before, and I've lived here fifty years\\". Jack Shepherd plays the stressed director, and Mark Wing-Davey is his assistant. This version has been released on Region2 DVD by Network, both as part of the compilation Jack Rosenthal at ITV, and as part of Red Letter Day box-set.  2003 version  In the 2003 adaptation Tom Courtenay takes the lead role of Joe McGill. The story is centred on the making of a film starring Amanda Holden as a police officer and Bill Nighy as an increasingly frustrated director. McGill's line was, \\"I've never seen the young man in my life before, and I've worked here forty years.\\" =Television industry= Rosenthal said his rewrite had turned the drama into a criticism of Television executives, and argued that \\"the industry has gone crazy and it needs a new generation to change it into something better\\".

Early life and career Born in Rotherhithe, then an impoverished area of London with appalling housing conditions, Haines was the youngest child of a dock worker who died when he was 2. His mother, a cleaner at a hospital, brought up the family. He joined the Labour Party as a teenager. At 14, he became a copyboy on the Glasgow Bulletin, and then a lobby reporter at Westminster in 1950.David Seymour \\"Joe Haines (1928–)\\" in Greg Rosen (ed.)

Haines claims that Wilson's doctor Joseph Stone offered to murder Marcia Falkender, the head of Wilson's political office, after she attempted to blackmail Wilson over an affair they had twenty years earlier. The BBC, in an out-of-court settlement with Falkender, paid her £75,000 after these claims were repeated in The Lavender List, a drama documentary written by Francis Wheen and broadcast in 2006. Although Haines himself was not sued, as a libel action involving him as the source it is generally accepted that the BBC settled because the original claimant would not stand behind the story. The allegations relating to Stone were repeated in the BBC's documentary The Secret World of Whitehall (2011).Broadcast on 23 March 2011 Not long after Wilson's resignation as Prime Minister, Haines published a book The Politics of Power about his experience of British political life. Attention mainly concentrated on two chapters about Marcia Williams (now Falkender) and her influence. Haines claimed that Williams' troublesome presence had been the real cause of Wilson's resignation. What he wrote in the book contradicted Wilson's statement at the time of his resignation that when he came back to power in 1974, he had told the Queen that he would not continue after he had reached the age of 60. Some commentators, such as Brian Sedgemore, considered that The Politics of Power was an interesting account, but the chapters about Marcia Williams were the weakest in the book. In a 2010 interview, Haines claimed that in the aftermath of the February 1974 general election, Harold Wilson had planned to discredit Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe by exposing Thorpe's relationship with Norman Scott in the event of the Conservative government reaching an agreement with the Liberals that would have permitted it to remain in power. BBC Radio 4 Around the same time, Haines confirmed that he had turned down a peerage from Wilson in the 1976 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours in part, he claimed, because he did not wish to be awarded one in a list also consisting of Joe Kagan and Eric Miller, who were suspected of criminal activity at the time. Later career In 1976, he joined the Daily Mirror. At the time Robert Maxwell purchased Mirror Group Newspapers on 12 July 1984, Haines told a meeting of his colleagues that their new proprietor \\"is a crook and a liar – and I can prove it\\".\\"Say It Ain't So, Joe\\", The Spectator, 22 February 1992, p.15Roy Greenslade Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits From Propaganda, London: Pan, 2004 [2003], p.395 Appointed the Mirror Group's political editor shortly after Maxwell's purchase of the Group, he also became a non-executive director of the board, and from 1984 to 1990 he was the Mirror's assistant editor. In 1988, the authorised biography by Haines of Robert Maxwell was published. The Mirror's then owner had commissioned the work to pre-empt a biography by investigative journalist Tom Bower, which Maxwell unsuccessfully attempted to have withdrawn. Haines' biography was generally considered to be encomium and was treated with a mixture of ridicule and extreme criticism by the media at the time of its release – The Times referred to it as \\"notorious\\". According to Tom Bower, Haines' biography was so flattering Maxwell would give out copies instead of business cards.

In 1991, a few days after the death from HIV/AIDS of Queen's lead singer Freddie Mercury, the Daily Mirror ran a column authored by Haines.queenmania: This repulsive article, which... - random thoughts: queen, life, and everything In this column, Haines described the late bisexual singer as \\"sheer poison - a man bent - the apt word in the circumstances - on abnormal sexual pleasures\\", accused him of \\"touring the streets seeking rent boys to bugger and share drugs with\\" and called Mercury's \\"private life\\" a \\"revolting tale of depravity, lust and downright wickedness\\". In addition, after mentioning that AIDS' \\"main victims in the Western world are homosexuals\\", Haines went on to say that for Mercury's \\"kind\\", AIDS is \\"a form of suicide\\". The article – characterised by others as filled with \\"rabid homophobia\\" – prompted an open letter in condemnation from folk singer Lal Waterson, later recorded as a song by her sister Norma.

In the 1760s and 1770s, Sulayman Bal founded one of the earliest Fulani Jihad States. Inspired by the Jihads of Alfa Ibrahima Nuhu who led the Imamate of Futa Jallon from 1725, Sulayman Bal led a revolt in the Fulani Denyanke kingdom. Aimed at overthrowing the traditional aristocracy, the movement only succeeded after his death. In its place, a clerical oligarchy rose which quickly came into conflict with its neighbors. The Brakna Moors were repulsed after a long history of raids in Futa Toro, and non-Muslim states were invaded. Sulayman Bal was seceded by Abd al-Qādir who consolidated the Futa Toro state, created a military aristocracy, and became one of the first in a line of West African leaders to take the title almami. In 1796, Futa Toro was defeated during the battle of Bounghoy by the non-Muslim Cayor kingdom led by the Damel Amary Ngoné Ndella Fall, and Abd al-Qādir was killed in 1807, to be replaced by a less oligarchic council of clan leaders.

Von Gardner was born into a family of Scottish ancestry on the family estate near Sevastopol, Crimea. He graduated Orthodox Theology at the University of Belgrade, after that he worked for a while as teacher in the Seminary of Cetinje and later on he took monastic vows and was given the name Filipp. In 1931 he was ordained priest serving in the Eastern part of Slovakia, between 1934 and 1938 he was the head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem. After his return he served a few years as parish priest in Berlin before he was consecrated bishop for the Russian Orthodox Church in Exile (ROCOR) in June 1942. On this occasion he was given the title \\"Bishop of Potsdam\\" thus being mainly responsible for the Russian Orthodox parishes of Berlin and Vienna. Yet in 1944 he had to leave holy orders and married shortly after - the exact circumstances how all this happened are not quite clear. After World War II he installed himself in the Bavarian spa town Bad Reichenhall situated not far from the Austrian border and became also choirmaster in one of the Russian Orthodox parishes of Salzburg which at that time were made up of refugees. In 1954 he was invited to the University of Munich as a lecturer of musicology hereby dealing especially with traditional Russian Chant, finally in 1965 he earned a doctorate and was subsequently given a professorship. After 1917, he spent four years living in Subcarpathian Rus and was particularly amazed at the religious knowledge of the simple peasants, acquired simply by singing in church. He described the singing which he heard in the churches of the Carpathian regions: \\"In Subcarpathian Rus’ in all the villages both among the Uniates and also among the Orthodox, there was always practiced only congregational singing of the complete services.... The numerous chants ... were known by everyone, even the children of school age. The leader of song—the most experienced singer from the parish—standing at the kliros and sang the chant. As soon as the worshippers heard the beginning, they would join in the chant and the entire church sang; they sang all the stikhery, all the troparia, all the irmosy—in a word, everyone sang properly.\\" Johann von Gardner died at 26 February 1984 in Munich.

He is most notable for successfully challenging the Home Secretary's powers to set minimum terms for life sentence prisoners. On 25 November 2002, the Law Lords ruled in favour of Anderson's claim that it was incompatible with human rights for politicians to set minimum terms for life sentence prisoners, and the next day the European Court of Human Rights agreed with this decision, meaning that politicians in European countries can no longer decide the minimum length of imprisonment for anyone serving a life sentence. British politicians had already been stripped of their powers five years earlier to set minimum terms for prisoners aged under 18 after the High Court ruled that Michael Howard had acted unlawfully by deciding that the juvenile killers of toddler James Bulger should spend at least 15 years in custody. Anderson's successful challenge was a test case which affected approximately 225 convicted British murderers who had been given recommended minimum terms at their trial, only for the term to be increased by the Home Secretary at a later date. He had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1988 on two charges of murder. His first victim was Thomas Walker, aged 60, who died in September 1986 after being punched and kicked by Anderson during a burglary. Anderson's next victim was 35-year-old Michael Tierney, who died in May 1987, having also been killed by Anderson in a burglary. The trial judge sentenced Anderson to life imprisonment and recommended that he should serve a minimum of 15 years before being considered for parole, which would keep him in prison until at least 2003. Six years after Anderson's trial, Home Secretary Michael Howard increased Anderson's minimum term to 20 years, meaning that he would now have to wait until at least 2008 before release could be even considered. Anderson had tried to challenge the Home Secretary's tariff-setting powers earlier, but his first case in February 2001 failed.

Jackson, President of the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., Inc.,\\" circa 1980, box 3/folder 6. http://bmrcprocessingproject.uchicago.edu/finding_aids – August 1990) was an American pastor and the longest serving President of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s was highly controversial in many black churches, where the minister preached spiritual salvation rather than political activism. The National Baptist Convention became deeply split; Jackson had supported the Montgomery bus boycott of 1956, but by 1960 he told his denomination they should not become involved in civil rights activism. Jackson was based in Chicago and was a close ally of Mayor Richard J. Daley and the Chicago Democratic machine against the efforts of Martin Luther King, Jr.. In the end, Jackson prevailed. Yet, surprisingly, it was a former son of Olivet [pastored by J. H. Jackson] L. Venchael Booth, whom Jackson would later install as pastor of First Baptist Church of Gary in September 1944, who issued the founding call for what became a rival group, Progressive National Baptist Convention. The PNBC became the \\"household of the civil rights movement among Black Baptists,\\" and the frontline supporters of the extensive activism of the King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference.William D. Booth, A Call To Greatness: The Story of the Founding of the Progressive National Baptist Convention (2001) pp.19-21.Patrick Allitt, Religion in America since 1945: A History (2003) p 51 Jackson's vocal stance for \\"civil rights through law and order\\" went in direct opposition to the methods of civil disobedience advocated by King. Life and ministry =Early life and education= Jackson grew up on a farm near Rudyard, Mississippi where he taught himself spelling, reading, and arithmetic while working in the pasture and completing chores. He began preaching at a young age in the rural Coahoma and Bolivar Counties in Mississippi.Rev. J.H. Jackson papers (Chicago History Museum)\\"Biographical Sketch of J.H. Jackson, President of the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., Inc.,\\" circa 1980, box 1/folder 1.http://bmrcprocessingproject.uchicago.edu/finding_aids He pursued a bachelor's degree from Jackson College, which later became Jackson State University. He went on to receive a bachelor of divinity from Colgate- Rochester Divinity School and a master's of education from Creighton University. He also completed advanced masters work in theology at the University of Chicago. Jackson received honorary degrees from Wilberforce University, the College of Monrovia, and Jackson State University. =Pastoral ministry= Jackson was the minister of Bethel Baptist Church in Omaha, Nebraska, and elected president of the Nebraska Baptist State Association. From 1934-1941, Jackson was the minister of Monumental Baptist Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1941, Jackson was called to pastor the historic Olivet Baptist Church on Chicago's South Side, where he served until his death in 1990. During his close to fifty year leadership at Olivet Baptist Church the membership in the congregation grew from approximately 10,000 to more than 20,000.[2] During Jackson's role as pastor, he was involved in ecumenism. In 1937 and 1948 Jackson attended the planning conferences to establish the World Council of Churches, making him a charter member of the Council. During his service as pastor of Olivet Baptist Church, Jackson remained involved in his denomination through maintaining presidency of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. (NBC) for twenty-nine years. He also remained politically active on the local, state, and national levels.Olivet Baptist Church History In addition to his ministry and involvement with the NBC, Jackson traveled throughout the world on numerous religious missions, served as vice president of the Baptist World Alliance, and was a member of the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches. =National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. (NBC)= From 1935 to 1941, Jackson was secretary of the Foreign Mission Board of the NBC. Following the retirement of D. V. Jemison from the presidency of the NBC in 1953, Jackson was elected President. Jackson served longer than any of his predecessors, holding office for 29 years. Under Jackson's leadership, one of the NBC's achievements included the purchase of a Freedom Farm in Tennessee to provide a haven for Black farmers. These farmers were divested of their land in the civil rights revolution. Yet, Differing concepts about engagement in the Civil Rights struggle and of term limitations for the president led to a division within the NBC. This division resulted in the formation of the Progressive National Baptist Convention (PNBC). =Controversy= A group led by Gardner C. Taylor including Martin Luther King, Sr and Jr.; Ralph David Abernathy Sr., Benjamin Mays, and L. Venchael Booth (a Cincinnati, Ohio pastor) filed suit against Jackson, accusing him of violating the denomination's constitution. They accused him of ignoring the four-term limitation of NBC president as stated in the constitution. The court decided in Jackson's favor and at the annual convention meeting in Philadelphia in 1960, Jackson was installed to a fifth term as president. In response to Jackson's reelection, Taylor's group demanded a roll call, but instead the meeting was adjourned. The dispute was once again taken to court, and the court again sided with Jackson. He remained as president of the convention.[3] The events of the next annual meeting in Kansas City, Missouri were among the most memorable in the organization's history. During that meeting Taylor's group attempted to secure control of the podium to compel a head count for the organization's presidency but Jackson's group blocked access to the podium furthering the conflict between the two groups. In the course of the misunderstanding Rev. A. G. Wright of Detroit fell four feet from the stage to the auditorium floor, resulting in a concussion that caused him to lose his life days later. The proceedings returned to order only after the Mayor of Kansas City, H. Roe Bartle, appealed to the clergymen to cease fighting.Taylor Branch, Parting the Waters, Touchtone Books/Simon & Schuster (1988), at p. 502. Following the meeting, Jackson pointedly denounced the nonviolent civil rights movement, including the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Congress of Racial Equality. He also removed Martin Luther King Jr. from the vice-presidency of the Baptist Training Union and Sunday School Congress.[3] In response, Taylor and his group met together in 1961 at Zion Baptist Church in Cincinnati, where they organized the Progressive National Baptist Convention. About half a million NBC members ended up leaving the NBC for the new group.[1] Jackson continued as president of the NBC until September 1982, when he was unseated by the long-serving General Secretary of the Convention, T.J. Jemison, the son of Jackson's predecessor.[6] =Views on civil rights and society= During a 1970 Time magazine interview Jackson said that, \\"The most important thing now, is to save the nation, in order to save the individual citizen, and the race.\\" By \\"save the nation\\" he meant that if one person was enslaved the society would also be enslaved or at the very least \\"polluted.\\" During his September 10, 1964 speech delivered at the 84th Annual Session of the NBC in Detroit, Michigan, Jackson explained his views on civil rights and society. He quoted Abraham Lincoln to support his statement about the importance of saving a nation. Jackson noted Lincoln's statement that, \\"By giving freedom to the slaves we insure freedom to the free.\\" Jackson followed this by stating, \\"The presence of one bound man pollutes the whole stream of human society; and the rattle of one chain of oppression creates a discord that breaks the harmony in every democratic system, and disturbs the mind and poisons the heart of every man with fear and dread, so that the would-be master finds himself mentally and morally the dweller in the hovels of slaves, the servant of a cause that is hostile to democracy, and becomes himself, the victim of the baser emotions of his own nature.\\" Jackson believed that African Americans would obtain civil rights \\"through law and order\\" by remaining in the mainstream of American democracy. He believed that American problems could be solved through the laws of the land and through obedience to the American philosophy and way of life. Jackson believed that as long as America was guided by logic and law this home of the Federal Constitution and land of due process would allow for fair treatment of all. Jackson believed in the power of the voting ballot as the \\"most important weapon\\" through which vital decisions were made. In this 1964 speech Jackson concluded the speech with six suggestions for the American Negro regarding the Civil Rights Movement. Jackson believed that a great church could not be built preaching hate, envy, revenge, and sending the people out on the street after the service mad at the world. He went on to declare that \\"no matter how nonviolent, civil disobedience lays the ground for civil hatred and the desire to destroy.\\"[1] In 1968 Jackson was proclaimed \\"Patriot of the Year\\" by right wing activist Billy James Hargis, in recognition of Jackson's outspoken law-and-order stance.[1] =Philanthropy= In 1983 Jackson gave $50,000 to Jackson State University to establish the Joseph H. Jackson Fund for a lecture series and scholarship award program. His additional philanthropy went to schools including Hampton University, Howard University, Edward Waters College, and Meharry Medical College.Ostling, Richard N., \\"Moving into the Mainstream\\", Time Magazine, September 19, 1983 =Death= Joseph Harrison Jackson died in August 1990 at Chicago Osteopathic Hospital in Chicago following a lengthy illness. He died at the age of 90 while still serving as pastor of Olivet Baptist Church.[2] He was survived by his wife Maude Thelma Jackson and daughter, Dr. Kenny Jackson Williams.

He gained recognition for studies on the co-ordination chemistry of tertiary phosphines, olefins, and acetylenes, and the relationship of their behaviour to homogeneous catalysis. Professional career Born in London, Bennett studied at The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School and received his PhD under the supervision of Geoffrey Wilkinson at Imperial College. He was subsequently a researcher at University College, London with Ronald Nyholm and then with Arthur Adamson. While in London, he prepared the rhodium complex [RhCl(PPh3)3], now known as Wilkinson's catalyst. In the 1960s he took a position in the Research School of Chemistry at the Australian National University in Canberra. Contributions At ANU, Bennett developed several lines of research broadly on themes in organometallic chemistry. This included extending work on the iridium analogue of Wilkinson's catalyst which he began at University College with Milner. Wilkinson's catalyst can be prepared by reducing rhodium(III) chloride in boiling ethanol in the presence of an excess of triphenylphosphine, but the equivalent preparative conditions lead not to [IrCl(PPh3)3] but instead to a mixture of iridium(III) products, primarily the hydrogen chloride adduct of the analogue: ::IrCl3(H2O)3 \\\\+ 4 PPh3 → [HIrCl2(PPh3)3] \\\\+ OPPh3 \\\\+ HCl \\\\+ 2 H2O Bennett prepared the analogue from the 1,5-cyclooctadiene (1,5-cod) iridium(I) dimer, [(η4-1,5-cod)Ir(μ-Cl)]2, using an excess of triphenylphosphine in ligroin under reflux. The product is isomorphous with Wilkinson's catalyst but does not lose a triphenylphosphine ligand through dissociation in organic solvents anywhere near as readily. A phosphine is lost under oxidative conditions with chlorine, affording initially [IrCl3(PPh3)2] and with excess chlorine, the iridium(IV) complex [IrCl4(PPh3)2] is obtained. [IrCl(PPh3)3] rearranges on heating via an insertion reaction, an ortho-metalation of one of the phenyl moieties, to produce the six-co-ordinate organometallic iridium(III) hydride [HIrCl(PPh3)2(Ph2PC6H4)] - an example of iridium(I)-iridium(III) tautomerism involving the formation of a bidentate phosphine ligand with a carbon donor atom: ::[(η4-1,5-cod)Ir(μ-Cl)]2 \\\\+ 4 PPh3 → 2 [IrCl(PPh3)3] \\\\+ 2 1,5-cod The (cymene)ruthenium dichloride dimer Bennett was the first to prepare complexes of cyclooctyne, cycloheptyne, and cyclohexyne. He developed rare examples of metal-alkene complexes that exist in two oxidation states.

Natural radioactive elements are present in very low concentrations in Earth's crust, and are brought to the surface through human activities such as oil and gas exploration or mining, and through natural processes like leakage of radon gas to the atmosphere or through dissolution in ground water. Another example of TENORM is coal ash produced from coal burning in power plants. If radioactivity is much higher than background level, handling TENORM may cause problems in many industries and transportation.TENORM.com NORM in oil and gas exploration Oil and gas TENORM and/or NORM is created in the production process, when produced fluids from reservoirs carry sulfates up to the surface of the Earth's crust. Some states, such as North Dakota, uses the term \\"diffuse NORM\\". Barium, calcium and strontium sulfates are larger compounds, and the smaller atoms, such as radium-226 and radium-228, can fit into the empty spaces of the compound and be carried through the produced fluids. As the fluids approach the surface, changes in the temperature and pressure cause the barium, calcium, strontium and radium sulfates to precipitate out of solution and form scale on the inside, or on occasion, the outside of the tubulars and/or casing. The use of tubulars in the production process that are NORM contaminated does not cause a health hazard if the scale is inside the tubulars and the tubulars remain downhole. Enhanced concentrations of the radium 226 and 228 and the daughter products such as lead-210 may also occur in sludge that accumulates in oilfield pits, tanks and lagoons. Radon gas in the natural gas streams concentrate as NORM in gas processing activities. Radon decays to lead-210, then to bismuth-210, polonium-210 and stabilizes with lead-206. Radon decay elements occur as a shiny film on the inner surface of inlet lines, treating units, pumps and valves associated with propylene, ethane and propane processing systems. NORM characteristics vary depending on the nature of the waste. NORM may be created in a crystalline form, which is brittle and thin, and can cause flaking to occur in tubulars. NORM formed in carbonate matrix can have a density of 3.5 grams/cubic centimeters and must be noted when packing for transportation. NORM scales may be white or a brown solid, or thick sludge to solid, dry flaky substances. NORM may also be found in oil and gas production produced waters. Cutting and reaming oilfield pipe, removing solids from tanks and pits, and refurbishing gas processing equipment may expose employees to particles containing increased levels of alpha emitting radionuclides that could pose health risks if inhaled or ingested. NORM is found in many industries including * The coal industry (mining and combustion) * Metal mining and smelting * Mineral sands (rare earth minerals, titanium and zirconium). * Fertilizer (phosphate) industry * Building industry Hazards The hazards associated with NORM are inhalation and ingestion routes of entry as well as external exposure where there has been a significant accumulation of scales. Respirators may be necessary in dry processes, where NORM scales and dust become air borne and have a significant chance to enter the body. The hazardous elements found in NORM are radium 226, 228 and radon 222 and also daughter products from these radionuclides. The elements are referred to as \\"bone seekers\\" which when inside the body migrate to the bone tissue and concentrate. This exposure can cause bone cancers and other bone abnormalities. The concentration of radium and other daughter products build over time, with several years of excessive exposures. Therefore, from a liability standpoint an employee that has not had respiratory protection over several years could develop bone or other cancers from NORM exposure and decide to seek compensation such as medical expenses and lost wages from the oil company which generated the TENORM and the employer.Cox, James R. “Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials in the Oilfield: Changing the NORM,” Tulane Law Review, 1993. Radium radionuclides emit alpha and beta particles as well as gamma rays. The radiation emitted from a radium 226 atom is 96% alpha particles and 4% gamma rays. The alpha particle is not the most dangerous particle associated with NORM. Alpha particles are identical with helium-4 nuclei. Alpha particles travel short distances in air, of only 2–3 cm, and cannot penetrate through a dead layer of skin on the human body. However, some radium alpha particle emitters are \\"bone seekers\\" due to radium possessing a high affinity for chloride ions. In the case that radium atoms are not expelled from the body, they concentrate in areas where chloride ions are prevalent, such as bone tissue. The half-life for radium 226 is approximately 1,620 years, and will remain in the body for the lifetime of the human — a significant length of time to cause damage. Beta particles are high energy electrons or positrons. They are in the middle of the scale in terms of ionizing potential and penetrating power, being stopped by a few millimeters of plastic. This radiation is a small portion of the total emitted during radium 226 decay. Radium 228 emits beta particles, and is also a concern for human health through inhalation and ingestion. Beta particles are electrons or positrons and can travel farther than alpha particles in air. The gamma rays emitted from radium 226, accounting for 4% of the radiation, are harmful to humans with sufficient exposure. Gamma rays are highly penetrating and some can pass through metals, so Geiger counters or a scintillation probe are used to measure gamma ray exposures when monitoring for NORM. Alpha and beta particles are harmful once inside the body. Breathing NORM contaminates from dusts should be prevented by wearing respirators with particulate filters. In the case of properly trained occupational NORM workers, air monitoring and analysis may be necessary. These measurements, ALI and DAC, are calculated values based on the dose an average employee working 2,000 hours a year may be exposed to. The current legal limit exposure in the United States is 1 ALI, or 5 rems. A rem, or roentgen equivalent man, is a measurement of absorption of radiation on parts of the body over an extended period of time. A DAC is a concentration of alpha and beta particles that an average working employee is exposed to for 2,000 hours of light work. If an employee is exposed to over 10% of an ALI, 500 mREM, then the employee's dose must be documented under instructions with federal and state regulations. Regulation NORM is not federally regulated in the United States. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has jurisdiction over a relatively narrow spectrum of radiation, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has jurisdiction over NORM. Since no federal entity has implemented NORM regulations, NORM is variably regulated by the states. In the UK regulation is via the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. This defines two types of NORM activity: *Type 1 NORM industrial activity means: (a) the production and use of thorium, or thorium compounds, and the production of products where thorium is deliberately added; or (b) the production and use of uranium or uranium compounds, and the production of products where uranium is deliberately added * Type 2 NORM industrial activity means: (a) the extraction, production and use of rare earth elements and rare earth element alloys; (b) the mining and processing of ores other than uranium ore; (c) the production of oil and gas; (d) the removal and management of radioactive scales and precipitates from equipment associated with industrial activities; (e) any industrial activity utilising phosphate ore; (f) the manufacture of titanium dioxide pigments; (g) the extraction and refining of zircon and manufacture of zirconium compounds; (h) the production of tin, copper, aluminium, zinc, lead and iron and steel; (i) any activity related to coal mine de-watering plants; (j) china clay extraction; (k) water treatment associated with provision of drinking water; or (l) The remediation of contamination from any type 1 NORM industrial activity or any of the activities listed above. An activity which involves the processing of radionuclides of natural terrestrial or cosmic origin for their radioactive, fissile or fertile properties is not a type 1 NORM industrial activity or a type 2 NORM industrial activity.Guidance to Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations (EPR) 2010  See also  * Background radiation, ionizing radiation constantly present in the natural environment of the Earth * Environmental radioactivity References External links * North Dakota Department of Health * NORM Technology Connection, Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission * Radiation Quick Reference Guide, Domestic Nuclear Detection Office * Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials from the World Nuclear Association * UK guidance on Radioactive Substances Regulation For the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010:Defra Category:Radioactive waste ","title":"Naturally occurring radioactive material"},{"id":"11872151","text":"Konca Kuriş Konca Kuriş (16 October 1961 – 1999) was a Turkish feminist writer who was murdered in Konya, Turkey on 20 July 1999 after having disappeared in 1998.

World Rabies Day takes place each year on September 28, the anniversary of the death of Louis Pasteur who, with the collaboration of his colleagues, developed the first efficacious rabies vaccine. World Rabies Day aims to raise awareness about the impact of rabies on humans and animals, provide information and advice on how to prevent the disease in at-risk communities, and support advocacy for increased efforts in rabies control.  Background  Rabies remains a significant health problem in many countries of the world. Over 99% of all human deaths caused by rabid dog bites happen in the developing world, with 95% of deaths occurring in Africa and Asia. With the exception of Antarctica, people and animals on every continent are at risk of contracting rabies.World Health Organization , accessed July 4, 2017. One major problem with rabies prevention is a lack of basic life-saving knowledge among people at risk. Organizations working on the issue can often feel isolated, and, as a neglected disease, rabies does not attract sufficient resources, even though the world has the tools and knowledge to prevent rabies and nobody needs to die from this disease. Health awareness days can help to improve policy on diseases and increase resources to prevent and control them. This understanding led to the development of an awareness day against rabies.  History  The first World Rabies Day campaign took place on 8 September 2007 as a partnership between the Alliance for Rabies Control and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA, with the co-sponsorship of the World Health Organization, the World Organisation for Animal Health and the Pan American Health Organization [Briggs D, Hanlon CA. World Rabies Day: focusing attention on a neglected disease. Vet Rec. 2007 Sep 1;161(9):288-9.]. In 2009, after three World Rabies Days, the Global Alliance for Rabies Control estimated that rabies prevention and awareness events had taken place in over 100 countries, that nearly 100 million people worldwide had been educated about rabies and that nearly 3 million dogs had been vaccinated during events linked to the campaign. A 2011 review by a network of international government agencies, academics, NGOs and vaccine manufacturers identified World Rabies Day as a useful tool to assist with rabies prevention, targeting at-risk communities, animal health workers, public health practitioners, governments, key opinion leaders and experts. In the years following the review, World Rabies Day has also been used by governments and international agencies as a day on which to announce policies, plans and progress on rabies elimination. For example, In 2013, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN, the World Health Organization and the World Organisation for Animal Health first called for the global elimination of canine-mediated rabies in a joint statement released on World Rabies Day. It has been included in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Rabies Elimination Strategy. At the first Pan-African Rabies Control Network meeting in 2015, the 33 African countries represented there recommended consideration of World Rabies Day as an opportunity for rabies advocacy. In the Philippines World Rabies Day has been observed at the national and local government levels since 2007, and is part of its National Rabies Prevention and Control Program. In September 2020, animal welfare organisations like Dog Meat-Free Indonesia (DMFI) have called for action by Indonesian authorities to tackle the significant threat of rabies posed by the illegal dog meat trade affecting an estimated one million dogs each year.Dog Meat-Free Indonesia campaigners warn of deadly rabies transmission without enforced ban on brutal dog meat trade from 28. September 2020 in Hsi.org.au  Organization and philosophy  World Rabies Day was created to be an inclusive day of education, awareness and action to encourage groups from all levels, the international to the local, to increase the spread of rabies prevention messages. Its objectives include raising global awareness about rabies and how to stop the disease, and educating people in rabies- endemic countries to prevent rabies. It is centralized with an online platform where World Rabies Day events can be registered and resources can be downloaded to support and promote the outreach of educational messages about rabies in person, in print and online. The campaign also aims to bring together all relevant partners in an effort to address rabies prevention and control. Health workers, scientists and personnel in communities at risk of rabies are encouraged to access a bank of awareness resources through the website of the Global Alliance for Rabies Control for use in local educational initiatives. As rabies is a disease that crosses borders, especially in wild animal populations, the campaign encourages the transnational collaboration of rabies control and prevention organizations. It also promotes a One Health approach to rabies prevention, part of a worldwide strategy for expanding interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health care for humans and animal health.One Health Initiative website , accessed July 4, 2017. The WRD logo (pictured above) represents the complexity of rabies, which can infect human beings, wildlife and domestic animals. The advocacy work of the World Rabies Day campaign includes promoting government involvement in rabies prevention and control programs, increasing the vaccination coverage of pets and community dogs, and improving the educational awareness of how to prevent rabies in all levels of society. It also promotes the utilization of an integrated model of disease management, the Blueprint for Rabies Prevention.Blueprint for Rabies Prevention and Control , accessed July 4, 2017. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN considers that World Rabies Day plays an important role in advocating the prevention and control of rabies among policy makers, especially in countries where rabies is still neglected.Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN , accessed July 4, 2017.  Events  A World Rabies Day event at Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan Events held to mark World Rabies Day range from symposia on current rabies control methods and public events for raising awareness about good prevention practice, to sponsored walks, runs or bike rides, to free or externally subsidized vaccination clinics for dogs. In the first ten years, over 1,700 events were registered from different countries, with increases over the years in Africa and Asia, where rabies is still a huge issue.

The unit was committed into battle in March 1945 in an unsuccessful attempt to stop American troops from encircling Army Group B in the Ruhr Pocket. History The brigade was formed on 29 March 1945 from training staff and other personnel at Sennelanger Training Grounds north of Paderborn. The unit consisted of two improvised infantry regiments that were named after their commanders. Regiment \\"Meyer\\" consisted of three battalions: SS Panzer Reconnaissance Training and Replacement Battalion 1, SS Panzer Reconnaissance Training and Replacement Battalion 2, and an SS Panzer Reconnaissance NCO Training Battalion. Regiment \\"Holzer\\" was named after its commander Obersturmbannführer Friedrich Holzer and consisted of the SS Panzer Training and Replacement Regiment in Augustdorf, which consists of three battalions. The 507th Heavy Panzer Battalion was the brigade's main armor component. The brigade had about 60 Tiger and Panther tanks as of 30 March 1945 according to Charles B. MacDonald. However, according to Steven Zaloga, the brigade instead had 15 old training tanks such as Panzer III, 21 Tiger II and three Jagdpanthers available by the end of March.

He is best known for his work on the Solow–Swan growth model, published simultaneously by American economist Robert Solow, for his work on integrating internal and external balance as represented by the Swan Diagram, and for pioneering work in macroeconomic modeling, which predated that of Lawrence Klein but remained unpublished until 1989. Swan is widely regarded as the greatest economic theorist that Australia has produced, and as one of the finest economists not to receive a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.Distinguished ANU Economists There were two independent pioneers of Neoclassical Growth Theory: Robert Solow and Trevor Swan. Solow published \\"A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth\\" in the February issue of the QJE in 1956, and Trevor Swan published \\"Economic Growth and Capital Accumulation\\" in the Economic Record, subsequent to Solow in December 1956. Swan's contribution has been overshadowed by Solow, who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in 1987 for his contributions to economic growth. Biography Born and educated in Sydney, Swan attended Canterbury High School where he was Dux in 1935. After school he joined the Rural Bank of New South Wales, studying part-time at the University of Sydney. In 1940 he received a bachelor of economics with First Class Honours and was awarded the gold medal, the first time it had been awarded on the basis of part-time study; he was appointed an assistant lecturer at the University of Sydney. From 1942 to 1950 he was employed in government service, as an economist in the Department of War Organization of Industry, secretary to the War Commitments Committee, chairman of the Food Priorities Committee, joint secretary of the Joint Administrative Planning Sub-Committee of the Defence Committee, chief economist of the Department of Post-War Reconstruction, and, from 1949, chief economist of the Department of the Prime Minister. During this period he contributed to the White Paper on Full Employment which set the framework for Australian macroeconomic policy in the postwar decades. In 1950, he was appointed as the first chair of economics created at the Australian National University, remaining Professor of Economics until his retirement in 1983. He built up a strong department with such figures as Noel Butlin and Ivor Pearce. In 1975 he was appointed to the Board of the Reserve Bank of Australia and reappointed in 1980. He played a small role in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, by suggesting to his friend, the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, that the banks could assist in ensuring the government had funds to meet its obligations, during the period when Supply was being threatened by the Opposition in the Senate.Gay Davidson, \\"The Dismissal: many degrees dead wrong\\", The Canberra Times, 11 November 2000, Panorama, p. 8 In 2007, in an address to the American Economic Association celebrating the 50th anniversary of his 1956 contribution, Robert Solow reminded his audience that, \\"If you have been interested in growth theory for a while, you probably know that Trevor Swan—who was a splendid macroeconomist—also published a paper on growth theory in 1956. In that article, you can find the essentials of the basic neoclassical model of economic growth.\\" Swan was noted by Paul Krugman in his New York Times blog: \\"There's an oldie but goodie in international macro known as the Swan Diagram – not instructions for making an origami swan, but the insightful analysis developed by the Australian economist Trevor Swan.\\" He died in 1989.

Early life McDowell was born in Ballymena, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Crime Hinz, a thirty seven year old homosexual trainee rabbi, gifted linguist, and national of Germany, had spent the night of 3 July 2002, drinking alone in the public house Black Cap, a gay bar in Camden, North London. After striking up a conversation with McDowell, they left the bar together in the early hours, and returned to McDowell’s flat in Baynes Street, Camden. Hinz arrived in Britain two years prior, in 2000, to begin his training to become a rabbi, at the Leo Baeck College. After knocking Hinz to the floor with a “martial arts” kick, McDowell proceeded to strangle Hinz, before dismembering his body, with a rip saw. The body parts were wrapped in bin liners, and put out onto one street near St Pancras Way, for the rubbish collectors. Their subsequent decomposition, exacerbated by summer heat, led to a “terrible smell” and a cloud of flies, that eventually led to their gruesome discovery. Barbara Hinz, his mother, returned home to Ulm, Germany, after flying to London the following week, to appeal for help finding her son. His cousin, Claudia Bobermin, also flew with his mother to London, in their appeal to find Hinz. Sentence McDowell briefly appeared in the Old Bailey on 2 December 2002, in relation to killing Hinz, and was remanded in custody until 14 February 2003. At the trial of McDowell two years later, in September 2004, it was revealed that, as a child, he had suffered abuse at the hands of a man, and grew up with a sense of hatred towards homosexuals, as well as suffering from a personality disorder. McDowell was a medical student at the time of the murder, and had also been working as a male prostitute. McDowell admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, and was sentenced to life imprisonment at Southwark Crown Court, on 30 September 2004. The trial judge spoke of his doubt, as to whether it would ever be thought safe to release McDowell back into the community, and recommended that he should never be released. He began his life sentence at Rampton Secure Hospital, in Nottinghamshire.

Design and development The B.Z.308 was a four- engined civil transport developed in the late 1940s for operation over both European and transatlantic routes. A large low-wing monoplane of all-metal construction, it was powered by four Bristol Centaurus radial engines driving five-bladed propellers. It had a large tailplane with endplate fins and rudders, and had retractable landing gear. The fuselage, oval in cross- section, accommodated a flight crew of five and 55 passengers in two cabins; a high-density model was planned with seats for 80. Construction began during 1946, under aircraft designer Filippo Zappata at Breda's Sesto San Giovanni works. The Allied Commission halted the work, which was not resumed until January 1947. Further delays in the delivery of Bristol Centaurus engines delayed the first flight, which was on 27 August 1948, piloted by Mario Stoppani. Although flight testing went well, the project was abandoned as a result of financial problems, anticipated competition from American airliners in the postwar market, and pressure (under the Marshall plan) to close down Breda's aeronautical section. Breda subsequently stopped producing aircraft entirely. Operational history The prototype B.Z.308 was acquired by the Italian Air Force in 1949 as a transport aircraft (MM61802). Despite orders in 1950 from India, Argentina and Persia, only the prototype was built, allegedly also due to pressure from the allies for Italy to refrain from competing in civilian aircraft manufacture after the war. On 27 August 1948 the Bz 308 made its maiden flight in front of civil and military authorities, politicians and the Italian President. The prototype, which passed to the Italian Air Force in 1950, was used to fly between Rome and Mogadishu until 21 February 1954, when it was damaged beyond repair by a collision with a cement truck, and was abandoned in a field in Somalia before being broken up.\\"Breda-Zappata BZ.308\\" Aviation Safety It was also the first Italian transatlantic aircraft, and the first aircraft to fly into the new Malpensa airport in 1948.

Adults are orange, red and purple in color, while juveniles are either mostly orange or have small blotches of red and purple. They can be recognized by their blunt bumps on their carapace. Puget Sound king crabs are larger than the similar brown box crab, with an average size of 6-10 inches. They are protected by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, so it is not advised to harvest it. If, however, you are in B.C., Canada, the Puget Sound King Crab can be harvested. Hand picking by divers would be the most likely method. Daily limit of 1, possession 2. Description The Puget Sound king crab, also known as Lopholithodes mandtii, is an uncommon species of crab with distinct features that can be found on the West Coast of the United States; from Alaska to Central California. When they are born, juvenile Puget Sound king crabs are primarily orange with some patches of red and purple. As they grow into adulthood, the L. mandtii form a more mixed shell color of red, orange, and purple. They can also grow to be an average size of 6 - 10 inches, with a carapace, or the dorsal side of the exoskeleton, growing upwards of 30 cm wide. This makes the Puget Sound king crab one of the largest crabs on the West Coast of the United States and yet it is still one of the hardest crab species to find. Another important characteristic of L. mandtii is the blunt, rounded bumps you will find all over them. Not only is this a necessary physiological trait that helps conceal the species in the subtidal, but the bumps also distinguish it from other closely related species, such as the brown box crab, Lopholithodes foraminatus, which has spinelike protrusions that are much sharper than the bumps on the Puget Sound king crab.Stevens, Bradley G., ed. King crabs of the world: biology and fisheries management. CRC Press, 2014. Distribution and habitat As described before, L. mandtii is distributed along the Pacific Coast of the United States and has moved, as observed, from as far as Sitka, Alaska to Monterey, California. In these regions, the Puget Sound king crab lives in close proximity to many other closely related species, such as the Alaskan king crab.Zimmermann, Mark, C. Braxton Dew, and Beverly A. Malley. \\"History of Alaska red king crab, Paralithodes camtschaticus, bottom trawl surveys, 1940–61.\\" Marine Fisheries Review 71.1 (2009): 1-22. In these areas, L. mandtii are known to be found anywhere between the subtidal to depths of about 140 m. They mostly take up rocky areas where they can easily maneuver around and hide themselves from physical and ecological factors such as strong currents and drag that could rip other organisms away.Toft, Jason D., et al. \\"Fish distribution, abundance, and behavior along city shoreline types in Puget Sound.\\" North American Journal of Fisheries Management 27.2 (2007): 465-480. Juvenile Puget Sound king crabs are more likely to be found under rocks at low tide in order to avoid heat stress. This makes them easier to find compared to adult Puget Sound king crabs which spend the majority of time at lower depths where there is a higher chance of catching prey. The exception to this is during the end of Winter/ beginning of Spring when they come up to shallow waters in order to mate and breed offspring.Dethier, Megan N., et al. Native shellfish in nearshore ecosystems of Puget Sound. No. TR-2006-04. WASHINGTON UNIV SEATTLE, 2006. As of recent, L. mandtii has become less common in the Puget Sound Straight region in Washington, USA. This is due to the shoreline modifications which negatively impact nearby habitats where various species, such as the Puget Sound king crab, coexist. Community impact and status The Puget Sound king crab is known to live in the subtidal regions along coasts which means it is part of a diverse community of marine life that interact with each other to create a dynamic environment. This species is in a position where it must catch prey and avoid predators in order to survive and thrive. L. mandtii is known to consume sea urchins and other invertebrates, such as starfish and sea cucumbers. By controlling sea urchin populations, more seaweed and kelp will show up since there will be less invertebrates that consume those primary producers. In turn, the seaweeds and kelp conceal the Puget Sound king crab from its predators in the sky, such as pelicans and other birds that consume marine life. This is an example of a changing cycle within this community because a disturbance or change any species population could alter the rest of the community altogether. L. mandtii is becoming more uncommon in the areas it used to thrive in. Part of this is due to increased use of fishing nets of different sizes which the crabs get caught in and brought up.Good, Thomas P., et al. \\"Derelict fishing nets in Puget Sound and the Northwest Straits: patterns and threats to marine fauna.\\" Marine Pollution Bulletin 60.1 (2010): 39-50. The Puget Sound king crab has been put on the protected species list by the Washington Fish and Wildlife Department which means it is not advised to catch and collect this species.

Knox Professor of English Literature and American Studies at Yale University. He also writes for Artforum, The Nation, The Advocate, and The Village Voice. He is the author of Publics and Counterpublics, The Trouble with Normal: Sex, Politics, and the Ethics of Queer Life, The English Literatures of America, 1500–1800, Fear of a Queer Planet, and The Letters of the Republic. He edited The Portable Walt Whitman and American Sermons: The Pilgrims to Martin Luther King, Jr. Biography Born September 9, 1958, Warner received two Master of Arts degrees, from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Johns Hopkins University, in 1981 and 1983 respectively. He received his Doctor of Philosophy degree in English from Johns Hopkins University in 1986. Warner assumed his position at Yale University in 2007, and became Seymour H. Knox Professor of English Literature and American studies in 2008. Prior to his work at Yale, he taught at Northwestern University (1985–1990) and Rutgers University (1990–2007). Warner is highly influential in the fields of early American literature, social theory, and queer theory. His first book, The Letters of the Republic: Publication and the Public Sphere in Eighteenth-Century America, established him as a leading scholar in Early American literature, print culture, and public sphere theory. He later became a public figure in the gay community for his book The Trouble with Normal, in which Warner contended that queer theory and the ethics of a queer life serve as critiques of existing social and economic structures, not just as critique of heterosexuality and heterosexual society. His most recent work, Publics and Counterpublics is a collection of essays on the politics of communication in advanced capitalistic societies, or Habermasian public sphere theory. Warner is currently working on the history of secularism in early America, from the early eighteenth century to the Civil War, culminating with the work of Walt Whitman, a writer on whom many of his interests converge. Warner has been a permanent fellow of Rutger University's Center for Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture since 2001, and was a director from 2006-2008. He also sits on a number of Advisory Boards, including that of the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies (since 1999), the Society for the Humanities at Cornell University (since 2003), and the Library of America Colonial Writing Project (since 2005). Warner is, along with Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Teresa de Lauretis, Lauren Berlant, and Judith Butler, considered one of the founders of queer theory.  Overview of major works  = The Trouble With Normal = In The Trouble With Normal, Warner critiques same-sex marriage activism and other moves more generally by the gay rights movement toward equality in normalcy. The book has been described as a classic of the debates on normalcy as a goal for the gay rights movement, and as an important contribution to queer theory. Martha Nussbaum, writing in the New Republic, praised the book's moral opposition to \\"the domination of the 'normal': \\"Warner is a deft and thoughtful writer who turns his own experience of the margins into a source of genuine understanding about America and its sexual politics...what Warner's book finally demands of us is...genuine reflection.\\" First published in 1999 by The Free Press, an imprint of Simon and Schuster, it was re-published in 2000 in paperback by Harvard University Press. Warner argues that the right to marry is an inadequate and ultimately undesirable goal for gay rights activism. Chapter one, \\"The Ethics of Sexual Shame\\", argues that people with deviant sexualities have been shamed, as a result of American society's relegation of sex to the private domain, where it is not talked about. It provides a list of sexual hierarchies, as well as discussion of stigma, shame, moral panics, and queer life. Chapter two, \\"What's Wrong with Normal?\\", critiques the notion of normalcy. In this chapter, Warner looks at the arguments of Georges Canguilhem and Alfred Kinsey to discuss issues with the concept of norms and \\"The Normalized Movement\\" within gay rights activism. Chapter three, \\"Beyond Gay Marriage\\", takes the concepts from chapter two to argue against same-sex marriage, and marriage as an institution that reinforces privacy and diminishes the queer counterpublic. Chapter four, \\"Zoning Out Sex\\", discusses the zoning laws put in place by New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. These laws were also critiqued in the article Warner co-wrote with Lauren Berlant in 1998, titled \\"Sex in Public\\". The conclusion \\"The Politics of Shame and HIV Prevention\\", discusses some of the health strategies of fighting HIV/AIDS, and how the cycle of shame increases the risk of spreading the disease. The book, according to Kirkus Reviews, argues \\"persuasively\\" against same-sex marriage. = Publics and Counterpublics = Publics and Counterpublics is a collection of essays based around the central question \\"what is a public?\\" Around half of the essays in the book have been published previously. Chapter one, \\"Public and Private\\", reviews the definitions of these terms, and traces the history of debates around public and private spheres, particularly around the women's liberation, and then the gay rights, movements. Chapter two, \\"Publics and Counterpublics\\", looks at redefining and expanding upon the term public, to introduce multiple publics. The chapter then introduces the concept of counterpublics, initially termed by Nancy Fraser to mean a public that is subordinate to a dominant public. Chapter three, \\"Styles of Intellectual Publics\\", considers the style of discourse in academic work and the impact this has on the type of public it creates. It suggests that Michel Foucault might have described intellectual work as a counterpublic, and discusses this possibility. Chapter four, \\"The Mass Public and the Mass Subject\\", responds to Jürgen Habermas' The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere introducing some of the concepts we now regard as queer theory. As the essay was originally published in 1989, it was written before the term queer theory had become widely used. Chapter five, \\"Sex in Public\\", was co-written with Lauren Berlant, and published previously in 1998. \\"Sex in Public\\" serves as a case study in the struggles over the mediation of publics, and is very similar, thematically, to The Trouble With Normal. Chapter six, \\"Something Queer About the Nation State\\", discusses queer politics and activism, and its relationship to the state. Chapter seven, \\"A Soliloquy 'Lately Spoken at the African Theatre': Race and the Public Sphere in New York City, 1821\\", considers an historical counterpublic and its context, and the texts that upheld it. Chapter eight, \\"Whitman Drunk\\" critiques Walt Whitman's work Franklin Evans and its reception in the context of temperance activism. Publics and Counterpublics, argues fellow queer theorist Ken Plummer, extended the public/private debate and contributed to the development of queer theory. Both of these major works discuss to some extent how queer straddles the public/private divide. The Trouble With Normal argues that the gay rights struggle for marriage equality is a struggle for normalcy, and privacy. This privacy, Warner argues, comes at the cost of those who do not marry, who choose to conduct themselves in public. Publics and Counterpublics considers the public sphere and its shortcomings, before considering how queer both exists in, and is subordinated by, publics. Warner calls the two books \\"mutually illustrative\\", with The Trouble With Normal critiquing the way gay rights movements have obscured queer counterpublics, one of the central concepts of Public and Counterpublics.

He is currently the conductor for the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra. Life and career Prior was born in London to a British father and a Russian mother who descended from Constantin Stanislavski. Prior began composing at the age of eight and has written more than 40 works, including symphonies, concertos, two ballets, two operas, and a Requiem for the children of Beslan. At an early age, he began piano lessons. He later enrolled in the junior department of the Royal College of Music. At 13, he entered the Saint Petersburg Conservatory where, beginning in his third year, he studied composition with Boris Tishchenko and opera and symphonic conducting with Alexander Alexeev (a pupil of Hans Swarowsky). In 2009, at age 17, he graduated with Distinction two Masters-Degrees in Symphonic and Operatic Conducting, and in Composition from the St. Petersburg Conservatory. Prior has collaborated with many leading orchestras and ensembles, including The BBC Singers, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the New Opera Orchestra, the Northern Sinfonia, and the ensemble Endymion. Highlights include a performance of his Sonata for Cello and Piano at the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory and a symphonic poem, Stalin's March, as part of the Arts Council-funded New Music Day with the City of London Sinfonia. Other performances include The Prince's Feast with Prior conducting the National Symphony Orchestra of London at the Barbican Centre and the premiere of Svyatogor's Quest by the Sitkovetsky Piano Trio at Wigmore Hall. In Autumn 2008, following performances in St. Petersburg, the Rossica Choir toured the UK, featuring Prior's choral cycle Sounds of the Homeland and parts of his All Night Vigil. Prior's Piano Concerto No. 1 was premiered at the V International Piano Festival in St. Petersburg in September 2006. Prior was runner-up in the 2008 International Prokofiev Composers Competition – his Piano Concerto No. 2 Northern Dances was performed by the State Academic Symphony of St. Petersburg in the Great Philharmonic Hall. In 2006, Prior's ballet Mowgli (based on Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book) was commissioned by choreographers Natalia Kasatkina and Vladimir Vassilev of the Moscow State Classical Ballet. The official premiere took place at the Kremlin Theatre in Moscow in February 2008. Prior made his UK conducting debut with The National Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican in March 2007. He also conducted the State Symphony Orchestra of St. Petersburg in a performance of his String Symphony No. 1 and in a concert in the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Hall entirely devoted to his own compositions. In November 2008 he conducted a performance of Rimsky-Korsakov's The Tsar's Bride in St. Petersburg, followed by a performance of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker in January 2009. In 2009, Prior received a commission from Channel 4 to compose a concerto featuring some of the world's most outstanding young musicians, as finally chosen by Prior, which included Zhang Xiaoming (\\"Jack\\") (age 10) on piano, Michael Province (age 13) on violin, Simone Porter (age 12) on violin, and Nathan Chan (age 15) on cello. The three-part series, culminating in a concert at The Sage Gateshead, was broadcast in June 2009, with Prior conducting the Northern Sinfonia.\\"The World's Greatest Musical Prodigies\\", Channel 4, 30 March 2009 Prior was commissioned by the St. Petersburg Concert Society to write a choral symphony based on Nikolai Gogol's work \\"Nevsky Prospekt\\" and other stories such as \\"Diary of a Madman\\". Prior's Symphony No.4 \\"Gogol\\" was premiered on 19 December 2009 at the Smolniy Cathedral in St. Petersburg with Prior conducting the St. Petersburg State Symphony Orchestra.

LA Opera website Reviews Prior has received some positive reviews for his recent concerto Velesslavitsa, both as a composer and a conductor. \\"But Prior was the real star. In his fourth year at the St Petersburg Conservatoire, he is in essence a Russian composer, and it was no surprise that Velesslavitsa sounded like an exuberant apotheosis, in concerto- grosso form, of Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and other Russian Romantics – the kind of over-the-top music a 16-year-old should be writing. At 47 minutes the structure could be tighter, but it has drama, colour and excitement in abundance. And Prior the conductor is an absolute professional, clear in his gestures, authoritative in manner, supportive of his soloists.

He was for many years the chief food critic for the Los Angeles Times and also wrote for LA Weekly and Gourmet, in addition to serving as a regular contributor on KCRW's Good Food radio program. Gold often chose small, traditional immigrant restaurants for his reviews, although he covered all types of cuisine. In 2007, while writing for the LA Weekly, he became the first food critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism.  Career  In 1982, while studying art and music at UCLA, Gold began working at LA Weekly magazine as a proofreader. He met his future wife Laurie Ochoa there, and the couple followed each other to later jobs at other publications. By the mid-1980s, Gold was an editor in the Weekly's music section, initially writing about classical music as well as hip-hop, during which he covered the early days of gangsta rap, interviewing Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and the other members of N.W.A. In 1986, with the reluctant support of Weekly founder Jay Levin,, Gold started his first food column \\"Counter Intelligence\\", reviewing under- the-radar restaurants in ethnic neighborhoods of Los Angeles. The column eventually moved to the Los Angeles Times, where Gold worked from 1990 to 1996, while also writing reviews of more upscale restaurants for California and Los Angeles magazines, as well as music stories for Blender, Spin, Rolling Stone, and Details. In 1999, he moved from Los Angeles to New York City to become a restaurant critic for Gourmet magazine. His work at the magazine was twice picked as a finalist for the National Magazine Award in Criticism by the American Society of Magazine Editors. In 2001, when Ochoa was named editor of the Weekly, Gold also moved back to Los Angeles, reviving Counter Intelligence for the Weekly while continuing to contribute to Gourmet. At the Weekly, he published a popular annual best-restaurants list, called Jonathan Gold's 99 Essential LA Restaurants; when he later moved back to the Times, the list expanded slightly to become Jonathan Gold's 101 Best Restaurants. In 2007, Gold became the first food critic to win the Pulitzer Prize; the citation referenced his \\"zestful, wide ranging restaurant reviews, expressing the delight of an erudite eater.\\" In 2012, Gold returned to work at the Los Angeles Times, succeeding S. Irene Virbila as chief food critic for the paper. In 2017, he founded the paper's L.A. Food Bowl festival. Over the course of his career, Gold won nine James Beard Foundation Awards for his writing. Describing his work in the LAist, Megan Garvey wrote: \\"It would be difficult to overstate Gold's impact on the culture of food in Southern California. His reviews of L.A.'s restaurants drew international attention.\\" Anthony Bourdain described Gold as \\"the first guy to change the focus from white tablecloth restaurants to really cool little places in strip malls\\"—a subject for which Bourdain also became renowned. Gold was the subject of the 2015 documentary film City of Gold, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.  Personal life  Gold was born in Los Angeles into a middle-class family as the eldest of three boys. His father was Jewish and worked as a probation officer, and his mother was a high school teacher and librarian who converted to Judaism. While a freshman at UCLA, he worked briefly at a kosher restaurant owned by Steven Spielberg's mother, Leah Adler. He married Laurie Ochoa, currently an editor at the Los Angeles Times and former editor-in-chief of the LA Weekly; they had two children. Jonathan Gold's younger brother Mark Gold was the long- time president of the Santa Monica-based non-profit organization Heal the Bay and then moved on to become associate director of UCLA's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, but now is an employee of the state of California in Sacramento at the Ocean Protection Council (OPC) as the executive director. =Death= In July 2018, Gold was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He died on July 21, 2018, at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles at the age of 57, a week before his 58th birthday. On July 28, 2018—what would have been Gold's 58th birthday—several buildings and landmarks in Los Angeles were lit in gold as a tribute to his memory. At the annual ceremony in April 2019, Gold was posthumously given his ninth career James Beard Foundation Award. In addition, the Foundation announced that they were renaming the annual Local Impact Award to the Jonathan Gold Local Voice Award, honoring “new writers who are telling stories of their cities and regions, just as Jonathan continually shone a light on his beloved Los Angeles.”  Bibliography  *  References   External links  * * Category:1960 births Category:2018 deaths Category:20th-century American male writers Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:American male journalists Category:American restaurant critics Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:James Beard Foundation Award winners Category:Pulitzer Prize for Criticism winners Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:Los Angeles Times people Category:Writers from Los Angeles Category:Writers from California ","title":"Jonathan Gold"},{"id":"11872531","title":"Little Dorrit (TV series)"},{"id":"11872546","text":"Isaac de Castro Tartas (ca. 1623, Tartas, Gascony - December 15, 1647, Lisbon) was a Marrano and Jewish martyr. Castro Tartas was born in France, where his parents had found refuge, under cover as Catholics, before moving to Amsterdam in 1640. Isaac remained with his family in Amsterdam only one year, where he continued studies in philosophy and Hebrew, before emigrating to Brazil with his aunt and her husband Moses Raphael de Aguilar. His parents and two younger brothers remained, one of them, David de Castro Tartas, later became notable as a printer in Amsterdam. The family was also related to the physician Elijah Montalto. In 1641 he arrived in Paraíba, Brazil, where he lived for several years. Against the wishes of his relatives there, he went later to Bahia de Todos os Santos, the colony's capital, where he was recognized as a Jew, arrested by the Portuguese Inquisition, and sent to Lisbon.The encyclopedia of Jewish knowledge Jacob de Haas 1946 \\"CASTRO TARTAS, ISAAC De: Martyr; b. Tartas, Gascony, c.1623: d. Lisbon, 1647. He was arrested by the Inquisition in Bahia dos Santos and sent to Lisbon. Although a Dutch citizen, he was summoned before the tribunal of the Inquisition, where he at once avowed his belief in Judaism and his determination to remain true to the faith. All the endeavors of the inquisitors to convert him to Roman Catholism were in vain. On December 15, 1647 (not September 23, as was erroneously supposed), this young man was led, together with five fellow-sufferers, to the stake. In the midst of the flames he called out in startling tones, \\"Shema' Yisrael! [Hear, O Israel!] The Lord our God is One!\\" With the word \\"Echad\\" (One), he died. For several years the public of Lisbon repeated his last words, so that the Inquisition was finally compelled to interdict this confession of the Jewish faith, under the threat of severe punishment. In Amsterdam the tragic end of the promising young man occasioned deep mourning. A memorial sermon was delivered by Saul Levi Morteira (printed at the press of Isaac's younger brother), and elegies in Hebrew and in Spanish were written in his honor by Solomon de Oliveyra and Jonah Abravanel.

His professional career left impacts in academia, sanitary engineering research, environmental and public health services, engineering professional societies, and journal publications. Wolman is best known for his research with Linn Enslow in the chlorination of Baltimore's municipal water supply, which has contributed to the distribution of safe municipal water supplies globally. Biography = Early Life and Education = Abel Wolman was born to Louis and Rose Wachsman Wolman on June 10, 1892 in Baltimore, Maryland. He was the fourth eldest child of Polish-Jewish immigrants. Wolman received his high school education from the Baltimore City College in 1909. Following his high school education, Wolman received his Bachelor of Arts in 1913 as a pre-med major. Although Wolman was interested in becoming a doctor, his mother's insistence on studying engineering led him to pursue a degree in engineering. He then went on to complete a Bachelor of Science in Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University, graduating in 1915 as the fourth person to receive a degree at the newly-established Whiting School of Engineering. Although Wolman did not complete a doctorate degree, his work in the field of sanitary engineering led to him being awarded an honorary Doctor of Engineering in 1937. Wolman was also awarded a Doctor of Humane Letters from the Maryland Institute College of Arts and a Doctor of Law by the Johns Hopkins University in 1969. = Career =  Public Health  Wolman served an extensive career in sanitary engineering, working in both environmental and public health services as well as in academics. In 1914, he started his long career in public health as an assistant engineer working for the United States Public Health Service. In 1922, Wolman became the Chief Engineer of the Maryland State Department of Health, where he served for 18 years until 1939. He also held various consultancy positions as an consulting engineer for public health organizations, including but not limited to the United States Public Health Service and the United States Army Corps of Engineers from 1927 to 1944 and the United States delegate to the International Health Conference from 1946 to 1950. While working in the public health sector, Wolman conducted research related to sanitation and public health. He is best known for his 1919 contribution, with chemist Linn Enslow, in the standardization of chlorinating Baltimore's drinking-water supply. His efforts there helped develop the plan for Baltimore's water supply so thoroughly and effectively that it remains well-provided for growth through the 21st century. His work also benefited water systems in New York, Detroit and Columbus, Ohio.  Academia  In 1937, Wolman started his official academic career at Johns Hopkins University when he was made Professor of Sanitary Engineering at the Whiting School of Engineering and the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, and his academic career did not end until his death in 1989 at the age of 96. At that same time, he served as the Department of Sanitary Engineering's chairman until his official retirement in 1962. During his time as a sanitary engineering lecturer, he was asked to lecture at many prestigious universities, including Harvard University, Princeton University, University of Southern California, and University of Chicago. He was appointed Professor Emeritus in 1962, but had no desire to retire from professional life, so he continued his teaching and research in addition to serving as a consultant to the many governments and municipalities that requested his advice and assistance.  Professional Societies  Supplementing his professional life, Wolman also held many important positions in the committees of professional societies and journal publications. In 1916, he joined the American Public Health Association as an associate editor of the organization's monthly publication, American Journal of Public Health, where he eventually became the editor in 1955 until 1957. Within the American Public Health Association, Wolman served as Chairman of the Public Health Engineering Section and Chairman of the Committee on Research and Standards. He was also involved heavily with the American Water Works Association, a close affiliate with the American Public Health Association, where Wolman served as the editor of the organization's journal, the Journal of the American Water Works Association, from 1921 to 1937 and eventually became the President of the organization in 1942. = Personal Life and Death = Wolman married Ana Gordon in 1919. Through their marriage, Wolman had one son, named Markley (M.) Gordon Wolman. Maintaining a lively and witty personality, Wolman was favorable amongst many of the students he interacted with as a professor. From colleagues and family members that knew Wolman well, he has been described as being very well-organized and always perceptive towards his problems and analyses related to work. Wolman died at his home in Baltimore, Maryland on February 22, 1989, aged 96 years old. The Abel Wolman Municipal Building, Baltimore, Maryland  Major Accomplishments  = Research Publications =  \\"Chlorine Absorption and the Chlorination of Water\\" (Sept. 1918)  In collaboration with Linn Enslow, Wolman wanted to standardize a chlorination method to purify municipal water supplies. At the time, the purification of water with chlorine was known and employed in cities, but the problem that Wolman and Enslow highlighted in this publication was that the dosage of chlorine used by cities were unreliable and unscientific. As a result, municipal water supplies were often incorrectly purified, leading to failures in performance marked by diseases. Wolman and Enslow began their experiment by describing their observations on the rate of chlorine absorption in different water samples that varied in bacteria, color, turbidity, oxidizable compounds, and other purity factors. After performing thorough statistical analyses on their observed rates of chlorine absorption, Wolman and Enslow proposed a chemical technique to determine the effective disinfection dosage to eliminate bacterial life in the water, which continues to be used in many of today's municipal water supplies.  \\"The Metabolism of Cities\\" (Sept. 1965)  In \\"The Metabolism of Cities\\", Wolman highlighted three major \\"metabolic\\" problems that plagued major cities in the United States and offered his insight on the reality of those problems and possible solutions. He defined the metabolic requirements of a city as all materials and commodities needed to sustain its population, including all processes related to the proper removal and disposal of waste products produced in daily life. However, he pointed out that many major US cities share three metabolic problems: (1) lack of an adequate water supply, (2) ineffective disposal of sewage, and (3) poor control of air pollution. Throughout most of the paper, Wolman provided relevant statistics and figures to underscore the proposed metabolic problems and analyzed historical municipal proposals designed to alleviate those metabolic problems. He concluded the article on a somewhat optimistic note, mentioning that the future of water sanitation, sewage disposal, and eliminating air pollutants is hopeful. However, in order to reach that future, Wolman called for immediate action and planning of policies and programs needed to combat the three metabolic problems. Since the publication of this paper, there have been many studies performed to develop viable solutions to tackle the water shortages, waste disposal, and air pollution issues proposed by Wolman. For example, in 1999, civil and environmental engineers at the University of California, Berkeley published a research paper that confirmed the presence of water shortages in the United States and advocated for cities to take water recycling and reuse measures. = Honors and Awards = For his efforts in public health practices and engineering skills on a local and global level, Wolman was granted multiple awards. In 1948, Wolman was awarded the Sedgwick Memorial Medal by the American Public Health Association for his contributions in the field of public health. In 1960, he was awarded the Albert Lasker Special Award in Public Health, which is an award \\"for outstanding contributions in research related to diseases which are the main causes of death and disability and for distinguished service in the field of public health administration. In 1967, Wolman was awarded the William Procter Prize for Scientific Achievement for his contributions in the field of science. In 1968, Wolman was awarded the first Lewis L. Dollinger Pure Environment Award. In 1973, Wolman was awarded the Milton Stover Eisenhower Medal. In 1974, Wolman was awarded the National Medal of Science. In 1976, Wolman was awarded the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement and the Ben Gurion Award. Both in 1973 and 1977, Wolman was awarded the American Water Works Association Award. In 1986, Wolman was awarded the Robert E. Horton Medal and the John Wesley Powell Award. Finally, in 1999, The Baltimore Sun named Wolman \\"Marylander of the Century\\". In regards to professional societies, Wolman was awarded with honorary memberships in the American Society of Civil Engineers, the American Academy of Environmental Engineers, the Water Pollution Control Federation, the American Water Resources Association, the American Academy of Environmental Engineers, the Franklin Institute, and the Technion of Haifa Board of Directors.  Legacy  = Academic and Social Tributes = Wolman Hall is a dormitory building for first-year students at The Johns Hopkins University. Following the death of Wolman, multiple tributes were created in his honor. For individuals that work in the water industry, the American Water Works Association annually presents the Abel Wolman Award of Excellence since 1985. In May 1966, the Johns Hopkins University named a newly acquired dormitory Wolman Hall, which continues to house first year students. In 1986, the City of Baltimore renamed its public works building to the Abel Wolman Municipal Building, honoring his years of service to the city. Today, the Abel Wolman Municipal Building is where citizens of Baltimore come to pay their property taxes, parking fines and metered water bills.[1] Bibliography *Chlorine absorption and chlorination of water.

Historical background =Oppidum Ubiorum (Latin city of Ubii), Ara Ubiorum and Apud Aram Ubiorum= Ubiermonument (c. AD 4) in the Archaeological Zone A Germanic tribe known as the Eburones had originally inhabited the present-day Cologne Lowland. But they were wiped out in a war of reprisal carried out by Julius Caesar. In 38 BC, the Germanic tribe known as the Ubii, who inhabited the right bank of the Rhine, were resettled by the Roman General Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in the lands in the Cologne Lowland vacated by the Eburones. This brought the Ubii within Roman-occupied territory. The Ubii chose an island in the Rhine as the central location of their settlement area. The island was a natural rise that was protected from flooding. The location of the settlement no longer exists today but it roughly comprises the area between the areas of the Heumarkt and the Alter Markt sections of the old city of Cologne. The settlement can be dated by archeological finds to the first half of the 1st century AD. By this time the typical Roman grid-style street plan was already in use. The settlement’s assumed name is probably Oppidum Ubiorum (Settlement of the Ubii). The Roman epoch of the history of the city of Cologne begins with this oppidum. Map of the Roman province of Germania under Augustus, showing Colonia During the rule of Augustus (30 BC to AD 14), the Ara Ubiorum (Altar of the Ubii) was constructed within the city limits. This altar was possibly foreseen as the central place of worship for a greater Germanic province, which would comprise lands across the Rhine, which remained unconquered at this point. The noble Segimundus is mentioned as the priest of the Ara in the year AD 9. He was from the family of Arminius, leader of the Cherusci. After Arminius' defeat of Publius Quinctilius Varus in the same year at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, the plans for a greater German province were largely set aside. However, the altar itself retained some of its importance as the city is mentioned as “Ara Ubiorum” in many inscriptions. Between 9 and AD 30 the area of present-day Cologne was mainly a garrison. Legion I Germanica and the Legion XX Valeria Victrix were stationed nearby. The place of the initial Roman Castra was known as Apud Aram Ubiorum (At the Altar of the Ubii). The headquarters of Germanicus were located in Cologne from AD 13 to 17, when he was recalled by Tiberius. After the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, Germanicus made efforts to stabilize the border region and to plan and carry out new offensives against the Germanic tribes located on the right bank of the Rhine. With the death of Augustus in AD 14 the legions garrisoned in Cologne mutinied with the aim of establishing Germanicus as emperor. These legions probably united in mutiny with those from Vetera stationed at their summer garrison in Castrum Novasium. Germanicus however remained loyal to Tiberius, who was heir to the throne. He dissuaded the legions from declaring him emperor and at the same time placated the mutineers through generous concessions. Legio I was later stationed in Bonna (present- day Bonn) and Legio XX garrisoned Castrum Novaesium near present-day Neuss. =Promotion to Roman colony= Reconstructed plan of the Roman city of Cologne (after AD 50) Reconstructed model of the Capitoline Temple (early 2nd century AD) Agrippina the younger was born in AD 15 in Cologne. She was the daughter of Germanicus and the wife of the Roman Emperor Claudius. She succeeded in convincing Claudius around 50 AD to elevate her birthplace to Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (Colony of Claudius and Altar of the Agrippinians). This gave Colonia the status of 'city' under Roman law and a Roman colony had many more imperial rights than an oppidum. At this time the city became the administrative capital of Germania Inferior. Before this time the area was not an official province, but an occupied area controlled and administrated initially by the military (exercitus Germaniae inferioris) and later temporarily defined as a tentative \\"Germania provincia\\". From AD 70 on the city had a strong city wall that was c. 8 meters in height and 2.5 meters wide. However, the remains of the Roman city wall that can still be seen today are from the 3rd century AD. The unwalled portions of the city were equal to a square kilometer. Its most important steles and grave goods are preserved in the Romano-Germanic Museum. =The year of four emperors and Batavian revolt= In AD 68, the death of Emperor Nero caused a succession crisis in Rome. This led to a civil war throughout the empire. The Roman Senate installed Servius Sulpicius Galba as emperor, but he was quickly murdered by another contender for the throne, Marcus Salvius Otho, who had the backing of the Praetorian Guard. Meanwhile, the legions stationed in Colonia called for their commander Aulus Vitellius to be crowned as emperor. Vitellius marched on Italy at the head of the better part of the Rhine legions, and defeated Otho’s troops at the First Battle of Bedriacum, in which Otho himself was killed. A power vacuum occurred on the now undefended Rhine border. The Batavians rose and advanced on the empire from the Northeast of Germania Inferior. The majority of the inhabitants of Colonia remained Ubii, as they had not been fully romanised. They quickly sided with the Batavians. However, when the Batavians demanded that the city wall be torn down, the inhabitants of Colonia again sided with the Roman Empire. Vitellius was overthrown eight months later by Titus Flavius Vespasianus, whose troops feared reprisals for having previously recognized Otho as emperor. Vitellius was killed and his body thrown into the Tiber. =Capital of the province Germania Inferior= Fresco with Dionysian scenes from a Roman villa of Cologne (Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium), 3rd century AD, Romano-Germanic Museum With the founding of the province of Germania Inferior under Domitian in AD 89, the commander of the Legions of Lower Germania Colonia became the provincial governor, based in Colonia. In AD 80 a water supply was built, the Eifel Aqueduct, one of the longest aqueducts of the Roman Empire, which delivered 20,000 cubic metres of water to the city every day. Ten years later, the colonia became the capital of the Roman province of Lower Germany, Germania Inferior, with a total population of 20,000 people.Werner Eck: Die CCAA als Provinzhauptstadt und die Vertreter der staatlichen Macht. In: Köln in römischer Zeit. Geschichte einer Stadt im Rahmen des Imperium Romanum. (vol. 1 of the history of the city of Cologne in 13 volumes). Greven, Köln 2004, , pp. 242–272. The Rhine fleet was stationed south of the city at Alteburg. The fortress itself was destroyed in attacks by the Franks in AD 276. This area was later named Alte Burg, from which come the present day names \\"Alteburger Wall\\" and \\"Alteburger Platz\\". With the elevation to provincial capital, Colonia was no longer a military base. The legions of the province were stationed in Vetera II near Colonia Ulpia Traiana (near present-day Xanten), Novaesium and Bonna. The name of the city varied in usage over time. In the 4th century AD it was known as Colonia Agrippina, which was shortened to Colonia sometime after the 5th century. =Late antiquity and the end of Roman rule= In AD 260 Postumus made Cologne the capital of the Gallic Empire, which included the Germanic and Gallic provinces, Britannia and the provinces of Hispania. The Gallic Empire lasted only fourteen years. By the 3rd century, only 20,000 people lived in and around the town as the city was badly affected by the crisis of the 3rd century. In AD 310, Emperor Constantine I had a bridge over the Rhine constructed; this was guarded by the castellum Divitia (nowadays \\"Deutz\\"). In AD 321 Jews are documented in Cologne; when exactly the first Jews arrived in the Rhineland area cannot be established any more, but Cologne's Jewish community claims to be the oldest north of the Alps. Colonia had to be temporarily abandoned in December 355 following a lengthy siege by the Franks. The archaeological strata of that time indicate that conquest and looting had catastrophic effects and the city lay in ruins. The Praetorium was reconstructed and enlarged circa 375 A.D. as seen in the model of the Roman- German Museum in Cologne The last dated reconstruction is from 392/393, when Arbogast, the Magister Militum of the Western half of the Empire, in the name of the emperor Eugenius renewed an unspecified public building. The city finally fell to the Ripuarian Franks in AD 459. Two lavish burial sites near the Cathedral date from this period of late antiquity. Library In Summer 2018, archaeologists declared that the foundations (located at ) that they discovered in 2017 during excavations to build a Protestant church, might be related to the \\"oldest known library in Germany\\", dating back to the 2nd century. The library, which has characteristics similar to those of the Library of Celsus in the ancient city of Ephesus, might have contained more than 20,000 scrolls.

The film received numerous accolades as well as a glowing review from the American film critic Roger Ebert, who later added the film to his list of \\"Great Movies.\\" The screenplay of the film is based on the novel Les Fiançailles de M. Hire by Georges Simenon and has original music by Michael Nyman. Simenon's novel was previously filmed in 1947 by Julien Duvivier as Panique starring Michel Simon. The film was entered in the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. It won the Prix Méliès from the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics and the award for Best Foreign Film at the 27th Guldbagge Awards. Plot Hire (originally Hirovitch) is an isolated bachelor who works as a tailor, with no human contact outside his job beyond occasional visits to a brothel, a skating rink and a bowling alley. Though he talks to no-one and says he dislikes people, he observes them closely and in particular is struck by a young woman called Alice who moves into the building opposite and never closes her blinds. He spends his evenings secretly watching her, with more than just curiosity or lust because he has fallen in love with her. One evening the dead body of a young woman is found nearby and, watching his neighbour, Hire sees her boy friend Émile, a petty criminal, trying to wash blood off his raincoat and hiding a handbag. Hire says nothing to the police, because he wants to protect Alice, but then the police start investigating him, with the inspector trying to trick and intimidate him into confessing to murder. While watching Alice one night from his darkened apartment, a flash of lightning reveals his staring face. Alice is at first horrified at being spied on and then is intrigued at who he can be. She engineers a meeting on the landing outside his flat, but he is too embarrassed to acknowledge her. Next evening she looks openly back at him and indicates that she is coming over. When she comes over, he rejects her advances. In the end, he agrees to meet her at the railway station restaurant, where he declares his love for her. He says he owns a small house in Switzerland to which the two of them could flee, which would separate her from the murderer Émile, with whose crime she is complicit, and get the police off Hire's back. He buys two train tickets, giving one to Alice, and writes a letter to the police inspector denouncing Émile. At the station, Alice does not turn up, so he returns to his apartment. The inspector is there with Alice, who has placed the murdered woman's handbag among Hire's things for the inspector to find. Hire makes a break for it, but falls from the roof and is killed. Only later does the inspector read the letter and find Émile's bloodstained raincoat. Cast * Michel Blanc - Monsieur Hire * Sandrine Bonnaire - Alice * Luc Thuillier - Emile * André Wilms - Inspector Reception Monsieur Hire was one of the last films to have been added by film critic Roger Ebert to his Great Movies section, with Ebert calling Leconte \\"one of the most versatile of French directors.\\" Review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes also reports 100% approval for the film among 13 critics, with an average rating of 8.1/10. Rolling Stone said that Leconte \\"has made an unapologetically romantic film out of a grisly story\\", and called it \\"a spellbinder that digs into the darker recesses of the heart.\\" Entertainment Weekly remarked that the plot \\"is involving in a conventional way, yet it isn’t tricky enough to work on the mystery-thriller level\\", but \\"Blanc’s sad, severe performance holds you, and Sandrine Bonnaire... makes the tenderest of femmes fatales.\\" Time Out said that \\"Michel Blanc's playing of Hire especially intriguing in its cool, sensitive understatement. But it is Leconte's direction that steals the show\\", and his \\"narrative economy contrives to say a great deal about his hapless protagonist.\\" Awards 1989: Prix Méliès 1990: César Award for Best Sound: Dominique Hennequin et Pierre Lenoir.

The game was released in North America on November 13, 2007. Contra 4 was produced by Konami Digital Entertainment in America and developed by WayForward Technologies, making it the first Contra game developed by them, as well as the first original Contra game for a portable platform since the 1991 Game Boy game Operation C. Contra 4 was designed to be a direct sequel to the Contra games for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES (Contra, Super C, and Contra III: The Alien Wars), with a gameplay model similar to those games, and was also in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the original Contra. A mobile phone port was released on November 19, 2007. Plot The plot is set in 2636, six months after the events of Contra III: The Alien Wars and two years before the events of Contra: Rogue Corps. With the Red Falcon alien threat defeated and the Alien Wars over, the Earth is peaceful once again. However, a similar alien entity calling herself Black Viper begins launching similar attacks against the human race, causing mass destruction over the planet. After strange readings are detected at the Galuga archipelago (the setting of the original Contra), the Earth Federation sends their four strongest Contra Force commandos on a final strike mission to destroy Black Viper and her army of aliens, robots, and mutants. The continuity of Contra 4 is based on the Japanese canon that was adapted into the English localization of the series with the release of Contra: Shattered Soldier. However, the game's producers took a number of liberties with the established canon by integrating elements of the American localizations of the older games, thus fusing the two versions together. The alien Black Viper was originally mentioned only in the North American manual of Operation C, whereas the original plot of that game (released as simply \\"Contra\\" in Japan) was about an unnamed superpower creating new weapons using an alien cell. In the timeline presented in the manual and official website, the events of Operation C are interpreted as a previous mission of \\"Mad Dog\\" and \\"Scorpion\\" - two new characters created specifically for Contra 4, against the Black Viper. In actuality, \\"Mad Dog\\" and \\"Scorpion\\" were the names used for Bill and Lance for the North American NES games. Additionally, Operation C was originally a solo mission of Lance Bean, aka Scorpion (as the game was one-player only). Gameplay The cast of Contra 4. From left to right: Mad Dog, Bill Rizer, Lance Bean, and Scorpion Contra 4 is based on the same 2D gameplay system featured in the series through Contra III: The Alien Wars, ignoring many of the game mechanics introduced in later games such as the fixed weapon configurations in Contra: Shattered Soldier and Neo Contra, returning to the old method of picking up power-up icons to obtain new weapons. The play controls are similar to Contra III: The Alien Wars, including the ability to hold two weapons in the player's inventory. The action spans both screens of the Nintendo DS system and a grappling hook can be used by the player's character to latch onto railings, allowing the player's character to move from one screen to the other. Similarly to the arcade version of Super Contra, the player can pick up the same power-up twice, giving them an improved version of the same weapon. The player can also discard a power-up, allowing them to try out a new weapon without losing a previous one. In addition to the standard side view stages, there are also tunnel stages similar to the two \\"3D view\\" stages from the original Contra, in which the perspective shifts behind the character's back. The action in these stages is displayed solely on the upper screen, while the bottom screen is used to display the stage's map and the locations of power-ups. Other than using both screens, Contra 4 makes no usage of the DS' special features such as the touchscreen (besides navigating the main menu), microphone, or multiplayer modes. =Arcade Mode= Arcade Mode is the main portion of the game, which is composed of six standard stages and three tunnel stages, for a total of nine stages. The stages pay frequent homage to Contra, Super Contra (Super C on the NES), Operation C and Contra III: The Alien Wars. Three difficulty settings are available: Easy, Normal, and Hard. Easy is intended to be accessible to novices by providing the player with plenty of lives and credits, as well as making all power-ups upgraded by default, but does not give the player access to the final two stages nor the ending. Normal is a moderate setting described to be \\"as difficult as the original Contra\\", whereas Hard features faster-moving enemies and enemy fire, with fewer lives. Hard mode also features a different ending from Normal. =Challenge Mode= After completing the main game (Arcade Mode) once on any difficulty setting, a Challenge Mode will be made available in the main menu. This game mode is composed of forty different challenges in which the player must complete various tasks within the side-scrolling stages of Arcade Mode. =Music= The music and sound effects were handled by famed video game music remixer Jake Kaufman, who also composed for Shantae and founded the game music remix site VGMix. The soundtrack consists of a few arrangements of music from previous Contra games as well as new material. When Arcade Mode is played on the Hard setting, an arranged version of the Jungle theme from the original Contra is played instead of the standard stage music. The standard Jungle theme is actually an enhanced version of a \\"Contra style\\" chiptune song previously posted on Kaufman's website, called \\"Vile Red Falcon.\\"Vile Red Falcon (Contra) by Virt A soundtrack CD was announced by Konami to be bundled in the first print of the Japanese release of Contra: Dual Spirits, as a gift for preorders through the KonamiStyle shop. This deal was only available for Japanese residents. In addition to the music found in the game, a 4-minute live performance of the \\"Harbor\\" song is included as a bonus track. The song is performed by The Smash Bros, Jake Kaufman's video game tribute band. Reception Contra 4 received positive reviews from critics, scoring an 83 out of 100 on Metacritic. Contra 4 has been hailed as a rebirth of the Contra franchise, returning the gameplay to the classic roots of the series. It has garnered multiple awards including IGN's \\"Best Action Game\\" and \\"Best Revival\\" of 2007,DS - Best Action Game of 2007 - IGNDS - Best Revival of 2007 - IGN and GameSpy's 7th best DS game of 2007.

Republican marriage () was a method of execution that allegedly occurred in Nantes during the Reign of Terror in Revolutionary France and \\"involved tying a naked man and woman together and drowning them\\".Ruth Scurr, Fatal Purity: Robespierre And the French Revolution (2006) p. 305. This was reported to have been practised during the drownings at Nantes (noyades) that were ordered by local Jacobin representative-on-mission Jean-Baptiste Carrier between November 1793 and January 1794 in the city of Nantes. Most accounts indicate that the victims were drowned in the Loire River, although a few sources describe an alternative means of execution in which the bound couple is run through with a sword, either before,William Stafford, English Feminists and Their Opponents in the 1790s: unsex'd and proper females (2002) p. 161. or instead of drowning.Steven Blakemore, Crisis in Representation: Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, Helen Maria Williams and the Rewriting of the French Revolution (1997) p. 212. The earliest reports of such \\"marriages\\" date from 1794, when Carrier was tried for his crimes, and they were soon cited by contemporary counter-revolutionary authors such as Louis-Marie Prudhomme and Louis Gabriel Ambroise de Bonald.Louis-Marie Prudhomme, Histoire Générale Et Impartiale Des Erreurs, Des Fautes Et Des Crimes Commis Pendant La Révolution Française, Tome III (1797), p. vii (referring to \\"Mariages républicains à Nantes. Deux personnes de différens sexes, nuds, étaient attachées ensemble, on les précipitait ensuite en masse dans la Loire\\" [Republican marriages in Nantes. Two people of different sexes, nude, were attached together, then put en masse into the Loire].\\"The dreadful invention of the republican marriages passes the genius of man\\", Louis Gabriel Ambroise de Bonald, Théorie du pouvoir politique et religieux dans la société civile (1796), p. 558.  Descriptions of the practice  Jean-Baptiste Carrier is popularly cited as having devised this method of execution. This form of execution is attributed to French Revolutionary Jean-Baptiste Carrier,Archibald Alison and Edward Sherman Gould, History of Europe from the Commencement of the French Revolution in 1789, to the Restoration of the Bourbons in 1815 (1850) p. 44. who was sent to Nantes to suppress the counterrevolutionary forces and to appoint a Revolutionary Committee. One historian described the use of the practice as follows: Details of the practice vary slightly, but are generally consistent with the description offered above. One author described how \\"marriages Républicains... consisted in binding together a man and woman, back to back, stripped naked, keeping them exposed for an hour, and then hurling them into the current of \\"la Baignoire Nationale\\", as the bloodhounds termed the Loire\\". British radical and Girondist sympathizer Helen Maria Williams, in her Sketch of the Politics of France, 1793–94,Helen Maria Williams, Sketch of the Politics of France, 1793–94 (1795), p. 42-43. wrote that \\"innocent young women were unclothed in the presence of the monsters; and, to add a deeper horror to this infernal act of cruelty, were tied to young men, and both were cut down with sabers, or thrown into the river; and this kind of murder was called a republican marriage\\". According to literary scholar Steven Blakemore, Williams seems to have regarded this as a form of \\"terrorist misogynism\\". Williams' description of the women as \\"innocent\\", in his view, \\"not only suggests that they were not guilty of aiding the rebels, but that they were young 'virgins'\\". He argues that in Williams' text, the male Jacobin executioners are portrayed as \\"sadistic, public voyeurs who delight in tying 'counter-revolutionary' men and women into forced positions of sterile intercourse, in a grotesque 'marriage' of the soon-to-be dead\\". Thus, \\"if the Old Regime, for Williams, represents the forced confinement of female beauty, the Terror represents beauty's degrading death\\".  Skepticism  While the executions of men, women and children by drowning in Nantes is not generally disputed, the factual nature of the \\"republican marriages,\\" in particular, has been doubted by several historians who alleged it to be a legend.Bertrand, Ernest. 1868. La justice révolutionnaire en France du 17 août 1792 au 12 prairial an III (31 mai 1793), 17:e article, Annuaire de la Société philotechnique, 1868, tome 30, p. 7-92.Alain Gérard (1993). La Vendée: 1789–1793. p.265-266 The claim that such a manner of execution has been practiced and ordered by Carrier appears for the first time in the trial of the members of the Revolutionary Committee of Nantes by the Revolutionary Tribunal in 1794. It was present in the report of Charles-Gilbert Romme and in several letters and witness testimonies. However, while a few witnesses asserted that they had heard about \\"republican marriages\\", none had actually seen one; one cited a drunken boatman who had used the term \\"civic marriage\\" but hadn't suggested that the executed were paired according to sex.Title unknown, L'intermediaire des chercheurs et curieux, 1866. P.244 As both the assistant-prosecutor and the defence mentioned, there was not enough evidence for that particular accusation, and it was crossed out from the indictment by the president of the jury. The remaining facts were entirely sufficient for Carrier and several of his closest accomplices to be sentenced to death. The reports of \\"republican marriages\\" nevertheless became well-known and were later cited by many authors writing about the Terror, who would elaborate on them, for example by adding the claim that the two victims were a priest and a nun.Brégeon, Jean-Joël. 1987. Carrier et la Terreur nantaise, p.169-171  Origin of the term  The use of the term appears to be a mockery of the concept of \\"republican marriage\\" as an actual \\"secular\\" marriage. Books describe parents horrified to learn that their children planned a \\"republican marriage\\" instead of being married in a church.John Sartain, et al., Friendship's Offering (1854), p. 271: \\"No priest dare marry us, dearest, and I cannot respect a republican marriage!\\"Laure Junot Abrantès, Memoirs of the Duchess D'Abrantès (Madame Junot) (1832) p. 294: [asked whether her daughter would be married in a church] \\"How could you for a moment entertain the idea that not my daughter only, but myself and her brother, could consent to a purely republican marriage?\\"Charles Brockden Brown, The Literary Magazine, and American Register (1804), p. 73: \\"There are many persons here, who are not content with a republican marriage, but get themselves also privately married by a priest, according to the forms of the Catholic religion\\".

A reverse commute is a round trip, regularly taken, from an urban area to a suburban one in the morning, and returning in the evening. It is almost universally applied to trips to work in the suburbs from homes in the city. This is in opposition to the regular commute, where a person lives in the suburbs and travels to work in the city. The reverse commuter travels in the opposite direction of the regular daily traffic flow, and therefore encounters less road traffic congestion faced by regular commuters. An advantage of this system is the usage of otherwise empty transit capacity: no additional trains or travel lanes are necessary to accommodate people riding or driving from downtown to the outskirts in the morning, and likewise back downtown at night. Train and bus routes may be more sparse in the reverse direction, but the vehicles have to get back somehow for their next journey in most cases. However, track capacity on some train routes like the Long Island Rail Road Ronkonkoma Branch and the New Jersey Transit Gladstone Branch in the US significantly reduces or even eliminates reverse commute options. Hence, transit usage can be lower for reverse-commuters than regular commuters. In some cases, reverse commuting has become quite popular. For example, Metro-North Railroad runs rush hour New Haven Line trains from New York City to Stamford, CT and surrounding suburbs to accommodate its many reverse commuters. Low unemployment rates in the suburbs may help to fuel the increase over the past years in reverse commuter ridership. But the very reasons commuting makes sense (such as higher employment in the city and lower housing prices in the suburbs) operate against the reverse commuter, so people doing so are less common compared to those going the other way. However, these traditional schools of thought are changing, especially in Southern and Western US cities, where employment options tend to follow a more decentralized or polycentric model than Midwest or Eastern US cities. For instance, on the Santa Monica Freeway in Los Angeles, there are more vehicles in the morning peak hour heading westbound towards Santa Monica than into Downtown Los Angeles. An example of reverse commuting can be found in the Washington Metropolitan Area. Due to a combination of ample transit infrastructure and the height limit in downtown, employment options in the area follow a polycentric model, heavily focused in both Downtown and areas such as Arlington, Tysons, Bethesda, and Silver Spring. Companies desiring space in Washington often opt for space in Maryland or Virginia because of the great expense of office space downtown. As such, there are many people who live in Washington and work in Maryland and Virginia, either driving, taking Metrobus, Metrorail, or carpooling.

Freedom From Religion Foundation, 551 U.S. 587 (2007), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court which ruled that taxpayers do not have the right to challenge the constitutionality of expenditures by the executive branch of the government.. The issue was whether taxpayers have the right to challenge the existence of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.https://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/06-00157qp.pdf The case centered on three Supreme Court precedents: Flast v. Cohen,. Bowen v. Kendrick,. and Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church & State.. In a 5-4 vote the Supreme Court ruled that the Foundation did not have standing to sue and ordered the Appeals court finding reversed. Background In January 2001, President George W. Bush created the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives within the Executive Office of the President by an Executive Order. Later Executive Orders created centers for the Office within the Departments of Justice, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Education, and Agriculture, as well as at the Agency for International Development. The Freedom From Religion Foundation and three of its members (Anne Nicol Gaylor, Annie Laurie Gaylor, and Dan Barker) filed an action against the Director of the White House Office and the Directors of Centers of the Office created within the above-mentioned Federal Departments. The Foundation and its members asserted standing based solely on their status as federal taxpayers. It was noted that \\"Because the Foundation itself is a non-profit entity that is exempt from paying federal income taxes under 26 USC 501(c)(3), the Foundation lacks taxpayer status in its own right, and can assert it, if at all, only on behalf of its taxpaying members. See Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 40 (1976).\\" The Foundation and its members complaint was over \\"the use of money appropriated by Congress under Article I, section 8, to fund conferences that various executive branch agencies hold to promote President Bush’s 'Faith- Based and Community Initiatives.'\\" The Foundation held that \\"the defendant officials violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by organizing national and regional conferences at which faith-based organizations allegedly 'are singled out as being particularly worthy of federal funding because of their religious orientation, and the belief in God is extolled as distinguishing the claimed effectiveness of faith-based social services.'\\" They also alleged that \\"the defendant officials 'engage in myriad activities, such as making public appearances and giving speeches, throughout the United States, intended to promote and advocate for funding for faith- based organizations.'\\" They further asserted that \\"Congressional appropriations [are] used to support the activities of the defendants.\\" The Foundation and its members sought a \\"declaratory judgment that the officials' activities violate the Establishment Clause, an injunction prohibiting further 'use [of] appropriations in violation of the Establishment Clause,' and 'an order requiring the defendants to establish rules, regulations, prohibitions, standards and oversight to ensure that future appropriations' comport with the Establishment Clause.\\" The Directors of the White House Office and its centers, moved that the complaint against them be dismissed for lack of standing. Lower courts =District court= The motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing was granted by the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. The court held Establishment Clause challenge standing was limited to \\"exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Article 1, § 8.\\" They held that the action of the directors \\"are not 'exercises of congressional power' as required by the Flast test.\\" The court noted that in Bowen v. Kendrick, it was \\"clarified that the disbursement of federal funds by an Executive agency in the administration of a congressional program could be challenged consistent with Flast\\", but they pointed out that \\"The President established the White House OFBCI by Executive Order and funded it with general budget appropriations.\\" They found that this meant that the Director of the office and other officials working within the program \\"have no congressional mandate. Rather, he acts at the President’s request and on the President’s behalf\\", so none of them were \\"charged with the administration of congressional programs.\\" They stated that \\"The view that federal taxpayers as such should be permitted to bring Establishment Clause challenges to all Executive Branch actions on the grounds that those actions are funded by congressional appropriations, has never been accepted by a majority of the Supreme Court.\\" Dismissal of claims The Foundation and its members had also brought suit against Rod Paige, United States Secretary of Education from 2001 to 2005. This was over a keynote speech at a White House Conference on Faith-Based and Community Initiatives in October 2002 where Paige said \\"With the stroke of a pen, the President signaled that this Administration will knock down any barrier, will do whatever it takes to get people of faith and goodwill involved in helping solve some of the problems in our society today. Now, President Bush does this because he knows first-hand that power of faith to change lives—from the inside out. And the reason he knows this is because faith changed his life ... He grew up in church, but like most of us, he didn’t always walk the walk. Many years ago, at a particularly low point in his life, he realized that something was missing. Fortunately for him, he bumped into the Reverend Billy Graham. And they had a long, long, long conversation. And he made a decision coming out of that conversation that changed his life. And he believes that if it can change his life, it can change the lives of others as well. And that is why he is so committed to this. So the reason we’re all here today is not because some politician needs to knock off one more thing on his ‘to do’ list. We are here because we have a President, who is true, is a true man of God. A man who prays every day. And I think together, we can really make a difference for mankind, for Americans, we can make America a better place. We can, and I enjoyed the prayer, as we began, served, getting food. He said, if the Jews could be better Jews, and if Christians could be better Christians, if all of us could just be a little better ourselves, what a difference that would make in this world, what a difference that would make.\\" The Foundation and its members had held that this \\"gave the appearance of endorsing religion.\\" The court ruled \\"These statements ... are too far removed from any congressional action taken pursuant to the taxing and spending clause of Art. I, § 8, of the Constitution to satisfy the Flast test. Defendant Paige will be dismissed\\". The Foundation also voluntarily dismissed several \\"claims that the heads of certain federal agencies had violated the Establishment Clause by 'directly and preferentially fund[ing]' particular programs that allegedly 'integrate religion as a substantive and integral component' of their activities.\\" They maintained their claims on two programs administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Summary judgment motions The Foundation and its members had requested a summary judgment against Emory University and MentorKids USA. Emory University had received funds from the Department of Health and Human Services' Compassion Capital Fund Grant for its \\"Strong Partners Initiative\\". Emory divided and distributed some of this funding to other groups that met its criteria. The Foundation claimed that Emory's use of the government funds had violated the Establishment Clause by giving \\"preferential treatment to religious organizations in their selection of organizations for subawards under the grant.\\" The court granted the petition to make summary judgment holding that the Foundation did have standing under Flast because the grant issued to Emory stemmed from a program Congress established in the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Amendments of 2001, Pub. L. No. 107-133. Upon review of the claims brought forward by the Foundation the court did not find that Emory's selection process favored religious organizations, and ruled that the Foundation \\"failed to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to Emory University’s CCF grant.\\" The court agreed with the government that as the Foundation had failed to substantiate claims against Emory there was no real dispute and so summary judgment could be, and was, made \\"in favor of defendants against plaintiffs affirming the Department of Health and Human Service's Compassion Capital Fund Grant to Emory University.\\" The Foundation also asked for a summary judgment on whether the group MentorKids USA a recipient of a subaward from Emory had violated the Establishment Clause. Again the court cited Flast and the same Congressional act as it had above to grant the Foundation standing in this instance as well. MentorKids' stated mission was to \\"exalt the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God,\\" they hired only Christians as mentors, and required them to give monthly reports on the progression of their mentee's \\"relationship with God.\\" Upon learning of this the Department of Health and Human Service had suspended MentorKids' grant. The court acknowledged that the grant had been suspended but ruled that \\"Defendants must bear the heavy burden to prove that there is no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated. ... Defendants have failed to meet this burden, having failed to provide sufficient assurances that the grant will not be reinstated.\\" Because of this the court made summary judgment for the Foundation ruling that the \\"grant to MentorKids USA is vacated and further funding is denied as it relates to its present structure.\\" =Appeals court= The district court's decision was appealed and heard by a panel of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals on September 13, 2005. The Appeals court made a decision on January 13, 2006 that vacated the order of dismissal and remanded the decision. Judge Richard Posner, writing for the majority, held that \\"Taxpayers have standing to challenge an executive-branch program, alleged to promote religion, that is financed by a congressional appropriation, even if the program was created entirely within the executive branch, as by Presidential executive order,\\" as long as the actions of the Executive Branch officials are financed by general appropriations.Chao, 433 F.3d at 996-97. The majority held that taxpayer standing \\"extends beyond programs that allocate federal funding to third parties, and includes challenges to any Executive Branch activity funded \\"from appropriations for the general administrative expenses, over which the President and other executive branch officials have a degree of discretionary power ... [as opposed to funding] from, say, voluntary donations by private citizens.\\" They held that standing exists even without a statutory program enacted by Congress and even if the taxpayer is \\"unable to identify the appropriations that fund the [challenged activity]\\".Chao, 433 F.3d at 994. The court rejected the government's position that programs created solely from the Executive branch funded through general appropriations were beyond challenge by individual taxpayers. They put forward a hypothetical saying that if \\"the Secretary of Homeland Security, who has unearmarked funds in his budget, decided to build a mosque and pay an Imam a salary to preach in it because the Secretary believed that federal financial assistance to Islam would reduce the likelihood of Islamist terrorism in the United States\\" this would surely not be allowed to stand. They said that in \\"the hypothetical case of the mosque, and in the real though much less dramatic case before us, the objection is to a program for which money undoubtedly is 'appropriated,' albeit by executive officials from discretionary funds handed them by Congress, rather than by Congress directly.\\"Chao, 433 F.3d at 995. The court noted that the plaintiffs were challenging not \\"the grants but the conferences\\" which are \\"concerned in part with instructing the attendants on how to apply for government grants for their religious organizations.\\" They held that the government's position that only the grants could be challenged, not the conferences \\"would be artificial because there is so much that executive officials could do to promote religion in ways forbidden by the establishment clause (which despite its wording applies to executive as well as congressional action) without making outright grants to religious organizations. For the government to operate a mosque or other place of worship would not involve a grant unless a contractor was involved.\\"Chao, 433 F.3d at 995 (internal citation omitted). The court dismissed the government's position that there could be no standing because the plaintiffs had not shown that their taxes were increased because general Congressional appropriations to the Executive branch were used to support the activities of the directors. They held that producing a proof that would show how many funds the plaintiffs would save if the situation was different was unnecessary in cases like this one as \\"the tangible harm would often be zero because if the complained-of expenditure was enjoined, the money would probably be used to defray some other public expense that would not benefit the taxpayer, rather than returned to him in the form of a lower tax rate.\\"Chao, 433 F.3d at 990. Dissent Appeals court Judge Kenneth Francis Ripple wrote a dissent that said allowing such taxpayer challenges to the conduct of Executive Branch officials \\"so long as that conduct was financed in some manner by a congressional appropriation\\" reflects a \\"dramatic expansion of current standing doctrine.\\"Chao, 433 F.3d at 997 (Ripple, J., dissenting). He held that the Judiciary had allowed taxpayer standing in Establishment Clause cases to prevent Congress from \\"support[ing] a sectarian cause through the transfer of public funds,\\" as this was \\"one of the specific evils feared by those who drafted the Establishment Clause and fought for its adoption.\\"Chao, 433 F.3d at 998 (Ripple, J., dissenting). Judge Ripple pointed to the general rule that a plaintiff had to “establish a nexus between his status as a taxpayer and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.” He held that the Foundation and its members had failed to “set forth with sufficient rigor a nexus between their status as taxpayers and an exercise of the congressional power under the Taxing and Spending Clause.” He wrote that they should not be given standing as “A lawsuit based on such undifferentiated injury — a mere disagreement with the government policy — is hardly the case and controversy within the jurisdiction of the federal courts.” In support of his position Ripple pointed to Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, which denied standing to taxpayer plaintiffs because they “did not challenge an enactment under Art. I, § 8, but rather the action of the Executive Branch”.Chao, 433 F.3d at 1000 (Ripple, J., dissenting, quoting ). He also pointed to the decision of the D.C. Circuit Court decision in District of Columbia Common Cause v. District of Columbia, which held that the \\"[Supreme] Court has never recognized federal taxpayer standing outside [of Flast’s] narrow facts, and it has refused to extend Flast to exercises of executive power.\\"Chao, 433 F.3d at 1001 (Ripple, J., dissenting, quoting District of Columbia Common Cause v. District of Columbia, 858 F.2d 1, 3-4 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). Rehearing denied The government filed a petition for rehearing by the Appeals court but it was denied on May 3, 2006 by a vote of 7-4. Two of the judges voting against the rehearing gave their reasoning writing that \\"the obvious tension which has evolved in this area of jurisprudence ... can only be resolved by the Supreme Court ... [and] the needed consideration of this important issue by that tribunal would be unnecessarily delayed by our further deliberation.\\"Chao, 447 F.3d at 988 (Flaum, C.J., concurring). The dissenting judges who voted for the case to be reheard at the Appeals level wrote that \\"the panel’s decision 'has serious implications for judicial governance,' and 'departs significantly from established Supreme Court precedent and creates an inter-circuit conflict ... the Supreme Court, in making an exception to usual standing rules for taxpayers has drawn a very clean line in order to avoid making the federal courts a forum for all sorts of complaints about the conduct of governmental affairs on no basis other than citizen standing.'\\"Chao, 447 F.3d at 991 (Ripple, J., concurring). Supreme Court proceedings =Petition for certiorari= The government petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case saying that the appeals court decision \\"transforms taxpayer standing in the Establishment Clause context from a narrow exception, designed to prevent the specific historic evil of direct legislative subsidization of religious entities, into a roving license for any 'individual citizen to challenge any action of the executive with which he disagrees, as violative of the establishment Clause.'\\" The petition said the ruling \\"cuts taxpayer standing from its constitutional and historical moorings\\" and contravened judicial precedents \\"and the decisions of other circuits.\\" Certiorari was granted on December 1, 2006. Government's position The Directors' position was argued for by a team headed by United States Solicitor General Paul Clement. They cited Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,. saying that the Judiciary was Constitutionally limited to hear \\"actual 'Cases' and 'Controversies.'\\" For this to be so, the plaintiff must \\"have suffered an 'injury in fact' in the form of the 'invasion of a legally protected interest,' that is both 'concrete and particularized' and 'actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.'\\" They cited DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 126 S. Ct. 1854, 1862 (2006), saying that \\"Standing has been rejected in such cases because the alleged injury is not 'concrete and particularized,' but instead a grievance the taxpayer 'suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally,' and because the injury is not 'actual or imminent,' but instead 'conjectural or hypothetical.'\\" On a similar note they cited Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 487 (1923) that \\"a federal taxpayer’s interest in the moneys of the treasury 'is shared with millions of others; is comparatively minute and indeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation, of any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court of equity.'\\" The government's lawyers also cited Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., saying \\"'Proper regard for the complex nature of our constitutional structure requires' that courts not 'hospitably accept for adjudication claims of constitutional violation by other branches of government where the claimant has not suffered cognizable injury.'\\" They pointed out that in the Valley Forge case the plaintiffs had not been granted standing because they were challenging \\"not a congressional action, but a decision by [a federal agency] to transfer a parcel of federal property.\\" The Court had ruled that \\"the expenditure of public funds in an allegedly unconstitutional manner is not an injury sufficient to confer standing ... [and taxpayer standing is confined to] \\"challenges directed only [at] exercises of congressional power.\\" \\"A constitutional objection to \\"a particular Executive Branch action arguably authorized by [an] Act [of Congress]\\" will not suffice.\\" In further support of their position that Flast was limited to acts of Congress the government also cited decisions of Appeals Court of the Second Circuit, namely In re United States Catholic Conference, 885 F.2d 1020 (1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 918 (1990) and Lamont v. Woods, 948 F.2d 825 (1991) (which they saw as upholding not limiting the Catholic Conference decision as the Foundation did). In rebuttal to the Foundation's protest that the directors \\"engage in myriad activities, such as making public appearances and giving speeches, throughout the United States, intended to promote and advocate for funding for faith-based organizations\\" the government said \\"that pay for the federal officials' salaries and offices, which would be appropriated whether or not the officials engaged in the conduct respondents challenge.\\" They likened the situation to those behind the ruling of Doremus v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 429 (1952) where standing was not granted as school teachers would receive the same salary whether they read from the Old Testament or did not. The government likened the use of funds to hold conferences for religious organizations seeking funding to the \\"payment of government officials' salaries when they make speeches or attend meetings, even with religious content.\\" They held that if the Court allowed the Appeals court position to stand then taxpayers could sue over the use of taxes to fund the electricity to power the microphone and the lights during a speech where the President might express his own religious sentiments. They pointed out that \\"from President Washington to President Lincoln to the present day, Presidents and other Executive Branch officials have made speeches invoking religion and have met with religious leaders without constitutional incident.\\" The government also maintained that a secular applicant for a grant who believed that their organization was passed up because they were not religious \\"even apart from Flast ... would have standing to sue.\\" They also held that while it was true that there might be \\"no available plaintiff to challenge the preliminary deliberative process that led to the grant, that is only because deliberations, apart from the disbursement of funds, inflict, at most, an inchoate injury.\\" Position of Foundation and its members The Freedom from Religion Foundation and its members point out that even the government lawyers did not deny that the funds involved \\"derived from Congressional tax appropriations.\\" They said the government was trying to \\"distinguish between general budget appropriations made by Congress and tax appropriations made to specific 'spending programs.'\\" They said such a claim of distinction \\"is not based upon any principle of differential responsibility or culpability by Congress in making appropriations that are allegedly misused.\\" They held that the government was urging the Court to accept the idea of distinction because of \\"a belief that the executive branch should be able to use Congressional tax appropriations without accountability under the Establishment Clause.\\" The Foundation pointed to Bowen v. Kendrick, saying that in that case the Congress had made a program that was not in violation of the Establishment Clause but the Court allowed taxpayer standing because the Executive branch was accused of violating the Establishment Clause in its execution of the program. They said \\"Despite the blamelessness of Congress in Bowen, the Supreme Court further considered whether the expenditure of tax appropriations was unconstitutional 'as applied.' The defendants in Bowen argued that a challenge to expenditures 'as applied' was really a challenge to executive action, not to an exercise of Congressional authority under the Taxing and Spending Clause. The Court rejected this argument.\\" From this the Foundation concluded that \\"The originating source of misused funds from tax appropriations is the critical taxpayer standing factor, rather than any decisional culpability by Congress for the actual misuse.\\" They argued that the Seventh Circuit Court's decision granting standing should be upheld for \\"to hold otherwise would countenance a distinction without a meaning – and insulate a substantial part of federal spending of taxpayer appropriations from any obligation to comply with the Establishment Clause. ... [and] would support the unprecedented proposition that entire blocks of executive spending would not be subject to the Establishment Clause, i.e., as an executive function that is merely funded by taxpayer appropriations. ...[The government's] argument would support the incongruous proposition that such spending, when pursued by the executive branch with Congressional appropriations, cannot be challenged by taxpayers objecting to the use of tax appropriations to endorse religion.\\" The Foundation and its members said that the government was arguing \\"implicitly, but incorrectly assumes that the Establishment Clause operates only as a limitation on Congress.\\" They pointed out that the courts \\"have consistently recognized that the executive branch is subject to the prohibitions of the Establishment Clause. In Schrum v. City of Coweta, 449 F.3d 1132, 1140-1143 (10th Cir. 2006), the Eleventh Circuit rejected an argument that the First Amendment proscriptions do not apply to executive action. The Court recognized that the Supreme Court has assumed on countless occasions that the Free Exercise Clause applies to executive action. Similarly, in the present case, the fact that executive branch actions are challenged is not a bar to an Establishment Clause claim; taxpayer standing requires only that the executive action involve the misuse of tax money raised through a Congressional appropriation.\\" The Foundation said that the Appeals Court \\"rejected the argument that general budget appropriations may be used by executive officials to endorse religion.\\" In support of this finding they also cited Minnesota Federation of Teachers v. Randall, 891 F.2d 1354, 1358 (8th Cir. 1989), where \\"the Eighth Circuit specifically rejected any notion that taxpayers only have standing where a special tax assessment was levied to pay for an expenditure that promoted religion.\\" In Randall the court said that if such a rule was adopted \\"when expenditures are made from general funds, no one would be able to challenge Establishment Clause violations. We believe taxpayer standing was created to specifically permit the airing of establishment claims.\\" The Foundation also cited Mehdi and Chankan v. United States Postal Service, 988 F. Supp. 721 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), which \\"involved a claim that the United States Postal Service violated the Establishment Clause by maintaining sectarian displays with federal tax appropriations. The court concluded that the plaintiffs had standing as taxpayers to challenge the government expenditures, made pursuant to Congress’ Taxing and Spending power, as violative of the Establishment Clause.\\" They said that under the government's argument \\"such expenditures would not be actionable by taxpayers because they are not part of a Congressional 'spending program.'\\" The Foundation said that the government's call for a distinction to \\"be recognized between appropriations for 'Congressional programs' and 'general budget appropriations' made to fund executive operations\\", was not recognized conceptually or legally. They said the government had cited \\"no decision that recognizes such a distinction between Congressional appropriation bills, nor is the distinction between Congressional appropriation bills, nor is the distinction provided with any conceptual plausibility.\\" They said \\"The Constitution does not distinguish between Congressional appropriations made to administrative 'spending programs' and Congressional budget appropriations made to the executive branch. All appropriations require Congressional legislative action. The Congressional 'power of the purse' refers to this exclusive power of Congress to appropriate funds, which power derives from specific provisions of the Constitution, including Article I, § 8, which empowers Congress to 'pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States.' The Appropriations Clause, Article I, § 9, Cl. 7, further provides that 'no Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.'\\" The Foundation held that the Appropriations Clause negated the government's claim that there was a distinction between Congressional programs and general budget appropriations. They cited Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U.S. 308, 321 (1937) \\"No money can be paid out of the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an act of Congress.\\" They said \\"Regardless of the nature of the payment – salaries, payments promised under contract, etc., no payment may be made from the United States Treasury unless Congress has made the funds available. As the Supreme Court stated more than a century ago: 'However much money may be in the Treasury at one time, not a dollar of it can be used in the payment of anything not previously sanctioned by a Congressional appropriation.' Reeside v. Walker, 52 U.S. 272, 291 (1850). ... the Supreme Court has consistently held that any exercise of power by a government agency 'is limited by a valid reservation of Congressional control over funds in the Treasury.' Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 425 (1990), 'Money may be paid out only through an appropriation made by law; in other words, the payment of money from the Treasury must be authorized by a statute.' Id. at 424. As a consequence, budget appropriation bills are enacted by Congress just as all other legislation. The Supreme Court described this process in Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 448 (1998). The Foundation said that the government's claim that if standing was allowed that this \\"opened a floodgate\\" of litigation into the Federal courts. They pointed out that Flast \\"only allows taxpayer standing to challenge misuse of Congressional appropriations that are used to endorse religion.\\" They said that despite the Flast decision in 1968 there has been no flood, \\"Limiting taxpayer standing to Establishment Clause transgressions has been an effective gatekeeper. ... [the government lawyers] incorrectly claim that recognition of standing would open the courthouse doors to all generalized grievances that citizens may have with policies pursued by the government. Only misuses of appropriations in violation of the Establishment Clause confer taxpayer standing.\\" =Oral arguments= In addition to the positions laid out above both sides expanded their statements before the Supreme Court. Clement's remarks Solicitor General Paul D. Clement told the Court that he believed that even if the program had been set up by Congress instead of by an Executive Order there would still not be any standing for a taxpayer to sue, \\"Because there has to be two things. There has to be a statute. And then there has to be an allegation that the statute creates a unique injury in the context of spending that affects taxpayers differently than anybody--than any other citizen. And if you have a situation ... where you don't have any spending that goes outside of the Government, then you might have an establishment clause problem, but it wouldn't be an establishment clause problem where the nub of the problem is the fact that money is spent.\\" When asked by Justice Antonin Scalia \\"If the congressional statute says the Government will build a church, that's okay, because then the money doesn't go outside the Government?\\" Clement said there would be no taxpayer standing in the case of an \\"internal Government church\\" but \\"Anybody who's subjected to the mass at the church probably has standing\\". He opined that \\"in the context of the internal Government church, the fact that money is being spent to establish that church is the least of your concerns. It's the fact that the Government is establishing it [in violation of the Establishment clause of the First Amendment] that's the principal concern.\\" Clement said that whether taxpayers would have standing if the government hired an outside party to hold the conferences for the Faith Based and Community Initiatives program would be dependent on circumstances. He opined that it would be likely that a taxpayer would have standing if the program paid for plane tickets for ministers, but when pressed by Scalia clarified that he thought if the funds were coming from the President and \\"he's taking it from a general appropriation that makes no indication it's to go outside the Government so one could not in any way articulate that as an as-applied challenge to the appropriations, then I suppose that there would not be standing.\\" When Justice Stephen Breyer asked if \\"Congress passes a law and it says it's a very nice thing to commemorate the Pilgrims by building a Government church at Plymouth Rock, where we will have the regular worship in the Puritan religion. Now can a taxpayer from California in your view challenge that?\\" Clement responded \\"I say no. I would say no, no.\\" Because in his reading of Flast, \\"You need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the taxing and spending authority; but then you need the money to go outside the Government.\\" Breyer than asked if \\"All over America, they build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress passes a statute and says in every city, town, and hamlet, we are going to have a minister, a Government minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the proposition that this particular sect is the true sect; and they pass a statute like that, nobody could challenge it?\\" Clement answered \\"I think the bottom line is that there would not be taxpayer standing. Plenty of people could probably challenge that [as a violation of the Establishment Clause].\\" Clements agreed with Chief Justice John Roberts's summary of the government's position \\"is simply that somebody -somebody in Oregon can't challenge the fact that they're building a church in Florida simply because the person in Florida pays taxes\\". Clements also answered a question from Justice Samuel Alito admitting that his argument was not designed to \\"make a lot of sense in an abstract sense\\" but \\"is the best that can be done within the body of precedent that the Court has handed down in this area\\". Pincus' remarks On behalf of the Foundation and its members attorney Andrew J. Pincus, co- director of the Yale Law School Supreme Court Clinic, addressed the Court. He said that there was nothing in Judicial history declaring that for standing to be allowed within Flast the money has to go outside the Government. For an example he pointed out that \\"the lower courts and this Court at least in part have found taxpayer standing to challenge the salaries paid to chaplains that are employed by the Government\\". Chief Justice Roberts asked if under the Foundation's interpretation of Flast a taxpayer could \\"sue our Marshal for standing up and saying 'God save the United States and this honorable Court.' Her salary comes from Congress.\\" Pincus said he thought standing would not apply in that situation because \\"We think that the limitations that are in this Court's opinions require the taxpayer to identify a discrete and identifiable non-incidental expenditure.\\" Justice Scalia asked if under the Appeal's court ruling standing would be given a taxpayer against the President as \\"It is easy to tell from time sheets and other things how much money is expended on Air Force One and on security for the President when he goes to address a religious organization, okay. And he urges the importance of religion in American life and so forth. The whole trip is about religion. That's measurable.\\" Pincus stated that \\"the court of appeals said, that this Court has identified a second limitation, which is not incidental. The money has to be central--the money that's being challenged has to be central to the violation. Just as you couldn't challenge a prayer breakfast\\". As in Bowen there had to be \\"a specific action that allocated a specific amount of money\\". Pincus opined that no taxpayer would be given standing to sue agents of the United States Secret Service for accompanying a President on a trip for a religious purpose as they would be there \\"protecting him for a protection purpose. His trip is for a religious purpose. And I think our submission is that there is a distinction that can be drawn there.\\" Pincus opined that a distinction could be made between funds that were spent incidentally (such as gasoline for Air Force One) and non-incidental expenditures (such as funding a conference for outreach to religious organizations). Both Justices Roberts and Scalia expressed concern that if they found for the Foundation it would mean the courts would have to continually decide if taxpayers had standing by trying to determine \\"whether the expenditure was incidental or not\\". Pincus responded \\"the Court also said in Allen against Wright, you know, the absence of precise standards does not leave the courts at sea in applying the law of standing. Standing isn't an area, really, that is susceptible to precise definitions.\\" Pincus rejected the government's argument that there was no standing without involvement of a third party saying the idea that \\"the Government could hire a corps of chaplains and send them out to civilians and to the populace at large and that couldn't be challenged, because all it is executive pay ... makes no sense. ... if history indicates anything it's that concerns about establishment were focused just as much on the King as on the Parliament in terms of the history that the framers understood.\\" Government rebuttal In his rebuttal Clement assured the Court that \\"if this Court recognizes that there is not taxpayer standing, that does not mean that there won't be lawsuits, that there won't be directly injured plaintiffs that can bring claims. Doremus and Schempp [v. School District of Abington Township] prove that point. But even more broadly, any time the establishment clause injury takes the form of alleged coercive conduct the individuals who are coerced are going to have standing to bring the suit.\\" Clements pointed out that \\"The property distribution plan at issue in Valley Forge took a tremendous amount of appropriated funds to run. Nobody thought that was a basis for taxpayer standing. The Bibles that were purchased and the salaries of the teachers in Doremus presumably cost at least a threepence. But that was not found enough.\\" He asked the Court \\"to focus on this word 'incidental.' ...In the context of money going to third party religious entities, nobody would say that the spending is incidental. It's the whole violation. In the context of Bible reading or anything else the Executive Branch does, the fact that money went to fund the Executive Branch to violate the establishment clause is the least of the problems. The problem is the primary conduct of the Executive Branch in violating the establishment clause, but that's not a spending injury. The funding that goes into that is incidental. I think that's the way to make sense of this Court's cases.\\" He asked the Court to reflect on what was being challenged in the case, \\"that the Executive Branch officials at the conferences spent too much time talking about faith-based groups and not enough talking about community-based groups. If that isn't intrusive on the Executive Branch, I don't know what is.\\" Clements said that if the Court had to reverse Flast it should not be afraid to do so, \\"if you have to choose between the logic of Flast and the irreducible minimum requirements of Article III, I think it's an easy choice. You don't abandon the basic requirements of Article III that distinguish the Judiciary from the political branches of Government.\\" Supreme Court decision =Opinion= In a 5-4 vote the Supreme Court ruled that the Foundation did not have standing to sue and ordered the Appeals court finding reversed. =Alito plurality= The plurality opinion was written by Justice Alito, and was joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy. Alito wrote \\"Flast focused on congressional action, and we must decline this invitation to extend its holding to encompass discretionary Executive Branch expenditures. ...It is significant that, in the four decades since its creation, the Flast exception has largely been confined to its facts.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 609. He wrote \\"The link between congressional action and constitutional violation that supported taxpayer standing in Flast is missing here. ...We have never found taxpayer standing under such circumstances.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 605. Alito cited Frothingham, \\"The administration of any statute, likely to produce additional taxation to be imposed upon a vast number of taxpayers, the extent of whose several liability is indefinite and constantly changing, is essentially a matter of public and not of individual concern ...Because the interests of the taxpayer are, in essence, the interests of the public-at-large, deciding a constitutional claim based solely on taxpayer standing 'would be[,] not to decide a judicial controversy, but to assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and co-equal department, an authority which plainly we do not possess.'\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 601. He also cited Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, which stated that \\"a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about government—claiming only harm to his and every citizen’s interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large—does not state an Article III case or controversy.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 601 (quoting ). Alito wrote that he was not convinced that if they ruled for the Foundation it would not open a floodgate of lawsuits, \\"Because almost all Executive Branch activity is ultimately funded by some congressional appropriation, extending the Flast exception to purely executive expenditures would effectively subject every federal action—be it a conference, proclamation or speech—to Establishment Clause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 610. In support of this he cited the Foundations own claim against the speech of Rod Paige that had been dismissed by the district court. Alito also noted that to allow standing in this type of case \\"would also raise serious separation-of-powers concerns.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 611. He cited Justice Powell's concurrence in United States v. Richardson: \\"'Relaxation of standing requirements is directly related to the expansion of judicial power,' and lowering the taxpayer standing bar to permit challenges of purely executive actions 'would significantly alter the allocation of power at the national level, with a shift away from a democratic form of government.'\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 611 (quoting (Powell, J., concurring)). Alito stated \\"Respondents set out a parade of horribles that they claim could occur if Flast is not extended to discretionary Executive Branch expenditures. For example, they say, a federal agency could use its discretionary funds to build a house of worship or to hire clergy of one denomination and send them out to spread their faith. Or an agency could use its funds to make bulk purchases of Stars of David, crucifixes, or depictions of the star and crescent for use in its offices or for distribution to the employees or the general public. Of course, none of these things has happened, even though Flast has not previously been expanded in the way that respondents urge. In the unlikely event that any of these executive actions did take place, Congress could quickly step in. And respondents make no effort to show that these improbable abuses could not be challenged in federal court by plaintiffs who would possess standing based on grounds other than taxpayer standing.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 614. Alito wrote that \\"It is a necessary concomitant of the doctrine of stare decisis that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic. That ... is the approach we take here. We do not extend Flast, but we also do not overrule it. We leave Flast as we found it.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 615. =Kennedy concurrence= Justice Kennedy wrote a concurrence where he re-emphasized the concerns over separation of powers should the Appeals court decision not have been reversed. He also stated \\"It must be remembered that, even where parties have no standing to sue, members of the Legislative and Executive Branches are not excused from making constitutional determinations in the regular course of their duties. Government officials must make a conscious decision to obey the Constitution whether or not their acts can be challenged in a court of law and then must conform their actions to these principled determinations.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 618 (Kennedy, J., concurring). =Scalia concurrence= Justice Scalia wrote a concurrence (which was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas), where he agreed that the case had to be reversed but held that the Court had not gone far enough, \\"If this Court is to decide cases by rule of law rather than show of hands, we must surrender to logic and choose sides: Either Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968), should be applied to (at a minimum) all challenges to the governmental expenditure of general tax revenues in a manner alleged to violate a constitutional provision specifically limiting the taxing and spending power, or Flast should be repudiated. For me, the choice is easy. Flast is wholly irreconcilable with the Article III restrictions on federal- court jurisdiction that this Court has repeatedly confirmed are embodied in the doctrine of standing.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 618 (Scalia, J., concurring). He said the problem was because \\"We have alternately relied on two entirely distinct conceptions of injury in fact, which for convenience I will call 'Wallet Injury' and 'Psychic Injury.' ...Psychic Injury ... has nothing to do with the plaintiff's tax liability. Instead, the injury consists of the taxpayer’s mental displeasure that money extracted from him is being spent in an unlawful manner. ...this conceptualizing of injury in fact in purely mental terms conflicts squarely with the familiar proposition that a plaintiff lacks a concrete and particularized injury when his only complaint is the generalized grievance that the law is being violated. ...We have never explained why Psychic Injury was insufficient in the cases in which standing was denied, and we have never explained why Psychic Injury, however limited, is cognizable under Article III.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 619 (Scalia, J., concurring). Scalia wrote, \\"We had an opportunity today to erase this blot on our jurisprudence [Flast], but instead have simply smudged it.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 637 (Scalia, J., concurring). =Souter Dissent= Justice Souter wrote a dissent and was joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer. Souter wrote that the plurality opinion \\"declares that Flast does not apply [in this case], but a search of that opinion for a suggestion that these taxpayers have any less stake in the outcome than the taxpayers in Flast will come up empty: the plurality makes no such finding, nor could it. Instead, the controlling opinion closes the door on these taxpayers because the Executive Branch, and not the Legislative Branch, caused their injury. I see no basis for this distinction in either logic or precedent, and respectfully dissent.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 637 (Souter, J., dissenting). Souter continued, \\"We held in Flast, and repeated just last Term, that the \\"'injury' alleged in Establishment Clause challenges to federal spending\\" is \\"the very 'extract[ion] and spen[ding]' of 'tax money' in aid of religion.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 638 (Souter, J., dissenting, quoting ). \\"Since the founding of our country, there have been popular uprisings against procuring taxpayer funds to support church leaders, which was one of the hallmarks of an 'established' religion\\".Hein, 551 U.S. at 638 (Souter, J., dissenting, quoting ). Souter drew the conclusion that \\"[t]he right of conscience and the expenditure of an identifiable three pence raised by taxes for the support of a religious cause are therefore not to be split off from one another.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 638 (Souter, J., dissenting). In response to Scalia's concurrence, Souter invoked Madison's work (see above) and wrote \\"The three pence implicates the conscience, and the injury from Government expenditures on religion is not accurately classified with the 'Psychic Injury' that results whenever a congressional appropriation or executive expenditure raises hackles of disagreement with the policy supported ... Justice Stewart recognized this in his concurring opinion in Flast, when he said that \\"every taxpayer can claim a personal constitutional right not to be taxed for the support of a religious institution,” and thus distinguished the case from one in which a taxpayer sought only to air a generalized grievance in federal court.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 639 (Souter, J., dissenting, quoting Flast, 392 U.S. at 114). Souter went over the qualifications for standing set by previous precedents, and concluded that they were all met in this case, \\"there is no dispute that taxpayer money in identifiable amounts is funding conferences, and these are alleged to have the purpose of promoting religion. Cf. Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429, 434 (1952) . The taxpayers therefore seek not to 'extend' Flast ... but merely to apply it. When executive agencies spend identifiable sums of tax money for religious purposes, no less than when Congress authorizes the same thing, taxpayers suffer injury. And once we recognize the injury as sufficient for Article III, there can be no serious question about the other elements of the standing enquiry: the injury is indisputably 'traceable' to the spending, and 'likely to be redressed by' an injunction prohibiting it. Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984)\\".Hein, 551 U.S. at 639 (Souter, J., dissenting). He also noted that \\"There will not always be competitors for the funds who would make better plaintiffs (and indeed there appears to be no such competitor here), so after accepting the importance of the injury there is no reason to refuse standing as a prudential matter.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 643 n. 5 (Souter, J., dissenting). Souter held that removing Executive branch actions concerning Establishment Clause questions from Judicial review was dangerous. He said the majority opinion \\"points to the separation of powers to explain its distinction between legislative and executive spending decisions ... but there is no difference on that point of view between a Judicial Branch review of an executive decision and a judicial evaluation of a congressional one. We owe respect to each of the other branches, no more to the former than to the latter, and no one has suggested that the Establishment Clause lacks applicability to executive uses of money. It would surely violate the Establishment Clause for the Department of Health and Human Services to draw on a general appropriation to build a chapel for weekly church services (no less than if a statute required it), and for good reason: if the Executive could accomplish through the exercise of discretion exactly what Congress cannot do through legislation, Establishment Clause protection would melt away.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 639-40 (Souter, J., dissenting). Souter disagreed with the majority's reading of Bowen, saying in that case \\"we already had found the statute valid on its face before we turned to the taxpayers' as-applied challenge ... so the case cannot be read to hold that taxpayers have standing only to claim that congressional action, but not its implementation, violates the Establishment Clause.\\" Therefore, after Bowen, the majority opinion's \\"distinction between a 'congressional mandate' on the one hand and 'executive discretion' on the other ... is at once arbitrary and hard to manage: if the statute itself is constitutional, all complaints must be about the exercise of 'executive discretion,' so there is no line to be drawn between Bowen and the case before us today.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 641 (Souter, J., dissenting). The Justice stated that \\"While Flast standing to assert the right of conscience is in a class by itself, it would be a mistake to think that case is unique in recognizing standing in a plaintiff without injury to flesh or purse. Cognizable harm takes account of the nature of the interest protected, which is the reason that 'the constitutional component of standing doctrine incorporates concepts concededly not susceptible of precise definition,' leaving it impossible 'to make application of the constitutional standing requirement a mechanical exercise.'\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 641-42 (Souter, J., dissenting, quoting ). As a proof of this he asked, what of cases where a person was \\"being forced to compete on an uneven playing field based on race (without showing that an economic loss resulted), or living in a racially gerrymandered electoral district? These injuries are no more concrete than seeing one’s tax dollars spent on religion, but we have recognized each one as enough for standing.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 642 (Souter, J., dissenting). Souter stated \\"The judgment of sufficient injury takes account of the Madisonian relationship of tax money and conscience, but it equally reflects the Founders’ pragmatic 'conviction that individual religious liberty could be achieved best under a government which was stripped of all power to tax, to support, or otherwise to assist any or all religions,' Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 11 (1947), and the realization continuing to the modern day that favoritism for religion 'sends the ... message to ... nonadherents \\"that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community,\\"'\\" McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U.S. 844, 860 (2005).\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 643 (Souter, J., dissenting). The Justice also agreed that the outcome of Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc. was based on the Property Clause of Article IV, §3 and so was not a viable precedent in this case.Hein, 551 U.S. at 641 n. 2 (Souter, J., dissenting). Souter noted that the majority expressed their fear that a great many Executive branch actions would be open to lawsuit if they ruled for the Foundation, he said \\"that does not mean taxpayers will prevail in such suits. If these claims are frivolous on the merits, I fail to see the harm in dismissing them for failure to state a claim instead of for lack of jurisdiction. To the degree the claims are meritorious, fear that there will be many of them does not provide a compelling reason, much less a reason grounded in Article III, to keep them from being heard.\\"Hein, 551 U.S. at 640 n. 1 (Souter, J., dissenting). Reactions to the decision President George W. Bush expressed his pleasure at the majority's ruling, saying \\"Today's Supreme Court decision marks a substantial victory for efforts by Americans to more effectively aid our neighbors in need of help. The Faith- Based and Community Initiative can remain focused on strengthening America's armies of compassion and expanding their good works. Similar efforts by governors and mayors in states and cities all across the country can also continue to advance. ...This ruling is a win for the thousands of community and faith-based nonprofits all across the country that have partnered with government at all levels to serve their neighbors. Most importantly, it is a win for the many whose lives have been lifted by the caring touch and compassionate hearts of these organizations.\\" Former Head of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives Jim Towey called the decision \\"good news for addicts and the homeless and others seeking effective social services. It's also a repudiation of the kind of secular extremism that ruled the public square for decades.\\" Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice said of the decision \\"This is a very significant victory that sends a powerful message that atheists and others antagonistic to religion do not get an automatic free pass to bring Establishment Clause lawsuits. ...This decision will have serious ramifications for separationist attempts to claim special privileges to sue as taxpayers without showing that a law or government activity actually injured them in any way. ...By rejecting a claim to special treatment for atheists and other separationists, the high court took an important step toward restoring equity to the legal system with respect to federal challenges in the Establishment Clause arena.\\" The ACLJ concluded that the \\"decision continues the trend to rebuff efforts to build upon the questionable Flast precedent.\\" The Rev. Barry W. Lynn of the Americans United for Separation of Church and State expressed his disappointment saying \\"This is a disappointing decision that blocks the courthouse door for Americans with legitimate church-state grievances. Taxpayers should be allowed to challenge public funding of religion, whether the money is allocated by Congress or the White House. However, it is important to note that this ruling applies to only a few situations. Most church-state lawsuits, including those that challenge congressional appropriations for faith-based programs, will not be affected.\\" Lynn called Justice Alito's statement that \\"Congress could quickly step in\\" if the Executive went too far as \\"quite incredible because the damage is done when the president acts. We have the courts to do precisely this, rein in the president or the Congress.\\" Ralph G. Neas, president of People For the American Way Foundation, said the decision marked \\"a bad day for the First Amendment. The Supreme Court just put a big dent in the wall of separation between church and state.\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 551 *List of United States Supreme Court cases References External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:2007 in United States case law Category:Establishment Clause case law Category:United States standing case law Category:Atheism in the United States Category:Presidency of George W.

The first winners of the cup were the Sheffield Steelers who defeated the Coventry Blaze on penalty shots in the final. The format was a home/away affair in the first year of play. In the 2006-07 season, the format was altered with the final being a one off game. The 2006-07 cup was won by the Cardiff Devils, when they beat the Coventry Blaze 3-0 at the Coventry Skydome. 2008–09 The British Knockout Cup will be a nine-team affair this season, with Sheffield and Belfast competing in a preliminary two-legged round at Ice Sheffield on the 25 and 26 October. The first match of the two ended in a 3-3 draw with both teams really battling it out, but the following night the Belfast Giants came out on top 6–5 and it was they who progress with an aggregate score of (9-8) to face Coventry Blaze in the quarter-finals. Quarter-Finals This Quarter Final between these two heavyweights was all tied up in the 1st leg with the Giants winning their home leg by a 5-1 scoreline, the same performance from the Giants saw them defeat the Blaze in their own backyard by a score of 5-2, this saw the Giants progress even further to the Semi-Finals to face Cardiff Devils. Agg:(10-45) The Devils got their place in the Semi's by destroying the Basingstoke Bison by an aggregate score of (17-1), the Devils won their home leg 8-0 and then went to Basingstoke and completely out-played the Bison and winning 10-20. The Newcastle Vipers fought hard to book their Semi-Final place by winning there tie in penalty shots. The first leg ended with the Vipers taking a one-goal lead to Edinburgh (5-4), the second leg was as hard-fought as the first with Edinburgh not going out without a fight and their spirit took the tie into overtime with Capitals winning 2-1 in regulation time. Neither of the teams could find a breakthrough so penalty shoot-out it was, with the Vipers coming out victorious 500-9. Agg:(10-10) The Phoenix were the other team to go through to make up the Final Four. They won their tie against the Stingrays by an aggregate of (8-3). The home leg was the easier of the two by shutting out Hull and winning it 4-0, the second leg was much, much harder with Hull giving it a real try, but could not faze the Phoenix as Manchester came out on top again with a score of 4-3. Semi-Finals It was Belfast who would progress again by an aggregate score of (7-4). The Giants and Devils played a tough game with even honours coming at the end of the home leg which was played at Dundonald Ice Bowl (3-3). The second leg was so much different as it was the Giants who made the push to win the tie and their pressure paid off as they won 4-1. The Phoenix will be the team to face the Giants from Belfast in this year's Final, as they defeated Newcastle (9-5) on aggregate. The Phoenix won the first leg in Newcastle easily 4-1. The Phoenix brought home a 3-goal lead, thinking it was over, but the Vipers had other ideas as they tried to get back into the tie, but they came up short as they lost 5-4. Final Belfast Giants beat Manchester Phoenix in the final, with an aggregate score of 7-5. The first leg was played at the Altrincham Ice Dome, and finished 3-3 after normal time. As this match was also the final league match of the season, Phoenix went on to win 4-3 in overtime, but as the score was 3-3 after 60 minutes, this was counted as the aggregate score.

His research interests included the optimal design of experiments, which was his major research area, as well as a wide variety of topics in mathematical statistics.  Biography  Jack Kiefer was born on January 25, 1924, in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Carl Jack Kiefer and Marguerite K. Rosenau. He began his undergraduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1942, but left after one year, taking up a position as first lieutenant in the United States Air Force during World War II. In 1946, he returned to MIT, graduating with bachelor's and master's degrees in economics and engineering in 1948 under the supervision of Harold Freeman. He then began graduate studies at Columbia University, under the supervision of Abraham Wald and Jacob Wolfowitz, receiving his Ph.D. in mathematical statistics in 1952. While still a graduate student, he began teaching at Cornell University, remaining there until 1979, when he retired from Cornell and accepted a new position as Miller Research Professor in the Department of Statistics and Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1957, he married Dooley Sciple, a former undergraduate student of his at Cornell, with whom he had two children. Kiefer died of a heart attack in Berkeley, California on August 10, 1981.; .  Awards and honors  Kiefer was a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (elected 1972) and of the United States National Academy of Sciences (elected 1975). From 1969–1970 he was president of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. In 1973, Kiefer and Michael Fisher were the first two Cornell faculty elected as Horace White Professors.2 Professors Are Named To Horace White Chairs, Cornell Chronicle, vol. 4, no. 19, Feb. 22, 1973.

Contributions  Much of Kiefer's research was on the design of experiments;. the American Statistician obituary calls him \\"undoubtedly the foremost worker in optimal experimental design\\". However, he also made significant contributions to other areas of statistics and optimization, including the introduction of golden section search (his master's thesis work) the Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz inequality and the Bahadur-Ghosh-Kiefer representation (with R.

He captained two important expeditions (in 1445 and 1446), which expanded the limit of the Portuguese discovery of the West African coast, probably as far as the northern borderlands of modern Guinea- Bissau. Álvaro Fernandes's farthest point (approximately Cape Roxo) would not be surpassed for ten years, until the voyage of Alvise Cadamosto in 1456.  Background  Álvaro Fernandes was the nephew João Gonçalves Zarco, discoverer and donatary captain of Machico (northern Madeira island). Fernandes was brought up (as a page or squire) in the household of Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator.  1445 Expedition  In 1443, one of Henry's captains, Nuno Tristão, discovered the Bay of Arguin (on the modern coast of Mauritania), which was dotted with small Sanhaja Berber fishing villages, the first native settlements the Henrican captains had seen since passing Cape Bojador ten years earlier. This discovery whet the appetites of Portuguese merchants, who immediately saw the easy and profitable prospect of slave-raiding on those vulnerable settlements. Between 1444 and 1446, a cascade of Portuguese slave- raiding expeditions, organized by private consortiums and armed with Henry's license, ravaged the Arguin banks, seizing the poor Arguin fishing folk as slaves to sell in Europe. One such consortium was organized by the private donatary captains of the Madeira islands, who assembled a small fleet of three caravels. One of the Madeira ships was outfitted by João Gonçalves Zarco (donatary of Machico, north Madeira) who appointed his nephew, Álvaro Fernandes to captain it. The second ship was commanded by Tristão Vaz Teixeira (donatary captain of Funchal, south Madeira) and the third by Álvaro de Ornellas.João de Barros, Lib. I, Ch. 11 (p.87); Faria e Sousa (p.527). The 15th-century chronicler Gomes Eanes de Zurara asserts that Álvaro Fernandes went out alone, personally instructed by Prince Henry to 'avoid' any raids, and aim straight for the \\"Land of the Blacks\\" (Sub-Saharan Africa) for the glory of exploration alone.Zurara, (Ch. 65, p.225). This, however, seems improbable, given the participation of the other captains and the events that transpired.Zurara mentioning the other two captains separately (Ch. 70, p.213). But Barros (p.87), Faria e Sousa (p.527), etc. give the impression all three left Madeira islands together. Henrican captain Diogo Gomes makes no mention of Fernandes or these others by name, but does allude to expeditions to the bay of Bezeguiche. The deserted Madeira islands were in the process of being colonized, and in need of slave labor, and the Madeira fleet very probably set out with the intention to raid the Arguin banks for it. The Madeira fleet did not reach the Arguin banks, but only got as far as Cape Blanc before two of the ships (Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Ornellas) decided to turn back. This might have been because of poor weather,As asserted in Zurara, Ch. 70 (p.213), Quintella, p.140 or possibly because they came across the note (nailed on a wooden cross erected at Cape Blanc) left a little earlier by slave-raider Antão Gonçalves warning future Portuguese slave-raiding captains that Arguin island had been devastated, that the remaining population had fled to the hinterlands, and they should try looking for captives elsewhere.Barros, p.84 It is known that Ornellas proceeded to raid the Canary island of La Palma and captured some Guanche slaves.Zurara (p.213, p.249); Diffie and Winius (p.86) It uncertain what Vaz Teixeira did. It was probably at Cape Blanc that Álvaro Fernandes decided to part ways and press south by himself, and try his luck in the \\"Land of the Guineus\\" (generic term for the Black African peoples below the Senegal River), the discovery of which had just been announced a few months earlier (1444/45) by Nuno Tristão and Dinis Dias. Sea chart of West Africa, Skipping Arguin, Álvaro Fernandes sailed straight south, reaching the mouth of the Senegal River. He stopped there only long enough to fill two barrels with river water.Zurara, p.226 It is probable Fernandes did not try to raid at Senegal because Dinis Dias had attacked a local pirogue there earlier, thus the local Wolof populations on the banks of the river were alert to the hostile intentions of Portuguese caravels. Álvaro Fernandes continued sailing down the Grande Côte of Senegal until Cape Verde, the farthest point reached by Dinis Dias. It is uncertain if Dias actually surpassed the cape. If not, then Álvaro Fernandes may very well have been the first European to double Cape Verde and sail into the Angra de Bezeguiche (Bay of Dakar). Fernandes anchored at Bezeguiche island (Gorée island), which was uninhabited, but had many wild goats, which the crew proceeded to slaughter for food.In his 1490s memoirs, Henrican captain Diogo Gomes (p.276) claims the bay was named Bezeguiche after a local mainland king. He does not, however, make mention of Álvaro Fernandes himself. Fernandes is said to have left his marker on the island by carving Prince Henry the Navigator's knightly motto, Talent de bien faire (\\"Hunger for good deeds\\") on a tree trunk.Zurara (p.226), Barros (p.113), Quintella (p.145) While idling off the island, a couple of curious native canoes (five men each) from the mainland (Wolof or more probably Lebou people) paddled out to the caravel. The first encounter went smoothly enough—gestures were exchanged expressing peaceful intentions, and several of the natives were invited aboard, and given food and drink by the Portuguese, before setting back in their canoes and returning to the mainland. Encouraged by the report of the initial pacific encounter, six more canoes decided to paddle out to the caravel. But this time Álvaro Fernandes decided to set up an ambush, and prepared a launch with armed men, behind the concealed side of the caravel. As the native canoes got within range, Fernandes gave the signal and the hidden Portuguese armed launch darted out from behind the ship. The native canoes immediately began to turn around to make their way back to shore, but not before the Portuguese boat reached the closest African canoe. Cut off, the native crew leaped overboard and tried to swim back to shore. Two of the swimmers were captured by the Portuguese, but put up such a fight that by the time the second man was captured and subdued, all the others had made it safely to the mainland.Zurara (p.228). Barros does not give details of this incident, but notes later (p.113) that the natives on this shore were provoked to hostility by Fernandes actions. Cliffs of Popenguine, just above the Cape of Masts (Cap de Naze), farthest point reached by Álvaro Fernandes in 1445 The ambush had yielded only two captives, and raised the alarm on the mainland shore. With the element of surprise now gone, Álvaro Fernandes saw little point in remaining in the vicinity, and set sail out of Bezeguiche bay.Zurara, p.228 He proceeded south along the Petite Côte a little way, until he reached an imposing cliff rock he called the Cabo dos Mastos (\\"Cape of Masts\\", on account of a set of dry, naked tree trunks, which resembled a cluster of ship's masts; now Cape Naze, ).Barros (p.113). Cape Naze is south of Popenguine and north of Guerrero. Castilho (vol. 1, p.117) points out that 'Naze' is probably a cartographic corruption of the abbreviation for 'Mastos'. Uniquely, Cortesão (p.10n11) makes the case that the Cabo dos Mastos might actually be Cape Rouge () just a few miles north of Cape Naze. Fernandes ordered a launch to scout the nearby area. They came upon a small hunting party of four natives (possibly Serer) in the vicinity, and tried to capture them by surprise, but the startled hunters managed to escape and outrun the Portuguese.Zurara, p.228-29. Alvaro Fernandes returned to Portugal thereafter, with only the two captives from Bezeguiche, the barrels of Senegal River water and the hunters' weapons to show for it. His hostile action had raised the alarm among the populations around Bezeguiche bay. The next Portuguese ships to arrive in the area—the large slaving fleet of Lançarote de Freitas a few months later—would be greeted by a hail of arrows and poisoned darts, and forced away. Despite the poor returns of his slave raid, Álvaro Fernandes had sailed further south than any prior Portuguese captain, setting up the Cape of Masts as the farthest marker. For that, he and his uncle (João Gonçalves Zarco) were amply rewarded by Prince Henry.Zurara, p.229  1446 Expedition  Álvaro Fernandes set out again on a caravel in 1446, this time on direct mission for Prince Henry.Zurara, Ch. 87 (p.p.258) (Port: p.406). Barros (Dec. I.1, Ch.14, p.121). Quintella (p.149) and Diffie and Winius (p.86-87) place this in 1446. Faria e Sousa (p.528) in 1447. Fernandes headed straight to his last point (Cabo dos Mastos), and landed a little exploring party, but finding nobody, re-embarked and continued sailing on. At an indeterminate point south of there, they spotted a local coastal village and disembarked a party, only to be met by an armed native force (probably Serer), intent on defending their village. Álvaro Fernandes killed what he believed was the native chieftain at the beginning of the encounter, prompting the rest of the local warriors to briefly halt the fight. The Portuguese landing party availed themselves of the pause to hurry back to their ship.Zurara, p.259. The environs of the Casamance River, from a French map Having sailed a little on, the next day, the Portuguese captured two young local women collecting shellfish by the shore. The caravel resumed sail, and continued \\"for a certain distance\\", until they reached a large river, which is recorded in the chronicles as \\"Rio Tabite\\" (location uncertain, see below). Although probably aware of the fate of Nuno Tristão on a similar river venture, Alvaro Fernandes nonetheless decided to set a launch to explore upriver. The first exploratory boat made a landing on the bank near some local huts, where they quickly captured a local woman and brought her back to the caravel. Then refitting the boat, they set out again, this time intending to sail further upriver. But they did not get far before they came upon four or five native canoes with armed men heading towards them. Fernandes immediately turned the boat around and began racing back to the caravel, with the canoes hot on his tail. One of the canoes went fast enough to nearly catch up with Fernandes's boat, prompting Fernandes to turn and prepare for a fight. But the lead native canoe, realizing it was alone, slowed down to wait for the others, thus giving the Portuguese boat the opportunity to resume their flight back to the caravel. The Portuguese escaped, but Álvaro Fernandes himself was gravely wounded in the leg by a poisoned arrow shot from one of the canoes. Once aboard ship, he disinfected the wound with urine and olive oil. He lay in fever for a few days, on the edge of death, but recovered.Zurara, p.260 Despite the near-fatal experience, the caravel proceeded straight south for a little longer, until they reached a sandy cape and large sandy bay.Zurara, p.261 They put a small boat to explore near the beach, but found a force of some 120 natives, armed with shields, assegais and bows marching towards them. The explorers immediately returned to the caravel. Nonetheless, the armed native party gave what seemed like a peaceful festive demonstration from the beach - waving and inviting the Portuguese to land. But given Fernandes's ill condition and still shaken by their earlier near-escape, the decision was made to quit the area and set sail back to Portugal. On the way home, Fernandes stopped by Arguin island and a nearby cape in the bay, where they negotiated the purchase of a black slave-woman from some Berber traders. Upon arrival in Portugal, Álvaro Fernandes was amply rewarded by Prince Henry the Navigator who offered him 100 dubloons, and regent Peter of Coimbra, who gave him another 100, for having sailed further than any other Portuguese captain thus far.Zurara, p.261  Extent of explorations  Of all the Henrican captains of the 1440s, Álvaro Fernandes seemed to have pushed the discovery marker farthest. It is almost certain that, on his first expedition (1445), Álvaro Fernandes surpassed all others and was the first European to land on Bezeguiche (Gorée island, in the bay of Dakar), sailing as far as the Cape of Masts (Cape Naze) in central Senegal. The extent of his second 1446 journey is more uncertain. Zurara reports Fernandes sailed as far as 110 leagues beyond Cape Vert.Zurara, p.261 If Zurara was exactly correct, that would mean Fernandes reached the environs of Cape Verga (, in modern Guinea), an incredible leap beyond his last point.Teixeira da Mota, 1946: p.280 Chronicler João de Barros goes even further, identifying the river Fernandes sailed up as the \\"Rio Tabite\\". The exact identification of \\"Rio Tabite\\" is uncertain, for that name is not found on old charts.Quintella (p.149n) Barros notes merely that Rio Tabite is 32 leagues beyond the \\"Rio de Nuno Tristão\\".Barros (p.121). If we assume the latter to be the Nunez River (in modern Guinea), that would lead us to identify the \\"Rio Tabite\\" with the Forecariah River in modern Guinea, implying Fernandes sailed a tremendous 135 leagues beyond Cape Vert, well beyond the 110 suggested by Zurara.The identification of the Tabite with the Forecariah is due to Teixeira da Mota (1946: II, p.278-80), basing himself on indications in Duarte Pacheco Pereira and elsewhere. Cortesão (1931: p.20-21) however, identifies the Tabite with the Pongo River (), a tad bit closer, but also in Guinea and still exceeding 110 leagues. At the other extreme, the Viscount of Santarém identified the Rio Tabite with the Rio do Lago (Diombos River, in the Sine-Saloum Delta of Senegal), a mere 24 leagues from Cape Vert.Viscount of Santarém, in the first edition of Zurara, (1841: p.408), basing himself on a Juan de la Cosa map. But then Santarém (p.410) goes on to dramatically claim they continued sailing as far as Cape St. Ann in Sierra Leone, a gigantic leap from Diombos. Another source, the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica (op. cit), describes Fernandes as having sailed to \\"perhaps in the neighborhood of Conakry...but little short of Sierra Leone.\\" However, the Diombos is the prime candidate location for the death of Nuno Tristão himself.Teixeira da Mota, (1946: Pt.1) If that was also sailed by Fernandes, then that eliminates Fernandes's claim to have exceeded Nuno Tristão's last point by many leagues. The Tabite has also been tentatively identified with the Gambia River,Beazley & Prestage (1896: p.xii). Although in their endnotes (p.349-50), they seem to endorse the Diombos of the Viscount of Santarem. although this does not find many adherents for the same reasons of being too close to Tristão's last point. Modern historians believe both Zurara and Barros greatly exaggerated in implying Álvaro Fernandes reached modern Guinea.Duarte Leite (1941), Damião Peres (1943), Magalhães Godinho (1945), Teixeira da Mota, 1946 In particular, it is highly unlikely he would have sailed past the huge Geba River and the many Bissagos Islands and other notable promontories and landmarks without exploring them or making the least mention of them. Moreover, Zurara claims that all along Fernandes's route from Cape Vert, the \\"coast tendeth generally south\\",Zurara, p.261 thus eliminating the wilder estimates (the coast runs steadily southeast after Cape Roxo). Reviewing the evidence, Teixeira da Mota suggests that the \\"Tabite\\" river Fernandes sailed up was probably the Casamance River (, Senegal) and the low cape and sandy bay that marked his final point was the stretch around Cape Varela (, just below Cape Roxo, at the northern end of what is now Guinea- Bissau).Teixeira da Mota (1946: II, p.283). That means Fernandes really sailed 50 leagues (not 110) beyond Cape Vert. That still makes it the farthest point reached by the Portuguese discoveries of the 1440s. The only real difficulty with the Casamance hypothesis is the use of poisoned arrows, which was common among the Serer, Nimoninka and Mandinka peoples of the Saloum-Gambia area, but not among the Jola people (Felupes) of the Casamance. But historians doubt whether Fernandes was actually hit with a poisoned arrow at all, rather than a regular arrow and simply suffered a common infection in the aftermath. The very fact that he survived suggests it was not poisoned, as does the fact that no other sailors reported any similar injuries.Teixeira da Mota, p.282 (It contrasts sharply with the fate of Nuno Tristão and his crew in the Diombos River, where a score of men fell dead quickly from Niominka poison. Given Tristão's fate, Zurara may have simply assumed all tribes south of Cape Verde used poison.Teixeira da Mota, p.282-83) The other footnote is why Fernandes' caravel was ambushed on the river by the Jola of the Casamance, who were unfamiliar with the Portuguese. Teixeira da Mota points to the abduction of the woman on the bank may have alerted the river peoples to the hostile intentions of the Portuguese. This contrasts with the Jola people on the beaches of Cape Varela, whose festive reception and hailing to the Portuguese ships from the shore reveals they had little or no prior notion of Portuguese slavers.Teixeira da Mota, p.282-83 Unfortunately, Zurara reports no topographic names bestowed by Álvaro Fernandes on his second journey, and the imprecise magnitudes reported (\\"some days\\", \\"a certain distance\\") are not very elucidating, leaving this conclusion still open to dispute. All that seems certain is that Fernandes sailed beyond his previous marker in 1446, and that this would remain standing as the record length reached by the Portuguese discoveries for the next decade. Fernandes's marker was only surpassed ten years later, in 1456, by Alvise Cadamosto, a Venetian explorer in Henry's service. Cadamosto laid claim to be discoverer of the Casamance River, and named it after the local king (mansa) of the Kasa (a near-extinct people related to the Bainuk people).

It entered the charts at No. 58 on the Billboard 200. The band recorded the album with producer Ken Andrews (Pete Yorn, Mae) in Los Angeles in spring 2007. The CD is a rendition of life's most pressing questions asked by every single person to walk the earth. A special edition of The Flame In All of Us was released simultaneously, with a DVD detailing the making of the record. This was the first time the band has let their fans in on the behind the scenes of their recording. Concept The band's front man Trevor McNevan describes the concept as \\"No Matter what you believe or where you were raised, you have the same core group of questions as the next person, who am I? Why am I here? What is life about?\\" Musical style The album almost completely departs from the rap metal and nu metal sounds of Set it Off and Phenomenon becoming heavier and more ambient. The album's style ranges from heavy metal on tracks \\"Falls Apart\\" and \\"Inhuman\\" to softer rock on \\"What Do We Know\\" and \\"Wish You Well\\". \\"In more ways than one this is the most refreshing record we've made,\\" McNevan has stated. \\"It was a uniting experience that took a lot of faith to get done. My favorite albums are the ones with lots of contrast that you can listen to front to back, that take you on a journey. And I believe the strongest bands are the ones that a listener can grow up with.\\" Track listing DVD (Inspired Heart Edition) Family Christian Stores exclusive: # \\"Making of the Record\\" # \\"On-Tour with TFK\\" # \\"The Flame in All of Us\\" (Acoustic) # \\"Breathe You In\\" (Acoustic) # \\"Rawkfist\\" (Music Video) # \\"Move\\" (Music Video) # \\"Bonus Footage\\" Music videos \\"The Flame in all of Us\\" has two music videos, more than any other TFK album. The official video for the album is \\"Falls Apart\\" and there is a second bonus video for \\"Favorite Disease\\". The \\"Falls Apart\\" video starts off showing the band in a dark wood room, with lots of rope around them. The members only have enough room to play their instruments. Eventually a man and a woman are shown and they are being held together by ropes. The man walks over to the woman and puts his arm around her. After a while she gets up and starts walking away, but then the ropes come off around everyone (the band and the couple alike). As a result, all of the couple's body parts lie on the floor. One of the man's hands crawls over to the one of the woman's hands to give her a needle with thread in it to sew both of them back up while the band ends the song. The video for \\"Favorite Disease\\" involves the band but does not show them playing instruments. McNevan is only shown singing at three parts in the song. The video begins with four soldiers (the band) walking in a line through a grass field. McNevan, the commanding officer, orders Joel Bruyere, against his will, to head in one direction. As they are walking they are fired at by unseen enemies and one soldier (Bruyere) goes down; before Bruyere dies he hands McNevan a piece of paper. As the trio are eating dinner by a fire, McNevan starts singing the song and reads the paper, McNevan then proceeds to go to Bruyere's grave. A flash back then occurs in which McNevan realizes that if he had not have made Bruyere go in the one direction Bruyere would have not been shot; also in the flash back it shows McNevan dying instead of Bruyere.

Karl Anders Petrén (1868-1927) was a Swedish physician who was a native of Halmstad. He studied medicine under Magnus Blix (1849-1904) in Sweden and with Joseph Jules Dejerine (1849-1917) in Paris. He received his doctorate in 1896, and later served as a professor of practical medicine in Uppsala and Lund. Petrén is remembered for his work with diabetes prior to the days of readily available insulin. He advocated a low-carbohydrate diet that was very high in fat to treat diabetes.Wilder, Russell M. (1989). Karl Petrén. A Leader in Pre-Insulin Dietary Therapy of Diabetes. In Dietrich v. Engelhardt. Diabetes Its Medical and Cultural History: Outlines — Texts — Bibliography. Springer. pp. 405-407. He noticed that adding meat to the diet of diabetic individuals sometimes exacerbated or induced ketosis, whereas a diet with a high fat content reduced ketosis. He demonstrated that if protein intake was limited, and the amount of fat in the diet was large enough, ketosis in diabetes could be eliminated. In 1901, Petrén published an important treatise on gait disorders titled Uber den Zusammenhang zwischen anatomisch bedingter und functioneller gangstorung im Greisenalter, in which he describes a condition called \\"trepidant abasia\\" or \\"trembling abasia\\".

E. Norris also worked on Assyrian culture with major contributions. He deciphered the Assyrian lion weights from Nineveh and he discovered the weight measurement system of this civilisation and established conversions in 1853 and started the Assyrian Dictionary.

In 1925 there was developed an own design of sports plane Sp-I (one built). From 1926, Ryszard Bartel led its construction bureau and started to design trainer aircraft for the Polish Air Force. After a single Bartel BM-2, a series of 22 Bartel BM-4 was built in 1928 (it was the first aircraft of the Polish design built in series). In 1928-1929 there was built a series of 60 trainers Bartel BM-5. The last design was a trainer fighter Bartel BM-6, flown in 1930, that remained a prototype. Apart from designing work of Bartel, several designers built prototypes of their sportsplanes (HL-2, MN-3, MN-5, O-2) or gliders in Samolot factory, but they were not built in series. From 1927 it also produced car bodies on imported chassises, mostly buses, Ford A30 cars and luxury cars. In 1930, due to a damage by fire (12 September 1929) and lack of orders, the factory Samolot became liquidated. Its machinery was bought by PZL. The Bartel BM-4 development was taken over by the PWS.

High school career Krause played high school football at Gonzaga Preparatory School in Spokane, Washington, where he starred as an all-city running back and linebacker.At the inductions into the Inland Empire Sports Hall of Fame, Rev. Arthur Dussault, S.J., presented Krause. In his presentation Dussault noted that as a Gonzaga Prep senior, \\"Max was given a trophy as being Spokane's finest high school football player in 1928.\\" Speech accompanying the Program of the IES Hall of Fame luncheon, 4/24/1981, on file in the Gonzaga University Library, Special Collections Division. He won 14 letters in four high school sports and in basketball he made the all-city second team as a guard. In baseball, Krause played outfield, and in track he participated in the broad jump and ran the 220 yard low hurdles.\\"Krause Ends Athletic Career at Gonzaga High\\", article in Spokane newspaper, November 18, 1928, from clipping in the Mike Krause Collection , vol. 1, p. 14. College career Krause stayed in Spokane for his college years, graduating from Gonzaga University with a B.A. degree in Philosophy. As fullback and halfback for the Bulldogs. Krause led the varsity backfield for three years. Krause punting for Gonzaga Reporter Abe Kemp described sophomore Krause in his first varsity year at Gonzaga during a game on October 12, 1930 against St. Ignatius (now the University of San Francisco). It was a close game that included a 70-yard scoring run from scrimmage by Krause: > \\"They said Krause was good.... He was better than good; he was immense. > Whether he ran, kicked, passed or tackled, there was a deadly and skilled > earnestness about him that won the sympathy of the crowd and even the > partisans.\\"Abe Kemp, \\"St. Ignatius Beats Gonzaga 13-12\\", article dated c. > October 13, 1930, Mike Krause Collection , vol. 1, p. 44. In the buildup to the 1932 cross-state matchup between Gonzaga and the University of Washington, Clarence Dirks wrote that \\"A coach couldn’t ask for a better back than stocky Max Krause. He kicks, passes, tackles viciously and in an open field is as illusive as a cemetery shadow.\\"Clarence Dirks, \\"U.W. Eleven will Spring New Shift Against Gonzagans\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 9/24/1932, in Mike Krause Collection , vol. 1, p. 63. During his senior year (1932 season), Krause was the leading scorer on the West Coast with 88 points and 1044 yards (130.5 yards/game from scrimmage, averaging 8.5 yards per carry). He scored four touchdowns in his final college game, a 56-13 win over the University of Montana. Krause was named 1st team All-West Coast fullback, and first choice Little All-American halfback. In the annual East–West Shrine Game, Krause started for the West at left halfback. Babe Hollingbery, famed Washington State coach and co-coach of the victorious West squad, described Krause as the \\"hardest-hitting back on the field\\" in the Shrine game.Mike Krause Collection , vol. 1, pp. 138, 144. Professional career Krause with Redskins After college, Krause played professional football for four seasons with the New York Giants. In his initial year with the Giants he had the distinction of scoring the first rushing touchdown in the NFL's first title game, the 1933 NFL Championship Game. In 1937, Krause moved to the Washington Redskins for an additional four seasons. Coach Ray Flaherty of the Redskins, former Gonzaga star himself, invited Krause along with other former Zags to Washington, including Ed Justice and George Karamatic. During his first year with the Redskins, the 1937 championship season, Krause was mainly a substitute and blocking back for the running back, Cliff Battles. After Battles retired in 1938 over a salary dispute, Krause started in the season opener in Philadelphia's Municipal Stadium, as described by Shirley Povich of the Washington Post: > \\"But the hero of the Redskins’ victory was not Sammy Baugh. It was short, > stocky, swarthy chap who was given the fullback job in the absence of Cliff > Battles, and his name is Max Krause. Krause it was who made three of the > four Redskin touchdowns. It was Krause throwing panic into the Eagles' > defense, Krause taking long passes and short passes, Krause bursting through > the Eagles’ line for a 48-yard touchdown gallop in the second quarter, > Krause tearing loose with a 71-yard sprint over the goal line in the third > period. He was something to see today, Krause was. He had a day such as > Cliff Battles, his illustrious predecessor, would have had at his best. The > flying form of Krause galloping goalward was an agonizing sight before the > eyes of the Eagles all afternoon.\\"Shirley Povich, \\"Sammy Tears Collar > Muscles\\", Washington Post, 9/12/1938, Mike Krause Collection , vol. 2, p. > 52. For the 1938 season, Krause finished second in the NFL in total yards rushing (averaging 8.6 yards per carry), behind Byron \\"Whizzer\\" White of the Pittsburgh Pirates (now Steelers). For many years, Krause also held the record for the longest kickoff return for a touchdown in an NFL championship game. The last game of Krause's Redskins and NFL career was the 1940 NFL Championship Game, when the visiting Chicago Bears beat Washington 73-0. Krause provided perhaps the only bright spot for Redskins fans on that dismal day when he ran a kickoff back for a 62-yard return (albeit not for a touchdown.) Life after football A knee injury ended Krause's football career in 1940. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Krause joined the United States Navy and fought in World War II. Later he established himself in the brewery business. From 1956–1983 he owned Spokane Distributors, Inc., a wholesale liquor warehouse for beer and wine. On April 24, 1981, Krause was inducted into the Inland Northwest Sports Hall of Fame. In 1989, he was inducted into the Gonzaga Hall of Fame. Krause died in Spokane on July 11, 1984 at the age of 75, and was interred in Holy Cross Cemetery. His wife of 42 years, Eleanor (Olson) Krause, died two years later.

The GCOR is used by Class I railroads west of Chicago, most of the Class II railroads, and many Short-line railroads. Some railroads in northeast United States follow NORAC, while Canada and Mexico have their own set of operating rules that govern their railroad operations. Overview The GCOR rules are intended to enhance railroad safety. The rules cover employee responsibilities, signaling equipment, procedures for safe train movement, dealing with accidents and other topics that directly and indirectly affect railroad safety. Some railroads modify the GCOR rules to suit their specific operations. The GCOR is supplemented by System Special Instructions, Timetables, Hazardous Materials Instructions, Air Brake and Train Handling Instructions, and General Orders. These documents are issued by each individual railroad. System Special instructions, Timetables, and General Order can modify or amend the General Code of Operating Rules. GCOR 1.3.2 states that General Orders replace any rule, special instruction, or regulation that conflicts with the general order.

It is used by every Canadian railway. Overview The Canadian Rail Operating Rules are intended to enhance railway safety. The rules cover employee responsibilities, signalling equipment, procedures for safe train movement, dealing with accidents and other topics that directly and indirectly affect railway safety. Categories The full set of Canadian Rail Operating Rules is divided into 22 categories: #General Responsibilities #General Notice #General Rule #Definitions #Operating Rules #Time and Time Tables (Rules 1–6) #Signals – General (Rules 11–35) #Protection of Impassable or Slow Track (Rules 40–49) #Movement of Trains and Engines (Rules 51–116) #Radio (Rules 117–127) #General Procedures (Rules 131–148) #General Bulletin Order (GBO) (Rules 151–155) #Forms of GBO #Occupancy Control System (OCS) Rules (Rules 301–313) #Special Control System (SCS) Rules (Rules 351–353) #General Description and Location of Fixed Signals (Rules 401–404) #Block and Interlocking Signals (Rules 405–430) #Automatic Block Signal System (ABS) Rules (Rules 505–517) #Centralized Traffic Control System (CTC) (Rules 560–576) #Interlocking Rules (Rule 601–620) #Optional Rules (Multi Control System and Rules 49.4, 314, 577 and 577.1) #Rules for the Protection of Track Units and Track Work Signal Aspects *Flashing yellow *Flashing green *Flashing red *Solid red *Solid green *Solid white *Solid yellow Canada uses a signal system similar to the United States' signalling system, in that signals are either one-, two- or three-headed, and each one can show any of the aspects described above. There are different signal systems for rapid transit and other urban rail systems in Canada. There are also various types of signs that can be placed on a signal mast, which can modify a signal. An \\"L\\" plate upgrades any medium-speed signal to limited speed. An \\"A\\" plate is indicative of an absolute signal: it cannot be passed at all red signals. An \\"R\\" plate upgrades a regular all-red signal from a stop and proceed signal to a restricting signal. A \\"DV\\" plate makes a slow-speed signal into diverging speed. Note Canadian railways use miles per hour not kilometres per hour, even though road speed limits are in kilometres per hour. Speed limits Speed limits ;Track speed: This means whatever the pre-approved speed limit for the track. (Note that track speed can be as low as or less, but still show a signal for track speed) ;Limited speed: This means . ;Medium speed: This means . ;Diverging speed: This means . ;Slow speed: This means in interlocking areas, and in non-interlocking areas. ;Restricted speed: This means an absolute maximum of , and the crew must be extra cautious as well as being able to stop in half the distance of vision. The signal system explained here assumes the signal displaying has three heads. Any signal indication that has a solid red on the third head down can also be indicated with just two heads. Any indication with solid red lights on the second and third heads down can be indicated with just one head. For example a green light on the top head still means proceed at track speed, no speed restrictions or stops within the next three signals, regardless of if the signal has only one head or not. A flashing yellow on the second head down with red on top and bottom would still mean limited to stop even if there was no bottom head. This article will also indicate a signal indication by stating the colour of the signal over another colour of the signal over the next colour of the signal, for example red over flashing green over flashing yellow. A signal can indicate some sort of restriction two signals in advance by flashing a yellow on the top head. If the signal heads are staggered, as in, one light is on the left side of the mast, then the next one down to the right side of the mast, etc., then that means signals are controlled by the automated CTC signal system, and that stop signals are not absolute. If all the heads are on one side or the other side of the mast, then a stop signal is absolute. If the signal is absolute, then the stop indication means stop and do not go until the signal improves or the crew gets written permission from RTC to proceed. If they are not absolute, the signal is controlled by CTC, and the crew may go at restricted speed after a complete stop.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4lUiaWT8wEhttp://www.railroadsignals.us/rulebooks/cror/ Any signal that is ambiguous or otherwise unclear or if any of the lights are not showing, then the signal must be read as if they are showing the most restrictive aspects they can display (that is, red) unless a solid yellow is on the bottom head, in which case the signal is interpreted as a restricting signal, because if the other signals are extinguished, they must be interpreted as if they are solid red, and a red over red over yellow does in fact mean restricting.https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/railsafety/rules-tco167-163.htm Signal meanings thumb *Clear: Green over red over red. *Clear to Limited: Yellow over flashing green over red. *Clear to Medium: Yellow over green over red. *Clear to Slow: Yellow over Yellow over red. *Clear to Restricting: Yellow over red over flashing red/white. *Clear to Stop: Yellow over red over red. *Limited to Clear: Red over flashing green. *Limited to Limited: Red over flashing green over flashing green. *Limited to Medium: Red over flashing green over green. *Limited to Slow: Red over flashing green over flashing yellow. *Limited to Restricting: Red over flashing green over flashing red/white. *Limited to Stop: Red over flashing yellow over red. *Medium to Clear: Red over green over red *Medium to Limited: Red over green over flashing green. *Medium to Medium: Red over green over green. *Medium to Slow: Red over green over yellow. *Medium to Restricting: Red over green over flashing red/white. *Medium to Stop: Red over yellow over red.

It was commanded by Richard Clement Moody. Selection When news of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush reached London, Moody was hand-picked by the Colonial Office, under Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, to establish British order and to transform the newly established Colony of British Columbia (1858–66) into the British Empire's \\"bulwark in the farthest west\\" Donald J. Hauka, McGowan's War, Vancouver: 2003, New Star Books, p.146 and “found a second England on the shores of the Pacific”.Jean Barman, The West Beyond the West: A History of British Columbia, (Toronto: University of Toronto), p.71 Lytton desired to send to the colony 'representatives of the best of British culture, not just a police force’: he sought men who possessed ‘courtesy, high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world’ and he decided to send Moody, whom the Government considered to be the 'English gentleman and British Officer’ at the head of the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment, which was created by an Act of the British Parliament on 2 August 1858. The Engineers were believed to exemplify the qualities sought by the Government. Col. Richard Moody, commander of the Columbia detachment Moody and his family arrived in British Columbia in December 1858, commanding the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment. He was sworn in as the first Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia and appointed Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for British Columbia. On the advice of Lytton, Moody hired Robert Burnaby as his personal secretary, and the two became close friends. Moody's letter to his friend Arthur Blackwood Esq. at the Colonial Office, dated February 1, 1859, contains several passages of sublime poetical description that demonstrate the qualities for which he was preferred. The Detachment under Moody consisted of 150 sappers and officers. This was later increased to 172. Moody had three Captains: Robert Mann Parsons, John Marshall Grant and Henry Reynolds Luard. The contingent included two subalterns, Lieutenant Arthur Lempriere (later a Major-General) and Lieutenant Henry Palmer, a surgeon, Dr John Vernon Seddall, Captain William Driscoll Gosset, a retired Royal Engineer, who served as civilian treasurer and commissary officer, Rev. John Sheepshanks served as the detachment's chaplain, and Burnaby. =Ned McGowan's War= Moody had hoped to begin immediately the foundation of a capital city, but upon his arrival at Fort Langley he learned of an outbreak of violence at the settlement of Hill's Bar. This led to an incident popularly known as \\"Ned McGowan's War\\", where Moody led 22 Engineers and Judge Matthew Baillie Begbie to Yale to face down a group of rebellious American miners. Order was restored without further violence. Moody describes the incident thus: \\"The notorious Ned McGowan, of Californian celebrity at the head of a band of Yankee Rowdies defying the law! Every peaceable citizen frightened out of his wits!—Summons & warrants laughed to scorn! A Magistrate seized while on the Bench, & brought to the Rebel’s camp, tried, condemned, & heavily fined! A man shot dead shortly before! Such a tale to welcome me at the close of a day of great enjoyment.\\" ' ' He enjoyed a warm reception for his success that he describes thus: \\"They gave me a Salute, firing off their loaded Revolvers over my head—Pleasant—Balls whistling over one’s head! as a compliment! Suppose a hand had dropped by accident! I stood up, & raised my cap & thanked them in the Queen’s name for their loyal reception of me\\". =The Foundation of New Westminster= In British Columbia, Moody ‘wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness’ and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for British dominance, ‘styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the crown and of the robe’. Subsequent to the enactment of the Pre-emption Act of 1860, Moody settled the Lower Mainland. He selected the site and founded the new capital, New Westminster. He selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port. He also struck by the majestic beauty of the site, writing in his letter to Blackwood, \\"The entrance to the Frazer is very striking--Extending miles to the right & left are low marsh lands (apparently of very rich qualities) & yet fr the Background of Superb Mountains-- Swiss in outline, dark in woods, grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you. Everything is large and magnificent, worthy of the entrance to the Queen of England’s dominions on the Pacific mainland. [...] My imagination converted the silent marshes into Cuyp-like pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset. [...] The water of the deep clear Frazer was of a glassy stillness, not a ripple before us, except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away\\".Jean Barman, The West Beyond the West: A History of British Columbia, (Toronto: University of Toronto) p.7 Moody designed the first Coat of arms of British Columbia.Ormsby However, Lord Lytton 'forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town’ and the efforts of Moody's Engineers were continuous hampered by insufficient funds, which, together with the continuous opposition of Douglas, 'made it impossible for [Moody's] design to be fulfilled’. =The Feud with Governor Douglas= Throughout his tenure in British Columbia, Moody was engaged in a bitter feud with Sir James Douglas, Governor of Vancouver Island, whose jurisdiction overlapped with his own. Moody's position as Chief Commissioner and Lieutenant-Governor was one of ‘higher prestige [and] lesser authority' than that of Douglas, despite Moody's vastly superior social position in the eyes of the Engineers and the British Government: Moody had been selected by Lord Lytton due to his possession of the quality of the ‘archetypal English gentleman and British Officer’, his family was ‘eminently respectable’: he was the son of Colonel Thomas Moody (1779-1849), one of the wealthiest mercantilists in the West Indies, who owned much of the land in the islands where Douglas's father owned a small amount of land and from which Douglas's mother, 'a half-breed', originated. Governor Douglas's ethnicity and made him ‘an affront to Victorian society’. Mary Moody, the descendant of the Hawks industrial dynasty and the Boyd merchant banking family,Howard, Joseph Jackson (1893–1906). Heraldic Visitation of England and Wales. 8. pp. 161–164. wrote on 4 August 1859 \\"it is not pleasant to serve under a Hudson's Bay Factor\\" and that the \\"Governor and Richard can never get on\\". In letter to the Colonial Office of 27 December 1858, Richard Clement Moody boasts that he has ‘entirely disarmed [Douglas] of all jealously' Douglas repeatedly insulted the Engineers by attempting to assume their command and refusing to acknowledge their value in the nascent colony Margaret A. Ormsby, author of the Dictionary of Canadian Biography entry for Moody (2002), condemns Moody for a contribution to the abortive development of the city. However, most other historians have exonerated Moody for the abortive development of the city and consider his achievement to be impressive, especially with regard to the perpetual insufficiency of funds and the personally motivated opposition of Douglas, whose opposition to the project continually retarded its development. Robert Edgar Cail, Don W. Thomson, Ishiguro, and Scott have praised Moody for his contribution, the latter accusing Ormsby of being ‘adamant in her dislike of Colonel Moody’ despite the evidence, and almost all biographies of Moody, including those of the Institute of Civil Engineers, the Royal Engineers, and the British Columbia Historical Association, are flattering. =Other developments= Moody and the Royal Engineers also built an extensive road network, including what would become Kingsway, connecting New Westminster to False Creek, the North Road between Port Moody and New Westminster, and the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park. He named Burnaby Lake after his private secretary Robert Burnaby and named Port Coquitlam's 400-foot \\"Mary Hill\\" after his wife. As part of the surveying effort, several tracts were designated \\"government reserves\\", which included Stanley Park as a military reserve (a strategic location in case of an American invasion). The Pre-emption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land, so large parcels were snapped up by speculators, including 3,750 acres (1,517 hectares) by Moody himself. For this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbing. Port Moody is named after him. It was established at the end of a trail that connected New Westminster with Burrard Inlet to defend New Westminster from potential attack from the US. Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment was disbanded in July, 1863. The Moody family, only 22 men and 8 wives returned to England, while the rest, 130 sappers, elected to remain in BC.Ormsby. Scott contends that the departure of the Engineers 'doomed' the development of the settlement and the fruition of Lord Lytton's dream. Chartres Brew replaced Moody as land commissioner.

At the same time Swedish Match was founded. In parallel Kreuger started to invest in a number of industrial companies, mainly in the Swedish industry. In 1923 Kreuger founded the holding company IMCO (International Match Corporation) together with Lee, Higginson & Co. in New York City. IMCO handled the Kreuger match business in America, South America and other countries outside Europe. During the year 1930, 64% of the entire trade on the Stockholm stock exchange was related to Kreuger companies,Stig Algott, Stockholms fondbörs 100 år (eng. Stockholm stock exchange 100 year), 1963. (Swedish) which also were involved in complicated international financial operations. In April 1932, a month after Ivar Kreuger's suicide, most of the Kreuger empire went bankrupt as well as Ivar Kreuger himself, who left nothing behind for his family. All of Kreuger's personal belongings, including houses, boats, furniture, paintings, etc., was sold at several auctions in 1932. Kreuger & Toll Construction AB however survived, as this company did not belong to the holding company, although the financial connections between these companies was never fully clarified. The company changed its name to Toll Construction AB. The company merged with another Swedish construction company in 1968. Swedish Match was reconstructed in 1936 with the help of government guaranteed loans that was repaid within a couple of years, but IMCO did not survive. The work with the bankruptcy took nine years, and was not completed until 1941. One of the reasons for the long investigation time was that the documentation was insufficient, transactions were difficult to follow and complex cross- ownerships between the companies that was almost impossible to straighten out. Ivar Kreuger also had made complex transactions that no one else except himself knew about. Only Kreuger had the full view of how the company was built up. A summary of the economics for the holding company Kreuger & Toll AB, including the American holding company IMCO, excluding the construction business within Kreuger & Toll Construction AB, was carried out in 1943,Bonnier encyclopedia, 2nd ed. (1943), pages 384–385, Kreuger crash (Swedish). showing the following figures:The entire world population in 1925 was around 2.6 billion people (Ref: Bonnier encyklopedia SE, 1943) and the size of the industrial world and market in correspondence with that. The direct comparison of business recalculated for values in 2007, with a population around 6.5 billion people is thus difficult to make. *Actual profits generated from 1917–1932: 151 million SEK (in year 2007 equal to 4 000 million SEK) *Actual return value to owners of shares and debentures, 1917–1932: 668 million SEK (in year 2007 equal to 18 500 million SEK) To cover this huge gap, analysts have claimed that Ivar Kreuger's intention was probably to slowly increase the match prices as soon as he had gained control of the entire match production in the world, parallel with the increased profits from his industrial companies that soon became a large part of the holding company's business, and continuously increasing during 1930, while the match industry had a tendency to slowly decrease in importance. Swedish Match and Kreuger & Toll AB holding company headquarters was the Tändstickspalatset (Matchstick Palace) with the address Västra Trädgårdsgatan 15 in Stockholm, where Ivar Kreuger had his Swedish office. The house was built by Kreuger & Toll Construction AB. The main office for the Swedish Match remained in the same building until 1991.

Published in 1976, Yates's book explores the tragic lives of two sisters. Along with Revolutionary Road, his debut novel, the book is considered to be Yates' finest work. Summary The famous opening line of the novel warns of the bleak narrative to follow: \\"Neither of the Grimes sisters would have a happy life, and looking back it always seemed that the trouble began with their parents' divorce.\\" Emily and Sarah are sisters who share little in terms of character, but much in terms of disappointment with their lives. Emily, the younger and more intellectual and cosmopolitan of the two, seeks love in numerous disappointing affairs and short-term relationships. Sarah, the prettier and more conventional one, marries young and bears children to an uncouth and abusive husband. The novel begins in the 1930s, when the sisters are children, and ends in the 1970s several years after Sarah's death. It primarily revolves around Emily as the book's central character, but the book employs Yates' characteristic shifts of consciousness throughout. Their troubled, rootless mother Pookie, like many Yatesian matriarchs, is likely modeled on his own mother, who was nicknamed Dookie. Critical reception Stewart O'Nan notes \\"The Easter Parade signaled the resurgence of Richard Yates. A year after the critically panned Disturbing the Peace, critics hailed him as an American master. They spoke now of his body of work and raved over the effortless elegance of his prose and the depth of his tragic vision.\\" The publication of The Easter Parade marked the beginning of a relatively stable and productive period for Yates, and the book has been championed by Joan Didion, David Sedaris, Kurt Vonnegut, Larry McMurtry and Tao Lin, among others. Film adaptation In 2005, Caroline Kaplan acquired the rights for a film adaptation to the novel. References in popular culture The novel is mentioned in Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters: Lee (Barbara Hershey), one of the titular \\"sisters\\", thanks her brother-in-law Eliot (Michael Caine) for lending her the book.

He played college football at Kansas State University where he was a football and Academic All-American. He went to high school at Booker T. Washington High School in Tulsa. College Lockett broke the school career touchdown receptions record in the same game that head coach Bill Snyder set the record for most career wins by a Kansas State football coach on September 30, 1995 for the Kansas State Wildcats. Prior to the formation of the Big 12 Conference in 1996, the Kansas State Wildcats competed in the Big Eight Conference. As a member of the 1996 Wildcats, he led the Big 12 Conference in receptions per game. He was a 1996 All-Big 12 Conference first team wide receiver. He was a 1996 first team Academic All-Big 12 selection. On special teams, he made first blocked kick in Big 12 Conference history on August 31, 1996. He established the following Kansas State school records: career receptions (217, 1993-96), career receiving yards (3032, 1993-96) - broken 1998 by Tyler Lockett, career receiving touchdowns (26, 1993-96), single-game receptions by a freshman (8, 11/20/93), single-season receiving yards by a freshman (770, 1998) - broken 1998 by Aaron Lockett, single-season receptions by a freshman (50, 1993), career 100-yard receiving games (9, 1993-96)-broken 2000 by Quincy Morgan, single-season receptions (72, 1996) - broken 1998 by Darnell McDonald, and single-season receiving touchdowns (13, 1995) - broken 2000 by Morgan. He led Kansas State in the following statistics, receptions (1993, 50; 1995, 56; 1996, 72), receiving yards (1993, 770; 1994, 583; 1995, 797; 1996, 882), and scoring (78, 1995). He also earned Academic All-America distinction in 1995 and 1996. Professional career =Kansas City Chiefs= The Kansas City Chiefs selected Lockett in the second round of the 1997 NFL Draft with the 47th overall selection. As a rookie, his only reception came in a November 23, 1997 contest against Seattle for the Chiefs who went 13-3. This was the only playoff team that he played for. In 1998, he caught 19 passes for 281 yards, followed by the best year of his career with 34 receptions for 426 yards and two touchdowns for the 1999 Chiefs, and then 33 receptions for 422 yards and two touchdowns for the 2000 Chiefs. In week 4 of the 2000 NFL season, he made a key third down reception on the clinching drive of the game as Elvis Grbac engineered an 8-play 80-yard drive to earn a 23-22 victory over Denver. His highest single-game yardage total came in week 9 of the 2000 season when he totaled 77 yards, including a first half touchdown against Seattle. That season, he tallied 7 receptions the following week for 57 yards and then he became the regular punt returner for the rest of the season, totaling 24 returns in the final 7 games. =Washington Redskins= Following the 2000 season, he signed a two-year contract with the Washington Redskins. Although he was the third receiver with the Redskins for the 2001 season, he was considered a receiver who demanded coverage from one of the opposition's top defenders. His production slipped in the 2001 season, only recording 22 receptions for 293 yards with zero touchdowns, but he completed his only pass attempt for a 31-yard touchdown to Derrius Thompson after receiving a backwards pass from Tony Banks. On November 1, he was released by the Redskins after tallying 11 receptions (including two touchdowns) for 129 yards, and a second touchdown pass making him two-for-two. =Jacksonville Jaguars= Lockett signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars two days after his release from the Redskins, and had five receptions (including two touchdowns) in his seven games for the team. Although less productive in terms of yards and receptions, the 2002 NFL season gave Lockett his career-high 4 touchdown receptions (and a touchdown pass). He re-signed with Jacksonville in the spring of 2003, but did not play any games for the Jaguars. =New York Jets= Lockett was signed by the New York Jets in mid-November. Lockett spent four weeks on the practice squad before being activated for the final three games in which he made 5 receptions for 76 yards. Personal life His son Tyler is a wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks. Another son, Sterling was offered a scholarship to Kansas State for their 2022 recruitment class, but has yet to commit. His younger brother Aaron played for the Canadian Football League for three seasons.

It was first scientifically described in 1890 in England. This nematode has a wide host range. Among the most important species affected are Chrysanthemums and strawberries. A. ritzemabosi is a migratory foliar feeding nematode. It can feed both ectoparasitically and endoparasitically, with the later causing the most significant damage. When adequate moisture is present, this nematode enters the leaves and feeds from inside the tissue. Typical damage is characterized by necrotic zones between the veins of the leaves. Its lifecycle is short; only ten days from egg to mature adult. A single female can lay as many as 3,500 eggs. This pest can be difficult to control. Host plant resistance, hot water treatments, and predatory mites are recommended. Nomenclature and Synonyms First described in England in 1890, it was given the name Aphelenchus olesistus by Ritzema-Bos in 1893. In 1908, Markinowski grouped A. olesisyus, A. fragariae, and A. omerodis under the common name A. omerodis. A. olesistus was recognized as an individual species and given the current name Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi by Schwartz in 1911.Decker, Heinz. Plant Nematodes and their Control. Phytonematology. 1981. Amerind Publishing Co. New Delhi. This species may also be known by the following synonyms: Aphelenchus ritzemabosi Schwartz 1911, Pathoaphelenchus ritzemabosi (Schwartz 1911), Steiner 1932, Aphelenchoides (Chitinoaphelenchus) ritzemabosi (Schwartz 1911) Fuchs 1937, Pseudaphelenchoides ritzemabosi (Schwartz 1911) Drozdovski 1967, Tylenchus ribes Taylor 1917, Aphelenchus ribes (Taylor 1917) Goodey 1932, Aphelenchoides ribes (Taylor 1917) Goodey 1933, Aphelenchus phyllophagus Stewart 1921 Description Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi ranges in length from 0.7 to 1.2 mm with the females of the species having the potential to be slightly longer than the males. Male A. ritzemabosi are often wider than females. The head is sharply differentiated from the body in that it is noticeably wider than the neck. This nematode has four lateral incisures. Females have at least two rows of oocytes and the spicule on the male nematodes is a short ventral process without outgrowths. Hosts and symptoms A. ritezmabosi has a wide host range of almost 200 plant species, and is an important disease in chrysanthemum and other ornamentals.Jenkins, W. R. & Taylor D. P. (1967) Plant Nematology. New York: Reinhold Publishing Corp. Other ornamental hosts of A. ritzemabosi are anemones, asters, carnations, Chinaster, cinerarias, coneflowers, crassulas, creeping bellflower, dahlias, delphiniums, elders, lupines, monkeyflower, phlox, pouchflower, rhododendrons, sages, Siberian wallflower, water peperomia, and zinnias.University of Illinois Extension. Report on Plant Disease. RPD No.1102 July 2000. A common symptom of A. ritezmabosi is seen when the nematode is feeding in the foliar tissue. Angular lesions are formed, which are chlorotic at first then turn necrotic as the feeding persists. A sign that an A. ritzeambosi nematode is feeding in the bud of a plant is brown scars on the bud and surrounding tissue. The nematode also produces secretions that have the ability to cause several other symptoms in infested plants including shortening of inter-nodes, creating a bushy appearance, browning and failure of the shoot to grow, as well as distorted leaf formation.Plant Pathology, Gorge N. Agrios. Academic Press, 2005. p868 & 869 Disease cycle A. ritzemabosi is an endoparasitic nematode, meaning that it feeds on plant tissue from the inside of the cell. Adult nematodes infest the leaves of their host plant by swimming up the outside of the stem in a film of water. This can only happen when the relative humidity is very high.Siddiqi, M. R. 1974: Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi. CIH descriptions of plant-parasitic nematodes. Set 3, No. 32. Once it has reached a leaf it enters through the stomata to begin feeding in an endoparasitic fashion. Once inside the host it is capable of invading and infecting host tissue at all life stages, other than the egg. The more mature stages show an improved ability to migrate through host tissue.[3] When the growing season of the host comes to an end the nematode goes into a quiescent state overwintering inside the leaf tissue. When spring comes they end their quiescent state then find and infest a new host. A. ritzeambosi is also capable of feeding ectoparasitically, from the outside of the cell. It has been known to feed ectoparasitically on the buds of some plants such as strawberry and black currants. Above ground ectoparasitic feeding can only happen in events of prolonged high humidity or other circumstances providing a long term film of water on the plant which protects the nematode from exposure. Ectoparasitic feeding also happens on the roots in the soil.Maggenti, Armand (1981). General Nematology. New York: Springer-Verlag. . All of this happens in an extremely short amount of time, it takes around 10 days for A. ritzembosi to go from egg to adult. All life stages are vermiform and migratory. [5] Reproduction Studies have shown that in optimal conditions a single female A. ritzemabosi can produce up to thousands of offspring in the period of about a month.J. S. DOLLIVER 1), A. C. HILDEBRANDT, & A. J. RIKERSTUDIES OF REPRODUCTION OF APHELENCHOIDES RITZEMABOSI (SCHWARTZ) ON PLANT TISSUES IN CULTURE. Department of Plant Pathology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, U.S.A. 2) French & Barraclough (1961) obtained a maximum number of 3,500 progeny from a single A. ritzemabosi female after 38 days at mean greenhouse temperatures of 17° to 23 °C. Temperature influence on reproduction showed that higher temperatures generally lead to more reproductive actions. No reproduction was observed at temperatures of 8 degrees Celsius. Fertilized females go on reproducing for six months without further fertilization In chrysanthemum leaves, the female lays about 25-30 eggs in a compact group. These eggs hatch in 3–4 days and the juveniles take 9–10 days to reach maturity. The total life cycle takes 10–13 days In susceptible varieties of Chrysanthemum, the female remains in one place within the leaf as it feeds on adjacent cells and continuously lays eggs. In resistant varieties, the female moves through the leaf laying only a few eggs as it goes. Few, if any of the juveniles make it to maturity. Like many other plant parasitic nematodes, A. ritzemabosi has the ability to reproduce on fungal tissue, suggesting that soil fungus may contribute to the nematode's survival when no host is available. Laboratory tests have shown that Botrytis cinerea and many Rhizoctonia species of fungi are more conducive to A. ritzeambosi growth and reproduction. These fungi are used to culture and propagate other Aphelenchid species as well. In adult females, the eggs can be seen developing inside their bodies before they are deposited to hatch. If an adult female is cut off from a reliable supply of food it has been observed that the egg will disappear from view, evidently being aborted and reabsorbed by the female. Environment A.ritzeambosi has a very wide range. In the US, its distribution is restricted to California, Colorado, Florida, and Wyoming. It is widespread in Mexico. It is also present but restricted in Asia, including many provinces of China, Japan, Iran, and India. It is also present throughout Europe from Portugal to Siberia; it was once present in Denmark but has been eradicated. It is widespread in South Africa, and the Canary Islands.Invasive Species Compendium www.cabi.org A. ritzemabosi is more commonly associated with temperate climates, even though it can be found in both tropical and temperate localities. It is best suited to thrive and reproduce when in highly humid environments, where it tends to be more active in infesting hosts than in dryer environments.Kohl, L. M. 2011. Astronauts of the Nematode World: An Aerial View of Foliar Nematode Biology, Epidemiology, and Host Range. APSnet Features. the optimal temperature for reproduction is 17 °C-23 °C. Management Infected leaves and plants should be removed and destroyed. Since this nematode relies on moisture to move up the plant and between plants, care should be taken to avoid periods of wetness. Drip irrigation is preferable over overhead spray irrigation for this reason. This nematode is susceptible to elevated temperatures. A hot water treatment at a temperature of 115 degrees Fahrenheit for five minutes of dormant plant materials such as bulbs, runners or cuttings intended for propagation can be used and is effective at eliminating most nematodes that may be infesting the plant material.Observations on the biology of chrysanthemum eelworm Aphelenchoides ritzema- bosi (Schwartz) Steiner in florists’ chrysanthemum I. Spread of eelworm infestation Sanitation of equipment is also important to controlling the nematode. Pots potting soil, and tools should be cleaned by baking or steaming at 180-200 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes.University of Illinois Extension Report on Plant Disease. RPD No. 1102, July 2000. Care must be taken so that the temperatures needed to eliminate the infesting nematodes does not irrevocably harm the plant material. Parathion has proven to be a potent chemical control of A. ritzemabosi, especially in chrysanthemum. The Bulb Mite, Rhizoglyphus echinopus, is a known predator of A. ritzemabosi and can serve in biological control practices. Host-plant resistance is also used to control A. ritzemabosi. The following cultivars of Chrysanthemum are resistant to this pest: Amy Shoesmith, Delightful, Orange Beauty, and Orange Peach Blossom. These are listed as resistant but not immune. This implies that the plant may still be attacked by adult nematodes but reproduction is highly reduced if not prevented. Importance Infection of various plants by A. ritzemabosi is likely to cause some degree of yield loss to growers where the nematode is present since photosynthetic area of the leaves is damaged or destroyed as the nematodes feed and reproduce. However, this nematode is not considered to cause economic loss unless environmental conditions are very suitable. In 1981, Crop losses from plant-parasitic nematodes in the US were estimated by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) at about $4.0 billion per year. A. ritzeambosi causes substantial economic loss in basil crops in Italy as it infects the economically valuable portion of the plant.Nicola Vovlas et al. 2005. Identification and histopathology of the foliar nematode Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi (Nematoda:Aphelenchoididae) A. ritzemabosi is a serious pest of strawberry in Ireland, where yield reductions up to 60% have been recorded. The crown weight of strawberry cv. Senga Sengana was reduced by 51% by A. ritzemabosi. This damage results in fruit yield loss of up to 65%. A. ritzemabosi infections can reduce the number of runners by up to 25-30%. The level of susceptibility varies among cultivars. An infection by A. ritzemabosi can cause average yield losses of an estimated 53.4% in the strawberry variety Korallovaya 100. The variety Yasna seems to be somewhat less susceptible to A. ritzemabosi than Korallovaya 100 or Muto. In Poland, A. ritzemabosi infestation destroyed 45% of chrysanthemum plants on a holding, and for the most susceptible varieties the number was as high as 92%.http://www.plantwise.org Chrysanthemum foliar eelworm ( Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi ). This organism is a 'C' rated pest in the U.S. state of California, meaning that it is not subject to state enforcement outside of nurseries except to retard spread or to provide for pest cleanliness in nurseries. For a sense of how that relates to other plant pests, an 'A' rated pest is an organism of known economic importance subject to action enforced by the state (or County Agricultural Commissioner acting as a state agent) involving: eradication, quarantine regulation, containment, rejection, or other holding action such as Aphelenchoides besseyi (strawberry summer dwarf nematode).

It is one of the tropical root-knot nematodes and a major agricultural pest in many countries. It has many hosts. Meloidogyne javanica reproduces by obligatory mitotic parthenogenesis (apomixis).  Hosts  Meloidogyne javanica is a nematode pathogen that affects over 770 species of plants (Cabi 2018). The hosts of this pathogen include both weeds and crops of economic importance. Those of economic importance include tea, grapevine, vegetables, fruit trees, cereals, and ornamentals (Cabi 2018). Meloidogyne javanica is considered an agricultural pest, as it is extremely abundant and damaging (Alford 2012).  Symptoms  Because there are so many different hosts for this pathogen, the symptoms are very variable. Common symptoms include abnormal leaf color, abnormal leaf form, wilting leaves, galls, swollen roots, reduced root system, dwarfing and senescence (Cabi 2018). This pathogen does the most damage when present in light soils with hot weather conditions (Alford 2012).  Diagnosis  = Morphological Characteristics = Because there are many plant hosts and variable symptoms, it is important when diagnosing Meloidogyne javanica to obtain a specimen of the nematode from symptomatic plant tissue. The most commonly utilized diagnostic techniques are the use of morphological characteristics of the nematode species (Cunha et al. 2018). Head shape and stylet morphology of males are useful characteristics in the identification of M. javanica. When specimens are placed in the lateral position, the distance between the dorsal esophageal gland orifice to the stylet base can be used to distinguish between species of Meloidogyne (Cunha et al. 2018). In the case of M. javanica, the distance between these two features is relatively short (2.0-3.0 um). Additionally, M. javanica can be diagnosed by looking at the perineal pattern of females. The shape of the perineal region, dorsal arch, dorsal striae, lateral lines and phasmids are all characteristics useful in identification. = Biochemical = Biochemical diagnostic methods are commonly used when diagnosing nematode diseases. One technique frequently utilized is isoenzyme phenotyping (Cunha et al. 2018). Protein extract from M. javanica is applied to a gel electrophoresis to use as a reference phenotype. This analysis is based on the mobility of the enzymes in the extracted protein, which is diagnostic of different species of Meloidogyne (Cunha et al. 2018). = Molecular = There are many molecular techniques that are becoming increasingly more common, as they are easy, quick, and cheap (Cunha et al. 2018). Species-specific PCR is commonly utilized, which uses species-specific primers to target certain nematodes based on SCAR (sequence-characterized amplified region) (Qiu et al. 2006, Cunha et al. 2018). These markers are used for species-specific diagnosis of Meloidogyne (Cunha et al. 2018).  Management  = Biocontrol = One management strategy being used to control Meloidogyne javanica is a plant growth-promoting bacteria (Escobar et al. 2015). This biocontrol is specifically utilized in tomatoes, where fluorescent pseudomonads produce an antibiotic, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG). When DAPG is produced, it induces resistance in tomatoes against the root knot nematode, Meloidogyne javanica (Escobar et al. 2015). Another biocontrol with proven success in controlling Meloidogyne javanica is the fungus Trichoderma harzianum. According to Sahbani and Hadavi (2008), the fungus is able to infect nematode eggs and juveniles and destroy them, consequently decreasing nematode infection. = Chemical = Another control strategy that is being utilized is chemical control, however, this is being used less and less due to the toxicity and contamination potential (Escobar et al. 2015). The specific chemical control utilized is nematicide toxins, including Aldicarb, Enzon, Oxamyl, and Cadusafos (Rugby). The most effective nematicide against Meloidogyne javanica is Rugby in a dosage of 8 ppm (Soltani 2013). The chemical control can be used throughout the nematodes life cycle, as the nematicide can kill the nematode at any stage. Additionally, a more recent development in the management of Meloidogyne javanica is seed treatment. Treating seeds with abamectin before planting to has been proven effective against Meloidogyne javanica (Almeida, 2018). = Cultural Practices = A cultural practice used to control Meloidogyne javanica is crop rotation with non-host species or resistant cultivars. Rotation crops such as marigolds, perennial grasses, and bermudagrass have been successful in suppressing the disease caused by M. Javanica (Escobar et al. 2015). This management style is effective when the nematodes are host-specific, as rotating with a non-host crop eliminates the pathogen's ability to infect.  Pathogenesis  Because Meloidogyne javanica affects many hosts, there are different host-parasite relationships: = Potatoes = When Meloidogyne javanica infects potatoes, the pathogen specifically infects the tubers and roots. The tubers reveal that the nematode is present in the outermost layer of the tuber, including the vascular ring, and is surrounded by 3-6 large giant cells (Vovlas 2005). In addition, when M. javanica infects the root, the female finds its permanent feeding site where it is surrounded by 3-4 large giant cells. The nematode induces the plant to form large multinucleate giant cells adjacent to the stele tissue, modifying the structure of the vascular cylinder. This hyperplasia in the roots caused the formation of galls (Vovlas 2005). = Wheat = When M. javanica infects wheat, galls are produced on young and old roots. The roots infested with the pathogen contain 5-6 giant cells with hypertrophic nuclei causing the interruption of vascular bundles in the stellar area (Kheir 1979). Because the nematode body expands when it feeds on the cells, the cortical cells get compressed and the stele structure is modified, causing gall formation (Kheir 1979). Overall, when M. javanica infects a plant, the plant is instructed by the pathogen to produce giant cells, which modifies the structure of the stele tissue and causes the formation of galls.

Biography Strang was born in 1850 in Toronto to Struthers Strang, originally from Scotland and Janet Ferrie.FamilySearch Ancestral File He was educated in Hamilton. After a period working for hardware dealers W. McGivern & Co., in 1871 he moved to Winnipeg, where he worked as a bookkeeper (eventually as the head of his own accounting office) until moving to Edmonton in 1883. He became Edmonton's leading city accountant, and also worked as bank manager for Lafferty & Moore in 1890 and as business manager for the Moore and MacDowell sawmill in 1893. He was part owner of Ross Bros., a hardware firm. In 1892 he ran for alderman on Edmonton's first town council. He finished first of fourteen candidates (the top six were elected). He was re-elected in 1893, 1894, and 1895, but was defeated (finishing last of eight candidates) in 1896. Strang entered a partnership with James A. Stoval, with a firm name of Stoval & Strang, which he operated until his death. In 1898 he ran for the public school board and was elected. He served as the board's secretary-treasurer, and was re-elected in 1899. During the same election, he returned to town council as an alderman. Aldermanic terms had been lengthened to two years, but his seat was declared vacant October 9, 1900. He did not seek public office again in his lifetime. Colin Strang also served as secretary of both the board of trade and the Edmonton Rifle Association. Strang died on December 10, 1900, after over a year of ill health.Edmonton Civic Politicians: Historical, Biographical, and Contemporary (2005) His final and fatal illness struck him on Friday, December 7, when he was bedridden and eventually lapsed into a coma.

The railway was the first federally chartered railway in the Commonwealth of Nations to be owned by a municipality. It is one of only two in all of Canada, the other being the Greater Winnipeg Water District Railway in Manitoba. History The railway was incorporated in 1884S.C. 1884, c. 79 by Guelph merchants because of the indifference of the Grand Trunk Railway, which was the only choice for freight since 1856. Competition was the only answer to high rates. These plans were expanded in 1887, when authorization was obtained to lay down a further line to the northwest of Guelph, originally with the intention of going to Goderich but eventually ending at Linwood. The intention was to build tracks south to the CPR main line in Campbellville, Ontario. Construction began in May that year, and it opened on 20 August 1888. Rather than operate the link themselves, they leased it to the Canadian Pacific Railway who offered twice daily passenger service as well as freight service. The City of Guelph was a majority (70 percent) owner and in November 1910 it acquired the rest of the stock from the merchants for sole ownership. The Canadian Pacific Railway erected a passenger station and freight shed at Priory Square in Guelph, a location which is now the River Run Centre. In 1904, the Railway obtained authorization to construct branch lines from Linwood by way of Stratford to St. Marys and Clinton, and from Linwood to Listowel. The Stratford branch was never constructed, while the Listowel branch opened in 1908. In December 1997, the Canadian Pacific Railway did not renew the lease with Guelph Junction Railway. Undeterred, the city decided it would continue Guelph Junction Railway as an independent railway and contracted with Ontario Southland Railway (OSR) to provide the freight movement services, effective January 1, 1998. The Guelph Junction Railway, via OSR, provides customers with dual access service to the two major railways (CNR and CPR), which, along with good locally managed service, has increased traffic considerably. Much of the cargo is grain, plastics, chemicals, lumber, aggregates and other industrial products. Several other companies have expressed interest in operating the Guelph Junction Railway after the OSR's lease expires in July 2020. The Goderich-Exeter Railway will operate GJR when OSR's contract expires. =Guelph and Goderich Railway= The Railway promoted an expansion of its operations through the incorporation of the Guelph and Goderich Railway in 1901, which added a line extending from Guelph to Goderich that was completed in August 1907. The GJR was authorized to transfer its present northwest line to either the CPR or the G&G; in order to further the project.S.C. 1904, c. 82, s.3 The whole line was leased to the CPR, which had also incurred the cost of building it, and it was vested in the CPR, and the company dissolved, in 1956. It was in use until 1988 when it was abandoned by the CPR. =Guelph Junction Express= From Summer 2008 to August 2011, a 4.5 hour passenger tour service travelled the entire Guelph Junction Railway track as the Guelph Junction Express with its own 1950's vintage stainless steel cars.

Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 1,816 people, 2,659 housing units, and 520 single-family owner-occupied homes in the ZIP Code. The population density was 860.1 people per square mile (332.2/km2). There were 8,705 housing units at an average density of 1,376.8 per square mile (531.8/km2). The racial makeup of the ZIP Code was 61.9% White, 1.2% African American, 2.3% Native American, 1.0% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.6% from other races, and 6.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 27.9% of the population. There were 520 households, out of which 31.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.5% were married couples living together, 14.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.3% were non-families. 27.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.47 and the average family size was 3.01. In the ZIP Code the population was spread out, with 28.3% under the age of 18, 4.5% from 18 to 24, 26.1% from 25 to 44, 26.6% from 45 to 64, and 11.6% who were 65 years of age or older.

The median income for a household in the ZIP Code was $34,219, and the median income for a family was $41,343. Males had a median income of $31,128 versus $16,214 for females. The per capita income for the ZIP Code was $14,663. About 20.1% of families and 32.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 33.3% of those under age 18 and 0.0% of those age 65 or over. =Vacation population= The population who own vacation homes in Surgarloaf overwhelmingly outnumber the full-time residents. Only 2 ninths of the households in Sugarloaf have permanent occupancy by a family or a householder. This is due to the relatively low cost housing, as well as it being close to a ski resort, and a popular destination for Southern California vacationers in both the summer and winter. Because of this, demographics and population are likely different when all homeowners are taken into consideration.

Boxer was the first U.S.-born player drafted to the NHL, when he was drafted in the second round (17th overall) by the Detroit Red Wings in the 1968 NHL draft. Professional career =College hockey= Boxer started college in Houghton, Michigan at Michigan Technological University in 1966. He had played hockey in high school and tried out for the team. His freshman year was spent on the junior team, but Boxer showed enough of his skill to make the varsity squad for his sophomore season. Playing on lines with Al Karlander and Brian Watts, Boxer amassed 24 points in the 31-game season. But he also did much more, showing his speed and skill with the puck. Focusing on his studies toward the end of the season, Boxer had no idea that anyone else had even taken notice of his abilities. > \\"I remember it because it was the end of my sophomore season at Michigan > Tech University, I was just finishing up final exams. I walked over to the > athletic department just to check on something, I really don’t remember what > it was. I ran into member of the hockey coaching staff. My coach, John > MacInnes, told me that he had talked to the Detroit Red Wings the day before > and said that they were interested in me. He told me that there was a good > chance that I might be drafted the next day. But don’t count on it because > so many other things can happen. I think this was on a Friday.\\" On June 13, 1968, the sixth NHL Draft took place at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, and Herb Boxer's name was announced as the 17th player taken overall, by the Detroit Red Wings. Boxer was the first American-born player selected in the NHL draft. > \\"The next day I woke up and planned on meeting some of my friends down at a > local restaurant. I walked into the restaurant and I heard somebody say; > 'Hey Herb, I heard you got drafted.' The person informed me that I had been > drafted by Detroit. That was how I found out. There were no phone calls by > Detroit. The media wasn't covering it like they do today. Even the > university didn't cover it or announce it.

Thousands of > young men were being drafted by the military. So many who heard I had been > drafted thought I was on my way to Vietnam.\\" Boxer played two more seasons for Michigan Tech and led the team in goal scoring during the 1969–70 season, finishing with 24 goals and 14 assists. He decided to sign with the Red Wings after graduation, among other offers for his services. > \\"It was 1970 and the US team was holding their training camp, I had a good > training camp with them. So what ended up happening was that I had two > different hockey organizations wanting my services at the time. There were > some good players on the Olympic Team at the time including Henry Boucha, > Robbie Ftorek and Mark Howe. I would have loved to have played with them. > But Detroit made me an offer and I decided to go with them.\\" Detroit offered Boxer an US$8,000 salary to go along with a US$7,000 signing bonus. =Minor league hockey= After graduation, Boxer started play with the Fort Worth Wings of the Central Hockey League, reuniting with former teammate Al Karlander. Boxer had a slow start, scoring 17 points in his first season with the Wings, but turning it around with a strong second season. For the 1971–72 season, Boxer finished fourth on the team in scoring with 23 goals and 28 assists. He even tacked on six points in Fort Worth's short playoff run. After his first season in Fort Worth, Boxer was drafted again, this time by the U.S. Army; however he wouldn't end up serving. > \\"I was classified 1-A before I turned pro. I suffered a back injury that > first season in the minors. By the time I was drafted, I went for my > physical and failed it. I was classified 4-F. That back injury made the > difference.\\" Soon after, Boxer was moved to another minor league affiliate when he joined the Virginia Wings of the American Hockey League for the 1972–73 season. Boxer continued his great offensive play, scoring 54 points and even helped carry Virginia into the playoffs, losing in the semi-finals to the eventual Calder Cup champions, the Cincinnati Swords. The following season saw more of the same as Boxer finished fifth on his team in scoring with 40 points. Let go by Virginia after the end of the season, Boxer found a short home with the Green Bay Bobcats of the United States Hockey League. He only played a handful of games before heading to Kalamazoo, Michigan to play for the Kalamazoo Wings of the International Hockey League. After finishing out the season with Kalamazoo, Boxer was asked to represent the United States in the 1975 World Championship in West Germany. He was released from his contract in February and joined the team, where he was quickly named their Captain. \\"Bob Johnson was the coach of that team. I got to play with the team for their final six weeks. I figured that this was a great way to end my hockey playing career. I had had a good career. I ended up getting an offer to play in Sweden the following season, but I had enough and was ready to start the next part of my life.\\" The U.S. team took sixth place in the tournament and Boxer retired from playing ice hockey in 1975. =Boxer the coach= After the World Championships, Boxer found a job as a hockey program director for a small place in Rockford, Illinois. He enjoyed the work and in 1976 accepted the position of assistant coach at his alma mater, under his former coach MacInnes. He remained assistant coach for nine years under MacInnes and Jim Nahrgang until Nahrgang resigned in February 1985 and Boxer was promoted to head coach of the Huskies. During that time, Boxer also coached with the U.S. Junior National Team in 1978 and 1979. In his first season as head coach, Boxer coached the Huskies to a losing record of 10-26-4. His second season saw more of the same with a 15-24-1 record. However in the 1987–88 season, Boxer coached the Huskies to a 20-20-1 record and was named WCHA Coach of the Year. After their first season without a losing record, the Huskies returned to their losing ways for the next two seasons and Boxer was let go after the 1989–90 season. Boxer wouldn't return to coaching until 1994 when he stepped in to help the struggling Memphis RiverKings of the Central Hockey League. Boxer helped turn the team around and make the playoffs twice in his three full seasons with the team. The RiverKings even made it to the finals in the 1996–97 season. However, Boxer was let go the following season after coaching the RiverKings to a 9-23-0 record midway through the season. Boxer decided to retire from coaching. Life after hockey Boxer currently works in Memphis, Tennessee as a technical recruiter for Cook Systems International. He is also the father of Marc Boxer and Jay Boxer, both of whom played college hockey. Boxer is proud of both his hometown and the impact he has had on American born players in the NHL, as told in an interview on NHL.com; > \\"I come from the twin-city area of Houghton and Hancock, Michigan.

Introduction Pratylenchus brachyurus, like many other plant-parasitic nematodes, are microscopic worms that can be damaging to many agricultural crops. Across the world, many billions of dollars each year are lost due to the damaging abilities of nematodes on cash crops.Sasser, J. N., and D. W. Freckman. 1987. A world perspective in nematology: The role of the Society. Pp. 7-14 in J. A. Veech and D. W. Dickerson, eds. Vistas in Nematology: A commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Society of Nematologist. Hyattsville, Maryland: Society of Nematologists. P. brachyurus is a migratory endoparasite UC Davis Nemaplex Taxadata that enters the roots and moves throughout the root tissue while completing its life cycle. History Under the old classification system based on morphology, these nematodes were under the Class Adenophorea. This changed in 2004 when a new classification system was presented by De Ley and Blaxter using SSU rDNA for comparison between different species of nematodes. Using this new system, De Ley and Blaxter placed P. brachyurus in the Class Chromadorea, Order Rhabditida.De Ley, P., and Blaxter, M., 2004. A new system for Nematoda: combining morphological characters with molecular trees, and translating clades into ranks and taxa. Nematology Monographs and Perspectives 2:633-653. In 1929 Godfrey first described P. brachyurus as the main cause for pineapple-root disease and called them Tylenchus brachyurus. He also discussed several other nematodes which were all later put into the genus Pratylenchus.Godfrey, G.H. 1929. A destructive root disease of pineapples and other plants due to Tylenchus brachyurus n. sp. Phytopathology 19:611-629. In 1934, Filipjev proposed the genus Pratylenchus. This proposed new genus name came with some challenges because the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature states that the new genus name must come with a statement as to why you want to change the name. It must also give reasons differentiating the new genus plus give the name of the type species. In 1936 the new genus name was universally accepted.Filipjev, I. N. 1934. The classification of the free-living nematodes and their relationship to the parasitic nematode. Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collection. Publication 3216, Leiden: E. J. Brill. 66ppStoll, N. R., R. Ph. Dollfus, J. Forest, N. D. Riley, C. W. Sabrosky, C. W. Wright, and R. V. Melville, eds. 1964. International code of zoological nomenclature. London: The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature.Filipjev, I. N. 1936. On the classification of the Tylenchinae. Proceedings of the Helminthological Society of Washington 3:80-80. Description This nematode is a migratory endoparsite that ranges from about 0.4 to 0.5 mm long and has a lip region that is angular and offset from the body.UC Davis Nemaplex Taxadata It is generally low and flat and has two distinct annules. P. brachyurus has a short strong stylet about 20 um long and large round basal knobs. It also has a short ventral overlap of the esophagus. The females have lateral fields marked by four incisures. Males are very rare and have one single outstretched testis.Sher, S.A., and M. W. Allen. 1953. Revision of the genus Pratylenchus (Nematoda: Tylenchidae) University of California Publications in Zoology 57: 441-469Roman, J., and H. Hirschmann. 1969. Morphology and morphometrics of six species of Pratylenchus. Journal of Nematology 1:363-386. Distribution and economic importance Pratylenchus are second only behind Meloidogyne in terms of crops infested and the extent of crop damage and loss. Pratylenchus brachyurus is widely spread throughout the warmer regions of the world.Corbett, D. C. 1969. Pratylenchus pinguicaudatus n sp. (Pratylenchinae: Nematoda) with a key to the genus Pratylenchus. Nematologica 15:550-556. In Brazil it is the most widely distributed root lesion nematode on coffee. They introduce necrosis in the cortex of the root which is detrimental to the plant. Lesion nematodes severely damage a plant and open points of entry for other bacteria and fungus to enter the root.Lordello LGE (1972) Nematodes pests of coffee. In: Webster JM (ed) Economic Nematology. Academic Press, London and New York . In the US it is mainly found in southern regions and in Florida it is found in nearly every county. A study in 1969 showed that it is found in 90% of the citrus groves in Florida.Trajan, A. C., and J. H. O’Bannon. 1969. Intraspecific morphological variation among populations of Pratylenchus brachyurus and P. coffeae. Journal of Nematology 10:152-160). Due to P. brachyurus being able to infest a wide range of crops and being so damaging, it is of high economic importance. Reproduction and life cycle These nematodes have the general nematode life cycle with four juvenile stages keeping their vermiform shape throughout the entire life cycle except the egg stage. Any of the stages, except the egg and J1 which molts inside the egg, can infect the root. The nematodes get inside the roots and move throughout the root laying eggs individually in the root cortex and maybe a few in the soil. This particular species of Pratylenchus reproduces by parthenogenesis. The males of this species have not been found very often.Brooks, T. L., and R. N. Huettel. 1967. Pathogenicity of Pratylenchus brachyurus to citrus. Plant Disease Reporter 51:569-573. Host-parasite relationships P. brachyurus can infest a wide range of crops. Peanuts, pineapple, soybeans, sugar cane, tomatoes, citrus, and cotton are just a few of the crops it can infest. With such a wide range of hosts, P. brachyurus is an important nematode for scientist to study and try to develop a resistant variety of its host plants. The problem with P. brachyurus is that not too much is known about it and many of the reports available contradict each other. In 2001 in Nematropica, it was stated that the host range of these nematodes has not been determined meaning that crop rotation as a way to manage these pest could prove to be difficult.Machado, A ., Inomoto, M. 2001. Host status of eighteen vegetable crops for Pratylenchus brachyurus . Nematropica 31:257-263. In 2012, the Journal of Cotton Science reported that this nematode is found in cotton fairly often but its pathogenicity is still in question. The variety of cotton used in the study seemed to be tolerant of the nematode and it only slightly affected the growth of the plant.Machado, A., Ferraz, L., Inomoto, M. 2012. Pathogenicity of Pratylenchus brachyurus on cotton plants. The Journal of Cotton Science 16:268-271. Some varieties of cotton are intolerant to these nematodes so a farmer would want to try and plant tolerant varieties. When nematodes infest a root, they can open up the root to many other pathogens including bacteria and fungus. There have been numerous reports of nematodes interacting with Fusarium spp as well as many other fungi.Powell, N. T. 1963. The role of plant-parasitic nematodes in fungus diseases. Phytopathology 53:28-35. Two scientists by the names of Michell and Powell presented evidence in their study that P. brachyurus can increase the incidence of Fusarium Wilt in cotton.Michell, R., Powell, W. 1971. Influence of Pratylenchus brachyurus on the incidence on fusarium wilt in cotton. Phytophology62:336-338. Management Many different methods to control nematodes have been tried over the years. Some have proven more successful and others have not. Some of these methods include nematicides, cover crops, crop rotation, genetically modified plants and seed treatments. In soybeans, Essex is a tolerant cultivar whereas Forrest is sensitive. Essex has a higher yield in fields that are infested with the nematode. The plots in this study by Koenning were treated with aldicarb, carbofuran, and fenamiphos and had less nematodes 40 days post planting then the areas that were not treated. The plots that were planted with Forrest which is the sensitive cultivar and treated with carbofuran had a higher yield than untreated control plots. Damage threshold levels have not been well established but using fumigated plots has shown significant increases in yield.Koenning, S., Schmitt, D. 1987. Control of Pratylenchus brachyurus with selected nonfumigant nematicides on tolerant and a sensitive soybean cultivar. Annals of Applied Nematology 1:26-28. In Brazil, many crops are planted under the no tillage planting system. This typically causes of buildup of polyphagous species of nematodes like P. brachyurus.Gallaher, R. N., Dickson, D. W., Corella, J. F., and Hewlett, T. E. 1988. Tillage and multiple cropping systems and population dynamics of phytoparasitic nematodes. Journal of Nematology. (Suppl.) 2:90-94. If a no till system is being used, planting cover crops that would decrease the density of the nematodes may be needed. The problem with that is there is contradictory information regarding P. brachyurus and which plants are poor or good hosts. Due to this very same reason, farmers would have to be very careful in choosing a crop rotation schedule as well.Inomoto, M., Asmus, G. L. 2010. Host status of graminaceous cover crops for Pratylenchus brachyurus. Plant Dis. 945: 1022-1025. In 1992 Vast demonstrated that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi could enhanced the plant’s resistance to nematodes by being a physical barrier.Vaast P, Zasoski RJ (1992) Effect of VA-Mycorhizae and nitrogen sources on rhizsphere soil characteristics, growth and nutrient acquisition of coffee seedlings (Coffea arabica L.) Plant and Soil 147:31-39. This would be something that could be used as a seed treatment to protect the newly emerging seedlings from being infested. As with many other nematodes that cause crop loss, we need to continue to move forward in the study of these nematodes. Many of the managements tools used are very contradictory in studies and no good management strategy has been established. This nematode is so widespread and has such a wide range of hosts that several different management strategies will have to be developed based on the specific crop and area. Hopefully one day we will be able to develop a gene that can be put into plants to defend them against these nematodes as well as many other different types of nematodes.

Eggman Nega secretly hires Rouge the Bat to collect the Chaos Emeralds. The Master Emerald has also gone missing (again) and Knuckles the Echidna teams up with Rouge to find it. Meanwhile, Silver the Hedgehog has returned from a now ruined future caused by the Ifrit. In order to make a happier future, he searches for and steals the Chao that are left in order to hide them. Espio first thought that Silver was hiding Chao for a cause of evil, but Espio finds out that Silver was trying to save the world. Then, they work together to save the world. The real Dr. Eggman sends Metal Sonic to find Shadow, and tells him of Nega's plans. Nega has learned of the Ifrit by accessing Gerald Robotnik's journals, and Shadow and Metal Sonic set out to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds before he does. Eggman uses Metal Sonic as a communication device to aid Shadow along the way. All of the teams meet up at the haunted mansion where the portal to the Ifrit's world is. Despite Rouge only collecting six of the Emeralds, the portal opens anyway and Nega dispatches his newly copy of Metal Sonic, Metal Sonic 3.0 to awaken the Ifrit. Despite possessing the minds of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Rouge (depending on who the player plays as), the Ifrit is defeated by the other teams. Shadow and Metal Sonic destroy the Ifrit and close the portal but they and Eggman Nega are trapped in the Ifrit's dimension. However, Metal Sonic tears his chassis open, revealing the 7th Chaos Emerald. Shadow uses the Emerald to teleport back with Metal Sonic. Nega is left trapped under some rubble. Sonic and Tails save all the Chao and bring them to a Chao Garden and relax there while Knuckles finds the Master Emerald in the Emerald Detector that he and Rouge stole from Eggman Nega. Rouge steals the Master Emerald and runs. Silver returns to what he hopes is a happy future while Espio has to answer to Vector the Crocodile who has spent their client's advanced payment on late rental fees. Characters Sonic Rivals 2 features eight playable characters, including all five characters from the previous title. All characters use Homing Attack and Spin Dash to move through the levels. Collecting Rings or destroying enemies will also fill the Signature Meter; when the meter is full, players can use a character-specific Signature Move to gain an advantage. For example, Shadow's \\"Chaos Control\\" move has the ability to slow down the other player's movement for a few seconds. The character roster is split into teams of two, with each team having its own story campaign that tells the events of the game's story from their perspective. Gameplay Sonic Rivals 2 has four main Single Player modes. Story Mode is the main single player mode. Players go through each of the game's battle modes and levels to advance the plot. Each zone has three acts and a boss, with the exception of the final zone. The characters are divided into four teams (Sonic and Tails, Shadow and Metal Sonic, Silver and Espio, Knuckles and Rouge) and each character has their own story. The game introduces a new mode called Free Play. In this single player mode, players can choose any one of the eight characters and play through the zones in traditional 2D Sonic fashion. They can also try Time Attacking, or finding the ten hidden Chao in the levels. There are no opponents for this mode. This is a first for many of the characters featured. In addition, players can also try the Cup Circuit and Single Event modes. Races and battle can be customized in every aspect, and players can try to earn cards by completing challenges. There are 150 different cards to collect, and each is tied to a certain achievement. For example, getting an S Rank in Knockout Mode unlocks a card of Mephiles the Dark. The cards themselves contain art from various older Sonic games, and can unlock things such as alternate suits for the characters. Unlike the first game, only one card is needed to unlock a suit; and each character has four suits instead of the original three. The cards also unlock the Cup Circuits, and Chao Detectors for the Zones. Sonic Rivals 2 boasts a new multiplayer \\"Battle Mode\\" with six different types of competition in addition to the main race mode. These modes are also worked into the story. The lengths of the battles can be set though the selection menus. In Knockout, each player starts with three rings. Players must knock all of the rings out of their opponent and then attack them to win. The first player to get the set number of knockouts wins. In Rings Battle, players have a set amount time to collect as many rings as possible. The player with the most rings at the end of the time limit wins. Capture the Chao is a Sonic themed version of Capture the Flag. Players must steal a set number of Chao from their opponent's base and bring them back to their own base with their own Chao still there to win. In Laps Race, the first player to complete a set number of laps around the track wins. King of the Hill has an Omochao stationed at the top of the level with a light beam. Players earn points by simply standing under it. The first player to get the set number of points wins. Tag is a Sonic themed cross between Hot Potato and Tag. Each player has a time limit that drops when they hold the bomb. Players pass the bomb by attacking the other player. The first player to have their time limit expire loses. =Stages= Each stage has three acts and a boss, instead of the original game's two. Acts one and three are races, and act two is always a battle. In the story mode, the races may be substituted with single character missions such as \\"Time Attack\\", \\"Collect X Rings\\", and other challenges. Certain stages can be skipped in the story, depending on the character chosen. Reception Sonic Rivals 2 received average reviews from critics. It received a score of 63.05% on GameRankings and 60/100 on Metacritic. In March 2009, Sonic Rivals was certified as part of Sony's Greatest Hits budget line, representing North American sales of at least 250,000. Sonic Rivals 2 soon followed.

It has been identified as the site of a Spanish mission to the Timucua people of the region, dating to the first half of the 17th century. Found within the historical territory of the Timucua tribe known as the Northern Utina, it is thought to be the Mission San Martín de Timucua, also known as San Martín de Ayacuto, which was founded in the important Northern Utina village of Ayacuto in 1608. Description The Fig Springs site is adjacent to a short tributary connecting Fig Springs to the Ichetucknee River, about one mile downstream from the head springs of the Ichetucknee. An apparent midden was discovered in the tributary in 1949, and a survey with limited excavations in 1986 found evidence of a mission on the adjacent land, including a church building, missionary residence (convento), cemetery, plaza and native village. More extensive excavations were carried out in 1988-1989. Analysis of sherds found at the site indicated that the mission was occupied during the first half of the 17th century. The archaeologists identified the site as likely to be that of San Martín de Timucua, which is known to have been founded in 1608, and which does not appear in Spanish records after the Timucua rebellion of 1656. An earlier identification of the site as Santa Catalina de Afuerica, which is known to have existed in the area between 1675 and 1685, is less likely based on the evidence of the sherds. The mission appears to have been established at one of the five major towns that existed at the beginning of the 17th century in the Province of Timucua proper (also Northern Utina or Utina), which included north Florida north of the Santa Fe River from the St. Johns River in the east to the Aucilla River in the west. The mission church was an open-air structure, with a plank wall on the east end, and the other sides left open. Posts, about 10 cm square, supported a roof over an area about 10.5 m north- south and 8 m east-west. The floor had been cleared down to bare earth, and a clean sand subfloor supported a packed clay floor, which rose in steps from west to east. The structure apparently burned, and the remains were covered by a layer of clean sand. A cemetery on the north side of the church included several rows of burials. Unlike several other Spanish missions in Florida, no burials were found in the floor of the church.

It occurs in temperate regions worldwide, regions between the subtropics and the polar circles. It is an animal that inhabits the roots of a wide variety of plants and results in necrotic lesions on the roots. Symptoms of P. penetrans make it hard to distinguish from other plant pathogens; only an assay of soil can conclusively diagnose a nematode problem in the field. P. penetrans is physically very similar to other nematode species, but is characterized by its highly distinctive mouthpiece. P. penetrans uses its highly modified mouth organs to rupture the outer surface of subterranean plant root structures. It will then enter into the root interior and feed on the plant tissue inside. P. penetrans is considered to be a crop parasite and farmers will often treat their soil with various pesticides in an attempt to eliminate the damage caused by an infestation. In doing this, farmers will also eliminate many of the beneficial soil fauna, which will lead to an overall degradation of soil quality in the future. Alternative, more environmentally sustainable methods to control P. penetrans populations may be possible in certain regions.  Hosts and symptoms  Root lesion nematode has a wide host range, including hosts like apple, cherry, conifers, roses, tomato, potato, corn, onion and sugarbeets, and ornamentals such as Narcissus. More than 164 hosts for P. penetrans have been recorded.Pratylenchus penetrans . Entomology and Nematology. University of California, Davis.Hooker, W. J. \\"Lesion Nematodes\\". Compendium of Potato Diseases. 1981. Print. In the host range there are some hosts that are susceptible, such as wheat, oat, field pea, faba bean, and chickpea, and some that are moderately susceptible, such as barley and canola.Wherrett, Andrew, and Vivien Vanstone. \\"Root Lesion Nematode\\". Soil Quality. Healthy Soils for Sustainable Farms, 2014. Web. 9 Nov. 2014. Some general symptoms that are produced on infected plants include poor growth, fruit spot, and chlorotic foliage. These secondary symptoms are often due to plant root stress.Davis, Eric L., and Ann E. MacGuidwin. \\"Lesion Nematode Disease\\". The Plant Health Instructor (2000): 1030-032. The American Phytopathological Society, 2014. Web. 9 Nov 2014. These make it rather difficult to diagnose nematode diseases in general. The roots when infected produce necrotic lesions, which are darkened areas of dead tissue, on the surface and throughout the cortex of the infected roots. These lesions turn the root to reddish-brown to black and are initially spotty. As the nematode continues to feed, the lesions can coalesce to become large necrotic areas of tissue that may eventually girdle the root. The population size of the nematode affects the degree of symptoms. Low to moderate populations may cause no visible above ground symptoms, while high populations can lead to stunting, nutrient and water deficiencies, and eventual die-back of the plant. On potato, infection of root lesion nematode can cause a secondary invasion by Verticillium dahliae leading to Potato Early Dying. Onions are another important host of P. penetrans. Onions are an important vegetable for consumption in the United States and upon infection the nematodes can limit yield and quality of the bulbs. Populations of more than 0.01 nematode per cubic centimeter of soil resulted in injury to onions. There is a negative relationship between the increasing inoculum levels on onion root and top fresh weight at harvest.Pang, W., S. L. Hafez, P. Sundararaj, and B. Shafii. \\"Pathogenicity of Pratylenchus Penetrans on Onion\\". Nematropica 39.1 (2009): 35-46. Cabdirect. Web. 9 Nov. 2014.  Lifecycle  Pratylenchus penetrans is a migratory nematode which means it moves from root to root and is also an endoparasite which means go into the roots. There are both female and male nematodes, with distinguishing differences being a spicule for the males and that males have a bent tail while females have a straight tail. They reproduce sexually, with the females laying single eggs in the root or soil. After embryonic development within the egg to the first stage juvenile (J1), the nematode molts to the second-stage juvenile (J2) and hatches from the egg. The nematode then molts from the J2 to J3, J3 to J4, and finally J4 into an adult. J2, J3, J4, and adults all have a vermiform, worm- like shape, and can all invade the roots. Entry into the roots is accomplished by mechanical pressure and cutting action of the stylet of the nematode, usually just behind the root cap but may occur through other surfaces of the roots, rhizomes, or tubers. The nematode feeds on the cells within the root, usually until the cell lyses and cavities are formed. Then the nematodes move forward within the root to feed on healthy plant cells. Since P. penetrans is a migratory nematode, they can move from plant to plant, but usually do not migrate more than 1–2 meters from the root zone that they first infect, thus invasion of many roots can take place in the nematodes life span. The nematode overwinters in infected plant parts or in the soil at any life stage, however J4 is the optimal life stage.  Environment  The nematode is found in all temperate regions around the world, because of the wide host range. For normal nematode activity a moisture film is needed for movement of the nematode. Soil moisture, relative humidity, and related environmental factors directly affect nematode survival. Moisture is needed to the nematode to survive and move. When the nematode is inside of the root, the root provides the optimal moisture and protection from desiccation. P. penetrans has a critical survival mechanism that during cold seasons and in the absence of the host it goes into diapause, animal dormancy resulting in a delay in development. Root lesion nematode also has the capability of having extreme states of anhydrobiosis. During anhydrobiosis the nematode enters an almost completely desiccated state which stabilizes its membranes and other cellular structures, preventing otherwise lethal damage caused by environmental extremes. However, in general this is not considered a successful strategy for the nematode.McSorley, Robert. \\"Adaptations of Nematodes to Environmental Extremes\\". The Florida Entomologist 86.2 (2003): 138. ProQuest.Web. 9 Nov. 2014. pH levels of the soil are also a factor of nematode activity. In a study, it was shown that a pH of 7 favored the multiplication of nematodes more than a pH of 9 or 3 in sandy loam and sandy clay soil[.Madan, LaI, and R. K. Jauhari. \\"Effect of Soil PH on the Population of Migratory Nematode Pratylenchus Penetrans (Cobb, 1917) (Nematoda: Hoplolamidae) on Tea Plantations in Doon Valley\\". Journal of Experimental Zoology 10.2 (2007): 469-71. Cabdirect. Web. 9 Nov. 2014. The number of eggs deposited, life cycle completion time, and juvenile mortality rates are all affected by temperature. In a study different temperatures were tested, 17 °C, 20 °C, 25 °C, 27 °C, and 30 °C. Eggs deposited per day measured 1.2, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0, respectively. Lifecycle completion time also corresponded with temperature, decreasing as the temperature increased, 46 days at 17 °C and 22 days at 30 °C. Finally, juvenile mortality rates were higher at when the temperature was lower than 25 °C around 50.4% and higher than 27 °C around 58.4%. Between 25 °C and 27 °C it is 34.6 and 37.6% respectively. However, with all of these factors taken into consideration it was found that P. penetrans reproduces over a wide range of temperatures.Mizukubo, Takayuki, and Hiroshi Adachi. \\"Effect of Temperature on Pratylenchus Penetrans Development\\". The Journal of Nematology 29.3 (1997): 306-14. NCBI. Web. 9 Nov. 2014.  Management/control  = Initial inoculum = The best way to prevent disease caused by Pratylenchus penetrans is to prevent the initial introduction of inoculum into the field. Without nematodes in the field disease cannot occur, however there are very few fields that are not infected with some amount of root lesion nematodes. One way this can be done is through fumigation of the field prior to planting to decrease the number of nematodes in the field. = Resistance = There are some resistant varieties of hosts that will not be affected by the pathogen. Moderate resistance is presently limited to only a few cultivated crops including forage legumes and potato. There are not very many varieties with a high degree of resistance but it has been shown that Peconic and Hudson varieties of potato have shown some resistance. = Cultural practices = There are also cultural practices that can be helpful in management of P. penetrans including clean planting stock, fallowing, and cover crops.Agrios, George N. \\"Plant Diseases Caused By Nematodes: Lesion Nematode, Pratylenchus\\". Plant Pathology. 5th ed. New York: Academic, 1969. 849-53. Print. Crop rotation is usually not feasible in management of the disease because of the wide host range of the pathogen. Rotations to nonhost crops offers limited opportunities due to nematodes being able to live in the soil. = Control practices = Chemical control has been shown to have the best effect on levels on nematode concentrations. Nematicides that are put on the field prior to planting has been shown to reduce inoculum levels, but may have negative effects on the crop that is planted. Pre-plant fumigation is most effective to reduce field population levels to below economic damage thresholds. = Newer methods = An area of ongoing research is using ornamental species to reduce inoculum levels of nematodes in the fields. Growing Tagetes marigolds has been shown to reduce Pratylenchus numbers by 90%. Other ornamentals such as Helenium, Gaillardia, and Eriophyllum also suppress P. penetrans.\\"Nematode, Northern Root Lesion (Pratylenchus Penetrans)\\". Plantwise Knowledge Bank. Knowledge Bank, 2014. Web. 9 Nov. 2014. All of these tactics require accurate diagnosis of species and identification of population levels assessed from soil and root samples taken from the field. Certain factors like expense and types of crops have influences on the types of control methods employed. When combating Pratylenchus penetrans several methods of control and management are usually employed for controlling the disease.  Importance  Root lesion nematodes are third behind root knot and cyst nematodes for the greatest economic impacts on crops worldwide. It is the most important nematode pest in the northeastern United States. Plant varieties susceptible to the respective fungi are damaged even more when the plants are infected with the nematodes, with the combined damage being considerably greater than the sum of the damages caused by each pathogen acting alone. In potatoes it has been shown that Pratylenchus penetrans has a relationship with Verticillium dahliae in causing Potato Early Dying Syndrome. Potato Early Dying causes premature vine death, severe yield losses, scabby appearance with sunken lesions, and dark, wart-like bumps that turn purple on tubers in storage. The fungus is not shown to be transmitted by the nematode, however it has an increased ability to infect because of the mechanical damage caused by root lesion nematodes. Also documented. is that varieties ordinarily resistant to Verticillium apparently becomes infected by it after previous infection by Pratylenchus.

The group was politically and militarily based in eastern Ethiopia, controlling portions of the countryside in the eastern highlands and around Jijiga by the time Mengistu Haile Mariam fled the country in Spring 1991. They then joined the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) where the party held 3 seats out of the 27 reserved for Oromo parties. The Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) held 12, while the Oromo People's Democratic Organization held the remaining 10.  Conflicts  Apart from its armed insurgency against the Derg which was overthrown in 1991, the IFLO later engaged in armed clashes with other dominant parties in what was the TGE, namely the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The clashes were sparked by alleged TPLF/EPRDF acts of sabotage and aggression towards the organization. This began immediately following the overthrow of Mengistu Haile Mariam. Some examples include: On January 18, 1992, two leaders of the IFLO, Sheikh Abdel Rahman Yusuf and Izzeldin Mohamed Ahmed, were killed by the EPRDF in Dire Dawa. Five others were wounded. The EPRDF claimed that the IFLO leaders failed to halt their car at a roadblock and opened fire on the EPRDF guards; the IFLO claims that the incident was a planned ambush, and pointed to the killing of another of its leaders, Faisal Birru, and the wounding of others, in the previous months by the EPRDF. The home of Ato Mehammed Chello in Addis Ababa was converted into a prison for three days, from September 25 through 27 1993. A group of armed persons belonging to EPRDF occupied the home, alleging that Ato Mehammed has hidden certain individuals they were looking for and demanding to know their whereabouts. Ato Mehammed and three other men were tied tightly with ropes and beaten in front of their family members. The rope with which their hands were tied and the beating has caused severe damage to their bodies. Ato Mehammed Chello was a member of the Central Committee of IFLO and once a member of the Council of Representatives of the TGE. Tesfaye Deressa and Bekele Mekonnen of Urji newspaper were charged in December 1995 with \\"publishing false information and disseminating it internationally\\" in connection with their report of a military communique by the OLF and IFLO. After withdrawing from the TGE and boycotting the 1995 general elections, the group returned to the bush with the objective of toppling the EPRDF, and has since claimed responsibility for many operations launched against EPRDF targets. In a 1994 interview with an Arabic-language paper made available by An-Najah Blogs, Sheikh Abdulkarim claimed that the mujahideen controlled 24,000 km2, predominantly in the East Hararghe Zone, and were carrying out commando operations against EPRDF targets.

The rules cover employee responsibilities, signaling equipment, procedures for safe train movement, dealing with accidents and other topics that directly and indirectly affect railroad safety. These rules govern operation on main lines, defined as those with some form of block control system. The 10th edition of the NORAC operating rules went into effect on November 6, 2011. The 11th edition of the NORAC operating rules goes into effect on February 1, 2018. History In January 1985, six railroads (Conrail, Amtrak, Metro-North, New Jersey Transit, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, and Delaware & Hudson) met in Newark, NJ with the goal to create a common operating rulebook. In May 1985, a second meeting was held, with eight railroads present, five of the original six (Metro-North withdrew) plus Providence and Worcester, Long Island Rail Road, and Boston & Maine. The first rulebook was released in January 1987. It contained rules for three types of train control: automatic block (ABS), manual block (MBS), and voice (VCS).

In 2008, when Obama launched his presidency, Carey Lundin, the series creator who was the Creative Director at Adelstein & Associates, a political advertising firm and owner of Viva Lundin Productions, had written a pilot script and decided to make the titular character real. Kate Soglin, a young citizen journalist, gave us the outsider’s view of inside politics. Citizen Kate was one of the first Citizen Journalists to hit the 2008 presidential campaign trail. She started her video blog coverage on February 10, 2007 at Barack Obama's announcement to run for president in Springfield, Illinois. She filed 90 video reports about the presidential campaign and politics on her web site, CitizenKate.TV, YouTube, Verizon Fios, Brave New Films and other sites worldwide. That series had an estimated 1M+ views. In February 2016, Citizen Kate again hit the campaign trail, this time two characters, Kate and her half-sister, Alexa Lopez (who is African American and Hispanic) looking for truth, jobs and America's future. The show was put on hold due to the creators' husband sudden passing. The series starred Chicago improvisers Abby Vatterott and Kimberly Michelle Vaughn. The new series had a stated mission of driving youth voters to the ballot box. The series did a test for their ability to reach youth voters of the Wisconsin primary, releasing PSAs directed at Sanders, Clinton and Cruz voters to BringitWisconsin.gov, a voter ID info site. The series creator, Carey Lundin, president of Viva Lundin Productions, read an article that showed Governor Scott Walker had passed a new set of IDs to be brought to the polls, then failed to promote it. he PSAs Subsequent send-ups of news coverage including \\"Who Cut the Cheese\\" about presidential candidate Ted Cruz's refusal to don a cheese hat, have been extremely popular with the Millennial audience. In 2008, Lundin commissioned Duffy Lyons, \\"The Butter Cow Lady of Iowa\\" and Iowa's most beloved person, to sculpt a Butter Head of Barack Obama. When it was presented to the future president two days before the caucus, it became a national story, jokingly cited by Keith Olberman on his show \\"Countdown\\" for MSNBC as the reason behind his last minute bump in the polls. Obama's campaign strategist, David Axelrod, joked that \\"it was the secret to his success.\\" In fact, if Obama had lost Iowa he may not have won the presidency. Citizen Kate hadn't aired the video, but proceeded to air the video on her website CitizenKate.tv to seed blogs and to send notes to reporters asking to be credited. Only Screen Magazine credited her. Her quest to meet Obama and find out what it takes to be a \\"Great Leader\\" landed her on , a site created by Jeff Jarvis, covering the YouTube Campaign 2008. The site identified Citizen Kate as the first Obama stalker, which led to a mention of her in the Chicago Tribune on February 26, 2007. The Tribune story was also picked up by The Economist Global Technology Forum.

The overall accord contains eight articles and dictates that both nations would support each other if either the Philippines or the United States are attacked by an external party. History The Philippines became a colony of the United States following the Spanish–American War and the subsequent Philippine–American War. In 1935, under the terms of the Tydings–McDuffie Act, the Philippines became a self-governing commonwealth, the Philippine Commonwealth, with full independence planned for ten years later. Delayed by World War II and the Japanese invasion and occupation of the Philippines, the Philippines became fully independent on July 4, 1946. Following independence there remained in the Philippines a strong American military presence including a number of United States military bases in the Philippines, all allowed by treaties between the newly independent Philippines and the United States. There were also a number of treaties that created a strong bond between the Philippines and the United States which gave both countries rights not enjoyed by other nations. The Mutual Defense Treaty Between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America was signed on August 30, 1951, in Washington, D.C. between representatives of the Philippines and the United States. A review of the MDT was ordered by Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on 28 December 2018 with “to maintain it, strengthen it, or scrap it” as the end goal. On 11 February 2020, the Philippines notified the US that it intended to withdraw from the Visiting Forces Agreement, which may impact the MDT. Specifics The overall accord contains eight articles and dictates that both nations would support each other if either the Philippines or the United States were to be attacked by an external party. As stated in Article I of the treaty, each party is to settle international disputes in a peaceful manner so that the international peace is not threatened, and to refrain from the threat of the use of force in any manner that is inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations. Article II states that each party either separately or jointly through mutual aid may acquire, develop and maintain their capacity to resist armed attack. Article III states that from time to time the parties will consult one another through the use of their secretaries of state, foreign ministers or consuls in order to determine the appropriate measures of implementation. The parties will also consult one another when either party determines that their territorial integrity, political independence or national security is threatened by armed attack in the Pacific. Article IV states that an attack on either party will be acted upon in accordance with their constitutional processes and that any armed attack on either party will be brought to the attention of the United Nations for immediate action. Once the United Nations has issued such orders, all hostile actions between the signatories of this treaty and opposing parties will be terminated. Article V defines the meaning of attack and its purpose which includes all attacks by a hostile power will be held as an attack on a metropolitan area by both parties or on the island territories under its jurisdiction in the Pacific or on its armed forces, public vessels or aircraft in the Pacific. Article VI states that this treaty does not affect, impede, or shall not be interpreted as affecting the rights and obligations of the parties under the Charter of the United Nations. Article VII states that the treaty shall be ratified in accordance with the constitutional processes set delineated by the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the Philippines. Lastly, Article VIII stipulates that the treaty terms are indefinite until one or both parties wish to terminate the agreement. If the agreement is to be terminated, either party must give one year advance notice. Support Secretary of State Hillary Clinton featured with Philippine President Benigno Aquino (Left) taken while Secretary Clinton was speaking during her two-day visit to the Philippines as a part of President Obama's Partnership for Growth agreement which coincided with the 60th anniversary of the two nations Mutual Defense Treaty, November 17, 2011.

Yano flew aboard USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76) After the fall of the Soviet Union and the decline of the threat of communism in the 1990s bilateral support for the mutual defense treaty has taken a roller coaster ride especially in the Philippines. Generally, the Philippine Government has remained favorable towards the treaty ever since its inception, more often coming to rely on the U.S. for its defenses as it has done ever since World War II. This was nonetheless more apparent during the Cold War given the numerous active U.S. Military bases in the Philippines. The most notable and controversial of these bases are Clark Air Force Base outside of metro Manila, and the U.S. Naval Station Subic Bay. The bases were garrisoned for nearly 40 years after the end of World War II until the early 1990s. In 1991 anti-US sentiment in the Philippines forced the Philippine Senate to reject a new base agreement treaty that subsequently forced the removal of all US forces from Philippine soil. However, given the rise of global terrorism with the events of 9/11 and the subsequent economic rise and militant expansion of China, the United States has strengthened its ties to its Asian allies especially the Philippines. In its 60th anniversary year, in a ceremony held on November 11, 2011, on the deck of the U.S. guided missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald, docked in Manila, the two governments reaffirmed the treaty with the Manila Declaration. The declaration was signed by Philippine Foreign Secretary Alberto Del Rosario and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The declaration was a formal affirmation of defensive ties between the two countries that date back over a century. The declaration states, in part: In a followup to the signing of the Manila Declaration the U.S. and Philippine representatives met to sign onto a new partnership strengthening the economic and defensive ties of the two countries. This new formal agreement is the Partnership for Growth. This new agreement comes as a part of President Obama's Global development initiative which is designed to strengthen the Philippines business development and commercial ties between the two countries. During the signing ceremony of this new agreement Secretary Clinton reaffirmed the U.S.'s position on the mutual defense of the Philippines through the statement \\"The US will always be in the corner of the Philippines. We will always stand and fight with you to achieve the future we seek\\". Opposition Evacuees board the Opposition to the U.S.-Philippine Mutual Defense Treaty has had its periods on both sides of the Pacific. Given the longevity of the U.S. Military presence in the Philippines opposition to the U.S. Military presence in the Philippines and the treaty itself began in the 1980s with the escalating tensions surrounding U.S. policy decisions and their repercussions. The late 1970s and 1980s saw a rise in anti-US sentiment following the increasing allegations and perpetrations of U.S. military personnel misconduct towards Filipino men and women. The nightclubs and social hotspots surrounding Clark Air Force Base and Naval Base Subic Bay became flashpoints of allegations of assaults by U.S. service- members on the local Filipinos. Political tensions steadily grew. In 1991, the Military Bases Agreement of 1947 was expiring and the George H. W. Bush Administration of the U.S. and the Corazon Aquino Administration of the Philippines were in talks to renew the agreement. A new treaty, the \\"RP-US Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Security\\", for the renewal of the Subic Bay lease was signed. Anti-US sentiment continued to grow in the Philippines and it was reflected in the election of the Philippine Senate. The majority of the Philippine Senate were in opposition to renewal. On September 13, 1991, the Philippine Senate voted not to ratify the new treaty. As a result, the last of the U.S. military personnel in the Philippines were removed from the bases on November 24, 1992. The American flag is lowered and Philippine flag is raised during turnover of Naval Station Subic Bay The opposition movement within the Philippines subsided after the removal of U.S. personnel from the Philippines in the early 90s. It never truly dissipated in its entirety however. Anti-US sentiment remained a prevalent social issue within the collegiate community in Metro Manila and relatively small anti-US demonstrations routinely took place outside the U.S. embassy until the early 2000s. As a result of the unfortunate events surrounding 9/11 the U.S. began restructuring and exercising its rights of the U.S. Philippine Defense Treaty as a part of its War on Terrorism, which included deployment of U.S. forces to the Philippines in Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines to advise and assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). As the U.S. military and Philippine Armed Forces began training and conducting anti-terrorist missions within the Philippine archipelago, anti-US sentiment slowly began to rise once again. 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement On April 28, 2014, desiring to enhance cooperative capacities and efforts in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, the two governments executed an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). The EDCA is designed to promote the following between the Philippines and the United States: *Interoperability *Capacity building towards AFP modernization *Strengthening AFP for external defense *Maritime Security *Maritime Domain Awareness *Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response (HADR) The agreement allows U.S. forces access to and use of designated areas and facilities owned and controlled by the Armed Forces of the Philippines at the invitation of the Philippine Government. It contains clear provision that the U.S. will not establish a permanent military presence or base in the Philippines and a prohibition of entry to the Philippines of nuclear weapons. The EDCA has an initial term of ten years, and thereafter will continue in force until terminated by either party after having given a one-year notice of intention to terminate.

He was born in a working class home in Saltaire, Yorkshire. He was a scholar in many related, and some unrelated, fields. He published some 330 articles, books, pamphlets and scholarly treatises. Early life and work In his early life he was imprisoned as a conscientious objector to military service in the First World War. During his confines in Durham and Wormwood Scrubs prisons he began an association with, and later membership of, the Society of Friends, that lasted throughout his life. As well as a pacifist, he was a socialist and had close ties to the early Independent Labour Party, which he greatly valued into his old age. His interests ranged widely. His early academic life was spent at Armstrong and Kings Colleges, Newcastle part of Durham University (later to become Newcastle University) where he attained the role of Reader in Applied Geology. His academic writings start from this period of his life, in 1925.Croucher (1995) After work in mine safety, he once again settled into an academic life. His interests widened from geology and mining engineering into what would now be termed landscape studies. At the same time, his interest in mechanical engineering led him to carry out pioneering work on the lead mining industry of his native Yorkshire and elsewhere, including Two centuries of Industrial WelfareRaistrick (1977) (on the London Lead Company). Again refusing directed labour for war in 1941, Arthur Raistrick was forced to leave his academic post in Newcastle. He stated that King's College \\"just had to suspend me\\", without pay.Joy (1991) p. 13, quoted in Jennings (2004) During the war years, he refused to earn sufficient money to pay income tax which would fund the war effort and he spent much of the time in converting a one-time barn into a home for himself and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth (née Chapman). It was during this period that he wrote the popular handbook Teach Yourself Geology (1943). As a Friend, Arthur Raistrick became interested in the history of Quaker involvement in science and industry, leading him to publish widely on this subject. In the course of this, he was responsible, with others, for pioneering work on the industrial archaeology of the Coalbrookdale area. His Dynasty of IronfoundersRaistrick (1989), originally published in 1953 remains a seminal work on the Darbys of Coalbrookdale and their work in the cradle of the industrial revolution. An industrial archaeologist Raistrick was also a field archaeologist of some renown, specialising in the Craven area of the Yorkshire Dales, around his long-time home at Linton, near Grassington. His work in the field of industrial archaeology occupied much of his mature years. He published an early work on the subject, Industrial ArchaeologyRaistrick (1972) which remains in use in undergraduate courses to this day. As well as his master's degree and doctorate, Arthur Raistrick received Honorary Doctorates from the Universities of Leeds and Bradford. He was particularly associated with the latter university and bequeathed his extensive mineral collection to it, together with an unrivalled collection of closely annotated maps of the Yorkshire Dales and North Pennines, which form a commentary to his extensive fieldwork. Raistrick worked closely with the Craven Museum & Gallery donated many finds from his excavations to the museum and in 1969 was chair of the Friends of the Craven Museum group. He also left the bulk of his large library to Bradford University.See external links Among other lifelong interests Raistrick was a keen walker, venturing far and wide amongst his beloved Yorkshire Dales and moors. He had been a founder member of the Holiday Fellowship and was a one time vice-president of the Youth Hostels Association. His interest in landscape and its conservation led to him serving several terms upon the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority. Honours refused Offered an OBE by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Raistrick wrote a letter declining the honour, which started, characteristically, \\"Dear Harold, I am deeply disappointed in you…\\".Unpublished letter in the possession of his family His lifelong dislike of privilege made it impossible for him even to consider accepting Wilson's offer. Raistrick was a true polymath. He was a self-taught expert on the organ works of J.S. Bach. He immersed himself in studies of ancient Chinese civilisation. Until the end of his long life, he retained the daily routine of a working man, rising at 5 am to work through the day until an early bed at 8 pm. As a tribute to his accomplishments, the Yorkshire Dales Society named him the Dalesman of the Millennium.Speakman (2006) Notes Selected bibliography * Raistrick, Arthur (1943) Teach Yourself Geology.

Limpopo Films produced a wide variety of films from 1964 to 1968 including Man in Ethiopia (which won numerous national and international awards), Vigeland on Life, Ten Thousand Mile Safari, From Zululand to Zambia, The Lions of Gorongoza, The Crocodiles of the Nile, The Elephants of Wankie, Meteorite Hunt, The Mystery of Zimbabwe, and many others. =Adventure Travel, Inc.= In 1976 Citron founded the American Adventurer’s Association (AAA), which was an international organization for adventurers. The American Adventurer’s Association eventually grew to a membership of over 10,000 and published a monthly national magazine, Adventure Travel; a monthly newsletter on worldwide adventure, Adventure Travel Newsletter; and an annual Worldwide Adventure TravelGuide (1978–1981). Adventure Travel magazine eventually reached a national circulation of over 100,000 and was distributed on half a dozen major international airlines. Citron sold his company to the Ziff Davis Publishing Company in 1981. =SPACEHAB= In 1983 Citron founded SPACEHAB, Inc., which designs, builds, and operates space research laboratories and space logistics modules that fly aboard the Space Shuttle fleet. It began its space commercialization roots through the development of privately owned, pressurized modules that fly in the shuttle’s cargo bay and double the amount of working and living space available to the astronaut crew. Citron incorporated the company in 1984 and the company made its initial public offering in 1995. The company flew its first module on a Space Shuttle mission on June 21, 1993. The SPACEHAB modules that Citron and Tom Taylor invented have been the primary payload on 17 Space Shuttle missions, including research missions on board the fleet of orbiters, and resupply missions to both the Russian space station MIR and the International Space Station (ISS). =Kistler Aerospace= In 1993 Citron and Walter Kistler founded Kistler Aerospace Corporation to develop fully reusable, low-cost rocketships to take commercial satellites to Low Earth and Geosynchronous Earth Orbit as well as provide logistic support for the International Space Station. The K-1 is the world’s first fully reusable aerospace vehicle, designed to deliver payloads to orbit and provide a low-cost alternative to single-use launch vehicles. The company intends the K-1 rocketships to become the reliable, low-cost providers of launch services for commercial and government payloads destined for Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO), as well as for cargo resupply and recovery flights to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Kistler Aerospace Corporation has raised over $600 million in private financing and, in 2006, received a NASA contract for $207 million to further the development of the K-1 launch vehicle fleet. =Lunar Transportation Systems, Inc.= In 2004, after NASA announced plans to return humans to the Moon and build a lunar base, Citron and Walter Kistler founded Lunar Transportation Systems, Inc. (LTS). Lunar Transportation Systems, Inc. is developing a new lunar architecture that has a number of advantages over current known and evolving architectures. The LTS architecture uses new innovations for modularity and flexibility, leading to reduced development cost, a faster development schedule, and better evolvability. LTS architecture will enable NASA to meet its near-term strategic objectives, including sending small payloads to the lunar surface in a few years, sending larger payloads to the lunar surface in succeeding years, and sending crews to the Moon and back to the Earth by the end of the next decade. In addition, the LTS architecture can provide routine logistic support for the lunar base now being planned by NASA. LTS is a privately financed company that requires cooperation from NASA in order to raise the private capital required to design, build, ground test, flight test, and operate its Earth-Moon transportation system. Nonprofit Foundations Citron founded or co-founded three nonprofit foundations: Educational Expeditions International with Clarence Truesdale, superintendent of Vermont public schools, in 1971, which became Earthwatch, the Center for Short-lived Phenomena (spun off from the Smithsonian Institution in 1975), and Foundation For the Future (with Walter Kistler in 1996). =Center for Short-Lived Phenomena= The Center for Short- Lived Phenomena was a global wire service that included a network of over 3,200 scientists and scientific institutions in 34 countries that reported on and undertook field research on short-lived phenomena such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tidal surges, oil spills, meteorite falls, unusual animal migration, insect infestations, moonquakes, and other short-lived events worthy of scientific investigation. The Center was involved in NASA’s Apollo Program (1968–1972), NASA’s Transient Lunar Phenomena Program (1969–1972), and NASA’s Skylab Earth Observing Program (1973–1974), and established the global Student Environmental Monitoring Network (1973–1975). Citron spun off The Center for Short-lived Phenomena from the Smithsonian Institution in 1975 and established it as a nonprofit organization. =Earthwatch= Earthwatch Institute is an international nonprofit organization that brings science to life for people concerned about the Earth’s future. Founded by Citron and Truesdell in 1969, Earthwatch supports scientific field research by offering volunteers the opportunity to join research teams around the world. This unique model is creating a systematic change in how the public views science and its role in environmental sustainability. Today, Earthwatch recruits close to 4,000 volunteers every year to collect field data in the areas of rainforest ecology, wildlife conservation, marine science, archaeology, and more. Through this process, it educates, inspires, and involves a diversity of people who actively contribute to conserving our planet. Currently raising approximately $15 million a year from the generosity of institutions, individuals, governments, and corporations, Earthwatch has a global reach. Earthwatch is currently supported by more than 150 staff, located in our headquarters in Maynard, Massachusetts, USA as well as in offices in Oxford, England; Melbourne, Australia; and Tokyo, Japan. =Foundation For the Future= Citron co-founded (with Walter Kistler) the nonprofit Foundation For the Future (FFtF). The foundation awarded the annual Kistler Prize, provided grants, and arranged events to discuss the long-term future of humanity. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in 2008, \\"the foundation's main undertaking is holding several seminars a year on such things as climate change, energy security, and other important matters.\\" Film and television production 1964 – present Citron began making films in 1964 while living in Africa and founded a film production company, Limpopo Films Ltd., which produced a series of documentary and travel films for television. These films included Zululand to Zambia, Ten Thousand Mile Safari, Europe North, Africa South, An American Boy in Russia, and others. In the 1960s, while with the Smithsonian Institution, Citron made a series of films in Africa on field research expeditions including The Wama Pygmies of the Congo, The Borana Tribe of Ethiopia, The Meteorites of Southwest Africa, and others. In the 1970s Citron and National Geographic made a series of television documentaries and educational films based on his EARTHWATCH field research expeditions, including The Search for Fossil Man, The Day the Sun Died, The Violent Earth, Earth, the Restless Planet, and others. During this period Citron was also a consultant to a number of film projects for the National Geographic Society, David Wolper Productions, and MGM Documentary Films. Recently Citron created a 15-minute film entitled Cosmic Origins: From the Big Bang to Humanity as a showcase for the work of the Foundation For the Future. He also supervises the production of a series of short films for the Foundation, including Where Does Humanity Go from Here?, Visions of the Future, and The Young Scholars Inquiry Program. Citron created a television series called The Next Thousand Years, now in development, for public television distribution. Scientific field research expeditions Citron has organized, managed, and/or participated in more than 60 scientific field research expeditions in Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and the South Pacific in fields that include volcanic eruption research, paleoanthropology, archaeology, anthropology, ecology, ethology, zoology, astronomy, meteoritics, and geophysics. He has participated in eight total solar eclipse expeditions in the Philippines, Mexico, Canada, Turkey, Mauritania, Ethiopia, India, and the Libyan Sahara between 1956 and 2006. Citron has organized, managed, and/or participated in more than a dozen archaeological excavations in Africa and Europe, including excavating early hominid and iron-age sites in South and East Africa with prominent archeological teams (1964–1974). While working for the Smithsonian, Citron also organized and managed and was the principal cinematographer on 18 volcanic eruption expeditions in Africa, the South Pacific, North and Central America, Hawaii, the Philippines, and New Guinea (1968–1974). He recently donated 40 hours of volcano expedition films to the Smithsonian Institution archives for research and education. In 2001 Citron organized a major expedition to the South Pacific to observe the reentry of the Russian MIR Space Station in a remote area of the Pacific Ocean. That expedition included chartering two aircraft from Fiji with 31 observers on board. The observers included the Russian Chief Designer of the MIR Space Station as well as three cosmonauts who lived aboard MIR for lengthy durations. Memberships Citron was a member of many professional organizations and special-interest groups, including the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, British Interplanetary Society, The Planetary Society, African Wildlife Federation, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, Seattle Astronomical Society, The Nature Conservancy, The Wilderness Society, American Film Institute, Seattle Film Society, Space Frontier Foundation, and the National Space Society. Awards Citron has received numerous awards for the projects he’s created and managed, and the films he’s made. He was a two- time recipient of the Smithsonian Institution Outstanding Achievement Award for his management of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Satellite Tracking Program and for founding and managing the Smithsonian Institution Center for Short-lived Phenomena. He also received the Space Pioneer Award from the National Space Society for his invention of the SPACEHAB modules that fly on the Space Shuttle, and he received the Space Entrepreneur of the Year Award from the Space Frontier Foundation for his contributions to the development of space tourism. In 1967 Emperor Haile Selassie presented Citron with the Haile Selassie Gold Medal for his contributions to the people of Ethiopia. Publications Citron has published over 200 articles and has written, and/or edited dozens of books and reports dealing with short-lived phenomena, adventure travel, space exploration, meteorite distribution, global environmental monitoring, and the future of humanity.

Its incidence is unknown, due to the very small number of cases reported. An audit by Duke-Elder of the medical literature from 1880 to 1963 discovered only 28 cases. The term was coined in 1937 by the renowned ophthalmologist Ida Mann. Embryologically, the defect is thought to occur around day 35 of gestation, when the vesicle fails to invaginate. Dysgenesis of the vesicle later in development may result in coloboma, a separate and less severe malformation of the ocular structures. CCE is almost always unilateral, but at least 2 cases of bilateral involvement have been described. Patients may also present with skin appendages attached to the skin surrounding the eyes. Association with intracranial anomalies has been reported. Treatment Treatment of CCE is usually by enucleation, followed by insertion of an ocular implant and prosthesis.

It is one of several Intellivision games developed at Cheshire Engineering for Activision. Atari 8-bit family and Atari 5200 ports followed in 1984. Gameplay The player flies a small fighter spacecraft to attack a very large and heavily armed vessel, a dreadnaught. Each dreadnaught approaches the \\"Galactic Unstable Energy Field,\\" which acts as a defensive line. The goal is to disable or destroy each dreadnaught before it can reach the Energy Field and launch its missiles on the planets the player is entrusted with defending. As the game progresses, the player can make repeated passes over the dreadnaught, one fighter at a time, attempting to weaken its defenses, slow its progress, and finally destroy it. The fighter is equipped with lasers and bombs to attack different targets. Bombing the dreadnaught's engines slows its progress and shooting out its bridges reduces the dreadnaught's ability to return fire from any intact gun turrets. In order to destroy the dreadnaught, the player has to bomb all of its energy vents, causing the vessel to overheat and explode. As soon as a dreadnaught is destroyed, another one of a different design arrives. There are five types of dreadnaughts, each of which poses its own challenges. The game has difficulty levels from \\"Basic\\" and \\"Novice\\" to \\"Expert\\" and finally, \\"You've Got to Be Kidding.\\" The dreadnaughts' speed, rate of fire, and fleet size are increased at higher difficulty levels.

Sheffield, who is white and was raised in the rural south, won an NAACP Image Award for his work on the show. Prior to that he had spent 10 years writing for dozens of performers ranging from Dolly Parton to the Smothers Brothers. Sheffield co-created the teen hit Roundhouse on Nickelodeon in the 1990s, often cited as revolutionary for its frenetically paced staging and sophisticated satire involving real teen issues.\\"Raucous comedy brings down the 'Roundhouse'\\" Matt Roush, USA Today, November 16, 1993 Roundhouse was shot in real-time before a live audience and was described by one critic as \\"like seeing all the high points of a smash Broadway show in half an hour.\\"\\"Skit Parade – 'Roundhouse gives youths a whirlwind-paced world view'\\" Ken Tucker, Entertainment Weekly, July 9, 1993 Sheffield created the show with his former wife, Rita Hester, with whom he had founded a children's theatre company when they were students at The University of Southern Mississippi.

The intent of the work is clearly given by the subtitle: Summary The work shows a scene that provides many deliberate examples of confused and misplaced perspective effects. Although the individual components of the scene seem self-consistent, the scene itself can be classed as an example of an impossible object. = Partial list of \\"errors\\" = The most immediately prominent errors are the first three or four: # The man in the foreground's fishing rod's line passes behind that of the man behind him. # The sign is moored to two buildings, one in front of the other, with beams that show no difference in depth # The sign is overlapped by two distant trees. # The man climbing the hill is lighting his pipe with the candle of the woman leaning out of the upper story window. # The crow perched on the tree is massive in comparison to it. # The church appears to front onto the river. Both ends of the church are viewable at the same time. # The left horizon on the water declines precipitously. # The man in the boat under the bridge fires at the swan on the other side, which is impossible as he's aiming straight at the bridge abutments. # The right-hand end of the arch above the boat meets the water further from the viewer than does the left-hand end. # The two-story building, though viewed from below, shows the top of the roof. As does the church tower in the distance. # The barrel closest to the foreground fisherman reveals both its top and bottom simultaneously. # The tiles the foreground fisherman stands on have a vanishing point that converge towards the viewer. # A tree is growing out of the top of the bridge. # The vanishing point for the near side of the first building transforms midway down the wall. # The line of trees obscuring the sign are likely representative of how objects should decrease in scale as they move further away, but in this case reversed. # The sheep on the left-hand side increase in scale as they get further away. # The swan behind the boat is larger than the men manning the boat. # The base of the tree on the far left is behind the tree to the right of it, but the canopy is in front of the tree to the right of it. # The left-most barrel appears to be on lower ground than the other two, when they should be on level ground. # The bottom swan is slightly smaller than the cow. # The man with the pipe is taller than the trees. # The tops and bottoms of the windows on the second building have different vanishing points. Aside from the impossibilities of scale, there are in fact approximately 10 different horizons based on the various vanishing points. Historiography of perspective instruction Until Brook Taylor's treatise on linear perspective was published in 1715, artists were taught perspective by studying methods used in earlier works by famous artists, rather than studying the mathematics behind the methods. Hogarth created the St Martin's Lane Academy partially to remedy this gap in studies, and he invited his friend Kirby to become a perspective teacher there. Kirby obliged and later, by publishing his pamphlet, became famous enough to gain a royal appointment as a perspective teacher.

Corresponding to the province of Western Cape it includes most of the vineyards in South Africa. Style The wines of the Western Cape range from sturdy Rhone-style red wines to aromatic Sauvignon blancs in vineyards cooled by breezes off the Atlantic. History Groot Constantia, the oldest wine estate in South Africa On 2 February 1659 the founder of Cape Town, Jan van Riebeeck, produced the first wine recorded in South Africa. In 1685, the Constantia estate was established in a valley facing False Bay by the Governor of the Cape, Simon van der Stel. His 'Vin de Constance' soon acquired a good reputation. But it was Hendrik Cloete, who bought the homestead in 1778, Great history of Constantia who really made the name of Constantia famous, with an unfortified wine made from a blend of mostly Muscat de Frontignan (Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains), Pontiac, red and white Muscadel (probably clones of Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains??) and a little Chenin blanc. It became a favorite tipple of European kings and emperors, from Frederick the Great to Napoleon. But the vineyards were decimated by phylloxera, the Cloete family were bankrupted, and Groot Constantia was sold to the government as an experimental station. In 1980 Duggie Jooste bought Klein Constantia, redeveloped it, and is now selling a new version of Vin de Constance made from Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains.History of Constantia The Franschhoek Valley was settled over 300 years ago by the French Huguenots. The first official wine route was opened in Stellenbosch in 1971. Wine of Origin In 1993, Western Cape was designated as a Geographical Unit under the Wine of Origin scheme.

It also includes the otherwise unassigned southern districts of Bot River, Cape Agulhas, Overberg, Plettenberg Bay and Walker Bay, and the wards of Cederberg, Ceres, Herbertsdale, Prince Albert Valley, Ruiterbosch and Swartberg. =Bot River (Botrivier)= There are two wineries on the banks of the 'butter' river, Goedvertrouw and Beaumont Wines. =Cape Agulhas= The southern tip of Africa, where the Atlantic meets the Indian Ocean, offers a unique terroir where Sauvignon blanc thrives, particularly in the ward of Elim. =Overberg= This district south of Paarl is cooled by Atlantic breezes and is producing some exciting cool-climate Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay and Pinot noir. It includes the Elgin and Klein River wards. =Plettenberg Bay= Newly declared WO that is home to Bramon Estate, who is best known for a sparkling Sauvignon blanc. =Walker Bay= West of Cape Agulhas, this coastal district produces some high-quality wines from the Burgundy varieties. Hemel-en-Aarde Valley, Sunday's Glen and Upper Hemel-en-Aarde Valley were recently declared as wards. Cape Winelands Cape Winelands - vineyards around Stellenbosch Jan Joubert's Gat bridge is situated on the Franschhoek Mountain pass in Cape Winelands. The Cape Winelands is a region of the Western Cape Province of South Africa. It is the largest wine-producing region in South Africa and is divided into six main wine regions, each offering its own unique wine route. Constantia, Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, Paarl, Robertson and Wellington are the most popular. The geographic area is generally referred to locally as the Boland, meaning uplands in Afrikaans. Constantia Valley wine region is situated in mountainous surroundings and is home to some of the oldest wine estates in the country. Stellenbosch wine region is well known in the Cape. In 1971 the first official wine route was founded by Frans Malan of Simonsig, Spatz Sperling of Delheim, and Niel Joubert of Spier. Franschhoek valley wine region was settled over 300 years ago by the French Huguenots. Set against the backdrop of the Franschhoek and Drakenstein mountains, the village has over 30 wine farms. =World Heritage status= The Cape Winelands and their cultural landscape were added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on June 24, 2004 in the Cultural category.The Cape Winelands Cultural Landscape - UNESCO World Heritage Centre See also * Cape Winelands District Municipality - an administrative region * Wine regions of South Africa References External links * www.winemag.co.za WINE magazine Category:Wine regions of South Africa Category:Economy of the Western Cape ","title":"Western Cape wine"},{"id":"11874881","text":"The Guards Cavalry Division (Garde-Kavallerie-Division) was a unit of the Prussian Army that was stationed in Berlin.

It served on the Western Front until December 1914, then undertook frontier guard duties against Holland until 30 June 1915, when it relocated to Russia. From 16 March 1918 to 9 April 1918, it was dismounted, re-formed and trained on the Zossen troop training ground. Thereafter, it served as the Guard Cavalry Schützen Division on the Western Front. It was in Artois until May 1918, then Champagne / Aisne. By the end of the war, it was serving under VI Reserve Corps, 1st Army, Heeresgruppe Deutscher Kronprinz on the Western Front. A more detailed combat chronicle can be found at the German-language version of this article.  Order of Battle on mobilisation  Upon the outbreak of war, the 4th Guards Cavalry Brigade was dissolved and its component regiments were assigned as divisional cavalry to the 1st Guards Infantry Division (Life Guard Hussars) and 2nd Guards Infantry Division (2nd Guard Uhlans).

Here, the cavalry brigades were renamed Cavalry Schützen Commands and performed a similar role to that of an infantry regiment command. Likewise, the cavalry regiments became Cavalry Schützen Regiments and allocated the role of an infantry battalion (and their squadrons acted as infantry companies). However, these units were much weaker than normal infantry formations (for example, a Schützen squadron had a strength of just 4 officers and 109 NCOs and other ranks, considerably less than that of an infantry company). *1st Guards Cavalry Brigade became independent on 9 April 1917 *2nd Guards Cavalry Brigade became independent on 6 June 1916 *3rd Guards Cavalry Brigade became independent on 18 October 1916 *19th Cavalry Brigade joined from 9th Cavalry Division on 8 April 1917 and became independent on 12 February 1918 *11th Cavalry Brigade joined from 5th Cavalry Division on 23 March 1918 and renamed 11th Cavalry Schützen Command on 8 May 1918 *14th Cavalry Brigade joined from 9th Cavalry Division on 23 February 1918 and renamed 14th Cavalry Schützen Command on 8 May 1918 *38th Cavalry Brigade joined from 8th Cavalry Division on 20 April 1918 and renamed 38th Cavalry Schützen Command on 8 May 1918  Late World War I organization  Allied Intelligence rated this division as 2nd Class (of 4 classes).

Criticism of college and university rankings refers to movements which developed among faculty and administrators in American Institutions of Higher Education as well as in Canada. The arguments of those who criticize the ranking are that it is not possible to come with a single number that characterizes university performance. Furthermore, ratings can be easily manipulated and include such subjective characteristics as the “reputation” determined by surveying university administrators such as chancellors or deans. In addition, the methodology of many rankings (e.g., U.S. News & World Report 2015 Best Engineering Schools Rankings) emphasizes research expenditures (such as grants and contracts) as the only measure of scientific accomplishments despite the concern that measuring science by the amount of money spent rather than by the importance and impact of scientific discoveries or the depth of the ideas could encourage costly projects that are not necessary scientifically sound. Reed College Reed College In 1995, Reed College refused to participate in U.S. News & World Report annual survey. According to Reed's Office of Admissions, \\"Reed College has actively questioned the methodology and usefulness of college rankings ever since the magazine's best-colleges list first appeared in 1983, despite the fact that the issue ranked Reed among the top ten national liberal arts colleges. Reed's concern intensified with disclosures in 1994 by The Wall Street Journal about institutions flagrantly manipulating data in order to move up in the rankings in U.S. News and other popular college guides. This led Reed's then-president Steven Koblik to inform the editors of U.S. News that he didn't find their project credible, and that the college would not be returning any of their surveys.\\" Rolling Stone, in its 16 October 1997 issue, argued that Reed's rankings were artificially decreased by U.S. News after they stopped sending data to U.S. News & World Report. Reed has also made the same claim. In discussing Reed's decision, President Colin Diver wrote in an article for the November 2005 issue of the Atlantic Monthly, \\"by far the most important consequence of sitting out the rankings game, however, is the freedom to pursue our own educational philosophy, not that of some newsmagazine.\\" Stanford University, FUNC, and Alma College Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) Vice-President Nicholas Thompson founded FUNC or \\"Forget U.S. News Coalition\\" in 1996 as a show of support for Reed College's decision not to participate in the U.S. News & World Report survey. FUNC eventually spread to other colleges and universities and was composed of a \\"group of students at universities across the country who argue that ranking something as complex and variable as a college education with a single number is an oversimplification. FUNC claims that the process makes college administrations focus on numerical rankings rather than on educating students.\\" FUNC also involved then-Stanford President Gerhard Casper. On 23 September 1996, Casper sent a letter to James Fallows, editor of U.S. News & World Report, stating, \\"As the president of a university that is among the top-ranked universities, I hope I have the standing to persuade you that much about these rankings - particularly their specious formulas and spurious precision - is utterly misleading.\\" In January 1997, then-president of Alma College, Alan Stone, asked 480 colleges to boycott the U.S. News & World Report Rankings due to the peer assessment survey which counts for 22.5% of a college's ranking. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, in 1996, Alma College surveyed 158 colleges about the rankings. The result of the survey indicated that \\"84 per cent of the respondents admitted that they were unfamiliar with some of the institutions they had been asked to rank. Almost 44 per cent indicated that they 'tended to leave responses for unfamiliar schools blank.' \\" Stone stated, \\"this makes me wonder just how many votes are being considered for each school's academic-reputation ranking.\\" In February 1997, Stanford University contemplated following both Reed and Alma by not filling out the ranking survey, a move advocated by FUNC. On 18 April 1997, Casper issued a letter critical of U.S. News & World Report college rankings titled \\"An alternative to the U.S. News & World Report College Survey\\" Casper's letter circulated among college presidents and led to a decision by Stanford that it will \\"submit objective data to U.S. News, but will withhold subjective reputational votes.\\" Stanford also announced at this time that it would post information about the University on its website. In 1998, Stanford posted an alternative database on its website, stating: \\"This page is offered in contrast to commercial guides that purport to \\"rank\\" colleges; such rankings are inherently misleading and inaccurate. Stanford believes the following information, presented without arbitrary formulas, provides a better foundation for prospective students and their families to begin comparing and contrasting schools.\\" . It has since been posted annually as the \\"Stanford University Common Data Set.\\" FUNC eventually disbanded and Stanford currently participates in the survey. St John's College St. John's College, which since 1937 has followed the Great Books Program, runs counter to the usual emphasis on rankings and selectivity. , St. John's has chosen not to participate in any collegiate rankings surveys and has not sent them their requested survey information. However, the school is still included in the U.S News college ranking guide and ranks in the third tier. This may be due to the school's decision not to send information to U.S. News. President Christopher B. Nelson stated that, \\"in principle, St. John's is opposed to rankings.\\" He notes that :Over the years, St. John's College has been ranked everywhere from third, second, and first tier, to one of the \\"Top 25\\" liberal arts colleges. Yet, the curious thing is: We haven't changed. Our mission and our methods have been virtually constant for almost 60 years. So when it comes to the U.S. News & World Report rankings, we would rather be ourselves and have our college speak for itself, than be subjected to fluctuating outside analysis.Christopher B. Nelson, \\"Why you won't find St. John's College ranked in U.S. News & World Report \\", University Business: The Magazine for College and University Administrators. Maclean's boycott In September 2006, a number of universities in Canada jointly refused to participate in the Maclean’s University Rankings survey. The president of the University of Alberta, Indira Samarasekera, commented that, \\"Canadian universities are listening with great interest as the call to boycott U.S. News & World Report rankings continues to increase in volume among our colleagues to the south. Many of our American colleagues say that they would like to resist the rankings, but fear it can’t be done, especially if only a few institutions act. I write to let you know that institutions can take on the rankings. About a year ago, a growing number of Canadian institutions began to raise the same alarm, ultimately resulting in 25 of our 90+ institutions — including many of our leading universities — banding together to take just such a stand against the fall rankings issue of Maclean's, our Canadian equivalent [...] It’s time to question these third-party rankings that are actually marketing driven, designed to sell particular issues of a publication with repurposing of their content into even higher sales volume special editions with year-long shelf life.\\" 2007 movement On 19 June 2007, during the annual meeting of the Annapolis Group, members discussed the letter to college presidents asking them not to participate in the \\"reputation survey\\" section of the U.S. News & World Report survey (this section comprises 25% of the ranking). As a result, \\"a majority of the approximately 80 presidents at the meeting said that they did not intend to participate in the U.S. News reputational rankings in the future.\\" However, the decision to fill out the reputational survey or not will be left up to each individual college as: \\"the Annapolis Group is not a legislative body and any decision about participating in the US News rankings rests with the individual institutions.\\" The statement also said that its members \\"have agreed to participate in the development of an alternative common format that presents information about their colleges for students and their families to use in the college search process.\\" This database will be web based and developed in conjunction with higher education organizations including the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities and the Council of Independent Colleges. On 22 June 2007, U.S. News & World Report editor Robert Morse issued a response in which he argued, \\"in terms of the peer assessment survey, we at U.S. News firmly believe the survey has significant value because it allows us to measure the \\"intangibles\\" of a college that we can't measure through statistical data. Plus, the reputation of a school can help get that all-important first job and plays a key part in which grad school someone will be able to get into. The peer survey is by nature subjective, but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice. The results from the peer survey also can act to level the playing field between private and public colleges.\\" In reference to the alternative database discussed by the Annapolis Group, Morse also argued, \\"It's important to point out that the Annapolis Group's stated goal of presenting college data in a common format has been tried before [...] U.S. News has been supplying this exact college information for many years already. And it appears that NAICU will be doing it with significantly less comparability and functionality. U.S. News first collects all these data (using an agreed-upon set of definitions from the Common Data Set). Then we post the data on our website in easily accessible, comparable tables. In other words, the Annapolis Group and the others in the NAICU initiative actually are following the lead of U.S. News.\\"  References  = Citations = = Sources = * Annapolis Group.

When Welsh culture adopted the name, it evolved to variations of traditionally Welsh names: Ieuan, Iowan, Ioan, Iwan, or even Siôn (note how the letter 'J' was originally being pronounced as 'i', akin to how J is pronounced in the latin alphabet). It is most popular in Wales, spreading outward from the mainland into England. History Distribution of Jones surname in Great Britain The surname Jones first appears on record as a surname in England in 1273 with the name \\"Matilda Jones\\". Others put the first known record of the surname Jones as 1279, in Huntingdonshire, England. Around the time of the Laws in Wales Acts in the early to mid 16th century, the traditional Welsh system of patronymics was increasingly replaced by surnames, since English was the official state language and all official documents needed to be in English; this led to the Anglicisation of Welsh names, meaning that English Christian names (such as John) became increasingly common to distinctively Welsh Christian names such as Meredudd (Meredith) and Llewelyn. Thus \\"Mab Ioan\\" or \\"ap Sion\\" (and many other variations) meaning \\"son of John\\" became the surname Jones in a large number of cases, making it a very frequently used surname. =20th and 21st centuries= Jones remains the most widespread surname in Wales, borne by 5.75% of the population. The frequency in England is lower, at 0.75%, but still the second most popular surname, after Smith. The 2000 United States census provides a frequency of 0.50%, providing an overall rank of fifth most frequent with 57.7% White, 37.7% Black, 1.4% Hispanic, 0.9% Native American. Jones was the fourth most common surname in the 1990 U.S. Census, behind only Smith, Johnson and Williams.

The agreement contained five articles, which dictated Japan to grant the United States the territorial means to establish a military presence in the Far East. Moreover, the accord prohibited Japan from providing foreign powers any bases or any military- related rights without the consent of the United States. The accord was ratified by the US Senate on 20 March 1952 and was signed into US law by US President Harry Truman on 15 April 1952. The treaty went into effect on 28 April 1952.Yale University (Avalon Project) Text =Introduction= Japan has this day signed a Treaty of Peace with the Allied Powers. On the coming into force of that Treaty, Japan will not have the effective means to exercise its inherent right of self-defense because it has been disarmed. There is danger to Japan in this situation because irresponsible militarism has not yet been driven from the world. Therefore, Japan desires a Security Treaty with the United States of America to come into force simultaneously with the Treaty of Peace between the United States of America and Japan. The Treaty of Peace recognizes that Japan as a sovereign nation has the right to enter into collective security arrangements, and further, the Charter of the United Nations recognizes that all nations possess an inherent right of individual and collective self-defense. In exercise of these rights, Japan desires, as a provisional arrangement for its defense, that the United States of America should maintain armed forces of its own in and about Japan so as to deter armed attack upon Japan. The United States of America, in the interest of peace and security, is presently willing to maintain certain of its armed forces in and about Japan, in the expectation, however, that Japan will itself increasingly assume responsibility for its own defense against direct and indirect aggression, always avoiding any armament which could be an offensive threat or serve other than to promote peace and security in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Accordingly, the two countries have agreed as follows: =Article I= Japan grants, and the United States of America accepts, the right, upon the coming into force of the Treaty of Peace and of this Treaty, to dispose United States land, air and sea forces in and about Japan. Such forces may be utilized to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security in the Far East and to the security of Japan against armed attack from without, including assistance given at the express request of the Japanese Government to put down largescale internal riots and disturbances in Japan, caused through instigation or intervention by an outside power or powers. =Article II= During the exercise of the right referred to in Article I, Japan will not grant, without the prior consent of the United States of America, any bases or any rights, powers or authority whatsoever, in or relating to bases or the right of garrison or of maneuver, or transit of ground, air or naval forces to any third power. =Article III= The conditions which shall govern the disposition of armed forces of the United States of America in and about Japan shall be determined by administrative agreements between the two Governments. =Article IV= This Treaty shall expire whenever in the opinion of the Governments of the United States of America and Japan there shall have come into force such United Nations arrangements or such alternative individual or collective security dispositions as will satisfactorily provide for the maintenance by the United Nations or otherwise of international peace and security in the Japan Area. =Article V= This Treaty shall be ratified by the United States of America and Japan and will come into force when instruments of ratification thereof have been exchanged by them at Washington. =Signatories= IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned Plenipotentiaries have signed this Treaty.

Zülzer is remembered for his work with diabetes mellitus. He had some success using pancreatic extracts on diabetic dogs, and in 1906 injected an extract called \\"Acomatrol\\" into a dying diabetic patient who was in a coma. At first the patient showed improvement, but later suffered from side effects, and died when the Acomatrol supply was exhausted. Acomatrol was based on an extract from calf pancreases, and was manufactured by a local company in Berlin. Afterwards, Zülzer continued to seek a suitable remedy for diabetes mellitus, but attained little success, and his laboratory was turned over to the German military during World War I. A breakthrough occurred in the early 1920s when Canadian physicians Frederick Banting and Charles Best developed an extract that saved the life of a 14-year-old diabetic patient.

The town grew quickly after gold was discovered nearby in 1862. La Paz, Spanish for peace, was chosen as the name in recognition of the feast day for Our Lady of Peace. Originally located in the New Mexico Territory, the town became part of the Arizona Territory when President Abraham Lincoln established the new territory in 1863.Wagoner, Jay J. (1970). Arizona 1863–1912: A Political History. Tucson, AZ: University of Arizona Press. In 1983 the newly-formed County of La Paz adopted the name, long after the town had become a ghost town. La Paz was the location of the La Paz Incident in 1863, noted for being the westernmost confrontation of the American Civil War. History La Paz, c. 1890, already a ghost town. Mountain man Pauline Weaver discovered gold in the Arroyo De La Teneja, on the eastern bank of the Colorado River, on January 12, 1862. His discovery triggered the Colorado River gold rush. La Paz grew up in the spring of 1862 along the Colorado River to serve the miners washing placer gold in the La Paz Mining District. This district produced about 50,000 troy ounces of gold per year in 1863 and 1864.Maureen G. Johnson, 1972, Placer Gold Deposits of Arizona, Geological Survey Bulletin 1355, p. 77. La Paz had a population of 1,500 and was a stage stop between Fort Whipple, Arizona and San Bernardino, California.Eldred D. Wilson, (1961) Gold Placers and Placering in Arizona, Arizona Geological Survey, Bulletin 168, p. 25. The town was the county seat of Yuma County from 1864 to 1870, and as the largest town in the territory in 1863 was considered for the Arizona territorial capital. The placers were largely exhausted by 1863, but the community hung on as a shipping port for steamboats of the Colorado River and supply base until the Colorado River shifted its course westward in 1866, leaving La Paz landlocked. The shipping business was taken over by a new river town, Ehrenberg, six miles south.

It was built in 1901 and expanded in 1916. With The hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for having local significance in the themes of commerce and social history. It was nominated for being an example of a once-common hotel type catering specifically to traveling salesmen. In 1994 the Palmer House was also listed as a contributing property to the Original Main Street Historic District. Still in business as a hotel, restaurant, and pub, the Palmer House is a member of the Minnesota Hotel & Lodging Association and the National Restaurant Association. Description The Palmer House is a three-story brick building on the northwest corner of Sauk Centre's principal intersection. Round-arched windows and doors line the ground floor of the two street-facing elevations, accentuated by decorative brickwork. The arched windows that open into the lobby and restaurant contain stained glass imported from Vienna. The windows of the upper floor are rectangular. Light corbeling marks a belt course just below the second-floor windowsills and along the cornice. Bays of the upper floors are defined by brick pilasters. The rear addition, built 15 years later, perfectly replicates the design of the original section. The roofline once had low parapets at the corners, but they have been removed. History The Palmer House was built in 1901 by Ralph and Christena Palmer on the site of the Sauk Centre House, the city's first hotel, which had burned down on June 26, 1900. It was ideally situated in the heart of Sauk Centre's business district and just over a block from the train station. The Palmer House was the first building in Sauk Centre to have electricity. The Palmers lived on the premises with their two children, and were assisted in running the establishment by Christena's mother and brother. The Palmer House catered especially to traveling salesmen, arriving by rail, who found not only overnight lodging but meeting space and after-hours relaxation at the hotel. Local residents also used the hotel as a gathering place. The young Sinclair Lewis worked two summers as a desk clerk at the Palmer House. He later used it as the model for the \\"Minniemashie House\\" in his 1920 novel Main Street, set in a town modeled in turn on Sauk Centre. When it first opened, the Palmer House contained 24 guest rooms. In 1916 the hotel's second owners hired architect Roland C. Buckley of St. Cloud, Minnesota, to expand the building with a rear addition containing another 20 rooms. Guests originally shared a common lavatory off the hall. The Palmer House was extensively remodeled in 1993. The interior was reconfigured to contain 19 guest rooms, each with its own bathroom. The supernatural Various people have reported paranormal activity at the Palmer House. Guests and staff have reported disembodied voices, rapid temperature shifts, and doors slamming shut on their own. One of the more common accounts the sound of a child bouncing a ball or running in the hallway. The Palmer House held its first paranormal seminar January 18–20, 2008; attendees included television personalities Chris Fleming and Patrick Burns, Darkness on the Edge of Town radio host David Schrader, and other paranormal experts. The Palmer House is featured in the fourth episode of season 7 on Ghost Adventures, where they investigate the building with Dave Schrader. It was also featured in episode 4 of the ninth season of The Dead Files. During the investigation, psychic medium Amy Allan confronted a dark presence attempting to take control of her physical being.

According to the Edo Period writing Kiyū Shōran (嬉遊笑覧), it can be seen that one of the yōkai that it notes is depicted in the Bakemono E (化物絵) drawn by Kōhōgen Motonobu is one by the name of \\"otoron.\\" Concerning the change in names such as \\"otoroshi\\" and \\"odoro odoro,\\" the yōkai researcher Katsumi Tada posits that in the \\"Bakemonozukushi,\\" the name written was actually \\"orodoku\\" (おどろく, to surprise) with the final く (ku) written very long (refer to image), so \\"otoroshi\\" (おとろし) could simply be a misreading of this. However, \\"odoro odoro\\" means \\"creepy, scary,\\" as it is the adjective \\"odorodoroshii\\" (おどろおどろしい) turned into a noun, and \\"otorshi\\" is the Kamigata dialect way of saying \\"osoroshii\\" (恐ろしい, terrifying), so there is not much difference in meaning either way. The yōkai researchers Tada and Kenji Murakami posit that the word \\"odorogami\\" (棘髪), meaning extremely long growths of hair, is also contained in \\"odoro odoro\\". Furthermore, both the Hyakkai Zukan and the Gazu Hyakki Yagyō put the otorshi alongside the waira, and \\"wai\\" (畏) can be understood to mean fear, so it can be interpreted that the \\"waira\\" (恐い, fear) and \\"otoroshi\\" (恐ろしい, dread) are two yōkai that make up a pair. Legends The emakimono do not provide any explanatory text besides their name, and there is no written material that write about any related folk legends, so it is not clear where they ever appeared in legends. In yōkai-related literature and children's illustrated yōkai reference books starting in the Shōwa and Heisei periods, it is often explained that when they find people who do imprudent or mischievous things at shrines, they would suddenly come falling from above.Edited by Morihiko Fujisawa Yōkai Gadan Zenshū, Nihonhen, first part, Chūō Bijutsu Sha, 1929, page 263, there is the passage, \\"The kai (strange/paranormal thing) called otoroshi that do not let the unfaithful, who make light of the gods, through the toorii.\\"聖咲奇『世界の妖怪全百科』小学館（コロタン文庫）1981年 133頁 Also, in the Tōhoku Kaidan no Tabi (1974) by the author Norio Yamada, under the title of \\"Otoroshi,\\" there is a story about how in Fukushima Prefecture, when the unfaithful who have never even once visited a temple go to their mother's funeral, upon passing under the temple gates, they would suddenly be seized by a thick arm and hoisted up. Kenji Murakami did not find any legends that followed this explanatory text and posits that this is nothing more than a made-up imagination based on Sekien's otoroshi picture in the Gazu Hyakki Yagyō (where it perches atop a torii). =Legend in Akita= While it is unknown what relation this may have with the otoroshi in yōkai pictures, in Yuki no Idewaji (雪の出羽路) (1814) by Edo Period traveler Sugae Masumi, there is the following story about a hill road: In the same book is written that the \\"Sae no Kamizaka\\" (道祖ノ神坂) is in the town of Sakuraguchi, Inaniwa, Ogachi District Dewa Province (now the town of Inaniwa, Yuzawa, Akita Prefecture).秋田叢書刊行会『秋田叢書』第三巻（『雪の出羽路』雄勝郡 二） 137頁 Also, in the public archives of Akita Prefecture, there is a nikuhitsu book titled Kubota Jōka Hyakumonogatari thought to be created by a warrior of the Akita Domain (author and year unknown), there is a depiction of a human-like yōkai with a huge head called the \\"Naganozaka Hiyama Yashiki no Odoroshi\\" as one of the yōkai called forth by the hitotsume-kozō.福島彬人『奇々怪々あきた伝承』無明舎 1999年 81-83頁 =Shishitori= The Bakemonozukushi Emaki (化け物尽し絵巻) (from the Edo Period, now in private possession and entrusted to a museum of the Fukuoka Prefecture), considered to be a yōkai emaki that was made for putting captions on previously existing yōkai pictures seen in emakimono, the otoroshi was introduced under the name of \\"shishitori\\" (しゝこり) (for unknown reasons, all the yōkai in this emaki had their names changed). In this caption, they have a height of about 8 shaku (about 1.8 meters), and a size of about 8 jō in area, and its mouth was 1 jō, 1 shaku in length (about 3.3 meters). They appear in a town called Narabayashi, Buzen Province (perhaps now Narabayashi, Tsunawaki, Iizuka, Fukuoka Prefecture), and they eat horses and cattle in one gulp. It is said that the end of a mountain hunt, it tried to hide in a cave, when it was finished off with a bamboo spear. Mythology The Otoroshi's name comes from a regional corruption of the word osoroshii meaning scary, frightening or disheveled. The Otoroshi is a rare and mysterious creature that resembles a hunched creature that is covered in a messy mane, has blue or red skin, and large tusks. It is a master of disguise and only appears when its wants to appear. The Otoroshi is often sighted perching on top of roofs, and temple gates. It will often pounce on anyone who has a wicked soul where it will tear them to shreds and eat their remains outside of their usual food of small birds. Despite their frightful appearances, the Otoroshi is loyal to the guardian deities.it is scary. Popular culture * Different adaptions of Otoroshi appear in the Super Sentai franchise: ** In Samurai Sentai Shinkenger, the monster Ushirobushi is an Otoroshi-themed Ayakashi. In its adaption Power Rangers Samurai, the monster was adapted as \\"Robtish.\\" ** In Shuriken Sentai Ninninger, the Otoroshi is the result of a sealing shuriken coming in contact with a lawn mower. In its adaption Power Rangers Ninja Steel, the monster was adapted as \\"Game Goblin.\\" * An Otoroshi is featured in Yo-kai Watch. * In AdventureQuest Worlds, the Otoroshi lives on Yokai Island. One Otoroshi guards the gates of Green Shell Village until it was affected by the negative energy as a result of the fight with Jaaka and became hostile to everyone. The players had to lure the Otoroshi from the gates and defeat it. While Otoroshi sports a recolored and long-haired version of the Oni Fukumen helm for a head, its body is a recolored version of Spid-Squider's body.

Bruning Collection of Japanese Books and Manuscripts, L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University. An is a Japanese yōkai depicted in Edo Period pictures such as the Hyakkai Zukan by Sawaki Suushi and the Gazu Hyakki Yagyō by Sekien Toriyama. Concept They were depicted to be a teeth-blackened yōkai with grotesque features who were waving both hands, and appeared to be looking threatening by raising their voice, but there was no explanatory text, so their true identity is unknown. Teeth blackening was performed in medieval Japan among males of the nobility (kuge) and warrior class (buke), so it is inferred that they may be a yōkai of someone from this class, or alternatively they may come from how monsters in Omine, Aso District, Kumamoto Prefecture are called \\"wanwan\\" and how monsters in Taniyama, Kagoshima Prefecture (now Kagoshima) are called \\"wan\\". In the background of the picture in the Gazu Hyakki Yagyō, there is the interpretation that they are a paranormal phenomenon that appears from the walls of a deserted residence. Also, in yōkai depictions, the uwan only has three fingers on its hands, so it is theorized that this refers to how oni have three fingers.  Other theories  In the essay Tōhoku Kaidan no Tabi by Norio Yamada, there is the following strange tale (kaidan) in Aomori Prefecture from the end of the Edo Period. A man named Kasuke was saving money, so he bought some old residence and move in with a woman, but at night, there continuously echoed a loud voice shouting \\"uwan!\\" that he was unable to sleep. The next morning, the two of them, eyes all red, complained about this voice saying uwan preventing them from sleep, but not one of their neighbors could hear such a voice, and it was rumored that they were not able to sleep simply because Kasuke was together with that woman all night. However, an elder who heard this tale said that it was because in this old residence lived a monster called \\"uwan.\\" There are no primary sources provided for this mysterious tale, so it has been suggested that this was simply made up by Yamada. There is also the theory that they would appear near old temples and let out a strange voice saying as their name suggest, \\"uwan!\\" and startle passer-bys and take their lives as they are distracted, but if one repeats back everything that was said to them, the uwan would flee. This comes from a children's book of strange tales, the Ichiban Kuwashii Nihon Yōkai Zukan (いちばんくわしい日本妖怪図鑑, \\"The Most Informed Japanese Yōkai Illustrated Reference\\") by Arifumi Satō, and the book Obake Zukan (お化け図絵, Illustrated Reference Book of Monsters) by Sanpei Kasu quotes this theory, but the primary source here is also unknown, and again, it has been suggested that this is simply made up by Satō.

William R. Bell, the District Officer of Malaita in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, and many of his deputies were killed by Basiana and other Kwaio warriors as part of a plan to resist the head tax imposed by the colonial authorities and what was perceived as an assault on the traditional values. A retributive raid was organised that ultimately resulted in the death of about 60 Kwaio, in addition to nearly 200 incarcerated and a systematic destruction and desecration of important Kwaio ancestral shrines and ritual objects. The event was of extreme significance for the Kwaio people, and has greatly affected their way of life. Tax collection massacre In September 1927, various Kwaio, led by Basiana, planned an attack on Bell and his party when they came for the tax collection.Keesing and Corris, 119. They attempted to recruit plotters by advancing their grievances against Bell and the government, especially the empowerment of Christian coastal groups that were seen to dishonour their ancestors.Keesing and Corris, 120. Word of the plot spread across the island, and Bell and his police were warned well in advance.Keesing and Corris, 125. However, understanding local mores, Bell decided the best approach was to make a show of strength, and thereby command the respect of the locals and achieve their compliance. Collecting taxes offshore or calling residents up one by one, as some of his deputies urged, would reveal weakness.Keesing and Corris, 133–134. On Monday, 3 October 1927 Bell moored his ship the Auki in Singalagu harbour, and set up the usual tax collection operation at the house in the glen nearby. At dawn on Tuesday, Basiana and the other warriors made their way to the tax collection site.Keesing and Corris, 129–130. When the warriors arrived, Bell announced his peaceful intentions and invited them to pay their taxes. Basiana paid his tax first and went back to the edge of the clearing where his pouch was. Then he took the barrel of his rifle, concealed it between his arm and body, and slipped back into the line. He worked his way to the front of the line, and while Bell was writing on the tax roll, he took the rifle, raised it high and smashed it into his skull with such force that Bell's head virtually exploded. Basiana then sprung onto the table and into the tax house.Keesing and Corris, 135–138. Meanwhile, some of the other warriors in Basiana's party attacked Kenneth Lillies, a British cadet serving as Bell's assistant. The machete blow was deflected by another policeman, and he was able to fire his revolver in point blank range at the attackers, wounding two, before another attacker was able to shoot him in the chest with a discarded rifle. Makasi, another policeman, picked up the rifle next to him and was able to kill one of the attackers.Keesing and Corris, 138–139. The other officials in front of the tax house were quickly set upon by other warriors.Keesing and Corris, 143. Minutes before, one group of attackers had cut through the loia cane that fastened the tax house, and were able to pull down the walls, pinioning eight policemen inside against their rifles. Only one constable was able to escape the tax house, and sprinted to the jetty and was able to swim to safety. The others fought the best they could, but the first to shoot, Constable Kabini, had his rifle misfire, and thus Basiana was not killed as he sprang into the house. In all, 15 officials, including Bell and Lillies, were killed. One of the attacking party, shot by Makasi, was killed, plus about half a dozen wounded.Keesing and Corris, 145. Punitive expedition The survivors made their way to the Auki and the Wheatsheaf and waited while a small party of Kwaio Christians went ashore to recover Bell's and Lillies' bodies and wrapped them in sailcloth. The two ships, along with the Advent, anchored near the mouth of the harbour, sailed to Ngongosila where Bell and Lillies were buried together. Then the Auki and the Wheatsheaf sailed off to Tulagi to bring the news to the protectorate headquarters.Keesing and Corris, 149. In Tulagi, the Resident Commissioner Richard Rutledge Kane was off on tour, and his deputy, Captain N.S.B. Kidson, who had little experience in the Solomons, surmised that the Malaitans were in a general uprising. The High Commissioner in Suva requested a ship to be sent to the Solomons, and sailed from Sydney on 10 October.Keesing and Corris, 150. Australia's quick response symbolised the bond between Australia and the Solomons, official, religious, and commercial, and newspapers printed hundreds of articles about the massacre and its aftermath. Talk of a punitive expedition began almost immediately among the Europeans in Tulagi. When the Resident Commissioner R.R. Kane returned to the capital, much had already been prepared. Dozens of Europeans volunteered their services, but in the end 28 Europeans, mostly planters, were selected to make up the civilian force. They were issued with .303 rifles and given intensive training. The District Officer of Guadalcanal, C.E.J. Wilson, who had a reputation for roughness from his treatment of some resistance on Guadalcanal, was given orders to patrol the coast of Malaita to gather information. Some village constables returned with Wilson and pleaded that those who had paid their taxes (listed in Bell's tax rolls) the day before not be punished. These people were already in coastal villages, anticipating an official retaliation.Keesing and Corris, 154–156. In Auki, the Malaitan district headquarters, 880 Malaitans had volunteered to participate in the expedition. Officials, knowing that most were probably simply eager to avenge dead relatives or other old scores, decided to limit their participation, and only accepted the help of 40, who for the most part had served in Bell's police force.Keesing and Corris, 158. The group was rounded out by fifty naval personnel from Adelaide and 120 native carriers.Keesing and Corris, 160. The first armed party landed from Adelaide on Sunday, 16 October, twelve days after the killing.Keesing and Corris, 156. Five days later, the Ramadi with the colonial officials and the 28 Europeans, anchored in the harbour. A staging area was built 1,600 feet up the mountain. On 26 October, the party set out for the interior, travelling in a line over a quarter-mile long. The leaders of the expedition had considerable trouble keeping the European volunteer army in check, and some volunteers, who had been led to believe they would be permitted to shoot natives on sight, felt betrayed by the limitations and reprimands from their leadership. They had considerable difficulty with the terrain, drank whisky and gambled, and most were dismissed after two weeks.Keesing and Corris, 161–164. The naval personnel, added to \\"stiffen\\" the civilian party, also had considerable difficulty with the conditions; when Adelaide returned to Sydney on 18 November, 20% of the crew were hospitalised for malaria, dysentery, and septic sores. The naval presence had been thought necessary for dealing with an open rebellion, but as it became clear that the early messages had been exaggerated, their presence was largely unnecessary.Keesing and Corris, 164. The Europeans largely were no threat to the resistant Kwaio, but the fellow Malaitan police patrols, led by constables who had worked with Bell, were. The only advantage of the Kwaio was a better knowledge of the local landscape, but that was balanced by assistance from some Kwaio guides from the coastal area.Keesing and Corris, 165. Another act which the northern Malaitans took considerable zeal was the systematic desecration of Kwaio holy sites. Ancestral skulls, consecrated objects, and other relics were crushed, burned, or thrown into menstrual huts. Though the police force was Christian, traditional Kwaio religion was similar to that which they had been raised in, and they knew how to most effectively bring the wrath of the ancestors (who punish only their own descendants) upon the Kwaio.Keesing and Corris, 166. Despite the official command, the dominant leaders in the expedition party were Bell's sergeants and constables, who remained loyal to Bell and wished to avenge his death. In addition, it was decided that all adult male members of the bush kin groups were to be arrested and sent to Tulagi, including large numbers of elderly men who were not involved or only peripherally involved in the massacre. Most of the most wanted men were not found in the search, but rather gave themselves up as rumours spread about killings of women, children, old men, and others not involved in the massacre.Keesing and Corris, 176. The inland base camp was deserted on 21 December, when twenty fugitives remained at large, but all but one surrendered or were captured in the subsequent weeks.Keesing and Corris, 178. The police reported the shooting of 27 Kwaio, said to have been attacking patrols, resisting arrest, or trying to flee.Keesing and Corris, 170. An exact number of Kwaio killed during the expedition as a whole is impossible to establish; the estimate of South Seas Evangelical Mission missionaries in the Kwaio area, 60, though dismissed by the government as an exaggeration, was accepted by Roger M. Keesing, who thoroughly studied both the official reports and the memories of the Kwaio forty years later. Keesing reports accounting for 55 deaths as virtually certain. The Kwaio themselves often estimate the number at 200. Keesing accounted for this large estimate as including deaths caused by the supernatural vengeance of the ancestors, upset at the desecration of their shrines.Keesing and Corris, 178–183. Aftermath In total, 198 Kwaio were arrested and detained between November 1927 and February 1928. They were held in a stockade near the harbour, awaiting transport on the Ramadi to Tulagi, where they waited in prison without formal charges pressed against them. Reacting to the prison food and the crowded conditions, many suffered diseases. In February, dysentery broke out, and in the months to follow, 173 of them were admitted to hospital for it. In all, 30 of the prisoners died from diseases while in jail. The government, reacting to accounts of the deaths, responded that many of these were older men, said to be senile or otherwise already weak. However, they did not explain why such men were being held.Keesing and Corris, 184. A long pre-trial investigation followed, consolidating testimonies by survivors and detainees. The legal authorities recognised from the investigation who had actually plotted the murder, and it was understood they had used their political dominance to keep others in line. A balance had to be struck between the desire to set an example and to maintain strict British justice, and in the end, it was decided to charge with murder anyone who could be shown to have killed government officers or police, and to imprison others who had inflicted wounds, attempted murder, or otherwise played a central part. In all, 11 men were charged with murder, and six were convicted; of the 71 eventually charged with lesser offences, 21 were convicted.Keesing and Corris, 185–186. Basiana, who had killed Bell, was hanged publicly on 29 June 1928, in front of his two sons.Keesing and Corris, 186–188. In June 1928, seeking a solution to the problem of what to do with those who were acquitted or never charged with crimes, the High Commissioner in Fiji issued a \\"King's Regulation to Authorise the Detention of Certain Natives Formerly Living on the Island of Malaita.\\"Keesing and Corris, 188. It declared as \\"legal and valid\\" \\"all acts\\" committed in connection with the detention \\"in order to preserve peace and good order within the Protectorate\\", and extended the detention period six months. This permitted resident commissioner Kane to continue planning for the resettlement of the Kwaio on another island, an idea he had conceived already in November 1927. However, Lieutenant-Colonel H.C. Moorhouse, who had considerable colonial experience in Africa and was sent by London to investigate the massacre, quashed the scheme, and urged for the rapid repatriation of the detainees. In August 1928, the remaining detainees were returned to Malaita, and rations of rice were distributed.Keesing and Corris, 188–190. During the punitive expedition, many Kwaio sought refuge in Christian villages, and after their sacred sites were polluted, hundreds converted to Christianity rather than face ancestral punishment.Keessing, Roger M. Kwaio Religion. New York: Columbia UP, 1982. Page 14. There was a precipitous drop in the interior population relative to the coast, and villages became slightly smaller and more widely scattered. The effective end of the power of the ramo and blood feuding increased spatial mobility and reduced sexual mores.Keesing, 26–27. The records kept relating to the massacre were helpful in establishing a lengthy demographic history of the Kwaio people for ethnographer Roger M. Keesing; such a long record is possibly unique among traditional Melanesian societies.Keesing, 17. See also *List of massacres in the Solomon Islands Notes References * Roger M.

Life and work Burgess was born in London, into a large family of artists. He studied at the Somerset House School of Design in that city. In 1849, he traveled to California to join the Gold rush. Having tried his hand at mining and lithography, he and his brother Hubert set up a jewelry shop in Sonora, repairing watches and fashioning jewelry. George traveled extensively through the gold rush country, chronicling his experiences through watercolor paintings. George made three trips to Hawaii. His longest stay was 1855–1856, with shorter visits in 1866 and 1871.Severson, 2002, p. 76 Many of George's Hawaii drawings were later printed by the lithographic firm of Britton & Rey in San Francisco. George's brothers Charles Burgess and Edward Burgess lived in Honolulu for various periods of time. Charles was a photographer and portrait painter; Edward ran a coffee shop and sold his brothers’ artwork.Severson, 2002, p. 76 In California, George made a living as a portrait artist, but remains best known for his paintings of the gold rush. He was a founding member of the San Francisco Art Association in 1871 and died in Berkeley, California.

He established the history curriculum used in Israel's High Schools. Katz described \\"traditional society\\" and deployed sociological methods in his study of Jewish communities, with special attention to changes in halakhah (Jewish law) and Orthodoxy. He pioneered the modern study of Orthodoxy and its formation in reaction to Reform Judaism. Years 1945-1950 In the year 1945 Jacob Katz presented to a conference of historians his article \\"Marriage and Sexual Relations at the close of the Middle Ages\\" which was published that year in the periodical Zion. Katz, who lived at that time in Tel Aviv and worked as a lecturer at College of Education, had already been credited with a few articles in the fields of education, psychology, and pedagogy, and their publication had given him a good reputation in the field. However, this reputation alone did not make him happy; he even suspected that it might distance him from what he craved most of all: to get back to engagement in history research. It was Ben-Zion Dinur who encouraged Katz not to give up on his research even in the absence of an academic post. Indeed, despite the difficulty of setting aside time for research, Katz succeeded in completing the article mentioned. Its publication in the pages of Zion gave rise to favourable responses, and even won Katz an invitation to the first International Congress of Jewish studies in Jerusalem in 1947. With hindsight it is possible to claim that Katz's article on \\"Marriage and Sexual Relations\\" in Zion paved the way for his joining the faculty of Hebrew University.

The music was by Damon Ebner; it was a parody of the film King Kong. Background After Corman produced Dinocroc in 2004, he wanted to create a sequel to be named Dinocroc 2. However, the Sci-Fi Channel turned down the project after claiming that sequels did not do well for them. Corman decided to go ahead with the project, but under the name Supergator.  Plot  Professor Scott Kinney is an American geologist monitoring a local volcano when Supergator, a Deinosuchus recreated from fossilized preserved DNA, escapes from a secret bio-engineering research center/laboratory. Along the way, it eats 13 people, including two lovers, three drunken teens, three models, two tourists and a fisherman. It also eats Alexandra Stevens and Ryan Houston. Kinney joins forces with another scientist, Kim Taft, and a Texan alligator hunter named Jake. They pursue the monster as it heads down river intent on destroying a luxurious resort packed with hundreds of tourists. Conventional weapons have no effect on it at all and Kim is eaten. So they, with the help of Carla, plan a trap for it using a fake volcano. They lure him on to it, with Jake using himself as live bait. Supergator devours him and Kinney kills it by shooting at the fake volcano, which then blows up the beast.

He commanded the XLI Panzer Corps during the Battle of Berlin, allegedly abandoning his troops on 1 May 1945, one day before the city capitulated. Career Holste joined the German Army on in August 1914 and was commissioned as an officer in 1915. During World War II, he commanded 14th Infantry Division, the 4th Cavalry Division and the XLI Panzer Corps. On 15 November 1944 he was promoted to major general (Generalleutnant). =Battle of Berlin= On 22 April 1945, Holste became part of a poorly conceived and incredibly desperate plan that Wilhelm Keitel and Alfred Jodl proposed to Adolf Hitler. The plan envisaged for the few remaining German forces in central Germany to attack the Soviet forces encircling Berlin. The plan called for General Walther Wenck's Twelfth Army on the Elbe and Mulde fronts to be turned around and to attack towards the east, then linking up just south of Berlin with General Theodor Busse’s Ninth Army. Then both armies would strike in a northeastern direction towards Potsdam and Berlin. Wenck’s objective would be the autobahn at Ferch, near Potsdam. Holste's directive was to attack from the area northwest of Berlin with his XLI Panzer Corps across the Elbe between Spandau and Oranienburg. To give Holste as much punch as possible, General Felix Steiner was to turn over to Holste his mechanized divisions (the 25th Panzer-Grenadiers and the 7th Panzer). Wenck's army did make a turn around and attacked towards Berlin, but was soon halted outside of Potsdam by strong Soviet resistance. Neither Busse nor Holste made much progress towards Berlin. By the end of the day on 27 April, the Soviet forces encircling Berlin linked up and the forces inside Berlin were cut off. Late in the evening of 29 April, Hans Krebs contacted Jodl by radio from Berlin and requested an immediate report on the whereabouts of Holste's spearhead. On 30 April, Jodl replied that Holste's Corps was on the defensive. Early on the morning of May 1, Holste is reported to have appeared at Twelfth Army HQ having abandoned his troops. A day later, on 2 May, the Battle for Berlin came to an end when Helmuth Weidling unconditionally surrendered the city to the Soviets. Holste surrendered 8 May 1945. In 1947, he was released.

A ramo was recognized when he had killed an adversary in personal combat, and established an intimidating reputation. This was also believed to represent ancestral support, and their supernatural abilities contributed to their reputation. Modern Malaitans generalize that ramos were part of the leadership triumvirate for each clan, along with a priest and a feastgiver; in practice, sometimes a single person fulfilled more than one role, and not all clans had established ramos or feastgivers. In theory, ramos lead the group in war and blood feuding, avenging murder or a violation of the sex code for bounty. Their prestige andy wealth depended on their ability to collect and redistribute blood money. A ramo usually had blood money offered against him, but he was able to successfully intimidate anyone from attempting to collect it. They may even kill their own relatives in order to collect money put up for their own death. History The power of the ramo on Malaita enlarged during the decades of blackbirding, as firearms and steel tools (decreasing the time required for farmwork) appeared on the island. Noted ramos from this time, such as Harisimae of Waisisi, are still remembered. At the turn of the century, observers noted that rifles were so common on Malaita that nearly every man carried one. This may have been an exaggeration, and they were largely outmoded guns and there were dwindling amounts of ammunition, but the rifles remained a powerful symbol of power and authority. In the early decades of the twentieth century, Kwaio society was dominated by a half-dozen famous ramo and their assistants. One of the first goals during the pacification of Malaita as part of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate was to decrease the extent of the blood feuding and limit the autonomy of the ramos. William R. Bell, who was District Officer during the last part of this period, was viewed as a ramo when he attempted to stop the blood feuding. His confrontation with one of the most feared ramos of the time, Basiana, led to his death and the Malaita massacre. References * Roger M. Keesing and Peter Corris.

He was a powerful and feared ramo (bounty hunter), and came from a line of prominent leaders, feastgivers, and warriors of the Gounaile clan. He is known in the West as the killer of William R. Bell, the colonial District Officer, for which he and his co-conspirators were hanged. He was the only son and the eldest of his first cousins, so he was groomed for this position from an early age. Unlike many members of his clan, he did not go to Queensland or Fiji to work. As an adult, he became one of the most feared ramo of the time, and was remembered as able to kill with ruthlessness and fearlessness that intimidated those around him. He is also remembered for his obsession with honour and strict enforcement of Kwaio norms. Basiana's success gave great quantities of wealth to his clan from his collection of blood money, which in turn contributed to the prestige of the clan as they offered feasts. In the 1920s, Basiana and the other strongmen saw their power slipping under the new colonial regime, which was making inroads into Malaita led by the Malaita District Officer Bell. They saw the threat of the Protectorate justice, as some Kwaio had been hanged in Tulagi for the sort of killing that they did. Furthermore, they resented the imposition of a head tax on all Malaitans, and the efforts of the colonial authorities to confiscate their rifles. Finally, they resented the increased power of the newly commissioned constables, who were given power by the colonial authorities. In 1927 Basiana and two other ramo planned an attack on Bell as he made his annual tax collection rounds. Others, aware of the strength of the British from their experience abroad or afraid from premonitions in a dream, tried to discourage the attack, but Basiana dismissed their concerns and was able to coerce others into following him. On October 4, Basiana paid his tax, withdrew, and then reappeared at the front of the queue and plunged his rifle into Bell's head with such strength his head virtually exploded. Other members of the party attacked, and most of the tax collection party were killed. In retaliation for this killing, the colonial authorities launched a punitive expedition to root out the plotters of the attack and bring them to justice. Basiana, as the most wanted man, kept on the move and was able to evade the search parties. But later he surrendered, as he received news about the extent of the damage of the punitive expedition. Along with 200 other detainees, he was held in facilities in Tulagi for several months, awaiting trial. Along with five others he was convicted of murder and sentenced to be hanged. He was hanged publicly on June 19, with his two sons watching. Basiana's eldest son Anifelo, raised to be a ramo as well, went on to become a police drummer, evangelist, and anticolonial political leader. He had one other son and one daughter.

While his career began with hip hop and reggae, he is most famous for musical hits in the reggaeton genre including \\"Perros y Gatos\\", \\"Te Imagino\\", and most recently, \\"Perdona\\". Early life Alberto Stylee began his career in 1995, participating in various dance and hip hop improvisation competitions. According to Alberto, for the first five years of his career he was afraid to perform in public. He never imagined the improvisations he performed would be discovered by radio and television. As Alberto Stylee rose to fame in the late '90s, he recorded for top DJ's including DJ Blass, Luny Tunes, DJ Barbosa and others. Alberto Stylee's distinctive style and voice propelled him to success early in his career, opening the doors to collaborations with J Alvarez (\\"Te Imagino\\"), Daddy Yankee (\\"Letra de Posición\\"), Ñejo & Dalmata (\\"Vamos Pa' La Disco\\"), and Cheka (\\"Poca Ropa\\") and his participation in various compilation albums including Playero 39 with DJ Playero. In 1998, Alberto released his first solo production entitled \\"Exclusivo\\", which was nominated in the category of best \\"Rap and Reggae Album of the Year\\" in the \\"Premio Tu Música\\" (Your Music Awards). For two consecutive years, Alberto Stylee was selected as the Artist of the Year in the National Day of Rap and Reggae (\\"Día Nacional del Rap y Reggae\\") Awards in 1998 and 1999. In 2000, he released \\"Love Reggae Jams\\", an album that served as a bridge to his later career in reggaeton with a new rhythm that integrated romantic ballads with reggae and hip hop music. Reggaeton career Alberto Stylee's fame and success, however, was derived from his entry into the genre of reggaeton. In 2002, Alberto Stylee launched his third album titled \\"Los Dueños de la Disco\\", collaborating with musical artists such as Nicky Jam, Daddy Yankee, Maicol & Manuel, and Plan B (duo). The use of various artists and DJs in the album created a unique flavor that combined a variety of different styles and voices. In 2003, Alberto Stylee left his native Puerto Rico to expand his career in the United States, settling upon Miami, Florida and signing a musical contract with Univibe Records. In 2004, he launched his fourth album and his second in the reggaeton genre, \\"Rebuleando Con Estilo\\". The album served to cement Alberto Stylee as a prominent reggaeton artist and featured collaborations with fellow Puerto Rican reggaeton stars such as Nicky Jam, and Zion & Lennox. As Alberto Stylee's career progressed, his focus pivoted to audiences in Latin America. In 2007, the artist left Miami to live in Medellín, Colombia and join the emerging music scene in the city that has produced some of the world's best reggaeton artists including J Balvin, Reykon, Maluma and others. Alberto cited Medellín's culture and renowned beautiful women as his reasons for relocating to the city. Legal history On June 2, 2012, Alberto Stylee was detained by Colombian authorities in Medellín, Colombia and later charged with attempted murder and the illegal possession of a firearm in connection with a shooting that took place on February 26, 2012 in a farmhouse in Copacabana, Antioquia. According to witnesses the victim, Edwin Alfredo Henao Moná, was shot multiple times during a party that featured multiple reggaeton artists and local celebrities. According to the victim, Alberto Stylee fell into a jealous rage after Mr. Henao spoke to a woman attending the party. When Alberto approached and aimed his gun, Mr. Henao allegedly pleaded for his life saying, \\"Please don't shoot me. I have a son\\". Alberto Stylee, who was attending the party to perform, has been consistent in his denial of the accusations, claiming that there were never ballistic tests and the clothing he wore on the day of the party did not match the clothing described by the victim. Mr. Henao died two years later, on May 27, 2014, due to complications resulting from his injuries . On October 30, 2012, Alberto Stylee was released from Colombia's Bellavista prison by the circuit court of Bello, Antioquia citing insufficient and conflicting evidence in the case. Alberto Stylee would later release a song titled Bella Bella, which touches on his experiences while incarcerated in the Bellavista prison. The video rendition of that single had more than 4.3 million views on YouTube as of November 2014. On February 17, 2016, the Tribunal Superior of Medellin revoked the prior acquittal from the circuit court of Bello, Antioquia and issued a warrant for Alberto Stylee's immediate arrest, ordering him to serve an additional 12 years in prison on charges of attempted murder and illegal possession of weapons. However, prior to his capture, the singer fled to the United States where he continues to maintain his innocence. Resurgence Since his release from prison, Alberto Stylee's career has seen a resurgence. Under the guidance of manager and friend Christian Hernandez, Alberto Stylee released three new singles in 2014 including Me Enamoré, and Manifiestate and Llamada Perdida. On July 9, 2014, Alberto Stylee signed a multiyear contract with Míguelo Romano, a men's designer clothing brand based in Brooklyn, New York that produces a line of high fashion, armored clothing. This sponsorship contract included performances at Medellín's Luxury Nightclub during Míguelo Romano's annual fashion show alongside hip hop sensation Radio MC. Alberto Stylee performed the concert while wearing a bulletproof urban hoodie.

After his re-election in 1994 and the return to power of the PQ, he was named Minister for several portfolios from 1994 to his resignation in 2002, including Minister of Environment and Wildlife, Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Parliamentary Reform, Transports and Natural Resources. He was also the Government House Leader just before the 1998 elections until his resignation on January 29, 2002. Brassard resigned after refusing a secondary Cabinet position offered by then-Premier Bernard Landry. He resigned on the same date as then-Minister of Transports Guy Chevrette, another veteran PQ member. He later worked for the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean newspaper Le Quotidien.

The Texas-born Wheat was a guitarist and bass player with the dance bands of the era, playing at the Chicago Playboy Jazz Festival 1959 in The Playboy Jazz All Stars and the Chet Baker Trio. In the winter of 1957 he was a jazz guitarist with Baker's Trio. Though most of Baker's material was recorded in Los Angeles, \\"Embraceable You\\", \\"There's a Lull in My Life\\" and \\"My Funny Valentine\\" are rare examples of Baker recording in New York. The format is also unusual for him, just Baker's vocals (no trumpet) accompanied by only Wheat on nylon string acoustic guitar and bassist Russ Savakus. Wheat wrote music with his partner, lyricist Bill Loughborough. Their composition \\"Better Than Anything\\" is part of the live acts of Lena Horne, Phylicia Rashad, Irene Kral, Bob Dorough and Al Jarreau. Their next song, \\"Coo Coo U\\", was recorded both by The Kingston Trio and by The Manhattan Transfer. Wheat embraced George Russell's Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization for improvisation; he would sing scales while playing a guitar accompaniment based on the theory.  The Kingston Trio  Wheat was best known as the upright bass accompanist for The Kingston Trio, the fourth member on stage and an integral part of the music and the group's musicologist. He is remembered for his subtle jazz influence during their early recordings, eleven of the Trio's Capitol Records albums, including the critically acclaimed Here We Go Again. He toured extensively, playing college campuses across America, well-known coffee houses in Greenwich Village and the hungry i in San Francisco. He also appeared on many television shows of the time, among them Milton Berle's Texaco Star Theater, Jack Benny, The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, The Pat Boone Show, and The Perry Como Show. Mr. Wheat is seen on the cover of the Trio's Goin' Places album. When asked in an interview, whether Buckwheat was considered a Beatnik since he grew up in the Beat generation, Dave Guard answered of his mentor, \\"Not sure, but he knew where to get it\\" referring to marijuana.Mr. Guard and the other two Article on Dave Guard and The Kingston Trio – Richard L. MacLeod, May 1, 2003. Retrieved on August 14, 2008  Whiskeyhill Singers  In 1961 Wheat left the Trio along with Dave Guard to form the Whiskeyhill Singers. The new group toured, recorded an album where along with Guard's banjo work on \\"Bonnie Ship, The Diamond\\", the group's rendition of the classic good-bye song \\"Isa Lei\\", using nothing but Buckwheat's bass for back-up, is reminiscent of his bass line and acoustic guitar behind Guard's soulful \\"Fast Freight,\\" recorded with the Trio in 1958. The Whiskeyhill Singers also came to attention after their recording of traditional American folk songs for the soundtrack of the MGM Cinerama motion picture, How the West Was Won (1962).  BooBam Bamboo Drum Company  Wheat had long been an advocate of George Russell's \\"Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization for Improvisation\\", the art of tonal gravity. In 1948 Harry Partch, an American composer, developed a microtonal system of music that depended on custom-built, specialized instruments of various and exotic designs, which could play non-tempered scales, for its performance. Buckwheat (the name Wheat used in later life)Gerd Stern, \\"From Beat Scene Poet to Psychedelic Multimedia Artist in San Francisco and Beyond, 1948-1978,\\" an oral history conducted in 1996 by Victoria Morris Byerly, Regional Oral History Office, The Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, 2001. Retrieved on August 15, 2008. and his Sausalito, California roommate Bill Loughborough, a musician and electronic engineer, built instruments for Partch, such as a marimba played with a large soft mallet over the resonator, delivering barely audible, low-Hertz tones. Loughborough borrowed diagnostic and metric instruments from the Mare Island Navy Yard; using an oscilloscope and audio oscillator, they were able to work at a technical level not previously possible. Together they moved onto a Sausalito barge with Jak Simpson, who in 1954 founded a business named the \\"Boobam Bamboo Drum Company\\". Wheat, who was also working on the President Lines cruises to the Orient as a bass player, would buy large-diameter giant bamboo in the Philippines and bring them back on the ship to build the South Pacific Island bamboo drums, which they manufactured in Mill Valley, California, as Boobam's, ('bam' and 'boo' switched around). The drums fascinated several jazz groups, which added them to their percussion sections. In 1956, Chet Baker's Ensemble used them to perform on the Today Show. The drums' unique sound inspired Nick Reynolds of the Kingston Trio, who eagerly included BooBam on their tour, with Buckwheat's percussion solo being featured on O Ken Karanga, along with his last performance with the group on the album College Concert, the Trio's first live recording with John Stewart at UCLA in 1961. After the demise of the Whiskeyhill Singers, Wheat became the bassist/arranger for folk duo Bud & Travis. He is heard on three of their albums; Live at the Cellar Door, Perspective on Bud & Travis and In Person, on the Liberty label.

He is one of the punokawan (clowns), but is in fact divine and very wise. He is the dhanyang (guardian spirit) of Java,Geertz, 23. and is regarded by some as the most sacred figure of the wayang set. Holt, 144. He is said to be the god Sang Hyang Ismaya in human form.Budihardja, \\"Grepen uit de Wajang,\\" Djawa II (1922), 22-23; cited in Holt, 145.Brandon, 13. The name Semar is said to derive from the Javanese word samar (\\"dim, obscure, mysterious\\"). He is often referred to with the honorific, \\"Kyai Lurah Semar\\" (\\"the venerable chief\\"). Description Mask of Semar for traditional Javanese theater performance. In depictions, Semar appears with a flat nose, a protruding lower jaw, a tired eye, and bulging rear, belly, and chest. He wears a checkered hipcloth, symbolizing sacredness. Like the other panakawan, the wayang kulit puppet does not have the elaborate openwork and ornamentation characteristic of the heroes In wayang wong, Semar always leans forward, one hand palm up on his back and the other extended partly forward, moving up and down, with an extended forefinger.Holt, 160. By tradition Semar has three sons, the other punakawans in the wayang: Gareng, Petruk, and Bagong (Bagong does not appear in Surakarta-style wayang).Brandon, 24. In some wayangs, he has a brother Togog (or Hyang Antaga), who is the servant-clown of a demonic hero.Holt, 145. Origin A decorative kris with a figure of Semar as the handle As Semar is one of the few characters in wayang stories not from Indian mythology, his origin is obscure. One hypothesis is that he and his sons are old indigenous deities who became cursed and demoted to servants with the importation of the kshatriya heroes of the Indian epics.J. Kats, \\"Wie is Semar?\\" Djawa III (1923), 55; cited in Holt, 145.Brandon, 18. Semar also resembles the vidusaka clown figure of Indian Sanskrit drama.Brandon, 3-4. The first known appearance of Semar is during the Majapahit era. In 1358 in relief of Sudamala in Candi TIgamangi, and in Candi Sukuh dated 1439. The relief was copied from a wayang story from the period, where Semar was first known to be appeared. Khoon, 106 Stories In one version of the Babad Tanah Jawi (the Javanese creation myth), Semar cultivated a small rice field near Mount Merbabu for ten thousand years before there were any men. His descendants, the spirits of the island, came into conflict with people as they cleared fields and populated the island. A powerful priest, unable to deviate from his king's orders to continue cultivating the island, provided Semar with a role that will allow his children and grandchildren to stay. Semar's role was to be a spiritual advisor and magical supporter of the royalty, and those of his descendants who also protect the humans of Java can remain there. One genealogy of Semar is that he is the eldest descendant of God, and elder brother to Batara Guru, king of the other gods; however, Semar became a man.Geertz, 276. Another genealogy says that he is the son of Adam and Eve. His brother Nabi (\\"prophet\\") Sis gave birth to various prophets, such as Jesus and Muhammad, from whom the various Western peoples are descended, while Semar (\\"Sayang Sis\\") gave birth to the Hindus and the Javanese. In either case Semar, in his awkward, ugly human form, represents at the same time god and clown, the most spiritually refined and outwardly rough. Use in wayang Sundanese wayang adaptation of Semar. Semar and his sons first appear in the second part of the plays (pathet sanga),Brandon, 79. as the servants and counselors of whoever the hero of the wayang play is.Frits A. Wagner, Indonesia: The Art of an Island Group. New York: Crown Publishers, 1959; 130. In wayang plots Semar is never mistaken, and is deceptively powerful. He is the only character who dares to protest to the gods, including Batara Guru (Shiva) and Batari Durga, and even compel them to act or desist. He often represents the realistic view of the world in contrast to the idealistic. His role as servant is to cheer up those in despair and blunt the pride of the triumphant. Clifford Geertz compared his role vis-à-vis Arjuna to that of Prince Hal with his father in Shakespeare's Henry IV, and his role as critic of the play's worldview and antidote to pride as similar to Falstaff.Geertz, 277. It has also been suggested that Semar is a symbol of the peasantry, not otherwise incorporated in the palace hierarchies; that in some more popular forms of the drama, he and the other clowns dominate the royal heroes supports this idea.H.O., \\"Petroek als Vorst,\\" Djawa, III (1922), 169-172; cited in Holt, 145. Other appearances Semar also appears on some ceremonial weapons, the pusaka of some important families. In this role he represents an ancestral figure.Wagner, 162. There is a low rectangular candi on the Dieng Plateau known as Candi Semar, perhaps originally a treasury,Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, History of Indian and Indonesian Art, New York: Dover, 1985, 202. but it is generally assumed by scholars that its name was given to the temple centuries after its erection.Holt, 53. In Bali, the counterpart of Semar is Twalen.Jeune Scott-Kemball, Javanese Shadow Puppets: The Raffles Collection in the British Museum, Trustees of the British Museum, 1970, 18.

The slametan (or selametan, slamatan, and selamatan) is the communal feast from Java, symbolizing the social unity of those participating in it. Clifford Geertz considered it the core ritual in Javanese religion, in particular the abangan variant.Geertz, 11. The feast is common among the closely related Javanese, Sundanese and Madurese people. A slametan can be given to celebrate almost any occurrence, including birth, marriage, death, moving to a new house, and so forth. Depending on the intention, the mood and emphasis may vary somewhat, but the main structure is the same. Geertz categorizes them into four main types:Geertz, 30. *Those relating to the crises of life: birth, circumcision, marriage, and death *Those associated with events of the Islamic calendar *The bersih désa (\\"cleaning of the village\\"), concerned with the social integration of the village *Those held irregularly depending on unusual occurrences: departing for a long trip, moving residence, changing personal names, illness, sorcery, and so on The ceremony takes its name from the Javanese word slamet, from Arabic: salam, which refers to a peaceful state of equanimity, in which nothing will happen. This is what the host intends for both himself and his guests, by experiencing the egalitarian structure of the slametan and the petitions of supernatural protection from spirits.Geertz, 14. In Geertz's fieldwork in Mojokuto in the 1950s, he found that costs of slametans varied from 3 to 5,000 Indonesian rupiahs, depending on the type and the relative wealth of the host. Procedure A Slametan in a mosque in Cibodas, with tumpeng as its main menu. ca. 1907. Slametans are generally held in the evening, after evening prayer is finished. The date is determined either by the occurrence it is celebrating (for births and deaths, for example), or on auspicious days in the Javanese calendar. The guests, always men, are always close neighbors, and the selection of guests is based entirely on proximity, and not whether they are friends or relatives. They are called by a messenger of the host (usually a child of his) only five or ten minutes before the slametan is to begin, and they must drop whatever they are doing to come.Geertz, 12. When they arrive, the guests sit on floor mats around the food which has been placed in the center, while incense fills the room. The ceremony begins with a formal speech (udjub) in high Javanese. The speech thanks the attendees for coming, presents the reason for the slametan, announces his intentions and petitions the spirits to secure for himself and his guests a state of equanimity (slamet, hence the name of the ritual), and finally apologizes for any errors in his speech and the humble inadequacy of the food. During pauses in the speech, the audience responds with solemn \\"inggih\\" (\\"yes\\").Geertz, 12-13. Following the speech, somebody present gives an Arabic chant-prayer. Many will not know how, but the host makes sure that someone there had attended a religious school (usually a kyai); for special occasions he may even invite the village religious specialist (the modin). Fragments of the Koran, especially the al- Fatiha, are most commonly used, although special prayers may be used if they are known. At pauses the audience says \\"amen\\" (amin). The prayer leader receives a small payment (wadjib).Geertz, 13. At last, the food is served. While the ceremony is strictly for men, the food preparation falls upon the women in the family, who for larger ceremonies may draw on kin to assist in the preparation. Each guest receives a cup of tea and a banana-leaf dish containing each sort of food in the center of the room. The food is fancier than average, and each variety has a symbolic meaning, which is sometimes explained in the speech. The host himself does not eat, nor does he serve the food, which one or two of the guests do. When everybody has a dish, the host invites them to eat, which they do quickly without speaking. After a few minutes, and before eating most of the food, the guests excuse themselves, and finish eating the food in their own homes, with their own wives and children. The whole ceremony usually lasts only ten or fifteen minutes. Timing and characteristics Tumpeng is commonly the main menu in a slametan. =Life cycle events= Around birth, there are four major slametans and a number of minor ones. The four major ones are:Geertz, 38, 47. * Tingkeban, at about seven months of pregnancy (held only for the first child of either the mother or father) * Babaran or brokokan, at the birth itself * Pasaran, five days after birth, including the naming of the child * Pitonan, seven \\"months\\" after birth (a month being the 35-day cycle of the Javanese calendar) The circumcision slametan (islamam or sunatan, held for boys between the ages of ten and fourteen) and the wedding slametan (kepanggihan) are similar in their ceremony and foods offered, and can be seen as coming-of-age ceremonies for boys and girls, respectively.Geertz, 51. Funerals (layatan) generally take place as soon as possible after the death, and inevitably involve the religious specialist (modin) of the village. Slametans are held the day of the death, and then repeated in increasing size (both in number of guests and length of the chant) three, seven, forty, and 100 days after the death, the first and second anniversaries, and 1000 days after the death. The final one is the most elaborate, and is thought to mark the point when the body has completely decayed to dust.Geertz, 58-72. =Islamic feasts= The most important of the calendrical slametans are for the Prophet's birthday (Muludan, on 12 Rabi' al-awwal) and near the end of Ramadan (Maleman). Other notable holidays infrequently have slametans, and Satu Suro, the New Year's Day (1 Muharram) is celebrated by those who are self-consciously Muslim. Because these dates are shared by everybody, it is common to attend slametans for many of one's neighbors in succession. For this reason, they tend to be relatively small, and particularly based on the principle of inviting neighbors.Geertz, 77-80. =Community feasts= The bersih désa is always held in Dhu al-Qi'dah (Sela), the eleventh month, on different days according to village tradition. This slametan is given at the place of burial of the dhanyang désa, the guardian spirit of the village. In santri villages, it may take place at a mosque and consist entirely of Muslim prayers. For this type of slametan, all families in the village are expected to contribute food, with the adult head of each family obliged to attend.Geertz, 81-82. =Personal feasts= Geertz's final category of slametans, intermittently occurring and dependent on a specific situation, are somewhat less frequent and tend to be smaller affairs. Reasons for holding these slametans include changing residences, changing names, going on a journey, bad dreams (it can prevent the fearful event), prevention or encouragement of rain, anniversaries of clubs and organizations, sorcery, healing, and others.Geertz, 83-84.

It was introduced in 1976 by Dutch economist Peter van Westendorp. The technique has been used by a wide variety of researchers in the market research industry. The PSM approach has been a staple technique for addressing pricing issues for the past 20 years. It historically has been promoted by many professional market research associations in their training and professional development programs. The PSM approach continues to be used widely throughout the market research industry and descriptions can be easily found in many market research websites. Assumptions The assumption underlying PSM is that respondents are capable of envisioning a pricing landscape and that price is an intrinsic measure of value or utility. Participants in a PSM exercise are asked to identify price points at which they can infer a particular value to the product or service under study. PSM claims to capture the extent to which a product has an inherent value denoted by price. Approach Example Van Westendorp questionnaire The traditional PSM approach asks four price-related questions, which are then evaluated as a series of four cumulative distributions, one distribution for each question. The standard question formats can vary, but generally take the following form: > * At what price would you consider the product to be so expensive that you > would not consider buying it? (Too expensive) * At what price would you > consider the product to be priced so low that you would feel the quality > couldn’t be very good? (Too cheap) * At what price would you consider the > product starting to get expensive, so that it is not out of the question, > but you would have to give some thought to buying it? (Expensive/High Side) > * At what price would you consider the product to be a bargain—a great buy > for the money? (Cheap/Good Value) The cumulative frequencies are plotted, and PSM advocates claim interpretive qualities exist for any intersecting of the cumulative frequencies for each of the four price categories. Note that the standard method requires that two of the four cumulative frequencies must be inverted in order to have the possibility of four intersecting points. Conventional practice inverts the cumulative frequencies for \\"too cheap\\" and \\"cheap\\". The general explanation of intersecting cumulative frequencies varies. A common description of the intersections is that the crossing of \\"too cheap\\" and \\"expensive\\" can be the lower bound of an acceptable price range. Some describe this as the \\"point of marginal cheapness\\" or PMC. Similarly, the intersection of the \\"too expensive\\" and \\"cheap\\" lines can be viewed as the upper bound of an acceptable price range. An alternative description is the \\"point of marginal expensiveness\\" or PME. Intersections where there is generally more agreement is the point at which the \\"expensive\\" line crosses the \\"cheap\\" line. This is described as the \\"indifference price point\\" or IPP. The IPP refers to the price at which an equal number of respondents rate the price point as either \\"cheap\\" or \\"expensive\\". Finally, the intersection of the \\"too cheap\\" and \\"too expensive\\" lines represents an \\"optimal price point\\" or OPP. This is the point at which an equal number of respondents describe the price as exceeding either their upper or lower limits. Optimal in this sense refers to the fact that there is an equal tradeoff in extreme sensitivities to the price at both ends of the price spectrum. While Van Westendorp himself did not attempt to solve the demand estimation problem (only pricing) three important extensions to the technique Newton/Miller/Smith (NMS), Martin Rayner Interpolation (MRI) and Roll/Achterberg (RA) were subsequently developed to address this problem and estimate demand. Newton/Miller/Smith assume no purchases on the too expensive or too cheap curves, adding instead two further questions about the probability of purchase at the expensive and cheap prices: e.g. > * At the how likely are you to purchase the product in the next six months? > Scale 1 (unlikely) to 5 (very likely). * At the how likely are you to > purchase the product in the next six months? Scale 1 (unlikely) to 5 (very > likely). Combining the price responses with the probability responses allows drawing a revenue curve to estimate the price point delivering the maximum revenue.

Most bodgies rode motorbikes but some had cars, many of which were hotted-up e.g. mag wheels, hot dog muffler, etc. The males were called bodgies and the females were called widgies. Bodgies were often depicted in Australian media and folk-lore as louts. On 1 February 1951 the Sydney Morning Herald wrote on its front page: > \\"What with \\"bodgies\\" growing their hair long and getting around in satin > shirts, and \\"wedgies\\" cutting their hair short and wearing jeans, confusion > seems to be arising about the sex of some Australian adolescents.\\"Aussie > Words Bodgie Nov 2002 The Mazengarb Report (Report of the Special Committee on Moral Delinquency in Children and Adolescents) of 1954 was partly a response to the emergence of the bodgie & widgie subculture. Citing a Sydney Morning Herald article from 21 January 1956, Professor Keith Moore wrote in 2004: > \\"The first bodgies were World War 2 Australian seamen who as well as > impersonating Americans were black marketers and the first bodgie gang was > the 'Woolloomooloo Yanks' who congregated in Cathedral Street Woolloomooloo. > By 1948, about 200 bodgies were regularly frequenting Kings Cross milk bars. > Soon, bodgie gangs formed at other inner-Sydney locations.

Their job was to bust up the gang. In 1983, the Melbourne Age suggested: > \\"the term \\"bodgie\\" arose around the Darlinghurst area in Sydney.

Bodgies took on that James Dean look in the period of post-World War II prosperity. The 1970s were the rockers' heyday in Adelaide. During the 1980s in South Australia, and possibly other Australian regions, Australian rockers were typically working class and fairly reactionary. Typical interests were alcohol, girls, music and cars. They were known as troublemakers and street fighters, and there were several rocker groups. It was not uncommon for rockers to fight members of other subcultures, such as surfies, mods, and skinheads. They mostly liked hard rock and heavy metal music, by bands such as AC/DC, The Angels, Midnight Oil, Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple. Adelaide Rockers of the 1970s enjoyed the music of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, but identified heavily with the look, style and rock n roll style of music and movie greats such as Elvis Presley and James Dean. Unlike their British counterparts, rockers in Australia had no association with rockabilly or Cafe Racer motorcycles. This Australian youth subculture had more in common with the 1950s and 1960s rock n roll scene. Cars common to rockers included Chevrolets, Oldsmobiles, Fords, Pontiacs or other American 1950s and 1960s classics. Rockers who did not own those brands generally had modified Australian cars, such as early model Holdens, Fords or Valiants. A number of rockers owned motorbikes. =Style and clothing= Australian rockers commonly wore black mesh shirts; black or white T-shirts; singlets or flannelette shirts (usually in a blue or occasionally red check pattern). Common jackets included classic suit jackets, generally dark coloured (blue or black); herringbone jackets; leather motorcycle jackets (sometimes with a fur-lined collar); red Holden or blue Ford jackets (with the logos of local car manufacturers emblazoned across the back); or denim jackets or vests. Australian rockers usually wore tight jeans, often with the legs taken in. Some rockers sewed their jeans on (i.e. take in their jeans while wearing them, to make them as tight as possible) for the weekends. Footwear common to Australian rockers included black ripple-soled suede shoes and black boots. Many rockers wore RM Williams leather elastic-sided square-toed boots, and some wore pointed shoes. Alternatives included ankle-high work boots (often steel capped), Adidas Officials (a black leather trainer/sneaker) and the Ciak casual shoe (usually black). The common look was slicked back or coiffed into a quiff, using Brylcreem or another hair cream. Some styled their hair into what were known as racks, hair curled into two waves meeting at a point at the forehead, but always slicked back on the sides. The Elvis look was extremely predominant in Rocker culture. Headgear, if worn, was typically a black knitted beanie (US name: watch cap, Canadian name: tuque). Tattoos, including bum tatts (amateur tattoos), were common among Australian rockers. Harder rockers often had small red stars with black/blue outlines tattooed on their faces (usually cheeks) and ears. These tattooed stars were known as rocker stars. In media Actor and comedian Grahame Bond created a character named Kev Kavanagh for the 1972 sketch comedy series The Aunty Jack Show and the spinoff series Wollongong the Brave. A more exaggerated version of the character was revived as the \\"last living bodgie\\" in the 1985 comedy series News Free Zone. Former Prime Minister of Australia Bob Hawke was nicknamed the Silver Bodgie by the Australian media for his thick silver-grey hair worn in the bodgie style and loutish behaviour before entering politics. Bodgie is a 1959 ABC television play. See also * Beatniks * Bogan * Sharpies * Skinhead References Further reading * Manning, A. E. (1958) The Bodgie: a study in abnormal psychology.

It is a nocturnal and herbivorous rodent that resides throughout the day in shallow burrows made in loose sand. Once widespread, the range has become greatly reduced and it is restricted to the grasslands, sedges, and cane- fields at the north and east of the continent. The fur is an attractive yellow-brown colour, with grey or cream at the underside. This medium-sized rat has a tail shorter than its body. Taxonomy  The description of the species was published in 1904 by Oldfield Thomas, the specimens were collected by J. T. Tunney and forwarded to the British Museum; Thomas recognising the field worker in the specific epithet. The type used in the description was a female collected at Mary River, in the Northern Territory of Australia, and two other unlabelled specimens. Thomas placed the new species in the genus Mus, allying them with the rat (as Mus rattus) familiar to Europeans. Two subspecies are recognised, the nominate describing those in the north and west, and subspecies Rattuss tunneyi culmorum at the east coast. The population has previously been recognised as subspecies Rattus culmorum apex. Rattus tunneyi is also known as Tunney's rat, and the Australian pale field rat.  Description  A medium-sized species of Rattus, with a rounded and comparatively broad head. The upper side of the pelage is a toffee-like shade of brown, said to be appealing in appearance, this grades into the lighter cream or greyish white at the underside. The hair across the upper back is slate-grey beneath with a sandy-buff colour overlaying this, the fine hair is around 10 mm and interspersed with hairs around twice this length. A defining detail is their tail length, 80 to 150 millimetres, which is obviously shorter than the combined head and body length, which ranges from 120 to 195 mm. The weight range is 50 to 210 grams. Rattus tunneyi has pale pinkish ears that are 15 to 20 mm long and their large eyes have a bulging appearance. The female has a total of ten nipples, one pectoral and four inguinal pairs of teats. The feet of these rodents are covered in white hair at the upper side.  Behaviour  The behaviour of the species is generally docile, and they are found in living with others in loosely connected and scattered groups. Breeding takes place in the austral autumn, although this occurs a little later in the year with north-west subspecies. The litter size is around 4 young, but this may range from 2 to 11. As is usual in the genus, the oestrus cycle is from 4 to 5 days, The period of gestation is 21 to 22 days, and when combined with post-partum oestrus it has the potential for a large population increase; the extremes of fluctuation for the population size of the dusky Rattus colletti and long-haired R. villosissimus rats are not recorded in this species. The existence of runways between their nests indicate some interaction between individuals, but the degree of sociality amongst these communities is unknown. Distribution and habitat  Rattus tunneyi once occupied almost all areas of mainland Australia, but is now found only in tall grasslands in northern Australia.Morris, K., Burbidge, A., Aplin, K. and Ellis, M. (2008). Rattus tunneyi. In: IUCN (2008). 2008 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The rats were once found as far inland as Alice Springs, but are currently restricted to coastal and sub-coastal regions. This species has become regionally extinct in some areas of its former range, which contracted greatly during the twentieth century. An outlying specimen obtained from South Australia was probably collected at Kangaroo Island, the mainland occurrence in that region is only confirmed from sub-fossil specimens. The distribution range of the east coast subspecies R. tunneyi culmorum is from Coffs Harbour in New South Wales to Coen in Queensland. To the west of the Gulf of Carpentaria the subspecies R. tunneyi tunneyi is found at coastal regions of the north to the Kimberley region in Western Australia, they also occur at offshore islands in the Pilbara region of that state. The fields of sugar cane found at the eastern coast may host the species, and they are observed at camp-sites or rocky slopes in the Kakadu National Park. The preference of habitat includes woodlands, dense sedges or grassy under-storey within monsoon forest, and wetter open grasslands. The local environment is usually vegetation surrounding a watercourse, with friable soils that seems to be a requirements. They forage for a variety of plant material, and will dig to expose subsurface foods such as tubers.  Ecology  A vegetarian that eats grass stems, seeds, tubers and roots, and during the day rests in a shallow burrows dug in loose, crumbly soil. The habitat is within the range of pastoralist leases and with the introduction of cattle local ecology has been degraded by soil compaction. Feral cats are also known to have placed pressure on the population. This rat is terrestrial, foraging across the soil surface, although a shallow burrow system provides them with shelter during the day. The breeding period of the eastern subspecies is primarily around the austral spring, September to November, the northernmost group reproduce during the drier period of the year from March to August. Rattus tunneyi was identified as a damaging pest species in Queensland, where their feeding at the roots of hoop pine, the species Araucaria cunninghamii, and destroying partially matured trees in plantation crops.

Club career =New Zealand= Born in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England, Pelter emigrated with his family to New Zealand at the age of eight and entered the New Zealand Football Academy whilst twelve years old. He exhibited a love for football in his school work, writing an essay on his personal hero Roy Keane, whilst also supporting English team Blackburn Rovers. He went on to play in the National Soccer League for Christchurch Technical, Ferrymead Bays and Central United. He was taken back to England at the age of fifteen by New Zealand Knights manager Chris Turner who introduced him to the scouting teams at Bolton Wanderers, Chelsea and Swansea City. After recovering from a serious back injury on his return, Pelter moved to New Zealand Football Championship team Canterbury United in 2005. Due to the semi-professional nature of football in New Zealand, Pelter had to take on other jobs to finance his football regime, with his mother later commenting \\"After training, he'd go to work in a bar until two in the morning to fund his career, he was running, training and swimming on his own, he used to get up on cold mornings on his own to go running\\". The winner of Canterbury United's \\"Defender of the Year\\" award and runner-up for \\"Player of the Year\\" in only his first season with the club, Pelter subsequently attracted the attention of European clubs in 2007 following his international progress. Born in the United Kingdom, he was eligible to play for any EU club without the need for a work permit and reserve team and youth contracts were offered to him by Leeds United and AC Milan amongst others. =Sunderland= He took up the offer of a trial at Sunderland in July 2007, appearing in the pre-season friendly defeat against Scunthorpe United and reserve team games against Berwick Rangers and Hebburn Town. He was offered a first team contract by the club in August but an ankle injury he had picked up during the World Cup put the deal in some doubt so he was initially offered a one-month deal, before signing a one-year contract three weeks later in September 2007 on successful completion of his medical. He was released by the club at the end of the 2007–08 season, after which he trained with Bradford City. =Vålerenga= On 31 August 2009 it was announced that Pelter had joined Vålerenga Fotball in Oslo, Norway on loan. Pelter will predominately play for the B team, in the Norwegian Second Division, for the remainder of the season. International career Pelter has represented New Zealand at the Under-17 and Under-20 levels. He made his Under-17 debut, against Tahiti, in 2003. He was part of New Zealand's Under-20 World Cup 2007 squad, of which he was captain. He made his debut against Mexico on 8 July 2007 at the Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton also scored New Zealand's only goal of the tournament in that match, as they failed to progress beyond the group stages. Pelter was part of the New Zealand A team that performed in the quadrangular Agribank Cup Tournament in Hanoi, Vietnam in 2006, with every game being played at the My Dinh Stadium, eventually finishing third in the tournament that also featured Vietnam the hosts, Bahrain under 21 and Thailand. New Zealand A were beaten 1–0 by Vietnam in their first game of the tournament on 25 October 2006, they were again beaten 1–0 by Thailand on 27 October.

Teenage Monster is a 1958 independently made science fiction-horror film. It was produced and directed by Jacques R. Marquette, and stars Anne Gwynne and Stuart Wade. The film had a first screening on December 25, 1957, in Los Angeles. It went into general theatrical release in January 1958, in a double feature with The Brain from Planet Arous; the pairing combined science fiction and western film elements, both of which were very popular in the late 1950s. Plot In a 19th century town in the American Southwest, young Charlie Cannon sees a meteorite crash in the desert. While exploring the crash site, he is exposed to mysterious rays emanating from the meteorite that cause him to begin aging rapidly. His mother, a gold prospector named Ruth, hides him and the town believes him dead. However, in a short time span, he ages ten years, while also becoming a hairy, aggressive, and completely psychopathic man-beast. He sometimes escapes his confinement, and terrorizes the community. After his mother strikes gold, she purchases a house in town in the hopes that living in a real home will soothe her son's inner beast. However, he scares more people and kidnaps a young woman, Kathy. Ruth pays Kathy to keep her silence, but Kathy begins to blackmail Ruth plus manipulate Charlie to kill for her. In the final show-down, Charlie understands Kathy's lies and hurls her off a cliff before being shot and killed himself.

Marquette made the feature because his company needed a cheap film to run as a double bill with The Brain from Planet Arous (1957). Jacques Marquette also helped develop the film's plot and handled some of the cinematography. Jack Pierce handled the make-up effects. Teenage Monster was released by Marquette Productions Limited. The film's working title was Monster on the Hill, but it was theatrically released as Teenage Monster in an attempt to cash in on the success of horror films from other distributors that used the word \\"teenage\\" in their titles. When the film was released to television, the title was changed to Meteor Monster. The film – as Teenage Monster – was refused a United Kingdom rating certificate in 1959. In 1995, the film was finally released in the UK fully uncut and with a PG certificate rating. The film currently holds a low 3.3/10 rating at the Internet Movie Database and a 0% rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.

They were particularly prominent in Melbourne, but were also found in Sydney and Perth to lesser extents. Sharpies were known for being violent, although a strict moral code was also evident. The name comes from their focus on looking and dressing \\"sharp\\". Sharpie culture Sharpies would often congregate in large numbers, regularly attending live bands at town hall and high school dances Common clothing items included Lee or Levi jeans, cardigans, jumpers, and T-shirts—often individually designed by group members. Mods were an enemy of sharpies, and their gang brawls were reported in the newspapers during 1966. In a 2002 interview, a former sharpie stated that despite the sharpie culture being quite violent – especially as they crossed other gangs' territories on the public transport network – the altercations were restricted to inter-gang rivalries. Sharpies were particularly fond of Australian pub rock and hard rock groups such as Rose Tattoo, Lobby Lloyde and the Coloured Balls and Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs.Blackman, Guy (7 August 2015). \\"When Sharpies ruled: CD celebrates a homegrown sound of the '70s\\", The Sydney Morning Herald.

Lewis E. Coley in command; decommissioned on 14 May 1946, at New York; transferred to the U.S. Army Transportation Service in May 1946; commissioned USAT General Maurice Rose on 1 August 1946; reacquired by the U.S. Navy and assigned to the Military Sea Transport Service (MSTS); placed in service as USNS General Maurice Rose (T-AP-126) on 1 March 1950. World War II Pacific Theatre operations Assigned to the United States Pacific Fleet, the transport departed San Francisco, on 21 July 1945 for a shakedown cruise which took her to San Diego and Los Angeles. She returned to her home port on 16 August - two days after hostilities with Japan ended — and embarked fresh troops to replace war-weary veterans in the Far East. She transited the Golden Gate on 21 August and proceeded via Ulithi to the Philippines. Following stops at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, and Batangas and Manila, Luzon, she headed home and reached San Francisco early in October. Then, following a second round-trip voyage to the Philippines, she again got underway from San Francisco in December and set course for Nagoya, Japan. This shuttle run ended at Los Angeles on 3 January 1946. Another voyage to Yokohama took her back to Seattle, Washington. Early in March, she sailed from that port with occupation troops and delivered them to Okinawa. Transferred to the US Army From that island in the Ryukyu Islands, the ship sailed, via the Panama Canal, for the east coast of the United States. She reached New York on 14 May, was decommissioned on that day, and was transferred to the War Department later that month. The ship entered the Bethlehem New York yard at 56th Street on 3 June to receive the repairs and modifications she would require upon assuming a slightly different role. She got underway again on 1 August and served the U.S. Army Transport Service as General Maurice Rose until she and her sister U.S. Army transports were transferred to the U.S. Navy on 1 March 1950 to serve in the recently established Military Sea Transportation Service. Transferred to the US Navy She was given the classification T-AP-126 at that time. Manned by a civilian crew, General Maurice Rose operated out of New York in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean during the next 15 years. Transporting Soldiers and Refugees Steaming primarily between New York and Bremerhaven, Germany, she completed more than 150 round-trip voyages while carrying military dependents and European refugees and rotating combat-ready troops. In addition, the ship deployed to the Mediterranean 17 times to support U.S. 6th Fleet operations. Following the gallant, but abortive, Hungarian revolution in October 1956, she completed three runs to Bremerhaven and back between 12 January and 27 March 1957 transporting Hungarian refugees to the United States. On three occasions between 1 April and 5 October, General Maurice Rose was dispatched to the eastern Mediterranean to support units of the U.S. 6th Fleet responding to political crises in Jordan. The ship was still transporting troops between New York and Bremerhaven in June 1959. Vietnam operations In 1965, however, America's increased involvement in the war in South Vietnam beckoned the transport toward a new theater of operations. After completing nine voyages to Bremerhaven and back between 16 January and 4 August 1965, General Maurice Rose departed New York on 14 August for transport duty to Southeast Asia. She sailed via Long Beach, and Pearl Harbor to Qui Nhon, South Vietnam, where she arrived on 14 September and began debarking troops and supplies. After departing Vietnam on the 19th, she steamed via Okinawa and the U.S. West Coast and reached New York on 18 October. During the first eight months of 1966, she made eight round-trip runs to Europe and back. On 8 September, she again departed New York for troop lift duty to South Vietnam. She operated in the western Pacific supporting US forces in Southeast Asia through the end of 1966. She returned to New York late in January 1967 for an overhaul and was placed in ready reserve status. As such she was laid up at the Cavin Point Army Depot in New York harbor. The ship was transferred to the permanent custody of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) on 30 June 1970 and shifted to the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River, Fort Eustis, Virginia. She was struck from the Naval Register, 20 August 1990 and sold by the Maritime Administration in June 1997 for scrapping at Brownsville, Texas.

A biweekly email newsletter, Financial Engineering Today was also published. In 1996, Financial Engineering News was established by Dr. Jim Clark. It was published by Stonebridge Center Publishers' in Issaquah, WA, through 2000. FEN was acquired in 2001 by Jim Finnegan, CFA, and was owned by Cusp Communications Group. Under the ownership of the Cusp Communications Group, FEN expanded from an eight-page tabloid format to a bimonthly magazine averaging 54 pages per issue. Circulation was quadrupled and its website traffic increased tenfold. Financial Engineering News was a newspaper devoted to reporting on the news, events, people, significant innovations, debates, and issues in the field of quantitative finance; as it applies to the real-world of investment management, insurance, investment banking, commercial banking, financial regulation, and corporate finance. It was published between the years of 1996 and 2007. By 2007 global circulation was approximately 18,000 for the print/digital magazine and 25,000 for the weekly e-mail newsletter Financial Engineering Today (or FET).  Readership  The readership included a high proportion of professionals who had earned or were in the process of earning the CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst), FRM (Global Association of Risk Professionals), and PRM (Professional Risk Managers International Association) and Society of Actuaries (SOA) accreditations, and readers who worked for commercial enterprises in the areas of risk management, asset management, financial analysis, trading (stock/bond/commodities/derivatives), corporate finance, and financial product development. FEN was an independent publication with no affiliation to any professional association. The readers were financial professionals with undergraduate and often master's degrees (typically an MBA or MS in Finance). They were not exclusively Ph.D.’s in their field: it was written for financial professionals and managers who relied upon the techniques and concepts of quantitative finance in their professional careers, have a background in this area, but were looking for commercially relevant and accessible ideas, tools, news, insights, techniques and concepts that could be put to use in their jobs without the theoretical math.  Suspension of publication  In January 2007, the publisher of FEN (Cusp Communications Group) announced publication would be suspended after the Jan/Feb 2007 issue.FEN: notice of suspended publication The publication was shut down due to the general decline in print advertising which affected all print publications.

Tallgrass aspen parkland/prairie grasslands in yellow, eastern deciduous forest in olive green, and the northern coniferous forest in dark green. The natural history of Minnesota covers many plant and animal species in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The continental climate and location of Minnesota at the physiographic intersection of the Laurentian and the Interior Plains influences its plant and animal life. Three of North America's biomes converge in Minnesota: prairie grasslands in the southwestern and western parts of the state, the eastern temperate deciduous forests in the east-central and the southeast and the coniferous forest in the north-central and northeast. Ecoregions An ecoregion is an area uniquely defined by environmental conditions and natural features. Ecoregions in Minnesota were largely influenced by the unique glacial history, geology, soil type, land use, and climate of the state. The United States Environmental Protection Agency, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, and World Wildlife Fund maintain separate classifications of the state's ecoregions. Although different, they generally agree on delineating between the coniferous forest in the north-central portion and the Arrowhead, a temperate deciduous forest in the central and southeast, and the tallgrass prairie in the southern and western portions of the state. The northern coniferous forests are a vast wilderness of pine and spruce trees mixed with patchy stands of birch and poplar. Flora Dwarf trout lily Much of Minnesota's northern forest has been logged, leaving only a few patches of old-growth forest today in areas such as in the Chippewa National Forest and the Superior National Forest where the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness has some of unlogged land. Although logging continues, regrowth keeps about one third of the state forested. Flora listed as threatened on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species include the Prairie bush-clover (Lespedeza leptostachya), the Western Prairie Fringed Orchid (Platanthera praeclara), and Leedy's roseroot (Rhodiola integrifolia ssp. leedyi).

The station is simulcast on 99.7 WBHX Tuckerton, New Jersey. History = 1960–1996 = WWYZ first went on the air on June 1, 1960 as WRLB \\"Radio Long Branch\\". At the time, the station's owner was afforded the possibility of broadcasting with 50,000 watts, but he declined, thinking that FM radio had limited potential. Therefore, the station signed on with 3,000 watts from a tower located in Long Branch, New Jersey. The studios were located adjacent to the tower. WWZY still uses the tower site, although the studios are now in Neptune, New Jersey. When the Long Branch 107.1 did not utilize 50,000 watts, the Federal Communications Commission subsequently assigned 107.1s to Briarcliff Manor, New York (north of New York City); Belvidere, New Jersey (near Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania); and Hampton Bays, New York (Long Island). These area 107.1s would later haunt the Long Branch allocation with interference in fringe areas. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, WRLB was a \\"full-service\\" station, broadcasting big-band music, high school sports and local news. An Italian program aired on Sunday. Competition was mainly from the Asbury Park Press' radio station, WJLK-AM-FM, which aired similar full-service programming. In 1968, WRLB revamped its programming continuing with adult \\"middle of the road\\" music from 6 a.m. until midnight when it switched to rock/top40 music hosted and pioneered by Charlie Roberts who was the first disk jockey in New Jersey to play rock on a commercial FM radio station; the program was called The Subway (an homage to Dick Summer at WBZ in Boston who was Charlie's mentor when he was at Boston University). His first song selection was \\"Road Runner\\" by Junior Walker and the All Stars. On occasion, he would have live in-studio guests including the progressive rock band Vanilla Fudge. His weather guy/sidekick was \\"Tommy Metro\\" who was also the station's chief engineer, Tom Tcimpidis. In 1981, WRLB was sold to Monmouth Broadcasting and became contemporary hit radio, WWUU (known on-air as \\"U 107\\"). The station was programmed as contemporary hit radio, but without a strong local presence due to automation. The station was sold again to Jonathan and Elizabeth Hoffman (under the similar name \\"Mammoth Broadcasting\\"), and in 1982 became WMJY (Y-107), featuring live local talent playing the hits. Liners for the rechristened station highlighted the station's local presence by touting \\"The New Live Y-107\\". Radio personality Sean \\"Hollywood\\" Hamilton spent a short time doing afternoon drive at Y-107 in early 1982 before moving onto WKTU in New York City. At first, Y-107 maintained You 107's CHR format, but within a few years, Y-107 was a rock station, using the slogan \\"Rock Hits Home\\", with special programming on Sundays spotlighting new-age music, blues, psychedelic music, and The Beatles. Disc jockeys at Y-107 in its rock days included John Ford, Linda Jordan, T.J. Brustowicz, Bobbi Stewart, Garrick Hart, Willobee (now Program Director/Operations Manager & afternoon host at KVNV - NV89 in Reno, Nevada), Lauren Pressley, Jason Watt and Thom Morrera. Ian Case hosted a morning show that combined music and comedy bits. Newscasters included Doug Doyle, Rhonda Schaffler (later of CNN) and Matt Ward. In late 1988, Mammoth sold WMJY to K&K; Broadcasting. At the time of its purchase, K&K; operated two radio stations in Erie, Pennsylvania. Word had gotten out that a format change was in the works. On January 19, 1989, mention had been made on the air of a rally to be held the following afternoon at the station's studios in downtown Long Branch to save Y-107's rock format. In the early morning hours of January 20, 1989, K&K; sent a security guard to remove overnight announcer T.J. Brustowicz from the premises and padlock the doors. The entire staff was fired (many reading of their job loss in the paper that morning), though some announcers and support personnel were eventually hired back. K&K; then temporarily instituted a satellite-driven hard rock format called \\"Z-Rock.\\" Many of WMJY's listeners objected to the firing of the local DJs and the hard-rock format, and petitioned K&K; to change it back to classic rock. The new owners refused. In May 1989, WMJY changed to a local, soft-adult contemporary format called \\"SeaView 107 FM.\\" The new format featured soft-rock artists with a heavy dose of 1960s and 1970s oldies. Call letters changed to WZVU in June 1989. WZVU \\"SeaView 107\\" was a ratings success in the Monmouth-Ocean ratings, beating longtime rival WJLK-FM within the first year. The station began to lean heavily on oldies, first featuring \\"all-oldies weekends.\\" Unfortunately, WZVU's corporate parent, K&K; Broadcasting began to encounter financial problems. In 1992, all of the local DJs were terminated, and the station switched to a satellite-delivered oldies format. Curiously, this was the same satellite format that was aired on WJLK/1310 in Asbury Park. By this time, the Asbury Park Press had sold WJLK-AM-FM to D&F; Broadcasting. In early 1994, GM Jim Davis (former Drake jock \\"Big Bob\\" Evans on WOR-FM) launched Oldies 107.1. Bob Steele was the second program director. Airstaff included Rocky D, Jersey Judi Franco, Big Joe Henry, Tommy Dean, Bobby Ryan, Captain Jack Aponte, Mark Lee and Ed Healy. Innovative specialty shows were on weekends such as All Request Radio and the Sunday Night Train with Tommy Dean and Bobby Ryan. = 1996–2003 = In mid-1996 the station was sold to Big City Radio. On December 7, 1996, the station became part of the Big City Radio trimulcast (and eventual quadcast) with other 107.1 stations, WRGX in Briarcliff Manor, New York and WWHB Hampton Bays, New York. WZVU and the other two multicast stations switched formats to country, ironically known as \\"New Country Y-107.\\" Call letters of the Long Branch station were changed to WWZY. Later, WRNJ-FM the 107.1 in Belvidere, New Jersey was added to make Y-107 a four-station \\"quadcast.\\" On May 7, 2002, the \\"Y-107\\" quadcast ended the country format, and after a day of stunting with construction sounds, the quadcast flipped to a tropical music format as \\"Rumba 107\\". The format was ill-suited to the quadcast suburban signals, so the WWZY transmitter was moved to a tower in the Belford section of Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in an attempt to improve its coverage of New York City. At the end of the year, Big City Radio filed for bankruptcy and sold the quadcast to Nassau Broadcasting, who broke up the quadcast and sold the individual stations.

The character first appeared in a serial written by Fernandez entitled Aztec. From 1976 to 1985, Zuma got his own series named Anak ni Zuma that was serialized in Aliwan Komiks published by Graphics Arts Service Inc. with illustration by Ben Maniclang. The comics series was the biggest best seller for Aliwan. Following this publication success, spin-offs and a 1990s reboot about the character were published and it was further expanded in other media including film and television. Publication history In 1974, Filipino comics book artist Jim Fernandez created Zuma, which first appeared in the comics serial Aztec. After two years, in 1976, Fernandez wrote a new series for the character entitled Anak ni Zuma that was serialized in Aliwan Komiks published by Graphics Arts Service Inc. (GASI) with illustration by Ben Maniclang. The series ran in syndication until 1985 that became Aliwan's biggest bestseller. Due to its publication success, the comics serial branched out to a prequel spin-off entitled Angkan ni Zuma, which tells the story of Zuma during the ancient period. This prequel was written again by Fernandez and illustrated by Mar T. Santana; and ran from 1978 to 1983. A science fiction comics entitled Zuma-Maria was another spin-off that divulges on the future descendant of Zuma. Dugong Aztec was also a spin-off that was simultaneously published with the main comics serial. It was published in Rex Komiks by Rex Publications Inc. from 1978 to 1979 and it was still written by Fernandez with illustration by Elmer Esquivas. There was also a comics reboot in the 1990s published under the short-lived magazine entitled Zuma Komiks by GASI. The stories in this comics magazine that was also known by other two names (Zuma and Other Amazing Stories and Zuma and Other Horror Stories) were written by various writers with illustration by Clem V. Rivera in its early run and then by Vic Catan Jr in later issues. The comics magazine is an anthology of horror. Character background Mesoamerican serpent deity Kukulkan at El Castillo, Chichen Itza. Kukulkan is depicted as the father of Zuma in the comics story line. The most noticeable physical characteristic of Zuma is the two-headed snake that protrude from his shoulders resting like a lei and he uses them to defeat his enemies as they have a powerful bite that has an ability to decapitate. In addition, he has green skin and bald hair similar to Martian Manhunter, another comics character. Although, his face is human-like with a demonic appearance. He is often depicted as a villain or an anti-hero instead of a superhero. According to Zuma's story in the comics and other media, he is the son of the Aztec serpent god Kukulkan, making him a demigod. He had been in hibernation for a long time until his tomb in an Aztec pyramid was unearthed by an archaeological expedition team that awakened him. After his revival, he goes to the modern world in a killing rage, slaughtering particularly virgin women, whose hearts are ripped out and consumed that give Zuma his strength and vigor. Aside from using his two-headed snake as a weapon, Zuma's power includes invulnerability (specifically bullet-proof) and controlling snakes. In later versions, Zuma has the ability to heal people. His weakness is the venom from his daughter Galema who is also his archenemy. Galema's mother is a human that Zuma has taken as his bride. Although, Galema grew with foster parents that made her to be a good person. Zuma also beget another child named Dino who has a head of a dinosaur and a body of a human. Dino initially allied with his father but he later abandoned him because Dino fell in love with a human. In other media =Film= Zuma have been adapted into two films. The first one was from a 1985 film by Cine Suerte Inc. entitled Zuma, with Max Laurel portraying the title role and Snooky Serna playing Zuma's daughter, Galema. This film that was directed by Jun Raquiza is also known as Jim Fernandez's Zuma. The second Zuma film is a sequel entitled Anak ni Zuma, which also known alternatively as Zuma II: Hell Serpent. Max Laurel reprised his role as Zuma while the role of Galema got a recast and was played by Jenny Lyn. It was released again by Cine Suerte Inc. in 1987 and was directed by Ben Yalung. =Television= Zuma appeared in the 2013 television series Galema: Anak ni Zuma. Derick Hubalde, son of Filipino basketball player Freddie Hubalde, played Zuma while Andi Eigenmann portrayed Galema. The television series is broadcast in ABS-CBN and the story focuses more on the hardship of Galema as she lives her cursed life that was passed down from her father, Zuma.

It used the call sign Air Force One when the President was on board, and at other times it used the call sign SAM 27000 (spoken as 'SAM two-seven-thousand'), with SAM indicating 'Special Air Mission.' The VC-137C serial number 72-7000 was a customized version of the Boeing 707 which entered service during the Nixon administration in 1972. It served all US presidents until George W. Bush and was retired in 2001. It is now on display at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Operational history The plane first entered service in 1972 during the administration of Richard Nixon. SAM 27000 replaced the aging SAM 26000 as the primary means of presidential travel, although SAM 26000 remained as a back-up plane. SAM 27000 served seven presidents in its twenty-nine years of service: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. In 1990, it was replaced as the primary presidential plane by two Boeing VC-25 jumbo jets — SAM 28000 and SAM 29000. =Nixon and Ford= The Fords in the President's forward cabin on SAM 27000 Nixon was the first president to use this Air Force One, dubbing it and its sister plane, SAM 26000, the \\"Spirit of '76\\", having that phrase painted on the nose of the two aircraft, although later removed by President Carter. Although SAM 27000 replaced SAM 26000 as Nixon's primary mode of aerial transportation, he chose to ride SAM 26000 when his family flew with him. Nixon garnered much attention for his frequent flying aboard Air Force One, usually flying to his homes in California and Florida, but also made many trips abroad, such as his trip to China in 1972. Top presidential aides and cabinet secretaries used the plane as well, including Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. When President Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974, he flew to his home in Orange County, California aboard SAM 27000. While flying over Missouri en route to their destination, Colonel Ralph Albertazzie, the pilot, contacted Kansas City Center and had the aircraft's call sign changed from Air Force One to SAM 27000 due to Gerald Ford being sworn in. Gerald Ford used SAM 27000 somewhat frequently, especially for his trips abroad, such as his meeting with Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev in Vladivostok in 1974. After experiencing two assassination attempts, Ford returned to the plane to hear his wife Betty quip \\"Well, how did they treat you in San Francisco?\\" During the Ford years, there was a growing number of airline hijackings and the threat of terrorism expanded, so both SAM 27000 and 26000 were equipped with defense systems to detect heat-seeking missiles. It was President Ford who first decided that the name of the aircraft itself should be Air Force One, along with the call sign. =Carter and Reagan= Ronald and Nancy Reagan wave from Air Force One (SAM 27000) as they prepare to descend the stairs upon the plane's landing in Moscow, Russia, 1988 Jimmy Carter made some changes to Air Force One that reflected his personal values. Carter preferred a simpler style of living, something he made apparent on SAM 27000; he even insisted that he and his family carry their own luggage aboard. Carter made regular use of the plane both for domestic use and for use abroad. In 1980, after the American Hockey Team defeated the Soviet Team, Carter sent SAM 27000 to pick up the team and bring them back to Washington, D.C. for a congratulatory ceremony. Carter's last trip aboard 27000 was actually taken as a former president, when Ronald Reagan sent Carter to Germany on behalf of the American people, to welcome home the 52 American hostages that were held captive in Iran. Ronald Reagan works aboard SAM 27000 in 1986 Ronald Reagan was SAM 27000's most frequent flyer, flying longer and farther than all the other presidents who flew on it, traveling more than 675,000 miles aboard it. Reagan used Air Force One to travel to all parts of the world to pursue his ambitious diplomatic goals, taking three trips to Asia, six to Europe, and twelve trips to foreign places in the Western Hemisphere. Reagan flew to three of his four summit meetings with Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev aboard SAM 27000: Geneva, Reykjavík, and Moscow (one was held in Washington, D.C.). While traveling on SAM 27000, Reagan spent most of his time in his forward cabin, but occasionally made visits to senior staff lounge for meetings with his aides. Reagan seldom slept on the plane, even on long journeys. First Lady Nancy Reagan was also enthusiastic about Air Force One, recalling the first time she flew on the plane, \\"Ronnie read reports and attended to paperwork, while I kept busy writing letters to friends back home on Air Force One letterhead. Look at me, I'm flying on Air Force One!\\" The Reagans' last flight aboard the plane was on January 20, 1989, when the now-former President and First Lady flew back to California. =Missions after replacement= George W. Bush and Laura Bush arrive in Waco, Texas after the completion of the last Presidential voyage of SAM 27000, August 2001 Reagan Library George H.W. Bush was the last president to use SAM 27000 as the primary means of presidential travel, for in 1990 the plane was replaced by two Boeing 747-200B jumbo jets, designated VC-25, although SAM 27000 was kept as a backup plane for Bush during the remainder of his presidency, as well as those of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Former President Richard Nixon died on April 22, 1994, in New York City. SAM 27000 brought his body to the Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in Orange County, California, four days later. His body was then taken to the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace (now Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum) to lie in state before a funeral service and burial. Its last Presidential voyage was August 29, 2001, when it delivered George W. Bush and Laura Bush to TSTC Waco Airport en route to their Prairie Chapel Ranch.Air Force One Retires =Reagan Library= SAM 27000 was decommissioned and flown to San Bernardino International Airport (formerly Norton Air Force Base) in September 2001, where it was presented to the Reagan Foundation. In what was known as Operation Homeward Bound, Boeing, the plane's manufacturer, disassembled the plane and transported it to the library in pieces. After the construction of the foundation of the pavilion itself, the plane was reassembled and restored to museum quality, as well as raised onto pedestals above ground. The pavilion was dedicated on October 24, 2005, by Nancy Reagan, President George W. Bush, and First Lady Laura Bush.

A VC-137C with Air Force serial number 62-6000, SAM 26000 was a customized Boeing 707. It entered service in 1962 during the administration of John F. Kennedy and was replaced in Presidential service in 1972 but kept as a backup. The aircraft was finally retired in 1998 and is now on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio. The aircraft was built at Boeing's Renton plant at a cost of $8 million. Raymond Loewy, working with President Kennedy, designed the blue and white color scheme featuring the presidential seal that is still used today. The plane served as the primary means of transportation for three presidents: Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard Nixon during his first term. In 1972, during the Nixon administration, the plane was replaced by another 707, SAM 27000, although SAM 26000 was kept as a back-up plane until 1998. John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson The most famous photo ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft was taken aboard SAM 26000. Hours after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson is sworn in just before take off for Washington. John F. Kennedy was the first president to use SAM 26000. Kennedy first flew on the aircraft on November 10, 1962, to attend the funeral services of former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt in Hyde Park, New York. SAM 26000 took Kennedy to Berlin (\\"Ich bin ein Berliner\\") in June 1963; the month before that, it set a new Washington-Moscow time record. It was designer Raymond Loewy who, at the invitation of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, gave SAM 26000 the now-familiar Air Force One livery of blue, silver, and white. On November 22, 1963, after landing the President and First Lady at Dallas' Love Field, SAM 26000 was the backdrop to live broadcasts of the Kennedys greeting well-wishers. Later that day, after Kennedy's assassination made Vice President Lyndon Johnson the new president, SAM 26000 carried the Johnson, Jacqueline Kennedy, and Kennedy's body back to Washington. To accommodate the casket four seats were removed from the passenger compartment; Johnson took the Oath of Office (see photo) aboard SAM 26000 before takeoff. The casket was on board because Mrs. Kennedy refused to leave her husband's body and under no circumstances, would Johnson leave without her. As Kennedy was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery, SAM 26000 flew overhead, following 50 fighter jets (20 Navy and 30 Air Force). Johnson was SAM 26000's most frequent flyer, logging some 523,000 miles during his five years as president; he once called it \\"my own little plane.\\" New seats were installed, now facing rearward toward the presidential cabin, in which was installed a spacious leather chair (dubbed \\"the throne\\") and a crescent-shaped table which the president could raise and lower by means of a switch. Aides and guests sat on couches around \\"the throne.\\" Johnson flew in SAM 26000 twice to Vietnam and took tours of Asia in 1968 and 1969. In 1967, Johnson went on a largely unplanned aerial odyssey, making stops in California, Hawaii, Australia, Thailand, South Vietnam, Pakistan, and Italy. Richard M. Nixon President Richard Nixon and First Lady Pat Nixon disembark SAM 26000 after landing in the People's Republic of China, 1972 Upon the inauguration of Richard Nixon in 1969, SAM 26000 underwent repairs and upgrades. Nixon and his staff were offered a key role in the redesigning of the plane, a position they took up, and indeed, the finished plane reflected the new president's persona. The interior of the plane was stripped from the nose to the tail; all minor problems were taken care of; upgrades were made on the flight management system; communications gear was slightly modified. Richard Nixon had the interior of the plane redesigned to suit his fancy. Nixon did away with the open floor plan of the Johnson era and replaced it with a three-room suite for himself and his family, serving as a combination of lounge, office, and bedrooms. Accommodations for guests, aides, security and media personnel were located aft of the three rooms. Although SAM 27000 took over as the primary presidential aircraft in 1972, Nixon's family preferred SAM 26000 because its interior configuration allowed greater privacy for the First Family. Nixon also had the name \\"The Spirit of '76\\" applied to the nose of both VC-137Cs. The Nixons flew on SAM 26000 to China in 1972, becoming the first American President and First Lady to visit that nation. SAM 26000 was also used by National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger during his secret meetings with the French to negotiate the Vietnam peace process. In December 1972, SAM 27000 took over as the primary presidential plane. Missions after replacement The cockpit of the aircraftOn January 22, 1973, Lyndon B. Johnson died. Two days later, SAM 26000 brought the former president's body from Texas to Washington, D.C., for the state funeral the following day. After the funeral, over which Nixon himself presided, the aircraft returned his body to Texas for burial, landing at Bergstrom Air Force Base in Austin, the airfield Johnson flew into and out of when president. As the former president was interred at his ranch, retired Brigadier General James U. Cross, pilot of SAM 26000 during part of the Johnson presidency, presented the flag to Lady Bird Johnson at her request. He also escorted her during the state funeral, again, at her request, saying that she did not know Army Major General James Adamson, then commanding general of the Military District of Washington (MDW). Most of this resulted from Mrs. Johnson agreeing to the public honors in Washington, though her husband died in Texas, because she felt so many others from around the world wanted to join in--40,000 people paid their respects when the former president lay in state, even though the mood during the state funeral was one of intense recrimination because the wounds of the Vietnam War were still raw. Because of SAM 26000, the final services honoring LBJ on January 25 were completed in one day, despite taking place in different parts of the country. On October 6, 1981, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was assassinated. Because of security concerns, then-President Ronald Reagan did not attend the funeral. Instead, he sent Secretary of State Alexander Haig and the living former presidents-- Nixon, Ford, and Carter--to the funeral, as well as former secretary of state Henry Kissinger. All of them flew aboard SAM 26000 when traveling to the funeral. The last time SAM 26000 carried a serving president was in January 1998 when President Bill Clinton's Air Force One, SAM 27000, got stuck in the mud in Champaign, Illinois, at University of Illinois Willard Airport. SAM 26000 was sitting at Grissom Air Reserve Base in Peru, Indiana, to serve as the backup Air Force One. SAM 26000 was quickly dispatched to Champaign to pick up President Clinton, who then flew to La Crosse, Wisconsin, for an event and then flew the final presidential service flight from La Crosse to Washington, D.C., where SAM 26000 was then officially retired from the president's fleet. Current status SAM 26000 at the USAF Museum, June, 2003.In May 1998, SAM 26000 was flown to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB near Dayton, Ohio. Its final flight was staged over the museum grounds for the benefit of the media and Museum visitors. The aircraft circled the museum several times at low altitude before finally landing on the original Wright Field airstrip alongside the museum. The plane taxied to the museum's restoration hangars and the crew disembarked, while members of the press explored the aircraft. After several months of work by the museum's restoration staff, the aircraft was placed on permanent display in the museum's Presidential Hangar. The public can walk through the aircraft; while the original intent (according to museum personnel) was to restore the aircraft to how it looked when Kennedy was President, it was later determined to leave the aircraft interior as it looked when it was delivered to the U.S. Air Force Museum in May, 1998.Archives of the National Museum of the United States Air Force In December 2009, SAM 26000 was taken off display and moved to the museum's restoration area, where it would be repainted into its Presidential paint scheme. SAM 26000 was later returned to the Presidential Planes Hangar at the museum.

Grid-tie inverters are used between local electrical power generators: solar panel, wind turbine, hydro- electric, and the grid.http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/463622-TtEMSp/webviewable/463622.pdf OSTI To inject electrical power efficiently and safely into the grid, grid-tie inverters must accurately match the voltage and phase of the grid sine wave AC waveform. Some electricity companies pay for electrical power that is injected into the grid. Payment for injected power Electricity companies, in some countries, pay for electrical power that is injected into the electricity utility grid. Payment is arranged in several ways. With net metering the electricity company pays for the net power injected into the grid, as recorded by a meter in the customer's premises. For example, a customer may consume 400 kilowatt-hours over a month and may return 500 kilowatt-hours to the grid in the same month. In this case the electricity company would pay for the 100 kilowatt hours balance of power fed back into the grid. In the US, net metering policies vary by jurisdiction. Feed-in tariff, based on a contract with a distribution company or other power authority, is where the customer is paid for electrical power injected into the grid. In the United States, grid- interactive power systems are specified in the National Electric Code, which also mandates requirements for grid-interactive inverters. Operation Grid- tie inverters convert DC electrical power into AC power suitable for injecting into the electric utility company grid. The grid tie inverter (GTI) must match the phase of the grid and maintain the output voltage slightly higher than the grid voltage at any instant. A high-quality modern grid-tie inverter has a fixed unity power factor, which means its output voltage and current are perfectly lined up, and its phase angle is within 1 degree of the AC power grid. The inverter has an on-board computer that senses the current AC grid waveform, and outputs a voltage to correspond with the grid. However, supplying reactive power to the grid might be necessary to keep the voltage in the local grid inside allowed limitations. Otherwise, in a grid segment with considerable power from renewable sources, voltage levels might rise too much at times of high production, i.e. around noon with solar panels. Grid-tie inverters are also designed to quickly disconnect from the grid if the utility grid goes down. This is an NEC requirementNEC Handbook 2005, Section 705, \\"Interconnected Electric Power Production Sources,\\" Article 705.40 \\"Loss of Primary Source\\" that ensures that in the event of a blackout, the grid tie inverter shuts down to prevent the energy it transfers from harming any line workers who are sent to fix the power grid. Properly configured, a grid tie inverter enables a home owner to use an alternative power generation system like solar or wind power without extensive rewiring and without batteries. If the alternative power being produced is insufficient, the deficit is sourced from the electricity grid. Types Inside an SWEA 250 W transformer-coupled grid-tie inverter Grid-tie inverters include conventional low-frequency types with transformer coupling, newer high-frequency types, also with transformer coupling, and transformerless types. Instead of converting direct current directly into AC suitable for the grid, high-frequency transformers types use a computer process to convert the power to a high-frequency and then back to DC and then to the final AC output voltage suitable for the grid.Solar Energy International (2006). Photovoltaics: Design and Installation Manual, Gabriola Island, BC: New Society Publishers, p. 80. Transformerless inverters, which are popular in Europe, are lighter, smaller, and more efficient than inverters with transformers. But transformerless inverters have been slow to enter the US market because of concerns that transformerless inverters, which do not have galvanic isolation between the DC side and grid, could inject dangerous DC voltages and currents into the grid under fault conditions. However, since 2005, the NFPA's NEC allows transformerless, or non-galvanically isolated, inverters by removing the requirement that all solar electric systems be negative grounded and specifying new safety requirements. Amendments to VDE 0126-1-1 and IEC 6210 define the design and procedures needed for such systems: primarily, ground current measurement and DC to grid isolation tests. Datasheets Manufacturers datasheets for their inverters usually include the following data: * Rated output power: This value is provided in watts or kilowatts. For some inverters, they may provide an output rating for different output voltages. For instance, if the inverter can be configured for either 240 VAC or 208 VAC output, the rated power output may be different for each of those configurations. * Output voltage(s): This value indicates the utility voltages the inverter can connect to. For smaller inverters for residential use, the output voltage is usually 240 VAC. Inverters that target commercial applications are available for 208, 240, 277, 400, 480 or 600 VAC and may also produce three phase power. * Peak efficiency: The peak efficiency represents the highest efficiency that the inverter can achieve. Most grid-tie inverters on the market as of July 2009 have peak efficiencies of over 94%, some as high as 96%. The energy lost during inversion is for the most part converted into heat. Consequently, for an inverter to output its rated power it must have a power input that exceeds its output. For example, a 5000 W inverter operating at full power at 95% efficiency requires an input of 5,263 W (rated power divided by efficiency). Inverters that are capable of producing power at different AC voltages may have different efficiencies associated with each voltage. * CEC weighted efficiency: This efficiency is published by the California Energy Commission on its GoSolar website. In contrast to peak efficiency, this value is an average efficiency and is a better representation of the inverter's operating profile. Inverters that are capable of producing power at different AC voltages may have different efficiencies associated with each voltage.gosolarcalifornia.org, \\"List of Eligible Inverters\\" , accessed July 30, 2009, * Maximum input current: This is the maximum amount of direct current that the inverter can use. If a system, solar cells for example, produces a current in excess of the maximum input current, that current is not used by the inverter. * Maximum output current: The maximum output current is the maximum continuous alternating current that the inverter can supply. This value is typically used to determine the minimum current rating of the over- current protection devices (e.g., breakers and fuses) and disconnects required for the output circuit. Inverters that can produce power at different AC voltages have different maximum outputs for each voltage. * Peak power tracking voltage: This represents the DC voltage range in which the inverter's maximum point power tracker operates. The system designer must configure the strings optimally so that during the majority of the year, the voltage of the strings are within this range. This can be a difficult task since voltage fluctuates with temperature changes. * Start voltage: This value is not listed on all inverter datasheets. The value indicates the minimum DC voltage required for the inverter to turn on and operate. This is especially important for solar applications, because the system designer must be sure that there is a sufficient number of solar modules wired in series in each string to produce this voltage. If this value is not provided by the manufacturer, system designers typically use the lower band of the peak power tracking voltage range as the inverter's minimum voltage. * IPxx rating: The Ingress Protection rating or IP Code classifies and rates the level of protection provided against the ingress of solid foreign objects (first digit) or water (second digit), a higher digit means greater protection. In the US the NEMA enclosure type is used similarly to the international rating. Most inverters are rated for outdoors installation with IP45 (no dust protection) or IP65 (dust tight), or in the US, NEMA 3R (no windblown dust protection) or NEMA 4X (windblown dust, direct water splash and additional corrosion protection). * Certifications/Compliance: Certifications required by electric utilities and local electric codes for grid tie approval such as UL 1741 and emerging standard UL 1741SA See also * Grid-tied electrical system * Inverter (electrical) * Islanding * Solar inverter * Stand-alone inverter References and further reading External links * California List of Eligible Inverters - This is the official California Energy Commission (CEC) list of inverters that are eligible for California's rebate program.

Personal life Fleishman was born in Santa Monica, and attended UCLA for one year before turning pro. He is currently the Chief Operating Officer at Shark Wheel, a company that reinvented the wheel into a sine wave-shaped design. Tennis career Fleishman began playing tennis at the age of 8. At the age of 18, he played one season (1998–99) of collegiate tennis at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), at the No. 2 position. That year Fleishman helped UCLA to the No. 1 ranking in the country, and to the final of the National Collegiate Athletics Association championships. In the ITF junior world rankings, he reached No. 18 in singles in 1998. After one year of competing on the collegiate level, Fleishman opted to turn professional in 2000. He has won seven professional singles titles (and numerous doubles titles) in his career, starting with back-to-back satellite wins in El Salvador on hard court, followed by a win in Honduras on red clay. Fleishman then won back-to-back titles again, this time in his native California, winning two futures events in Redding and Chico (he also won the doubles title). Later, he was able to establish himself on the challenger circuit, winning a US$25,000 event in Ecuador on red clay and then a US$50,000 event in Vietnam on hard court. This propelled his ranking to 11th in the United States and World # 127. In 2008, Zack added another professional tournament victory to his resume winning the Costa Mesa Tennis Futures. In his career Fleishman notably defeated Fernando González, David Nalbandian, Vince Spadea, Agustín Calleri, Mardy Fish, Robby Ginepri, Daniel Nestor, Tomáš Berdych, Kei Nishikori, Kevin Anderson, Santiago Giraldo, Yen-Hsun Lu, Denis Istomin, Nicolas Mahut, and Joachim Johansson. =2006= In 2006, Fleishman qualified for his first Grand Slam event: the Australian Open. He won three qualifying matches and then drew World No. 85 Dick Norman of Belgium. Fleishman rallied from two sets down to force a fifth set. However, Fleishman was unable to capitalize on his momentum, and lost the fifth set and the match. =2007= In 2007, Fleishman again qualified for the Australian Open. This time, he defeated World # 26 Agustín Calleri of Argentina in the first round, before falling to Australian Wayne Arthurs in the second round. The same year, Fleishman won three matches and qualified at Wimbledon, where he faced World No. 10 Tommy Haas. On July 17, 2007, Fleishman achieved his first victory over a top-ten player, defeating World # 6 Fernando González 7–6 (5), 6–4, in the first round of the Los Angeles Tennis Center's Countrywide Classic. He proceeded to beat fellow American Robert Kendrick 7–6 (4), 6–3, in the second round, compiling his first ever back-to-back wins in an Association of Tennis Professionals event. In the quarterfinals, however, Fleishman fell to the eventual tournament champion Radek Štěpánek, 6–4, 6–2. =2008= In September 2008, Fleishman won the USA F23 in California, beating Michael McClune in the finals, 4–6, 6–4, 7–6 (5). He and McClune partnered to win the doubles in the tournament, dropping only one set along the way.

Design and patent The rotary jail was initially designed by architect William H. Brown, and built by the Haugh, Ketcham & Co. iron foundry in the Indianapolis, Indiana neighborhood of Haughville. Their 1881 patent had the following description:  Features  Detail diagram of central core plumbing connections to cell. The pie-shaped cells rotated around a core having a sanitary plumbing system, which was considered an unusual luxury at that time. The cell block could be rotated by a single man hand-rotating a crank. It was connected to gears beneath the structure which rotated the entire cell block. The structure was supported by a ball bearing surface to allow for smooth rotation. Condemned The jails encountered problems almost immediately with inmates' limbs being crushed or interfering with the cellblock's rotation.

Timothy Hallinan (born 1949) is an American thriller writer, based in Southern California and Southeast Asia. In the 1990s, Hallinan created the erudite private eye Simeon Grist, who appeared in a total of six novels, all set in Los Angeles. The series was widely and well reviewed, with some titles appearing on critics \\"Ten Best\\" lists for the year in which they appeared, such as that of the Drood Review of Mystery, but did not achieve widespread popularity. (Hallinan came out with a seventh Grist novel in 2017.) Hallinan returned to publication in 2007 with a second series, set in Bangkok, where he has lived off and on since the early 1980s. The first book in the series is A Nail Through the Heart (William Morrow). The fourth, The Queen of Patpong, was nominated for both the Edgar and the Macavity awards. The sixth, For the Dead, was chosen by the New York Times Book Review to represent Thailand in its “Thrillers from Around the World” feature. In 2011 he launched a third series starring Junior Bender, a burglar who serves as a private detective to Los Angeles' underworld elite. The fourth book, Herbie's Game, won the Lefty Award for best comic mystery novel in 2015. In his non-writing career, Hallinan served as a consultant to corporations, advising on issues of television sponsorship and audience- building. He also created a firm, Hallinan Consulting, that created educators' websites on behalf of a number of public television programs, including \\"The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow,\\" \\"Slavery in America,\\" and \\"The Supreme Court.\\" He now writes full-time.

The country has a range of different habitat types and an ecologically rich and diverse wildlife, vascular plants being particularly abundant, many of them endemic to the country. There are few forested areas, much savanna grassland, semi-arid Karoo vegetation and the fynbos of the Cape Floristic Region. Famed for its national parks and big game, 297 species of mammal have been recorded in South Africa, as well as 858 species of bird and over 20,000 species of vascular plants. Geography Topography of South Africa South Africa is located in subtropical southern Africa, lying between 22°S and 35°S. It is bordered by Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe to the north, by Mozambique and Eswatini (Swaziland) to the northeast, by the Indian Ocean to the east and south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the coastline extending for more than . The interior of the country consists of a large, nearly flat, plateau with an altitude of between and . The eastern, and highest, part of this is the Drakensberg, the highest point being Mafadi (), which is on the border with Lesotho, a country surrounded by South Africa. The south and south-western parts of the plateau, at approximately above sea level, and the adjoining plain below, at approximately above sea level, is known as the Great Karoo, and consists of sparsely populated shrubland. To the north the Great Karoo fades into the drier and more arid Bushmanland, which eventually becomes the Kalahari Desert in the far north-west of the country. The mid-eastern, and highest part of the plateau is known as the Highveld. This relatively well-watered area is home to a great proportion of the country's commercial farmlands. To the north of Highveld, the plateau slopes downwards into the Bushveld, which ultimately gives way to the Limpopo lowlands or Lowveld. The climate of South Africa is influenced by its position between two oceans and its elevation. Winters are mild in coastal regions, particularly in the Eastern Cape. Cold and warm coastal currents running north-west and north-east respectively account for the difference in climates between west and east coasts. The weather pattern is also influenced by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. In the plateau area, the influence of the sea is reduced, and the daily temperature range is much wider; here the summer days are very hot, while the nights are usually cool, with the possibility of frosts in winter. The country experiences a high degree of sunshine with rainfall about half of the global average, increasing from west to east, and with semi-desert regions in the north-west. The Western Cape experiences a Mediterranean climate with winter rainfall, but most of the country has more rain in summer. Flora A total of 23,420 species of vascular plant has been recorded in South Africa, making it the sixth most species-rich country in the world and the most species-rich country on the African continent. Of these, 153 species are considered to be threatened. Nine biomes have been described in South Africa: Fynbos, Succulent Karoo, desert, Nama Karoo, grassland, savanna, Albany thickets, the Indian Ocean coastal belt, and forests. The most prevalent biome in the country is the grassland, particularly on the Highveld, where the plant cover is dominated by different species of grass; fires, frosts and grazing pressure result in few trees occurring here, but geophytes (bulbs) are plentiful and there is a high level of plant diversity, especially on the escarpments. Vegetation becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low rainfall. There are several species of water-storing succulents, like aloes and euphorbias, in the very hot and dry Namaqualand area. The grass and thorn savannah turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of baobab trees in this area, near the northern end of Kruger National Park. Fynbos vegetation on the Cape Peninsula There are few forests in the country, these being largely restricted to patches on mountains and escarpments in high rainfall areas and gallery forests, and much of the plateau area is covered by grassland and savanna. The karoo occupies much of the drier western half of the country; this area is influenced by its proximity to the Atlantic and has winter rainfall. The vegetation here is dominated by dwarf succulent plants, with many endemic species of both plants and animals. Fynbos is a belt of natural shrubland located in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces with a unique flora dominated by ericas, proteas and restios. This area is part of the Cape Floristic Region. The World Wide Fund for Nature divides this region into three ecoregions: the Lowland fynbos and renosterveld, the Montane fynbos and renosterveld and the Albany thickets. There is some concern that the Cape Floristic Region is experiencing one of the most rapid rates of extinction in the world due to habitat destruction, land degradation, and invasive alien plants. The Cape Floral Region Protected Areas is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a group of about thirteen protected areas that together cover an area of over a million hectares. This is a hotspot of diversity of endemic plants, many of which are threatened, and demonstrates ongoing ecological and evolutionary processes. This region occupies less than 0.5% of the area of the African continent yet has almost 20% of its plant species, almost 70% of the 9,000 plant species being endemic to the region. The Fynbos vegetation consists mainly of sclerophyllous shrubland. Of special interest is the pollination biology of the plants, many of which rely on ants, termites, birds or mammals for this function, the adaptions they have made to the fire risk, and the high level of adaptive radiation and speciation. The Mediterranean climate produces hot, dry summers, and many of the plants have underground storage organs allowing them to resprout after fires. A typical species is the silver tree, which grows naturally only on Table Mountain. Fire kills many of the trees but triggers the germination of the seeds, founding the next generation of these short-lived trees.  Mammals  Some 297 species of mammal have been recorded in South Africa, of which 30 species are considered threatened. The Kruger National Park, in the east of the country, is one of the largest national parks in the world, with an area of of grassland with scattered trees. It supports a wide range of ungulates including Burchell's zebra, impala, greater kudu, blue wildebeest, waterbuck, warthog, Cape buffalo, giraffe and hippopotamus. There are also black and white rhinoceroses, African elephant, African wild dog, cheetah, leopard, lion and spotted hyena. Elsewhere in the country there are gemsbok, alternatively known as oryx, nyala, bushbuck and springbok. There are seventeen species of golden mole, a family limited to southern Africa, five species of elephant shrew, many species of shrews, the southern African hedgehog, the aardvark, various hares and the critically endangered riverine rabbit. There are numerous species of bat and a great many species of rodent. Primates are represented by the Mohol bushbaby, the brown greater galago, the Sykes' monkey, the vervet monkey and the chacma baboon. Smaller carnivores include mongooses, genets, the caracal, the serval, the African wildcat, the Cape fox, the side-striped jackal, the black-backed jackal, meerkats, and the African clawless otter. The brown fur seal and other species of seal occur on the coasts and the waters around the country are visited by numerous species of whale and dolphin.These details are derived from the IUCN Red List which lists species of mammal and their distributions.  Birds  With its diverse habitat types, South Africa has a wide range of residential and migratory species. According to the 2018 edition of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 849 species of bird have been recorded in South Africa and its offshore islands. Of these, 125 species are vagrants, and about 30 are endemic either to South Africa, or the more inclusive South Africa/Lesotho/Eswatini region.Clements, J. F., T. S. Schulenberg, M. J. Iliff, D.

Downloaded from http://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/download/ retrieved August 14, 2018 The endemic species include the southern black and blue korhaans, the grey-winged francolin, the Knysna turaco, the Hottentot buttonquail, the southern bald ibis, the forest buzzard, the ground woodpecker, the Cape and Drakensberg rockjumpers, the Cape, eastern and Agulhas long-billed larks, the red, Karoo, Rudd's and Botha's larks, the Cape bulbul, the Victorin's and Knysna warblers, the Drakensberg prinia, the bush blackcap, the Cape sugarbird, the chorister robin-chat, the sentinel and Cape rock thrushes, the buff-streaked chat, the pied starling, and the orange- breasted sunbird.These details are derived from the IUCN Red List which lists species of bird and their distributions. The common ostrich is plentiful on the open grassland and savannah areas. Some birds breed elsewhere but migrate to South Africa to overwinter, while others breed in the country but migrate away in the non-breeding season. Migratory species include the greater striped swallow, white-rumped swift, white stork, African pygmy kingfisher, yellow- billed kite and the European bee-eater.  Reptiles and amphibians  There is a rich fauna of reptiles and amphibians, with 447 species of reptile recorded in the country (as compiled by the Reptile Database), and 132 species of amphibian (compiled by AmphibiaWeb). South Africa has the richest diversity of reptiles of any African country. Endemic species include the angulate tortoise and geometric tortoise, the Zululand dwarf chameleon, the Transkei dwarf chameleon and the Robertson dwarf chameleon, the Broadley's flat lizard, the dwarf Karoo girdled lizard, the Soutpansberg rock lizard, and the yellow- bellied house snake. Natal diving frog Also included among the fauna are the Nile crocodile, the leopard tortoise, the Speke's hinge-back tortoise, the serrated hinged terrapin, various chameleons, lizards, geckos and skinks, the cape cobra, the black mamba, the eastern green mamba, the puff adder, the mole snake and a range of other venomous and non-venomous snakes. Amphibian diversity reflects the many diverse habitats around the country. Species of interest include the endemic western leopard toad and the arum frog, the bronze caco, the spotted snout-burrower and the critically endangered Rose's ghost frog, found only on the slopes of Table Mountain. Another endangered endemic species is the Natal diving frog.

He was born in Hadersleben, Schleswig (now Haderslev in Denmark), and died in Rosenheim. Biography Langbehn was born in Hadersleben in what was then the Duchy of Schleswig, on 26 March 1851, the third of four sons. His father, a philologist, was dismissed from his position as the assistant principal at the local gymnasium shortly after Julius's birth, a result of a campaign to suppress German nationalism in southern Denmark following the First Schleswig War and the Revolutions of 1848. The Langbehn family eventually settled in Kiel, where Julius entered the gymnasium in 1863. After graduation, he entered the University of Kiel for a degree in the natural sciences. At the age of 19, he enlisted in the Prussian Army following the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. He fought in the battles of Orleans and Le Mans in December 1870 and January 1871, respectively. Langbehn's military service left him with a profound distaste for war.Stern, pp. 98-100 After the war, Langbehn returned to Kiel to study chemistry, though in 1872 he transferred to the University of Munich with the help of a wealthy merchant. There, he grew bored with chemistry and began to study art and archaeology. After his mother suffered a nervous breakdown, Julius traveled to Venice before returning to Munich in 1875. He studied archaeology under Heinrich Brunn; his doctoral dissertation examined early Greek statues of Nike, the goddess of victory. He worked briefly at the Imperial Archaeology Institute in Rome in 1881. Over the following decade, he traveled throughout Germany, collecting material for his first book, Rembrandt als Erzieher (Rembrandt as Teacher), published in 1890. His work was focused on initiating cultural reform in Germany.Stern, pp. 100-103 Rembrandt als Erzieher, which was published anonymously \\"by a German\\", was a huge success. Langbehn's attitudes towards Jews was initially favourable, but as the book went through its numerous editions, this changed, with new chapters introduced to this effect in the 37th edition, which were subsequently ever more stridently revised.Peter Pulzer: The Rise of Political Anti-semitism in Germany & Austria (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988) 236 In 1891, he published 40 Lieder (40 Poems), again anonymously; this proved to be a complete failure. The poems, which were explicitly erotic, prompted the state prosecutor of Schleswig-Holstein to threaten to press charges. The legal problems were sufficient to force Langbehn to withdraw the book. Der Rembrandtdeutsche followed, this time \\"by a friend of truth\\", though it too was not well received. Langbehn moved to Vienna, then in the Austro- Hungarian Empire, where he lived briefly. He shortly fled the country after having been convicted in a lawsuit from his landlord. Around this time Langbehn took on a disciple, a painter from Frisia by the name of Nissen.Stern, pp. 109-111 After departing Vienna, Langbehn traveled to Italy, southern France, Spain, and the Canary Islands in 1894. He then returned to Germany and continued his vagrant life there, producing no new works. In the mid-1890s, he began to attend Catholic churches, and in early 1900 he converted to Catholicism. He now directed his reformist tendencies toward the Catholic Church, and began to attack liberal segments. Langbehn died on 30 April 1907 of stomach cancer.Stern, pp. 112-115 Views Langbehn's efforts at reform were a reaction against modernism. He particularly disliked materialism, democracy, and internationalism; he favored aristocracy, individualism, and peace. He believed that Germany should abandon industrialization and urbanization in favor of an agrarian society ruled by a monarch.Mosse, p. 51 While Langbehn's vision did away with the bourgeois, proletarians, and the Junkers, he strongly opposed a classless society, stating that \\"equality is death.\\"Rembrandt als Erzieher, quoted in Mosse, p. 51 Langbehn advocated pan-Germanism, along with a view that Germany ought to take a place of primacy in world affairs, owing to national superiority.

The book formulated an \\"ideal\\" of national empowerment, which resounded throughout a Germany desperate to rebound from the Treaty of Versailles. For Moeller van den Bruck, Germany's great misfortune lies in the political system created by the Weimar Republic, one of competitive parties and liberal ideologies. An admirer of Benito Mussolini, he looks for a strong leader.  The concept  His empire is not so much a state in the sense that term is usually understood: it is the ideal condition, the only way in which the scattered German people can achieve a common purpose and destiny. But he does not look for the limited state, and the Second Reich fashioned by Otto von Bismarck was an imperfect empire. It did not include Austria, which survived on from \\"our First Empire\\", side by side with \\"our Second Empire\\": \\"Our Second Empire was a Little-German Empire which we must consider only as a stepping stone on our path to a Greater German Empire.\\" The weak Weimar Republic, he argues, will have to be replaced by a new revolution, a revolution from the right. He looks also for a new political movement that will embrace both socialism and nationalism, a unique form of German Fascism. He takes all of his philosophical cues from the work of Nietzsche \\"who stands at the opposite pole of thought from Marx\\". The one contemporary politician he admires above all others is Benito Mussolini.  Implications  The temptation is to see this difficult little book as an advocate for what was to come, but this gap between the ideal vision and the historical truth is virtually unbridgeable. On the eve of publication Moeller van den Bruck inserted a preface, in which he wrote that \\"The Third Reich is a philosophical idea not for this but for the next world. Germany might perish because of the Third Reich dream.\\" He believes Germany needs an Übermensch in the fashion described by Nietzsche, but that individual is not Adolf Hitler. Soon after the collapse of the Munich Putsch he wrote: \\"There are many things that can be said against Hitler, and I have sometimes said them. But one thing you have to give him credit for: he is a fanatic for Germany. But he is wrecked by his proletarian primitive ways. He does not know how to give an intellectual basis to his Nazi party. Hitler is all passion but lacks sense or proportion. A heroic tenor, not a hero.\\" Hitler, in other words, was not Mussolini. These were the last words he ever wrote before his suicide in 1925.

Albania and Achaea In January and February 1374, Urtubia was rewarded 1,000 Aragonese gold florins, some mills by the bridge at Tudela, and the custody of the great castle of Rocafort by Charles II of Navarre for services rendered. In 1375, Urtubia appears as a recruiter for the Navarrese Company in Gascony. He was one of the four original captains of the outfit which went to Albania with Louis of Évreux. He led the largest single societas (sub-company) of the company, at fifty men; he appears in the enlistment roll of 15 February 1375 as Johanco durtuvia escudero del Rey ordenado por yr en el dicto biage dalbania e sus eill e en sus governamiento L hombres darmas como parece por un otro mandamiento del Rey. After the successful conquest of Durazzo with Navarrese help, the Company disappears from view until Urtubia is found in the Morea in April 1378, leading a hundred men or more in the employ of Nerio I Acciajuoli (\\"Micer Aner\\" or \\"Arner\\"). Urtubia quickly entered into arrangements with the Hospitallers under Juan Fernández de Heredia and his lieutenant, Gaucher de la Bastide, a Gascon whom Urtubia may have originally met in Gascony a few years prior. Bastide negotiated with Urtubia and another Navarrese captain, Mahiot de Coquerel, leader of a band of 50, for their mercenary services. Conquest of Boeotia When Urtubia invaded Boeotia, which was part of the Duchy of Athens, then a possession of another Spanish mercenary company, the Catalan Grand Company, in the spring or early summer of 1379, his army probably numbered much more than one hundred, possibly more than two hundred, which would have been a considerable array in an age \\"when great organised armies were not known, and often a band of adventurers determined the fate of a country unprepared for war.\\"Setton, 131, quoting Antonio Rubió y Lluch. It is not known why exactly Urtubia attacked Thebes, but it was probably for plunder and power, if not mere adventure. The troops with which Urtubia made his invasion were a remnant of the Navarrese Company which had taken Durazzo, but not the remnant which had retained the structure of the Company, but rather a sort of splinter group composed primarily of the Navarrese complement of the Company, but also comprising Gascons, Italians, Greeks, and disaffected Catalans. After crossing the territory of his erstwhile employer, Nerio Acciajuoli, Urtubia made for Thebes, the capital of Athens and the chief city of Boeotia. It was a strategic gem, controlling communications between Athens in the south and the Duchy of Neopatria to the north, another Catalan possession. With the support of Niccolò III dalle Carceri, Duke of the Archipelago on his right and Nerio guarding his rear, Urtubia was secure to besiege Thebes for a long time. From the north, too, Francis Zorzi, the Margrave of Bodonitsa, rendered aid against his overlords, the Catalans. The Republic of Venice, which might have stepped in to stop the overtures of Carceri at least, was too involved in the War of Chioggia to be of any help to vulnerable Thebes. Within Thebes, too, disaffected Catalans (mostly those who had supported Frederick III of Sicily against Peter of Aragon in a previous civil war), as well as the majority of Greeks and the archbishop, Simon Atumano, lent tacit support to the besiegers. Finally, Nerio Acciajuoli also lent aid to Urtubia in hopes that he would also conquer Athens. Galcerán de Peralta, the Catalan captain, castellan, and veguer of Athens, however, rushed to the defence of Thebes, but was captured outside its walls in battle. He was still a prisoner a year later, but, at the request of Peter IV of Aragon, Duke of Athens, the Hospitaller master Heredia secured his release. The city of Thebes eventually fell to Urtubia in May or June 1379. After Thebes After Galcerán's failure, Louis Fadrique, the vicar of the duchy, attacked Urtubia (1380), but the latter, with the help of the Hospitallers, fended him off. Fadrique refused to make peace with Urtubia, but the Hospitallers constrained him with thinly veiled threats of war on the Navarrese's behalf. After the fall of Thebes, the Navarrese under Urtubia conquered Livadeia as well (1381). Urtubia, however, disappears from the record in late fall 1381 and this has been taken to indicate his death. When the Company signed a treaty with Venice on 2 January 1382, Urtubia was not a signatory. By his conquest of Thebes, however, he left his mark on the history of the Catalans in Greece: he brought it to a swift end. Sources * *Setton, Kenneth M. Catalan Domination of Athens 1311-1380\\\\.

Biography Described by Cincinnati television producer Len Goorian as \\"the closest thing I've ever seen to a living leprechaun,\\" the Plymouth, Indiana-born Robert Gerald Shreve broke into radio following a stint in the U.S. Navy as a singer on Hoosier Hop and Calling All Poets for WOWO in Fort Wayne. He subsequently appeared on \\"National Barn Dance\\" for WLS in Chicago, and Club Matinee for ABC in New York, before accepting an offer from WLW in Cincinnati. As a staff tenor for WLW, he sang the favorite hits of the day, sometimes duetting with other local talent such as Betty Clooney, the sister of Rosemary Clooney. In 1950, WLW added television to their service and Shreve was in the vanguard of talent to make the leap from radio to TV. In August 1950, he appeared in comedy skits on WLWT's Cincinnati at Sunset, the first local program to receive national broadcast via NBC. Thereafter, he proved himself able to provide whatever the hungry airwaves needed: an on-air announcer, a mellow singing voice, a movie host, an able vaudevillian, a soft-shoe dancer, or a cornpone comedian. It was in the latter category that he made his first significant local success in The General Store, a half-hour comedy show in the style of Lum and Abner that aired on WLWT Mondays through Fridays at 3:30 p.m. Set in the mythic rural burg of Broken Tooth, Measley County USA (Population: 43), The General Store top-lined Bill Thall as store proprietor Willie, but Shreve stole every episode as his brain-dead employee Elmer Diffledorfer, who wore a sideways deerstalker cap and a necktie that stood up of its own accord. This is the same outfit that he wore, portraying the \\"Country Cousin Alvin\\" on the \\"Old American Barn Dance\\" on the DuMont Television program of the 1953 summer replacement season. Remarkably, except for a basic scripted premise, each of the daily episodes was wholly improvised and the setting of the program allowed for easy accommodation of the sponsors' products. The show was a quirky comic phenomenon of its time, and Thall and Shreve made numerous personal appearances as Willie and Elmer in Cincinnati and other tri-state cities, and sometimes reprised the characters on WLWT's nationally broadcast Country & Western show, Midwestern Hayride. During his tenure at WLWT, Shreve was also a frequent performer on the popular Ruth Lyons show, The 50/50 Club. In 1954, after The General Store Shreve was lured over to fledgling television station WCPO-TV, where he co-hosted an afternoon show with Wanda Lewis and Colin Male, and played Lucky the Clown and Roger the Robot on the station's long-running morning children's program, The Uncle Al Show. He also played \\"Butchie\\" and then \\"Weasel\\" on Bud Chase's afternoon show, \\"The Bean's Clubhouse\\". Circa 1959-60, he hosted The Three Stooges shorts while wearing a trademark bowler hat, plaid coat, and Elmer's old saluting necktie, and Popeye cartoons while wearing a sailor's suit. Shreve's antics made him one of WCPO's most popular and beloved personalities, especially among children, and his on- air antics sometimes caught the eyes of comedians travelling through Cincinnati.He was joined on the air at various times by such surprise guests as Jerry Lewis, Doodles Weaver, and The Three Stooges themselves. In 1963, Shreve's combined experience in vaudeville, comic improvisation, and salesmanship crystallized when he became one of the pioneers of all-night broadcasting. It was then that Shreve made his first appearance as the bartender host of WCPO's The Schoenling All Night Theater, which ran from 1:30 am to 6:00 am on Saturday nights/Sunday mornings. Taking a page from Jackie Gleason's popular skits with Frank Fontaine on The Jackie Gleason Show, Shreve would greet the viewer as a visitor to his bar, and prepare to pour the first of the evening's mugs of Schoenling beer by singing the show's theme song, set to the tune of \\"Sailing, Sailing\\": \\"Schoenling, Schoenling / That is the beer for me / It has the taste of malt and hops / Of finest quality / Schoenling, Schoenling / My choice for purity / I've tried the rest, Schoenling's best / It's Schoenling beer for me!\\" As the show went on, it got zanier and zanier with Shreve lip-synching songs like Irving Taylor's When the Crabgrass Blooms Again and Leona Anderson's Limburger Lover, and sometimes making surprise \\"cameo appearances\\" in the movies being shown. The show's crazy cast of characters included Chickie, a rubber chicken that Shreve sometimes stretched past the breaking point; Garoro, an ugly severed head; Spidel, a large stuffed spider that would swing into frame to knock hats off Bob's head, and many others. During his commercial breaks, Shreve would also read on the air the names of viewers who called in, and it became the fashion for callers to invent preposterous names for themselves, just to get an amusing reaction from Shreve. Typically, the show mellowed to a more reflective mood around 4:00 am, with Shreve breaking into standards like \\"Me and My Shadow\\" and sometimes stepping out from behind the bar to indulge in a little soft-shoe dance. The show became so popular that Shreve was invited to host an identical program (called The Schoenling Nite People Theater) live from the studios of WHIO-TV in Dayton, Ohio, on Friday nights/Saturday mornings, which lasted for several years. In 1968-69, Shreve would follow a full night's work on the Cincinnati show by sticking around to host Cartoons A Go Go on Sunday mornings. Also during this period, when the popularity of the all-night show seemed at its height, he recorded an album, Good Olé [sic] Bob Doing His Thing for Cincinnati's King Records with the help of the Dee Felice Trio. The album eschewed his popular comedy routines to present a pleasant, sentimental showcase for Shreve's warm Irish tenor voice and his affection for old- fashioned songs like \\"That Old Gang of Mine\\" and \\"Walkin' My Baby Back Home.\\" With a cover sporting the King Records legend of \\"A James Brown Production,\\" the album is now one of the most coveted Shreve (and Brown) collectables; only two or three thousand copies were pressed. When The Schoenling All Night Theater was unceremoniously cancelled by WCPO in 1970, it was quickly picked up by Shreve's old stomping grounds at WLWT as The Schoenling Nite People Theater. (The Dayton show of the same title was by this time discontinued.) Unfortunately, it did not last there more than a year or two. In 1975, the show moved to WKRC-TV, then Cincinnati's ABC affiliate, with the new Saturday Night Live-influenced title, The Past Prime Playhouse. Schoenling no longer sponsored the show, which gave way to new advertisers like LaRosa's Pizza, Hemsath Sound Centers, and Mayor's Jewelers. WKRC would give the show (nicknamed \\"The PPP\\") its longest run; it stayed on the late night airwaves for a full ten years, even though Shreve's shenanigans were toned down since the early days. Among the celebrity visitors to the PPP set over the course of that decade were Adam West, Bill Cosby, comedian Pete Barbutti and the buxom stripper then known as \\"baseball's kissing bandit,\\" Morganna. During the latter years of the PPP, WKRC introduced a spin-off show-of-sorts for Garoro, Shreve's \\"gamey\\" severed head sidekick: Garoro's Theater of Horrors, the channel's weekly horror feature, introduced at the outset by the heretofore voiceless Garoro, who had somehow gained the power of Boris Karloff-like speech. It was widely rumored at the time that WKRC was losing sponsors for the show owing to Shreve's tendency to poke fun at and upstage his advertisers, but the truth behind the show's cancellation had more to do with the arrival of home video and infomercials. With more and more homes equipped to play movies on videocassette, the \\"all-night movies\\" aspect of shows like The Past Prime Playhouse began to shed its appeal. Rather than spend money to produce live all-night programming, stations saw the wisdom of accepting money to roll tape for all-night advertisers. As the PPP disappeared, so did most all original all-night programming across the United States. A shy man in private life, Shreve didn't take comfortably to retirement. Able to keep himself only intermittently busy with voice work and the occasional Public- access television interview, his health began to wane. In February 1990, he died at the age of 78 at Jewish Hospital, where he was being treated for cancer, after suffering a debilitating bout with the flu. In 1992, Bob Shreve was posthumously inducted into the Greater Cincinnati Broadcast Hall of Fame. The honor was accepted by his widow Jane (the former Mary Jane Keller, whom he married in August 1948) and son Robert Shreve, Jr.  External links  *WKRCTV Vault featuring Bob Shreve's Past Prime Playhouse video clips Category:American television personalities Category:Television personalities from Cincinnati Category:People from Plymouth, Indiana Category:1912 births Category:1990 deaths ","title":"Bob Shreve"},{"id":"11876450","text":"Holyrood is a residential neighbourhood in the Bonnie Doon area of south east Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

The Baie de la Seine or Baie de Seine (Bay of the Seine River) is a bay in northern France. Geography It is a wide, rectangular inlet of the English Channel, approximately 100 kilometres (east-west) by 45 kilometres, bounded in the west by the Cotentin Peninsula, in the south by the Normandy coast and in the east by the estuary of the river Seine at Le Havre. The coast alternates between sandy beaches and rocky promontories and, in general, it offers little shelter for shipping. At the western end of the bay are the Îles Saint- Marcouf. Economy Le Havre is the major port of the region; there are minor harbours at Barfleur, Port-en-Bessin, Courseulles-sur-Mer, Langrune-sur-Mer, Ouistreham, Trouville-sur-Mer and Honfleur. Domestic and foreign tourists visit the coast, given its World War II associations, sandy beaches and proximity to Paris. There are coastal resorts at Arromanches, Deauville, Cabourg, Houlgate, Villers-sur-Mer, Trouville-sur-Mer and Honfleur. History The Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue were naval battles fought off Barfleur and Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue in the 17th century. The Normandy coast was the location, during World War II, of the main Allied landings in France; the unavailability of significant harbours caused the Allies to construct artificial harbours (Mulberries) at Arromanches and Omaha Beach.

Prior to 2018, the festival took place on Treasure Island, California, located in the San Francisco Bay. In 2018, the festival moved to Middle Harbor Shoreline Park, located in Oakland. The festival is produced by Noise Pop and Another Planet Entertainment (APE) . The first day of the festival consists of electronica and hip hop/rap influenced performers while the second day consists of rock and indie rock influenced performers. Each day the sets are split between two separate, nearby stages, however, the performances are staggered such that attendees can listen to every performer. Typically, the northernmost stage is the main stage on which the headliner plays. Parking on the island was limited and as such, each year the majority of private vehicles were left in the parking lot at AT&T; Park or Bill Graham Auditorium, depending on the year, and a shuttle service was provided to the island. The organizers also claim this reduces traffic congestion on the island. The Treasure Island Music Festival has also been noted for its emphasis on reducing carbon emissions: organizers provide zero emission bus services to the island from the city of San Francisco and emphasize the use of composting. 2018 Lineup =Day 1: October 13= *A$AP Rocky *Silk City (Diplo + Mark Ronson) *Santigold *Pusha T *Aminé *Hiatus Kaiyote *Laff Trax (Toro y Moi x Nosaj Thing) *Moses Sumney *Polo & Pan *George Fitzgerald (LIVE) *JPEGMAFIA *Gilligan Moss =Day 2: October 14= *Tame Impala *Lord Huron *Courtney Barnett *Jungle *Sharon Van Etten *Cigarettes After Sex *U.S. Girls *Alex Cameron *Soccer Mommy *Pond *Shame *serpentwithfeet 2016 Lineup =Day 1: October 15= *Ice Cube *ZHU *Glass Animals *Duke Dumont—cancelled due to unsafe playing conditions *Young Thug *Flight Facilities—cancelled due to unsafe playing conditions *The Polish Ambassador—played extended set. *Mura Masa *How to Dress Well— played a shortened set due to flight delays. *Honne *Sofi Tukker *Kamaiyah—played twice. *DJ Worthy =Day 2: October 16= *Sigur Ros *James Blake—cancelled and performed a free show the following night. *Purity Ring *Tycho—played a DJ set in addition to live performance. *Mac DeMarco *Sylvan Esso *Neon Indian *Christine and the Queens *Wild Nothing *Deafheaven *Car Seat Headrest *Hinds *Day Wave 2015 Lineup = Day 1: October 17 = * deadmau5 * FKA twigs * Big Grams (Big Boi and Phantogram) * STS9 * Run The Jewels * Gorgon City * Hudson Mohawke * Cashmere Cat * Viceroy * Shamir * Bob Moses * Skylar Spence * Baio = Day 2: October 18 = * The National * CHVRCHES * The War On Drugs * Father John Misty * Panda Bear * Jose Gonzalez * Deerhunter * Drive Like Jehu * Ex Hex * Mikal Cronin * Lower Dens * Viet Cong * Ought 2014 Lineup =Day 1: October 18= * Outkast * Zedd * Janelle Monáe * St. Lucia * Jungle * MØ * Classixx * Ryan Hemsworth * Ana Tijoux * XXYYXX * Ratking * Tobacco * Painted Palms =Day 2: October 19= * Massive Attack * alt-J * TV on the Radio * The New Pornographers * Washed Out * Banks * Poliça * The Growlers * Chet Faker * Ásgeir * Bleached * Cathedrals 2013 Lineup =Day 1: October 19= * Atoms for Peace * Major Lazer * Little Dragon * Phantogram * Disclosure * Holy Ghost! * Danny Brown * DJ Falcon * Poolside * Adult. * Robert DeLong * Giraffage * Antwon =Day 2: October 20= * Beck * Animal Collective * James Blake * Sleigh Bells * STRFKR * Lord Huron * Japandroids * Real Estate * Haim * Palma Violets * Cayucas * IO Echo * Deep Sea Diver 2012 Lineup =Day 1: October 13= *Girl Talk *The Presets *Porter Robinson *Public Enemy *SBTRKT *Tycho *AraabMuzik *Matthew Dear *Toro y Moi *Grimes *The Coup *K.Flay *Dirty Ghosts =Day 2: October 14= *The xx *M83 *Gossip *Best Coast *Joanna Newsom *Divine Fits *Youth Lagoon *Los Campesinos! *The War on Drugs *Ty Segall *Hospitality *Imperial Teen *The Neighbourhood 2011 Lineup =Day 1: October 15= *Empire of the Sun *Cut Copy *Chromeo *Death From Above 1979 *Battles *Dizzee Rascal *Flying Lotus *Yacht *The Naked & Famous *Aloe Blacc *Shabazz Palaces *Buraka Som Sistema * Geographer =Day 2: October 16= *Death Cab For Cutie *Explosions In The Sky *Beach House *The Hold Steady *The Head and the Heart *St. Vincent *Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks *Friendly Fires *Wild Beasts *Warpaint *The Antlers *Thee Oh Sees *Weekend 2010 Lineup =Day 1: October 16= *LCD Soundsystem *Deadmau5 *Kruder & Dorfmeister (Live set) *Miike Snow *!!! *Die Antwoord *Little Dragon *Four Tet *Holy Fuck *Phantogram *Jamaica *Wallpaper *Maus Haus =Day 2: October 17= *Belle & Sebastian *The National *Broken Social Scene *She & Him *Superchunk *Rogue Wave *Surfer Blood *Ra Ra Riot *Monotonix *The Sea and Cake *Phosphorescent *Papercuts *The Mumlers 2009 Lineup =Day 1: October 17= *MGMT *MSTRKRFT *Girl Talk *Brazilian Girls *The Streets *Passion Pit *LTJ Bukem Feat.

It contains the Local-Level Government (LLG) areas of Kiunga Rural, Kiunga Urban, Ningerum Rural, Olsobip Rural and Star Mountains Rural, and the townships of Kiunga, Tabubil, Olsobip and Ningerum. Demographics The population of the district in the 2011 census was 62,850. The most populous LLG in the area at that time was Kiunga Rural, with almost 13,500 people, making the greater Kiunga area the most populous area in the district with about 21,000 people. The township itself, however, is smaller with about 8,300 residents, and is dwarfed by Tabubil, a much newer settlement in Star Mountains Rural LLG which was recently estimated (2006) to have 13,500 residents, making it the largest settlement in the Western Province and the 12th largest settlement in the country. Politics The political centre of the district is Kiunga, and government representatives are elected periodically. There are a total of 105 police in the district, but only three of these are located outside Tabubil and Kiunga. These townships also host court houses. A jail has recently been re-opened in the district at Ningerum. Climate The district has an average annual rainfall of 8 metres. A peak rainfall in the highlands is realised of over 10 metres. Olsobip, one of the northernmost settlements in the district, is probably one of the wettest places on earth, a fact that cannot be established scientifically, due to the absence of a weather station. The district is landlocked, and is heavily reliant on its high rainfall for shipping. The majority of the district is situated on a plain. The beginning of the Star Mountains is the southernmost point in the district that is more than a few hundred metres above sea level. The plain is a very humid environment, and has a stable tropical temperature of 27 to 32 degrees Celsius. The highlands is slightly cooler, with a temperature range of 19 to 27 degrees. Geography The district covers the northern area of the Western Province. It shares a provincial border with Sandaun in the north and Southern Highlands Province in the east. It shares an international boundary with Papua province of Indonesia in the west and borders Middle Fly District in the south. The southern area of North Fly District is a massive plain, and the highlands begin around Tabubil, at the foot of the Star Mountains. The province south of this point is rather low lying, and doesn't increase in altitude above a few hundred metres. The border with Sandaun, however, rises to 3,727 metres. The total land mass of the North Fly District is 13,138 km², slightly larger than Enga Province. The district is home to the sources of the Fly River and Ok Tedi River. The Strickland River also flows through this district. Economy Most of the economy of the District revolves around the Ok Tedi Mine, the largest economic entity in the Western Province, accounting for over half of the entire province's economy and 25.7% of the country's entire export earnings. Ok Tedi's base of operations is Tabubil. There is also a productive rubber industry situated around Kiunga. Kiunga holds the main port of the province, and ships a lot of supplies in, and copper from Ok Tedi Mine, rubber and lumber out. The Kiunga- Tabubil Highway runs through the district and is a main supply line, and a feat of engineering in its own right. The highway was built and is maintained by Ok Tedi Mining Limited.

Cover art was by Stephen Tappin, and interior art was by Trevor Hairsine, Des Hanley, Adrian Smith, Stephen Tappin, and Richard Wright. Jonathan Tweet explained the initial goal behind the book: \\"The Miniatures Handbook and the D&D; Miniatures line in general developed because we saw that miniatures were a big part of the D&D; roleplaying experience. We wanted to support players who use miniatures in their games, as well as create easy-to-use miniatures for players who would like to use miniatures but don't. In addition, we built on the experience Wizards has with competitive games. Our D&D; miniatures are designed to work in a roleplaying game, but we've also created a head-to-head skirmish system for fighting fast, tactical battles with them. The Miniatures Handbook, like the miniatures themselves, supports both roleplaying and head-to-head wargaming.\\" Reception Shannon Appelcline noted that the book \\"got somewhat mixed reviews and some things like the mass battle rules - which may have dated back, in part, all the way to Wizard's unpublished 'Military Order' book - were derided as not working well with the random nature of the miniatures. Still, the book probably served its purpose of cross-marketing Dungeons & Dragons and the Miniatures game.\\" References External links * Play the D&D; Miniature Demo * Hasbro's Wizards of the Coast D&D; Miniatures site * DDM Spoilers by Greyhaze * Unofficial Maps and tiles ** Dungeon Grids ** Dungeoneering ** Dreamweaved Worlds Category:2003 books Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks ","title":"Miniatures Handbook"},{"id":"11876633","text":"Reciprocal teaching is an instructional activity that takes the form of a dialogue between teachers and students regarding segments of text for the purpose of constructing the meaning of text.

Conceptual underpinnings  The concept of reciprocal teaching was first developed by Annemarie Sullivan Palincsar and Ann L. Brown in 1984. As previously mentioned, reciprocal teaching was developed as a technique to help teachers bridge the gap for students who demonstrated a discrepancy between decoding skills and comprehension skills (Palincsar, Ransom, & Derber, 1989). That is, the process is aimed at aiding students who possess grade-level skills in letter-sound correspondence (\\"sounding out\\" words and \\"chunking\\"), but are unable to construct meaning from the texts they decode. Reciprocal teaching utilizes the strategy of prediction, whereby students predict before reading, and then use those predictions during reading to check if they are correct (Stricklin, 2011). Reciprocal teaching is made up of four components: predicting, clarifying, questioning, and comprehension. In 2005, Oczkus coined the phrase the \\"fab four\\" to describe the processes involved with reciprocal teaching (Stricklin, 2011). Students then move on to clarifying things they do not understand by asking the instructor questions, or having the teacher ask questions during reading, in order to clarify difficult sections of text or point out areas where students should pay particular attention. After the text is read, questions are asked of a student or group of students to enhance retention and check how much was learned. Finally, comprehension is achieved by engaging the students in a summary of either a page or the entire text selection of what they just read (Stricklin, 2011). The teacher supports the students by rephrasing or elaborating on their answers, statements, and questions.Rosenshine, B. & Meister, C. (1994). Reciprocal Teaching: A review of the research. Review of Educational Research. 64(4)479-530.  Role of reading strategies  Reciprocal teaching is an amalgamation of reading strategies that effective readers are thought to use. As stated by Pilonieta and Medina in their article \\"Reciprocal Teaching for the Primary Grades: We Can Do It, Too!\\", previous research conducted by Kincade and Beach (1996) indicates that proficient readers use specific comprehension strategies in their reading tasks, while poor readers do not (Pilonieta & Medina, 2009). Proficient readers have well-practiced decoding and comprehension skills which allow them to proceed through texts somewhat automatically until some sort of triggering event alerts them to a comprehension failure (Palincsar & Brown, 1984). This trigger can be anything from an unacceptable accumulation of unknown concepts to an expectation that has not been fulfilled by the text. Whatever the trigger, proficient readers react to a comprehension breakdown by using a number of strategies in a planned, deliberate manner. These \\"fix-up\\" strategies range from simply slowing down the rate of reading or decoding, to re-reading, to consciously summarizing the material. Once the strategy (or strategies) has helped to restore meaning in the text, the successful reader can proceed again without conscious use of the strategy (Palincsar & Brown). All readers—no matter how skilled—occasionally reach cognitive failure when reading texts that are challenging, unfamiliar, or \\"inconsiderate\\"—i.e. structured or written in an unusual manner (Garner, 1992; Wade, 2001). Poor readers, on the other hand, do not demonstrate the same reaction when comprehension failure occurs. Some simply do not recognize the triggers that signal comprehension breakdown. Others are conscious that they do not understand the text, but do not have or are unable to employ strategies that help. Some use maladaptive strategies (such as avoidance) that do not aid in comprehension (Garner, 1992). Mayer notes in his paper on Learning Strategies that reciprocal teaching can help even novice learners become more adept at utilizing learning strategies and furthering their understanding of a subject (1996). Mayer also notes that the reciprocal teaching process gives the students the chance to learn more by having the teachers as role models, and that the reciprocal teaching process gives beginners in an academic field a chance to learn from the experts by taking turns leading the class (Mayer, 1996).  Strategies  Approaching the problem from the perspective of Cognitive Strategy Instruction (Slater & Horstman, 2002), reciprocal teaching attempts to train students in specific and discrete strategies to prevent cognitive failure during reading. Palincsar and Brown (1984) identified four basic strategies that may help students recognize and react to signs of comprehension breakdown: Questioning, Clarifying, Summarizing, and Predicting. These strategies serve dual purposes of being both comprehension-fostering and comprehension-monitoring; that is, they are thought to enhance comprehension while at the same time affording students the opportunity to check whether it is occurring. The leader follows these four steps in this specific order: = Predicting = The prediction phase involves readers in actively combining their own background knowledge with what they have gathered from the text. With a narrative text students imagine what might happen next. With an informational text, students predict what they might learn or read about in subsequent passages. Predicting involves combining the reader's prior knowledge, new knowledge from the text, and the text's structure to create hypotheses related to the direction of the text and the author's intent in writing. Predicting provides an overall rationale for reading – to confirm or disconfirm self-generated hypotheses (Doolittle et al., 2006). The Predictor can offer predictions about what the author will tell the group next or, if it's a literary selection, the predictor might suggest what the next events in the story will be. As Williams points out, predictions don't necessarily need to be accurate, but they need to be clear (2011). The sequence of reading, questioning, clarifying, summarizing, and predicting is then repeated with subsequent sections of text.Slater, W. H., & Horstman, F. R. (2002). Teaching reading and writing to struggling middle school and high school students: The case for reciprocal teaching. Preventing School Failure, 46(4), 163. Different reading strategies have been incorporated into the reciprocal teaching format by other practitioners. Some other reading strategies include visualizing, making connections, inferencing, and questioning the author. = Questioning = When using the questioning strategy, readers monitor and assess their own understanding of the text by asking themselves questions. This self-awareness of one's own internal thought process is termed \\"metacognition.\\" Questioning involves the identification of information, themes, and ideas that are central and important enough to warrant further consideration. The central or important information, themes, or ideas are used to generate questions that are then used as self-tests for the reader. Questioning provides a context for exploring the text more deeply and assuring the construction of meaning (Doolittle, Hicks, Triplett, Nichols, & Young, 2006)Doolittle, P.E., Hicks,D., Triplett, C.F., Nichols,W.D., & Young, C.A. (2006). Reciprocal teaching for reading comprehension in higher education: A strategy for fostering the deeper understanding of texts. International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education. 17(2), 106-118. The Questioner will pose questions about the selection: * Unclear parts * Puzzling information * Connections to other concepts already learned = Clarifying = The clarification strategy focuses on training students in specific steps to help with decoding (letter-sound correspondence, \\"chunking,\\" spelling, etc.), as well as fix-up strategies to deal with difficult vocabulary and lapses in concentration. Clarifying involves the identification and clarification of unclear, difficult, or unfamiliar aspects of a text. These aspects may include awkward sentence or passage structure, unfamiliar vocabulary, unclear references, or obscure concepts. Clarifying provides the motivation to remediate confusion through re-reading, the use of context in which the text was written and/or read, and the use of external resources (e.g., dictionary or thesaurus) (Doolittle et al., 2006). The Clarifier will address confusing parts and attempt to answer the questions that were just posed. = Summarizing = Summarization requires the reader to perform the task of discriminating between important and less- important information in the text. It must then be organized into a coherent whole (Palincsar & Brown, 1984). Summarizing is the process of identifying the important information, themes, and ideas within a text and integrating these into a clear and concise statement that communicates the essential meaning of the text. Summarizing may be based on a single paragraph, a section of text, or an entire passage. Summarizing provides the impetus to create a context for understanding the specifics of a text (Doolittle et al., 2006). The Summarizer will use his/her own words to tell the main idea of the text. This can happen anywhere in the story, and it should happen often for those students who are at-risk. It can happen first at sentence level, then paragraphs, then to whole text.  Instructional format  Reciprocal teaching follows a dialogic/dialectic process. Palincsar, Ransom, and Derber (1989) wrote that there were two reasons for choosing dialogue as the medium. First, it is a language format with which children are familiar (as opposed to writing, which may be too difficult for some struggling readers). Second, dialogue provides a useful vehicle for alternating control between teacher and students in a systematic and purposeful manner. Reciprocal teaching illustrates a number of unique ideas for teaching and learning and is based on both developmental and cognitive theories. The strategies embedded in reciprocal teaching represent those that successful learners engage in while interacting with text. They are thought to encourage self-regulation and self-monitoring and promote intentional learning (Brown, 1980).Brown, A. L. (1980). Metacognitive development and reading. In R. S. Spiro, B. B. Bruce, & W. L. Brewer (Eds.), Theoretical issues in reading comprehension. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum Reciprocal teaching also follows a very scaffolded curve, beginning with high levels of teacher instruction, modeling, and input, which is gradually withdrawn to the point that students are able to use the strategies independently. Reciprocal teaching begins with the students and teacher reading a short piece of text together. In the beginning stages, the teacher models the \\"Fab Four\\" strategies required by reciprocal teaching, and teacher and students share in conversation to come to a mutual agreement about the text (Williams, 2011). The teacher then specifically and explicitly models his or her thinking processes out loud, using each of the four reading strategies. Students follow the teacher's model with their own strategies, also verbalizing their thought processes for the other students to hear. Over time, the teacher models less and less frequently as students become more adept and confident with the strategies. Eventually, responsibility for leading the small-group discussions of the text and the strategies is handed over to the students. This gives the teacher or reading tutor the opportunity to diagnose strengths, weaknesses, misconceptions, and to provide follow-up as needed. Reciprocal teaching encompasses several techniques involving the who, what, and where, of learning (Mayer, 475-476):Mayer, R.E. (2008). Learning and instruction. (2 ed.) Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. * What is learned are cognitive strategies for reading comprehension rather than specific facts and procedures. The teaching focuses on how to learn rather than what to learn. * Learning of the cognitive strategies occurs within real reading comprehension tasks rather than having each strategy taught in isolation. Learning takes place in an order, rather than learning everything separately. * Students learn as apprentices within a cooperative learning group that is working together on a task. The students are learning through themselves, and through the others in their group.  Current uses  The reciprocal teaching model has been in use for the past 20 years (Williams, 2011) and has been adopted by a number of school districts and reading intervention programs across the United States and Canada. It has also been used as the model for a number of commercially produced reading programs such as Soar to Success, Connectors, Into Connectors. Unfortunately, according to Williams, most students and teachers in this country have \\"never even heard of it\\" (2011). Available from Global Ed in New Zealand, written by Jill Eggleton is the Connectors and Into Connectors Series. These two series have both non fiction and fiction text. (2015) Abrams Learning Trends publishers Key Links Peer Readers by Jill Eggleton (2016) Reciprocal teaching is also being adopted and researched in countries other than the United States. For example, Yu-Fen Yang of Taiwan conducted a study to develop a reciprocal teaching/learning strategy in remedial English reading classes (2010). Yang's study concluded that \\"...students expressed that they observed and learned from the teacher’s or their peers’ externalization of strategy usage. Students’ reading progress in the remedial instruction incorporating the RT system was also identified by the pre- and post-tests. This study suggests that there may be benefits for teachers in encouraging students to interact with others in order to clarify and discuss comprehension questions and constantly monitor and regulate their own reading\\" (2010). In a 2008 study presented effective implementation of reciprocal teaching to students diagnosed with mild to moderate forms of disability. Within this group, ten percent of students had difficulty in learning due to Down Syndrome. The average of the participants was around eighteen years of age. The researchers, Miriam Alfassi, Itzhak Weiss, and Hefziba Lifshitz, developed a study based on Palincsar and Brown's design of reciprocal teaching for students who were considered academically too low for the complex skills of reading comprehension. The study compared two styles of teaching, remediation/direct instruction to Palincsar/Brown reciprocal teaching. After twelve weeks of instruction and assessments, reciprocal teaching was found to produce a greater success rate in improving the literacy skills in the participants with mild to moderate learning disabilities. After the study was completed, researchers recommended reciprocal teaching so that students are taught in an interactive environment that includes meaningful and connected texts. This research for the European Journal of Special Needs Education, promotes reciprocal teaching for its structure in dialogues and how students learn to apply those dialogues based on the reading taking place in instruction.Alfassi,Miriam; Weiss,Itzhak; Lifshitz,Hefziba. (2008) The efficacy of reciprocal teaching in fostering the reading literacy of students with intellectual disabilities. Oxford: Routledge Taylor & Frances Group Currently in the United States research has also been conducted on the use of reciprocal teaching in primary grades. Pilonieta and Medina conducted a series of procedures to implement their version of reciprocal teaching in elementary school students (2009). The researchers adopted an age-appropriate model for reciprocal teaching and called it \\"Reciprocal Teaching for the Primary Grades,\\" or RTPG (2009). Their research shows that even in younger children, reciprocal teaching apparently benefited the students and they showed retention of the RTPG when re-tested 6 months later (2009). Reciprocal teaching has been heralded as effective in helping students improve their reading ability in pre-post trials or research studies (Pearson & Doyle, 1987; Pressley et al., 1987)Carter, C. (1997). Why reciprocal teaching? Educational Leadership. 5464. Further trials employing Reciprocal Teaching have consistently indicated the technique promotes reading comprehension as measured on standardized reading tests (Carter, 1997).  Vygotsky connection  In \\"Thought and Language\\" Lev Vygotsky limns the profound connection between (oral) language,cognition and learning. Refer to Learning by Teaching for additional evidence. The intensive oral language component in Reciprocal Teaching is Vygotskian. Reciprocal Teaching is a contemporary application of Vygotsky's theories; it is used to improve students' ability to learn from text. In this method, teacher and students collaborate in learning and practicing four key skills: summarizing, questioning, clarifying, and predicting. The teacher's role in the process is reduced over time. Also, reciprocal teaching is relevant to instructional concepts such as \\"scaffolding\\" and \\"apprenticeship\\", in which a teacher or more advanced peer helps to structure or arrange a task so that a novice can work on it successfully.Mcleod, S. A. (2007). Simply Psychology; Vygotsky. Retrieved 6 December 2011, from http://www.simplypsychology.org/vygotsky.html The design of this instructional method was influenced primarily by the work of Vygotsky and his notion of a “zone of proximal development,” which he characterized as “the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance, or in collaboration with more capable peers” (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 86).Vygotsky. L. S. (1978). Mind in society: The development of the higher psychological processes. Cambridge, MA: The Harvard University Press. The assistance provided the learner is a good example of scaffolding in that both temporary and adjusted support is provided, according to the needs of the participants. The assistance is withdrawn when it is no longer needed. The sequence of teacher modeling, coaching, and then fading also provides an excellent example of the structure of a cognitive apprenticeship as outlined by Collins, Brown, and Newman (1989).Collins, A., Brown, J. S., & Newman, S. (1989). Cognitive apprenticeship: Teaching the craft of reading, writing, and mathematics. In L.

The title of the film refers to Tel Aviv, a relatively peaceful city in a tumultuous region and the setting of the film. Plot Noam, a young Israeli reservist working at a checkpoint while on reserve duty, is crushed when he witnesses a Palestinian woman giving birth to a dead baby; he also locks eyes with a young Palestinian man there, Ashraf. He then gets back to Tel Aviv as he has finished his military service. There he shares a flat with another gay man, Yali, and a woman, Lulu, who works in a soap shop. The three roommates live a generally bohemian life. Ashraf arrives at the apartment to return Noam's passport, which he had dropped and left at the checkpoint. Noam takes Ashraf to the roof to look at the city skyline. They talk and Ashraf kisses Noam and they spend the night together. Soon it is agreed that Ashraf will move in with them and work in Yali's restaurant as a Jew under the name Shimi, as he could not be openly gay in the Palestinian territories like he can in the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Tel Aviv. For a time, all goes well for the couple despite some jealousy on the part of Yali. However, Ashraf flees to his family in Nablus when he is recognized by Lulu's former boyfriend as a Palestinian. Ashraf does not return any of Noam's calls. Noam is devastated by Ashraf's desertion, and refuses to get out of bed. When the news reports violence in Ashraf's hometown, Noam becomes worried. He and Lulu go to the West Bank identifying themselves as French television journalists and find Ashraf at his parents' house and there the two men kiss. Ashraf's future brother-in-law, Jihad (who is a Hamas militant), sees them and repudiates him, adding that Ashraf has to marry his cousin or he will reveal his secret. Lulu and Noam leave in a hurry, but encourage Ashraf to come to their anti-occupation rave party. Ashraf shows up, and he and Noam spend another night together. Before his sister's wedding ceremony, Ashraf tells her he is in love with a man. She angrily refuses to believe him, and Ashraf is devastated. Later, during the wedding, he overhears Jihad planning a bombing in Tel Aviv. Yali is maimed in the bombing, and will never walk again. The next morning, Ashraf's sister is killed by stray bullets in a military raid seeking those responsible for the Tel Aviv bombing, before his very eyes. At the funeral Jihad promises revenge, telling Ashraf's father that his daughter was a martyr and will not die in vain. Jihad once again demands that Ashraf marry his cousin, revealing a poster of Ashraf's involvement with the Israeli rave. It is clear at this point that Ashraf is walled in and feels no hope of escape from his situation. His brother-in-law, Jihad, decides to avenge the death of his newlywed bride, and while creating a suicide video, Ashraf decides to take Jihad's place as a suicide bomber in Tel Aviv. Ashraf wanders the streets of Tel Aviv with a sorrowful and blank expression. He winds up at the cafe in which he once worked. When Ashraf primes his explosive belt, Noam sees him from inside the bar where he has just bought Yali's and Lulu's dinner, and rushes out to Ashraf. Seeing Noam, Ashraf walks away from the bar to the middle of the street. As Noam approaches, Ashraf turns to face him. The two stare at each other and start to kiss when the bomb explodes, killing them both. The news report that Ashraf avoided more death by suddenly turning away from the cafe into the empty street. The film ends with Noam talking about the love the two shared, wondering whether they ever had a chance, wishing for a place where they can just love each other, and hoping that people will see \\"how stupid these wars are\\", over a scene of young Noam and young Ashraf playing together as children in Jerusalem, their mothers sitting side by side. Cast * Ohad Knoller as Noam * Yousef (Joe) Sweid as Ashraf * as Lulu * Alon Friedman as Yali * Zohar Liba as Golan * Ruba Blal as Rana * Shredy Jabarin as Jihad Production The Bubble might be the most personally important film that Eytan Fox has created. In telling about his experiences with coming out of the closet, he described the struggle he and his father experienced in reaching an understanding, which only truly was achieved around the time of filming this project. Very shortly after the film's premiere, and after confessing his final understanding of his son, Eytan's father died due to a heart attack. Critical reception The film received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 51% out of 39 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 5.8/10. The public gave the film an 84% approval rating.The Bubble (Ha Buah) - Rotten Tomatoes Michael Phillips from the Chicago Tribune wrote “Director and co-writer Eytan Fox is going for a sexually democratic, politically aware variation on story themes familiar to “Sex and the City” viewers. (At one point Lulu is referred to as “Miss Israeli Carrie Bradshaw.”) Surprisingly, it works, and the entire cast is excellent.” Sylvie Simmons from the San Francisco Chronicle wrote “The Bubble surprises us at every turn.” Dennis Harvey from Variety wrote “Eytan Fox delivers another involving tale in The Bubble.” Background * Eytan Fox has admitted that the film might have been prompted by his memory of falling in love with a Palestinian man when he was going through his military service, when he was eighteen, although he did not follow this through.Têtu, July–August 2007 issue, page 24 * The film was originally meant to be titled Romeo and Julio in reference to Romeo and Juliet, but it was changed to The Bubble after Eytan Fox was told it would sound like a porn movie.

The character subsequently appeared in Spider-Woman #19 (October 1979), #27-29 (June–August 1980), Ghost Rider #58 (July 1981), and Spider-Woman #50 (June 1983). He was killed by the Scourge of the Underworld in Iron Man #194 (May 1985). The Enforcer received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #17. Fictional character biography =Charles L. Delazny, Jr.= Charles L. Delazny, Jr. was born in San Jose, California. He is a criminal mercenary and son of Charles L. Delazny Sr. who owned Delazny studios. Beginning a criminal career, he employs an elderly scientist named Dr. Ignatz Goldman, who designs Charles' costume. Charles then takes on the costumed identity of the Enforcer. To obtain a disintegrator ray generator, Enforcer hires Gladiator to steal if from Eel, who was in possession of the device. Enforcer encounters Eel in the alley and claims the device as Gladiator kills Eel. Enforcer brings the device to Dr. Goldman to be miniaturized.Ghost Rider vol. 2 #21 Dr. Goldman presents the disintegrator ray device in the form of a medallion. Enforcer arrives at the Belaire mansion to confront the \\"boss\\" of the criminal organization that gained control of Delazny studios. He then announces that he is taking over the organization. When the boss of the criminal organization threatens the Enforcer, he is disintegrated. The boss' henchmen then swear allegiance to Enforcer. Dr. Goldman then miniaturizes it further into a ring. As Enforcer and his henchmen head to San Diego Naval Yards, they are followed by Ghost Rider. During Enforcer's fight with the shore patrol, he is attacked by Ghost Rider. The two battle until they both fall into the water. Enforcer escapes, but his ring falls off into the water during the fight.Ghost Rider vol. 2 #22 Enforcer approaches Water Wizard and offers him a million dollars if he can eliminate Ghost Rider. Water Wizard uses his powers to create 1,000 liquid beings to help recover Enforcer's ring from the bottom of San Diego Harbor. Enforcer later has Water Wizard ambush Ghost Rider, which ends with Ghost Rider being knocked out and turning back into Johnny Blaze.Ghost Rider vol. 2 #23 Enforcer has the unconscious Johnny Blaze strapped to a motorcycle and sent off the cliff. Johnny regains consciousness and turns into Ghost Rider as the motorcycle goes off the cliff. Returning to his underwater base with Water Wizard, Enforcer reveals that he planned to use Delazny's money to build a criminal empire. Enforcer then decides that Dr. Goldman has served his purpose. As he is about to disintegrate Dr. Goldman, Ghost Rider shows up and defeats Enforcer and Water Wizard. Ghost Rider contacts the authorities and tells them where to find the villains.Ghost Rider vol. 2 #24 Enforcer manages to recover before the authorities arrive. In his civilian form, Enforcer convinces the authorities that Carson Collier Jr. was the Enforcer, causing Carson to be arrested for Enforcer's crimes. Charles Delazny Sr. soon figures out that his own son is the Enforcer.Official Handbook of Marvel Deluxe Edition #17 While gathering info on Ghost Rider, Doctor Druid visits Charles Delazny Jr. and uses his powers to probe his mind. He learns that his son is the Enforcer.Ghost Rider vol 2. #26 The Committee later hires Enforcer and gives him a modified automated pistol to replace his disintegrator ring. His first assignment is to \\"silence\\" writer Buck Cowan (who was about to expose the Committee's activities to the cops). Enforcer kills Buck Cowan's former employer.Werewolf by Night #42-43 The Committee informs Enforcer that Buck Cowan's friend is Jack Russell and the fact that Jack is also Werewolf by Night.Spider-Woman #19 (October 1979) Enforcer confronts Cowan at Russell's apartment. Russel transforms, but is unable to stop the Enforcer from using his \\"tingler\\" (a device which attaches to the victim's spine and causes him to ignite into flames if he tries to tell anyone about the Enforcer) on Cowan. The fight draws the attention of Spider-Woman, who defeats the Enforcer and leaves him for the police. While in custody, Enforcer attempts to confuse the police by claiming that he is Carson Collier Jr. His deception is not exposed until he makes his escape. While \\"Carson Collier\\" is serving time in California State Prison, he receives a private visit from newspaper tycoon Rupert M. Dockery. Dockery contrives to leave behind a cane with a hidden blade, allowing the Enforcer and four other inmates to overpower the guards and make their escape. Enforcer then plans revenge against Spider-Woman. He steals the only bronze representation of Anasi the Spider from the Los Angeles Museum of Anthropology and Folk Art in order to lure Spider-Woman to him, then defeats and captures her. When her criminologist partner Scotty McDowall tries to rescue her, the Enforcer shoots him with a psycho-chemical incendiary dart.Spider-Woman #27 (June 1980) Enforcer offers to give Spider-Woman the antidote if she helps him steal $10,000,000, enough for him to retire from his super-villain career. He strings her along for some weeks, during which the two of them work together to pull off three major heists. He then reveals to her that he never had any antidote for his darts, and gloats over the fact that she has made herself as much a wanted criminal as him for nothing. To complete his revenge, he voluntarily turns himself over to the police, thus depriving Spider-Woman of even the satisfaction of apprehending him.Spider- Woman #28-29 (July–August 1980) The Enforcer is soon at large again. The police are undetermined if Enforcer is actually Carson Collier yet. Enforcer is later hired by some gamblers to fix the rematch between Johnny Blaze and Flagg Fargo. Enforcer meets with Flagg Fargo and threatens to kill him if he doesn't take a dive. During the racing, Enforcer shoots Flagg Fargo, causing him to crash into some cars. While everyone is distracted, Enforcer goes to the stadium box office and robs it of $300,000 of ticket receipts. Enforcer shoots two guards with his tranquilizer darts and escapes in his souped-up car. He is pursued by Ghost Rider. Enforcer fires a missile from his car's bomb bay to destroy the bridge and cut off Ghost Rider's pursuit, but Ghost Rider takes the long way around. Finding himself racing against Ghost Rider on a narrow road high above the lake, Enforcer drives his car off the precipice and into the lake.

This Enforcer is Mike Nero, the nephew of the original Enforcer. Following the death of his uncle, Mike Nero became the new Enforcer and learned how to deal with supernatural threats where he started to develop a reputation by killing werewolves, zombies, a vampire, and a Maggia crime lord. Enforcer then stole an Aztec exhibit from a museum. He was then apprehended by the Wrecking Crew who hauled him to the Hood (who also sought out the money he owed to a loan shark named Nicky Bats). The Wrecking Crew surrounded Enforcer in one of Hood's hideouts as Hood inspected Enforcer's stash of mystical artifacts and offered Enforcer a role in his criminal organization as its supernatural expert. Enforcer triggered an amulet disguising a creature that fed off demonic energies, which then clasped onto Hood's face. Enforcer used his magic bullets on the Wrecking Crew and escapes through a glass window, declaring that he was just getting started. After Enforcer's escape, Hood swore his revenge on Enforcer.Dark Reign: Made Men #1 (one-shot) Powers and equipment The first Enforcer wore body armor with a silver-nitrate covered vest for protection from werewolves. He carried two .45 caliber guns with which he used normal ammunition, silver bullets, tranquilizer pellets, pyrogranulate capsules, and a \\"tingler\\" that changes the victim's metabolism, causing the victim to burst into flame by post-hypnotic command. He also wore a disintegrator amulet, later in the form of a ring.

The game was first released in March 2001 for Microsoft Windows. The story takes place in Britain, where Detective Brent Halligan, an inspector at Scotland Yard, investigates a brutal series of murders committed in England. The investigation leads Detective Halligan into a mystery surrounding the demise of the British Order of Druids and eventually takes him on a trip through time itself. Nordic Games announced on December 5, 2014 that it had acquired the game's intellectual property.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot A large portion of the game-play in The Mystery of the Druids consists of discovering clues and solving puzzles. Clues are mainly found by moving the computer mouse over various objects on the screen and clicking them to add them to the inventory or gain information about them. Puzzles are often solved by combining items, using drag and drop gestures, after which the player must figure out how the newly created item is used. Many actions in the game require the completion of such puzzles, such as being able to use a telephone. Interaction with non-player characters is accomplished through dialog trees. These conversations with non-player characters are essential to playing the game, as many of the major plot points are revealed through conversation rather than through investigating the environment.  Plot  Detective Brent Halligan The Mystery of the Druids begins with a dark ceremony at Stonehenge in 1000 AD, where all but a few of the druids are enveloped in a supernatural glow before being consumed by fire. In 2000, at New Scotland Yard in London, Detective Brent Halligan has been assigned to investigate a series of brutal murders known as the \\"Skeleton Murders\\". Assisting him with his investigation is Dr. Melanie Turner, an anthropologist at the Oxford Anthropological Museum, who, along with historian Arthur Blake, discovers that the murders match the description of cannibalistic sacrificial rites performed by Britannic druids. It is later revealed that a demonic superior druid seized power over the druids in order to force mankind to submit to his rule by performing a \\"final ritual\\", which would transfer the knowledge and power of the druids to five infants known as the \\"Inheritors\\". The ritual was not entirely completed, but the Inheritors are strong and powerful enough to complete the ritual themselves. While investigating a lead regarding a group of neo-Druids called \\"The Circle\\", Halligan is captured and held prisoner by their leader, Lord Sinclair. Halligan escapes, but discovers The Circle performing a human sacrifice and faints. Halligan awakens at dinner and, unbeknownst to him, is eating human flesh which grants strength and power, but also makes them susceptible to brainwashing. Turner is led to Lord Sinclair's estate through information which Halligan had left at her museum, after which she is able to sneak in to the property. She finds an artifact, the Amulet of Transformation, which may be required to complete the Final Ritual. Halligan discovers her and a fight ensues before she is able to knock him unconscious. As he awakens, he discovers that he was brainwashed. He discerns Sinclair's plan, which is to put a curse on the world in order to enslave humanity. If Turner is noticed while trying to rescue Halligan, Lord Sinclair's security will capture her. She is brought inside, where a brainwashed Halligan, who does not seem to recognize her, informs her that she will be the guest of honor for their dinner. A few days later, the skeleton of Turner is found in a forest near London. Halligan is listed as missing and last seen leaving his Scotland Yard department. Blake is killed by Sinclair, but he points them in the direction of the Twelve Bridges ruins. Once there, Halligan and Turner are sent back in time. Halligan stumbles on the site of the ritual and attempts to disrupt it, but is interrupted by the demonic druid Serstan, who holds Turner hostage. A staff that Halligan had found is bartered for Turner's life and a promise, on his honor, not to harm Halligan or Turner. Serstan agrees and begins the ritual, whereupon Halligan and Turner are transported back to their own time. Halligan and Turner rush to Stonehenge where The Circle is attempting to complete the final ritual. Halligan stabs Turner with scissors and informs Serstan that the vow has been broken, causing Serstan to intervene and cause the Circle to disappear and preventing the ritual from being completed. Turner is near death, but Halligan is able to save her using magical mistletoe, after which they share a kiss.  Development  cdv Software Entertainment revealed The Mystery of the Druids, then titled The Heirs of the Druids, to IGN on July 12, 2000. It was developer House of Tales' first release. The Mystery of the Druids was advertised as containing \\"50 detailed locations\\", \\"360 interactive scenes\\" and \\"20 speaking characters\\". It also blended \\"2D and 3D graphics, including character models with up to 1000 polygons.\\" A playable game demo was released on May 25, 2001 which featured game-play up to the Anthropology Museum in Oxford. A second game demo was released later that year on September 25, which included the time travel scene to prevent the ancient ritual which resulted in the creation of the Inheritors. The first trailer was released on August 14, 2001 and featured game-play videos of Detective Halligan. A second trailer was released on August 30 which showcased the various locations of the game, as well as the druidic ritual which is seen at the beginning of the game. The third and final trailer was released on September 6, 2001. This trailer introduced the romance between Detective Halligan and Dr. Melanie Turner as it progresses throughout the game.  Reception  =Domestic= In the German market, The Mystery of the Druids debuted at #29 on Media Control's computer game sales chart for March 2001. Alex Watson of GameSpot UK wrote that the game had become a \\"big hit\\" in Germany by July. The German publication Golem.de similarly reported that the game was \\"quite successful\\". Writing for Golem.de, Thorsten Wiesner commented, \\"The exciting story and the atmospheric game design are big pluses, but deficiencies in control and some weak graphics are also clear negatives—with a little more care, The Mystery of the Druids could have been a much better title.\\" =International= The Mystery of the Druids received mostly negative reviews. Brett Todd of Computer Games Magazine proclaimed it \\"poorly designed, ugly, and rife with bugs.\\" Computer and Video Games derided its \\"unimaginative settings and painful dialogue\\" as well as its inclusion of \\"some of the most ridiculously complex puzzle sequences to achieve even the simplest of tasks\\" before deciding that it has \\"very little appeal for anyone but the most patient and geeky PC-head.\\" GameSpot described its characters as \\"rude\\", its puzzles and dialogue branches as \\"confusing\\", and the game overall as \\"surprisingly devoid of plot.\\" GameSpy described it as being a game that might make customers \\"take matters into their own hands and put the [adventure game] genre out of its misery\\". In a positive review, PC Zones Mark Hill wrote that the title's \\"closest gaming relatives are Broken Sword and the Blade Runner game, [but] Druids is far superior to both.\\" He summarized it as \\"best serious adventure game in years\\". Legacy In retrospect, Martin Ganteföhr characterized The Mystery of the Druids as an important learning experience for House of Tales, despite its mistakes and many negative reviews. He said after its release: House of Tales followed The Mystery of the Druids with The Moment of Silence in 2004, and later with Overclocked: A History of Violence (2008). In 2018, Ganteföhr worked with Daedalic Entertainment to create the game State of Mind.

Wight was a prolific run scorer at the top of the order, scoring 16,965 runs during his thirteen years at Somerset; and at the time of his death only Harold Gimblett had made more runs for the county. After playing, he became an umpire in English first-class cricket, standing in matches from 1966 to 1995. Early life His family was a mix of Scottish and Portuguese blood with good cricketing talent. His cousin, Vibart Wight had represented the West Indies twice, acting as vice-captain in the third Test against England in 1928. His elder brother Leslie Wight also went on to play Test cricket for the West Indies, while his other brothers represented British Guiana at cricket, hockey, tennis and soccer. Wight came to England at the age of 20, arriving on a cargo boat in 1951. The conditions in England came as a shock to him, with rationing and outside toilets still prevalent. He had arrived in the country with the intention of studying engineering, but his employer in Burnley refused to release him, as promised, for his motor mechanic exams. With this, he emigrated to Toronto before returning to Lancashire to work in a factory. Career =Playing career= In 1953, he was scoring runs for Burnley Cricket Club in the Lancashire League when his brother-in-law suggested he try out for Somerset. He impressed in the nets and was selected to play in a trial game, against the touring Australians. A shaky start saw him dismissed for a first-innings duck but he scored a century in the second-innings and was offered a Somerset contract. Wight passed 1,000 runs in a season for the first of ten successive years during 1954; his first full season with the county, totalling 1,343 runs in 50 first-class innings. The following year he made his maiden County Championship century, with 106 in the first innings of a nine wicket victory over Worcestershire. The next three seasons proceeded in a similar fashion, with Wight scoring runs with an average fluctuating between the high twenties and low thirties, failing to make the big scores needed to boost it further. It was during the 1959 season that he truly established himself as one of the leading batsmen in English cricket, despite missing a number of games due to eye problems. He finished the season with 1,874 runs, and with the joint second highest batting average (of those playing more than 2 innings) in the County Championship, behind only M. J. K. Smith. His career best score came also during this season, when he achieved 222* for Somerset against the visiting Kent at the County Ground, Taunton. =Coaching and umpiring career= When he was released by Somerset in 1965 he had scored 16,965 runs for the county. After retiring he opened a cricket school in Bath and spent 30 summers as an umpire. He umpired 567 games in total and when added to his games as a player he holds the record for most first-class appearances in Post-War England. Honours =First-class= * Passed 1,000 first-class runs in a season: 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963 * Passed 2,000 first-class runs in a season: 1960, 1962 * County Championship leading run-scorer: 1960 =Miscellaneous= * Named as one of the Playfair Cricket Annual Eleven Cricketers of the Year in 1961.

Biography and Career Born of an Iraqi father and German mother, Laith grew up in the United States and Mannheim, Germany. He achieved first fame with his debut album, Ich will nur wissen (English: I Only Want to Know), from which came his first two singles, Bilder von Dir (English: Pictures of you, German version of the 1995 hit Everlasting Pictures of B-Zet with Darlesia) and Kleine Helden (English: Little Heroes). His second album, Melomanie, released in 2002, resulted in the singles Dein Lied (English: Your Song) and Jetzt, Hier, Immer (English: Now, Here, Always), and was just as successful as his debut album. Laith was also nominated for the Comet, a music award given by the German broadcaster VIVA in the category of Hip hop/R&B;, which he declined, saying that he would only seek recognition for German-language music rather than an international award At the beginning of 2004, Laith released the album Für Alle (English: For Everyone), which was seen a continuation of his previous musical style. The album reached the top spot on the German album charts and was Laith's greatest commercial success. The single taken from Für Alle, Alles an dir (English: Everything About You), reached #21 on the German charts, the highest position for one of Laith's singles up to that point. The second single taken from the album, Höher (English: Higher) was one of the finalists for Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004. In the fall of 2004, Laith produced a live album, which performed well on the German charts for several weeks. In September 2005 a DualDisc of this live album was released, with the entire album rerecorded in 5.1 surround sound. In June 2007 a new album, Die Liebe zum Detail (English: The Love For Detail) and a new single, Keine wie du (English: No One Like You), were released.

Biblehub Biblical accounts =Book of Isaiah= * Isaiah 14:29: \\"Do not rejoice, all you of Philistia, because the rod that struck you is broken; for out of the serpent's roots will come a viper, and its offspring will be a fiery flying serpent.\\"Isaiah 14:29. Multiple versions. Biblehub * Isaiah 30:6: \\"The burden against the beasts of the South. Through a land of trouble and anguish, from which came the lioness and the lion, the viper and the fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches on the backs of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people who shall not profit;\\"Isaiah 30:6. Multiple versions. Biblehub =Other sources= References to \\"fiery serpents\\" lacking a mention of flight can be found in several places in the Hebrew Bible. * \\"Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;\\" * \\"(6) And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. (7) Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. (8) And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.\\" This symbol, the Nehushtan, is similar to the ancient Greek Rod of Asklepios (frequently confused with the caduceus) and is frequently cited as an instance of the same archetype.

He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1999 for covering the transfer of American satellite-launch technology to China. He broke stories about the Whitewater controversy and the Chinese scientist Wen Ho Lee. Both stories turned out to sorely lacking in truth or basis (references?). Both stories, Whitewater and Wen Ho Lee there is a very disturbing pattern of not checking sources in terms of credibility and alleging wrongdoing when none exists (references?). Ken Starr didn't mention Whitewater in his exhaustive report, probably because his investigation had nothing to do with the potential criminal activity in the Whitewater case. On September 26, 2000, The New York Times apologized for significant errors in reporting of the case.[27] Lee and Helen Zia would later write a book, My Country Versus Me, in which he described Risen and Gerth's work as a \\"hatchet job on me, and a sloppy one at that\\", and he points out numerous factual errors in Risen and Gerth's reporting.[28] The New York Times was one of five newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, which jointly agreed to pay damages to settle a lawsuit concerning their coverage of the case and invasion of privacy.[29][30] Biography Gerth attended Shaker Heights High School in Ohio in the 1960s, where he was a member of the Junior Council on World Affairs and captain of the golf team. He was a varsity golfer at Northwestern University where he got a degree in business administration. Gerth began his career not in newspapers but in the marketing department of Standard Oil of Ohio; he was assigned to write down license plates of vehicles pulling in and out of gas stations to find out why drivers were choosing Standard Oil's rivals. Professional career Gerth worked for the 1972 George McGovern presidential campaign, investigating some aspects of the Watergate scandal. Then he did some freelance journalism, including an exposé of the La Costa resort's ties to organized crime that ran in Penthouse. Gerth, and his co- author, Lowell Bergman, were sued, along with Penthouse, by the founders of the resort for more than half a billion dollars. Before trial, Gerth and Bergman both settled and apologized. Gerth also collaborated with Seymour Hersh of The New York Times, who recommended that the newspaper should hire him. Gerth joined the newspaper in 1976 and spent most of his career in their Washington, D.C. bureau.Blood Sport, James Stewart, Simon & Schuster. In March 1992, Gerth revealed that beginning in 1978, while Bill Clinton was Arkansas attorney general, he and his wife Hillary were partners in an Ozark real estate deal with James B. McDougal. When Clinton was governor, McDougal controlled a bank and Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan. Gerth's stories raised the question of whether it was appropriate for a governor to be in business partnership with someone having immediate financial interests in an industry regulated by the state. Gerth's reporting was criticized by liberal columnist Gene Lyons for \\"not particularly fair or balanced stories that combine a prosecutorial bias and the art of tactical omission.\\" Other criticisms centered on the unclear time line - it was difficult to pick out that Bill Clinton was Attorney General, not Governor, at the time the partnership was created, and that Jim McDougal did not own a business regulated by the state until passage of the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act in 1982, 4 years after creation of the partnership. (See The Hunting of the President, particularly the book.) Gerth reported a controversial Sunday meeting between Clinton and his personal secretary, Betty Currie. At the meeting, according to Currie, Clinton asked her a number of sensitive questions, including whether she remembered his ever being alone with Monica Lewinsky. From April to December 1998, Gerth and others at The New York Times covered, or uncovered, \\"the corporate sale of American technology to China, with U.S. government approval despite national security risks, prompting investigations and significant changes in policy.\\" The 1999 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting recognized The New York Times staff, and notably Jeff Gerth. On March 6, 1999, Gerth reported that an unidentified Chinese American, later identified as Wen Ho Lee, stole secrets for U.S. nuclear bombs. A government official was quoted as saying the case was \\"going to be just as bad as the Rosenbergs.\\" FBI investigators waved the story in front of Lee as they interrogated him. Judge James Parker eventually dropped all charges against Lee, stating, \\"I sincerely apologize to you, Dr. Lee, for the unfair manner you were held in captivity\\", describing Lee's nine months in solitary confinement as having \\"embarrassed our nation and all of its citizens.\\" Although he wrote some of the paper's most visible stories, Gerth himself kept a low profile. Balding and professorial, he shunned interviews, refused to give speeches and declined TV talk show appearances. In 2004, Gerth was a visiting professor at Princeton University, where he taught an undergraduate seminar on investigative reporting. He left The New York Times in 2005, and joined the staff of ProPublica in February 2008.\\"Noted Reporters and Web Technologist Join New Investigative Team\\", ProPublica, Feb. 19, 2008. With his former colleague at The New York Times, Don Van Natta, Jr., Gerth wrote an investigative biography about Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton entitled, Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton. It was published in June 2007 by Little, Brown and Company. Gerth and Van Natta were reportedly offered a $1 million advance.\\"The United States of America vs. Bill Keller\\", New York Magazine, Sep. 11, 2006. His New York Times articles on Wen Ho Lee are mentioned in the play Yellow Face by David Henry Hwang. In Yellow Face, Gerth's character is only referred to as \\"Name Withheld on Advice of Counsel\\". =Personal= Gerth married at thirty-nine and became a father a year later. His wife, Janice O'Connell, worked on the Foreign Relations Committee for Senator Christopher Dodd, who, during the 1996 Presidential campaign, chaired the Democratic National Committee. Gerth recused himself from any campaign coverage.

Croissant was shown by Kurt Rebmann, then Attorney General of Germany, \\"to have organized his cabinet the operational reserve of West German terrorism\\". A campaign against his imprisonment was organized in which, in particular, Jean-Paul Sartre and Michel Foucault took part. He was released on bail and absconded to France on 10 July 1977. He was apprehended in Paris on 30 September. He applied for political asylum but his plea was rejected by the court of criminal appeal of the Court of Appeal of Paris and an extradition order made on 16 November 1977 despite some protests in Germany, France and Italy. He was extradited to West Germany the following day. In a platform published in Le Monde on 2 November 1977, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari wrote: He was sentenced to two-and-a-half years' imprisonment for supporting a designated terrorist organization.

A class of 2012 ring, \\"For More Than Ourselves\\". A USMA class ring, class of 2012, \\"For More Than Ourselves\\". The cadets of the United States Military Academy first began the practice of wearing class rings in 1835. The United States Military Academy class ring has traditionally been worn on the left hand, but most recent graduates choose to wear it on their right hand, which is likely in response to the dilemma posed by wearing both a West Point ring and a wedding ring on the same finger.CLASS RINGS, MINIATURES, AND A-PINS Some graduates choose to wear both on their left hand. While at West Point, the ring is worn so that the class crest is worn to the inside and closest to one's heart. Upon graduation, the ring is worn so that the West Point crest is closest to the heart.CLASS RINGS, MINIATURES, AND A-PINS  Class rings within West Point culture  Ring Weekend is a tradition at the United States Military Academy where senior cadets are awarded their West Point class ring. West Point was the first American school to have class rings. It is awarded to senior cadets shortly after the start of their senior year, after which there is a formal dinner and dance (called a \\"hop\\" in cadet slang) following the ceremony for the cadets and their guests. After the ring ceremony, Firsties are mobbed by plebes reciting the \\"Ring Poop\\": The term \\"ringknocker\\" refers to the alleged custom of some graduates to gently rap their ring against a hard surface in social situations; this serves as an unobtrusive signal of their status to any other graduates in the vicinity. However, a negative social-networking connotation also associates with the term, in that the term \\"implies that if there is a discussion in progress, the senior (West) Pointer need only knock his large ring on the table and all Pointers present are obliged to rally to his point of view.\\" Broughton, Jack (2007). Rupert Red Two: A Fighter Pilot's Life from Thunderbolts to Thunderchiefs, Zenith Press, , 141. Broughton is a 1945 USMA graduate.  Ring design  Cadets choose their ring several months in advance, selecting everything from size (the traditional large and heavy men's casting, or the less bulky women's version), color (white gold, yellow gold, or no-luster palladium), and stone (some rings are all gold and embossed with the West Point seal where the stone would have been set). Some cadets opt to \\"inherit\\" pieces of rings from other family members or mentors who have also graduated from West Point. The rings are customized for each cadet, and there are very few standard-seen practices, save the use of symbol black onyx and gold to represent the school colors, but this is seen in a minority of rings. West Point alumni may donate their rings to be added to the smelting pot when a new batch of rings are cast. Also, the stone from an older ring can be removed and placed into a new graduate's ring. There are also ring-related souvenirs. Students can pick out items for family members made to resemble their class ring such as cufflinks, pendants, and pins. All these items of jewelry bear the same markings as the top of the ring: the words \\"West Point\\", the year the Cadet graduated (e.g., West Point 2005), and stones matching the cadet's class ring. By longstanding custom, many graduates choose to present a miniature of the West Point ring as an engagement ring. President Eisenhower, then a young lieutenant, gave a miniature to Mamie Eisenhower as the couple's engagement ring. Early Use In early years, Class rings often contained a reverse motif seal crest that was often used for wax sealing of both official military and personal correspondence. This to aid the senders authenticity. Tradition has it that the seal was broken upon the owners death to prevent its use by other persons.

These were the middle two Saxon castes, below the nobility and above the unfree. The aim of the Stellinga was to recover those rights the two castes had possessed before their conversion from Germanic paganism in the 770s. At that time they had still possessed political privileges, but Charlemagne, having won over to his cause the Saxon nobility, had reduced them to mere peasants. The Stellinga thus despised the Lex Saxonum (law of the Saxons), which had been codified by Charlemagne, preferring to live in accordance with ancient and unwritten tribal custom.Goldberg, 482. The movement was violently resisted by the uppermost caste, the nobiles (nobility), not always with the support of the Frankish kings. Saxon conditions 838-841 During the civil war of 840-843 in the Carolingian Empire, between the heirs of Louis the Pious, the Stellinga had the support of Lothair I, who promised to grant them the rights they had had when formerly pagan and whom they in turn promised to support for the throne of East Francia. Saxony, on the eve of the Stelling uprising, was divided into two noble factions: the Saxons supportive of Hattonid influence (and thus of imperial unity) and the Saxones sollicitati, who were allied with Louis the German in his invasion of Alemannia in 839. When Louis the Pious died, the German Louis deposed the Hattonid leader Banzleib from his royal offices and bestowed them on the Abbey of Corvey.Goldberg, 488. Among Louis's chief supporters in Saxony were the Ecbertiner and the Bardonids. Having patronised new families and removed from power old ones, Louis the German made the Saxon aristocracy his organ of government there and forced his foes, such as Lothair, to look to the lower classes for support in Saxony.Goldberg, 490. Uprising The chief sources for the Stellinga are the Annales Xantenses, Annales Bertiniani (written by Prudentius of Troyes), Annales Fuldenses (written by Rudolf of Fulda), and the Historiae of Nithard. Gerward, author of the Annales Xantenses, wrote under the year 841 that \\"throughout all of Saxony the power of the slaves rose up violently against their lords. They usurped for themselves the name Stellinga . . . [a]nd the nobles of that land were violently persecuted and humiliated by the slaves.\\"Goldberg, 467 Both Nithard and the Annales Bertiniani indicate that an anti-Christian reaction was prevalent among the Stellinga. At Speyer late in 841, Lothair and his young son Lothair II met the leaders of the Stellinga uprising, among other Saxon notables who were loyal to him. Louis the German, however, marched against the Saxon \\"freedmen seeking to oppress their lawful lords\\" and \\"crushed [them] ruthlessly by sentencing the ringleaders to death\\".AF, 841. The Saxon nobilies themselves disarmed the movement with a brutal action in 843. Historiography Modern historiography has often seen parallels between the Stellinga uprising and earlier Saxon resistance to Charlemagne, the near contemporary self-defence league formed by the peasantry of the Seine basin and crushed by the nobility in 859, and the later Liutizi uprising in 983 in favour of Slavic paganism. It was the only popular revolt recorded in Europe between the sixth century, when Gregory of Tours records several riots in protest of Merovingian taxation, and the tenth century and the 983 rebellion.Goldberg, 467 and n4. The Stellinga uprising has been studied extensively and in detail by Marxist historians in East Germany.Goldberg, 468. The Marxists formed two camps, those who saw the Stellinga as probably feudal dependents trying to free themselves from their obligations and those who saw them as essentially free men seeking to ward off the Feudalisierungsprozeß, the feudalisation of Germany. According to scholar Eric Goldberg, Marxist analysis has tended to ignore the simultaneous civil war in the Carolingian kingdoms and has mostly failed to explain why \\"exploitation\\" or \\"oppression\\" did not incite more revolts during the Middle Ages.Goldberg, 469.

Written by member Daryl Hall, the song was released as the second single from their eleventh studio album H2O on January 29, 1983. Backed by minimalistic, synthesizer-based production, the song's lyrics incorporate various sports metaphors to describe seduction. Daryl Hall performs lead vocals, while John Oates provides backing harmony vocals. It peaked at number seven on the United States Billboard Hot 100, becoming one of three top ten singles from H2O. The song's music video, directed by Mick Haggerty and C.D. Taylor, depicts Hall walking around a city street singing the song, interspersed with shots of him performing on a stage with Oates. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice named it the eighth-best video of the year in his ballot for the annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll. \\"One on One\\" has been covered and sampled by various artists and was notably used in several commercials for the National Basketball Association. Covers and samples Smooth jazz saxophonist Warren Hill covered \\"One on One\\" for his fifth studio album Life Through Rose Coloured Glasses (1998). The song was also covered by indie pop duo The Bird and the Bee for their Hall & Oates tribute album Interpreting the Masters Volume 1: A Tribute to Daryl Hall and John Oates. Indie rock band Fruit Bats performed a live rendition of \\"One on One\\" for The A.V. Clubs \\"Undercover\\" song series. Alternative hip hop group Fun Lovin' Criminals sampled \\"One on One\\" for their song \\"Sugar\\", from their album 100% Colombian (1998). The song's popularity and various lyrical references to basketball led to it being notably used in several National Basketball Association (NBA) commercials in the mid-1980s. One such commercial featured Los Angeles Lakers small forward James Worthy performing a 360-degree spin move in slow motion during the song's saxophone solo.

First Year March During orientation week before their first classes, first years exit Lerner Hall through its back doors, turn right and enter campus again through the main gates to officially become Columbia students. The Varsity Show An annual musical written by and for students, this is one of Columbia's oldest and finest traditions. Past writers and directors have included Columbians Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, Lorenz Hart, I.A.L. Diamond, and Herman Wouk. The show has one of the largest operating budgets of all university events. Orgo Night On the day before the Organic Chemistry exam--which is often on the first day of finals--at precisely the stroke of midnight, the Columbia University Marching Band occupies Butler Library to distract diligent students from studying in an attempt to raise the curve on the organic chemistry exam. After a forty-five minutes or so of jokes and music, the procession then moves out to the lawn in front of Hartley, Wallach and John Jay residence halls to entertain the residents there. The Band then plays at various other locations around Morningside Heights, including the residential quadrangle of Barnard College, where students of the all-women's school, in mock-consternation, rain trash - including notes and course packets - and water balloons upon them from their dormitories above. The Band tends to close their Orgo Night performances before Furnald Hall, known among students as the more studious and reportedly \\"anti-social\\" residence hall, where the underclassmen in the Band serenade the graduating seniors with an entertaining, though vulgar, mock-hymn to Columbia, composed of quips that poke fun at the various stereotypes about the Columbia student body. Alma mater Legend has it that the first freshman to find the owl tucked within the folds of the Daniel Chester French sculpture of Alma Mater that sits on the steps of Low Memorial Library will graduate as valedictorian. Primal Scream On the Sunday of finals week each semester, students open their windows at midnight and scream as loudly as possible. The tradition helps students release their pent up stress and anxiety about exams. Similar traditions exist at UC Santa Cruz, Stanford University, Harvard University, Cornell University, the University of Pennsylvania, Vassar College and presumably other institutes of higher learning as well. 40s on 40 With forty days remaining until graduation, seniors drink 40oz malt liquor on the steps of Low Library to celebrate their impending graduation. Regarded as a rite of passage, the event usually leaves debris on the steps and gives passing tour groups a unique impression of the school as evidenced here. In 2007, the administration attempted to make the tradition a carefully regulated event, perhaps due to incidents and complaints from previous years. Although it has been suggested that the administration chose to target a particularly festive student tradition, one might argue that regulations on 40s on 40 are in keeping with the university's increasingly stringent anti-alcohol policy. 2005, which saw a traditional 40s on 40, already ushered in the first year of mandatory online alcohol safety class for incoming freshmen (alcohol.edu). Whatever the cause, by 2008 the tradition appears to have changed entirely. At 12:00 pm only those seniors whose names were on a list (in prior years many underclassmen had joined, when possible, in wishing the seniors farewell) were allowed into a cordoned section of the steps. Students were given wristbands which were market to limit intake of light beer to one 12oz cup per hour in keeping with the oft-bemoaned regulations on alcohol events. The university catering service provided bud lite and sandwiches (vegetarian option included). At 12:05 hundreds of students were observed waiting in lines to purchase tee shirts commemorating the event. Joyce Kilmer Memorial Annual Bad Poetry Contest Beginning in 1986, the Philolexian Society has hosted this open-to-the-public event in honor of Alfred Joyce Kilmer (Class of 1908), vice president of the society and the author of \\"Trees.\\" Contestants read their wittiest and worst original poetry, hoping for cheers and the title of Poet Laureate.Newhouse News Service:If I'm as Bad as I Can Be, Won't You Please Not Publish Me? The event, which regularly draws 200 people or more, generally takes place a week before Thanksgiving. Two students have won the competition twice: Everett Patterson, Columbia College '06 in 2003 and 2005, and Stephen Blair, Columbia College '11, in 2008 and 2012. Tree-Lighting and Yule Log Ceremonies College Walk is illuminated in the winter months The campus Tree-Lighting Ceremony is a relatively new tradition at Columbia, inaugurated in 1998. It celebrates the illumination of the medium-sized trees lining College Walk in front of Kent and Hamilton Halls on the east end and Dodge and Journalism Halls on the west, just before finals week in early December. The lights remain on until February 28. Students meet at the sun- dial for free hot chocolate, performances by various a cappella groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest. Immediately following the College Walk festivities is one of Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The ceremony dates to a period prior to the American Revolutionary War, but lapsed before being revived by University President Nicholas Murray Butler in the early 20th century. A troop of students dressed in Continental Army soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The ceremony includes readings of A Visit From St. Nicholas by Clement Clarke Moore (Columbia College class of 1798) and Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus by Francis Pharcellus Church (Class of 1859).

Coleman (November 30, 1895Birthdate obtained from Social Security Death Index. – July 8, 1990 ) was a college baseball coach at Oregon State University for 35 years. Early life Coleman was born in Canby, Oregon in 1895 and graduated from Canby High School. He attended Oregon Agricultural College (later renamed Oregon State University), where he lettered in track for three years before trying baseball in his senior year of 1918. After serving in World War I, he pitched for the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League and was offered a tryout with the Detroit Tigers, but opted instead for the head baseball coaching job at his alma mater. His younger brother Ed also played for the Beavers and went on to the major leagues. Coaching career Nicknamed The Silver Fox, Coleman remained the Beavers' head coach for 35 seasons: from 1923 to 1928, from 1930 to 1931, and from 1938 to 1966. His tenure was broken several times by other campus duties. Under Coleman's tenure, the Beavers had an overall record of 561–316–1 and finished first in the Northern Division 10 times. Coleman coached the Beavers to its first appearance in the College World Series in 1952, but the team lost its games to Duke and Texas. Legacy In 1968, he was named to the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1981, the same year that Oregon State's baseball stadium was renamed Coleman Field in his honor.

The whole floor was even rented out for his staff and bodyguards. Many famous people including the U.S. presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, George H.W. Bush, and native son Bill Clinton have stayed. Even baseball legend Babe Ruth and Tony Bennett, Barbra Streisand and Yoko Ono have all luxuriated at the hotel.

In August 2005, Kouemaha was transferred to Hungarian side Tatabánya FC. He immediately managed to become a regular scorer for a relatively weak team in the Hungarian league. His 14 league goals for Tatabánya helped him to attract the interest of league leader Debreceni VSC. He finally moved to Debrecen to become their topscorer with 14 league goals in the 2007–08 season.

Boosted by his first nomination to the Cameroonian national team, Kouemaha answered the expectations once more by scoring 15 goals in 35 matches. His immediate success in German football led to a €1.2 million move to Belgian club Club Brugge KV for the 2009–10 season. His 16 league goals during that season made him the top goalgetter of the Belgian League. The steady progress in his career broke down with permanent problems with his Achilles tendon in the 2010–11 season which led to a rupture while playing on loan for 1.

It applies to all land zoned for residential use across Victoria and covers buildings up to three storeys in height. (Taller buildings are covered by different policies.)  History  ResCode was implemented as a result of negative community perceptions of the effects of its predecessor, the Good Design Guide for Medium Density Housing (GDG), which was a planning initiative of the previous Liberal state government led by Jeff Kennett. The GDG had been introduced in 1995 as part of a broader reform to the Victorian Planning Provisions that aimed to facilitate market-led urban consolidation in established residential areas of Melbourne. One of the main complaints about the GDG was that it allowed developers to build higher-density (multi-unit) developments almost anywhere, which was damaging or destroying the local neighbourhood character. Notably, protection of neighbourhood character was one of the principal guidelines within the GDG that needed to be followed. Unlike the GDG, ResCode does not exist as a separate policy document. Instead, its provisions are incorporated into all Victorian local government planning schemes and the Victorian Building Regulations.  Main regulatory features  ResCode makes neighbourhood character the primary criterion for assessing residential development applications in Victoria. While a range of local as well as state planning policies (such as Melbourne 2030) concerning amenity and environmental sustainability must be taken into account by development applications and those assessing them, the code's central (and most well-known) features are clauses concerning neighbourhood character. In this regard, ResCode contains a number of requirements that were carried over from the GDG, such as the need to identify neighbourhood character by a site analysis for every development proposal, the elements that need to be included in a site analysis and the requirement for a description of how a proposed design responds to the neighbourhood character of the site. However, where these were previously guidelines, ResCode made them mandatory. Also, ResCode extends more stringent regulation than its predecessors to such issues as the position of a building on its site, its setback from front and side boundaries, and many other elements of a building's design, including overall height, roof pitch, external colours and materials, and fence heights. There are strict guidelines, covering the type of documentation required and the objectives that need to be satisfied under ResCode in clauses 54 and 55 of the planning scheme.  Criticisms  ResCode has been criticised by many residents' groups and planning academics for not going far enough to limit the allowable changes to neighbourhood character, associated with contemporary residential developments occurring in established residential areas. There are many, in the design professions, who have been critical of ResCode for its conservative interpretations of neighbourhood character. Many architects regard the degree to which its constraints on aspects of architectural design such as height, roof pitch, materials, fences, and window details limit innovations in design. Because the neighbourhood character provisions of ResCode apply only to certain types of development, the code cannot regulate those aspects of buildings outside its scope. They are of two main types. Firstly, residential buildings of four or more storeys are subject to different planning policies. Secondly, detached housing on lots above a certain size are exempt from a planning permit and so cannot be assessed under the planning scheme. Developments of both types have been the cause of much community disquiet, but ResCode and its predecessor, the GDG, cannot be held responsible.

He joined the cast in late 1994 while the programme was still in its first season. He was transferred to Mount Thomas as his first station straight from the police academy at age 19 and took Roz Patterson’s place when she was dismissed from her employment as the station’s administration officer for accessing confidential police records. Adam was a bright spark of an officer with plenty of potential and plenty of questions. He was very young for a police officer and could appear slightly immature at times though he had a good heart and love for his job. He is the ninth longest running character behind Tom Croydon, Chris Riley, P.J. Hasham, Maggie Doyle, Ben Stewart, Nick Schultz, Jo Parrish and Evan Jones. Role On Blue Heelers = Season 1= Season 1 for Adam mainly focused on his introduction to and breaking-in at the station. The first time Adam appeared in the series, he was at the academy and Wayne Patterson had travelled there himself to complete further study. It was here that Adam and Wayne met and Wayne began to show his dislike towards Adam. Adam managed to say all the wrong things and act the wrong way which irritated Wayne. This finished in Adam and Wayne having a violent confrontation and Adam finally decided to leave him alone. When he arrived at the station, he was the newest officer there and appeared a little out-of-place with all the mature officers. =Season 2= Early in Season 2, Adam was bitten by a bouncer (Terry Serio) who was HIV positive in an attempt to capture and arrest him. He was terrified at the prospect of dying at a young age, and thankfully his test results a few weeks later turned out to be negative for the condition. After a shaky start, Adam begun to fit in a little more at the station. He also started a physical relationship with Chris Riley, but the relationship ended in the season finale when he had intercourse with Gina Belfanti. Adam's brother visited him in the same episode, an argument took place after his older brother was accused of rape. Overall, Adam matured a little and started to fit in a lot more in Season 2. =Season 3= As a valued member at Mount Thomas, Adam went through another steady year as a Heeler in Season 3. He played a key role in proving Nick Schultz innocent when he was accused of killing a man who was in custody. Drama came for Adam in \\"Sex and Death\\" when he crashed his car while drag racing, he faced being sacked but luckily Chief Superintendent Clive Adamson decided against it. He was good mates with Jack Woodley, who was posted at Mount Thomas for a few weeks before getting sacked for fixing evidence. Adam also formed a strong early bond with Dash Mckinley, and Adam quickly became very fond of her. He saved Dash in a hostage situation in the season final, and drove Dash down to Melbourne to visit her sick mother in hospital. =Season 4= Early in Season 4, Adam rolled the dice and admitted his feelings for Dash, but Dash told him that she didn't like him like \\"that\\". Adam met Stacey Norse in \\"Fowl Play\\" and after a short time dating the two decided to get married. The night before the wedding, Dash and Adam kissed, after the kiss, Adam revealed that Stacey was pregnant.. But Adam and Dash put their now obvious feelings for each other aside and the marriage went through the very next day. Faced with financial difficulties, Adam and Stacey's marriage declined and it was revealed that Stacey was not pregnant with Adam's child, but an ex-boyfriends. When the ex- boyfriend came to town, Stacey created an evil plan to kill Adam and take off with her ex-lover and start a new life with Adam's insurance payout. The plan failed, and in a dramatic scene, a bed ridden Adam proved that she conspired to kill him. The rest of the season was quiet for Adam, but his relationship with Dash remained strong. =Season 5= The downfall of Adam Cooper began about 3 episodes into Season 5. After his male friend Wazza tried to kiss him, Adam found himself in a difficult situation when he saw Wazza being bashed for being a homosexual. To avoid being labelled a \\"fag-lover\\", he did nothing to stop the beating in a cowardly fashion. About 12 episodes later, Adam came close to killing a boxer in a fight which was organised by himself. But the worst came from episode 201 onwards. Adam found new friends, who weren't exactly trustworthy and he became resentful towards Tom, who always seemed to pick at Adam over minor things. A few tension filled verbal conflicts resulted. In episode 206 \\"Mates Rates\\", Adam mistakenly purchased a stolen car. He soon found out that it was stolen, but to avoid any investigation he did not reveal the truth to his workmates. In \\"Rotten Apple\\", Adam comforted Dash who was facing the prospect of dying of cancer and the two had sex. A few days later, Adam's secret regarding his car was found out and Tom went to him to tell him what he had found out - Adam has a furious look on his face throughout the conversation and punched Tom at the end of it. The next day, Adam was dismissed by Tom, who agreed not to press assault charges after some persuasion from Chris. Adam responded with a simple \\"Thanks\\". He packed up his things as his disappointed colleagues stood and watched and he started crying just before he walked out for the last time. As he exited the station, he had one last glance at the car which cost him his career, and before he could go much further Dash came out to say one last goodbye and from this it was apparent that she was the only officer who still respected him. The pair shared a friendly moment before Adam walked away. Other appearances = Ep. 510: One Day More= Adam reappeared on our screens in the last episode of Blue Heelers (Episode 510: One Day More). During this episode he came back to Mount Thomas saying that he wanted to make amends to the broken bridges, get on with his life and speak with Tom. As things turned out, he came back and attempted to frame Tom for selling an illegal weapon in Melbourne just after the old station was bombed. He came back as a photocopier technician and was, not to Tom’s knowledge, fixing the station’s photocopier. It was this job that gave him the access to the police computer where he stole information while everybody was occupied. This was found out and his room was searched revealing that he still had the illegal high-powered sawn-off shotgun. It was found out, also, that he was involved in a shooting and drug offence but, when he made allegations against Tom, Inspector Falcon-Price was more than happy to release him on bail. His accomplice, the shooter, was later brought in and released, along with Adam and he was forced to, in self-defence, kill this man with a metal bar when he made a move on him. The episode finished with Adam and Tom having a long talk and making amends and Adam dropping the allegations against Tom. Adam made a full confession to killing the shooter in self-defence.
