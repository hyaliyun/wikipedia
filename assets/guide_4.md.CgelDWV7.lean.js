It is on the far side of the Moon and was found by a gamma-ray spectrometer in 1998. It is an area of concentrated thorium, a 'fertile' element. Lunar rock samples from the Apollo missions reveal that most lunar volcanism occurred around 3 to 4 billion years ago, but this feature could have formed as recently as 1 billion years ago due to the unknown history of the moon's far side. Description The Compton‚ÄìBelkovich Thorium Anomaly was found in 1998 by the Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) instrument on board the Lunar Prospector (LP) and subsequently identified as a hotspot, located around . The estimated thorium concentration reaches (5.3 micrograms per gram) while the surrounding highland basalts only contain between . Compared to the Earth's thorium concentration of , the Compton‚ÄìBelkovich's is very high. It has unusually high reflectance, identified by a visible imaging study that was carried out later by the Clementine spacecraft in a Clementine Visible Images study. High resolution images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter LRO made it possible to analyze the surface features of the Compton‚ÄìBelkovich Thorium Anomaly in 2011. The Compton‚ÄìBelkovich Thorium Anomaly's location on the Moon. =Location= The anomaly is between the Bel'kovich crater, which is wide, and the Compton crater, which is wide. The region as a whole is wide and long. The center of the region is a volcanic complex, to across, between the Bel'kovich and the Compton craters. It is from the extent of the northeastern Procellarum KREEP Terrane (an area which has high abundances of KREEP, a geochemical component of some lunar rocks). =Features= In the center of the elevated region is a depression; this is bounded by scarps and may be some kind of caldera. Just to the north is a feature called Little Dome, in diameter. Further north is an elongated dome, oriented north-south, called Middle Dome. It is long and wide. Both Little Dome and Middle Dome have boulders on top that may be volcanic blocks. Big Dome is further to the north at the edge of the anomaly. It is in diameter with a depression in the top. An extension of the reflective material extends to the south-east from the elevated region by about . This may be a pyroclastic flow. This more highly reflective area also matches an area that shows a Christiansen feature with shorter wavelength. It reflects more strongly in the 7.1 to 7.5 Œºm range, which indicates quartz or alkali feldspar is the major constituent. Explosive remains also appear scattered to the east for about 300 km covering an area of 70,000 km2. =Volcanic slope= Volcanic features provide information about the composition of the lava that formed the Compton‚ÄìBelkovich Thorium Anomaly. On average, many volcanoes on the Moon have slopes of lower than 7 degrees. However, the Compton‚ÄìBelkovich Thorium Anomaly has a slope which reaches 25 degrees at the highest. This suggests that the region was formed by more viscous lava. =Composition= Using infrared reflectance data from Clementine at 750 nm and 950 nm, the level of iron oxide was determined to be about 3% by mass. =Formation= A direct analysis of Apollo program samples revealed that most lunar volcanism occurred around 3 to 4 billion years ago. However, volcanic activity on the unsampled lunar back side could have occurred around 1 billion years ago. The smoothness of the surface associated with the anomaly indicates that it could possibly have been formed in a more recent event. As the lava cooled, it would have crystallized to produce a silicate structure; incompatible elements such as thorium would have been excluded from the process and formed thorium-rich pockets in the remaining liquid rock. The eruption associated with the thorium anomaly could have created the elevated features to the west and the low and broad area to the east. The latest possible eruptions of lava would have made domes with steeper slopes, and also would have caused small bulges, as they would barely reach the surface.

In a career which lasted from June 2003 until September 2004, he ran nine times and won four races. He recorded his most important victory when winning the Classic St. Leger Stakes on his final racecourse appearance. He had previously finished second in the 2004 Epsom Derby. Background Rule of Law, described by Timeform as a \\"leggy, attractive\\" bay horse, was bred in the United States by Robert Sangster. He is one of many notable thoroughbred racehorses sired by Kingmambo, a son of Mr. Prospector. His dam, Crystal Crossing, as a descendant of the successful racehorse and broodmare Violetta, was closely related to the Derby winner Teenoso. Before the start of his racing career, Rule of Law was acquired by Sheikh Mohammed who sent him into training with David Loder at Newmarket, Suffolk. For the 2004 season, the colt was transferred to the Godolphin Racing organisation and was trained by Saeed bin Suroor. Racing career =2003: two-year-old season= Rule of Law ran four times as a two-year-old, ridden on each occasion by Jamie Spencer. He made his debut in a seven furlong maiden race at Sandown Park Racecourse in June, in which he finished third to Grand Rich King. A month later Rule of Law appeared in a similar event at York Racecourse and led from the start before drawing clear in the closing stages and winning by seven lengths. Rule of Law returned to York in August and was moved up in class to contest the Listed Acomb Stakes. Starting the 15/8 favourite, he led from the early stages and held the late challenge of the Aidan O'Brien-trained Celtic Cat to win by a neck. On his final start of the season, Rule of Law was again promoted in class for the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes at Ascot in September. Spencer again attempted to make all the running, but Rule of Law was caught in the final furlong and finished third, beaten a short head and three quarters of a length by Snow Ridge and Moscow Ballet. =2004: three-year-old season= Rule of Law began his three-year-old season in the Group Two Dante Stakes at York, an important trial race for the Epsom Derby. Starting at odds of 8/1 and ridden by Frankie Dettori he kept on well in the closing stages to finish second to North Light, beaten half a length, with Let The Lion Roar two and a half lengths back in third. In the Epsom Derby on 5 June, Rule of Law started a 20/1 outsider, and was ridden by Kerrin McEvoy as Dettori had opted to ride Godolphin's other runner, Snow Ridge. McEvoy restrained Rule of Law at the back of the field before moving him to the outside to make his challenge in the straight. The finish proved to be a repeat of the Dante, with North Light winning by a length and a half from Rule of Law and Let the Lion Roar. In the Irish Derby at The Curragh three weeks later, Rule of Law took the lead in the straight but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Grey Swallow, North Light and Tycoon. In August, Rule of Law was sent to York for the Great Voltigeur Stakes, a major trial race for the St Leger. Ridden by Dettori, he \\"dominated\\" the race from the start and quickened clear in the straight to win by two and a half lengths from Let the Lion Roar. In the St Leger at Doncaster on 11 September, Rule of Law started 3/1 joint favourite alongside the Michael Stoute-trained filly Quiff, the winner of the Yorkshire Oaks. He was the Godolphin team's sole representative and had been strongly fancied after working impressively in training. McEvoy sent Rule of Law into the lead from the start and set a moderate pace before sending him into a clear lead in the straight. In the closing stages he was strongly challenged by Quiff, but ran on \\"gamely\\" to win by a head in what the BBC described as a \\"thrilling finish\\". Rule of Law was sent to Dubai for the winter of 2004/5, where he sustained a foot injury. He stayed in training for a further two seasons, but never ran again, owing to his inability to recover fully from his injury problems. Assessment and honours Rule of Law was rated the best racehorse in the world over extended distances in 2004 when he was given a rating of 120 in the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings. Stud career Rule of Law was retired to stand at his owner's Darley Stud. He has been based in Japan before moving in 2011 to the Kedorah House Stud in County Tipperary, Ireland. To date, he has had little success as a sire of winners. Pedigree *Rule of Law is inbred 4 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

He was a founding contributor to the British Journal of Aesthetics, and is best known for his writings on epistemology and aesthetics. He influenced figures as diverse as Susanne Langer, Lionel TrillingTrilling wrote the introduction to the first American edition of A Study in Aesthetics (Reader's Subscription Inc, 1954). and Harold Osborne.There is a wikipedia entry for Harold Osborne in Spanish. Jacques Barzun said that Reid's book A Study in Aesthetics was \\"the best discussion of art yet produced in our century.\\" Barzun, Jacques. Berlioz and the Romantic Century. Columbia UP (1969.) I.179n. As A.J. Ayer recounts in his autobiography, Reid is also remembered as the candidate preferred by the philosophers on the appointment committee for the chair in philosophy at the University of London. The philosophers were outvoted by the lay members of the committee, who appointed Ayer instead.Ayer, A.J.. Part of My Life, Collins (1984.) 308. Reid was born in the manse at Ellon, north of Aberdeen, the descendant of Presbyterian and later Free Church ministers.Biographical details come from Reid's memoir, Yesterdays Today. Canberra: Samizdat Press (CreateSpace), 2013. He later became an Anglican and later still an agnostic. He went to school at the Leys in Cambridge, where he knew Mr Chips, and then briefly flirted with the idea of a career in engineering. He also volunteered as a sapper in the Royal Engineers early in the First World War, though he was invalided out on the basis of rheumatic fever. It was at about this period that he first read Bergson, and found his vocation in philosophy, going on to study at Edinburgh from which he graduated in 1919. His first lectureship was at Aberystwyth, during which time he wrote the (realist) PhD which became his first book, under the supervision of the leading idealist, J.H. Muirhead. From Aberystwith he moved to Liverpool as a senior lecturer in 1926, and then in 1932 to a chair in philosophy at the Armstrong College, Newcastle, a college of Durham University. In 1947 he was invited to move to the Institute in London, where he remained until his retirement in 1962. He continued to write and teach for many years afterwards. Theory of perception In his first book, Knowledge and Truth, Reid argued against the representational theory of perception.L.A. Reid, Knowledge and Truth, Macmillan (1923) 105, 113. This is the view implicit in Locke that when we see an object we in fact see an image (a representation) in our mind which is the product of the stimulation of our optic nerves by light. The problem with this account is that it makes the image the immediate object of perception, and thus leaves us with no direct evidence of the physical world. It leaves us vulnerable to Berkeley's idealism (the view that there is no physical world). Reid (anticipating Mary Warnock)Mary Warnock, Imagination. London: Faber, 1976. argued that the representational theory is faulty.For an exposition of Reid‚Äôs views, see Nicholas Reid, Coleridge, Form and Symbol. Ashgate (2006) chapter 1. When we see, he argued, we are not ‚Äòseeing‚Äô an image or sense datum in the mind: we are ‚Äòseeing‚Äô the world, albeit not in the direct fashion imagined by the na√Øve realist. The ‚Äòseeing‚Äô is in fact the act by which the image or datum is constructed in the first place. Imaging can thus be compared to the act by which a blind person constructs an ‚Äòimage‚Äô of the external world on the basis of information transmitted through his or her white cane; for though our visual sense is much more sophisticated and appears immediate, it is in fact mediated by light (a physical intermediary like the cane), and involves the same kind of construction. ‚ÄòImaging‚Äô is thus an object-directed, mental act. (This is the basis of Reid‚Äôs qualified realism.) It follows that the sense datum is not what is known but is an active way of knowing the world. Moreover, the sense datum per se is an abstraction rather than a substantial entity, though sensing (conceived as an act) is very real. Sense qualities (qualia) are in a radical sense secondary qualities; not representations of the world, but instead presentations, or the way in which we understand the world. Embodied meaning It follows that there is no problem in understanding how the qualitative aspects of art can embody meaning, given that qualia are paradigmatically mental, and interpretative. This solves one of the central puzzles about how art works. It is the basis for Reid's argument that art embodies meaning.See Meaning in the Arts. George Allen and Unwin (1969). Epistemology Reid goes further, and makes the epistemological claim that the arts are a way of knowing.L.A. Reid, '‚ÄôKnowledge and Truth'‚Äô, Macmillan (1923) chapter 9; and in many other places; 'Art and Knowledge'. British Journal of Aesthetics (1985) 25 (2):115‚Äì125. He rejects the common view of knowledge as paradigmatically propositional, regarding propositional meaning as something which the mind abstracts from concrete experience. What is in our propositions is first in our sensory or concrete understandings of the world, though that in turn (as a construction) is influenced by our conceptual understanding. Phenomenology Reid's phenomenology also centred on the role of feeling in thinking, for he did not think of 'thinking' as some kind of computational manipulation of propositions. Instead, propositions codify our underlying feelings about the relations of things in the world. Feeling and thinking are two sides of the same coin. By 'feeling' Reid is thus not referring to some kind of merely subjective quality. He regarded sensation as a paradigmatic kind of feeling, a kind of feeling which is cognitive and world directed. In this, he influenced Susanne Langer'sSussanne Langer, Feeling and Form. Routledge and Kegan Paul (1953). views on feeling, and anticipated Antonio Damasio'sAntonio Damasio, Descartes' Error. Putnam (1994). somatic marker hypothesis as well the views of Nicholas Humphrey,Nicholas Humphrey, A History of the Mind. Simon and Schuster (1992). George Lakoff and Mark Johnson,George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and its Challenge to Western Thought. Basic Books (1999). and others. His views were largely developed independently of the Continental phenomenologists, whose works were not well known in Britain in the early inter-war period. He may have been unknowingly influenced by Coleridge, on whose philosophy his supervisor J.H. Muirhead wrote a seminal introduction.J.H. Muirhead, Coleridge as Philosopher. George Allen and Unwin (1930). Education For Reid, education is not about the passive reproduction of propositional knowledge. It is about apprehension, about active and concrete understanding.L.A. Reid, '‚ÄôPhilosophy and Education: An Introduction‚Äô‚Äô, Heinemann (1962). The arts also have a central place in education, because they are a form of knowing.

Due to a common mistake and no element of enticement to believe that mistake, estoppel was not available on the facts. Facts The claimants were two companies, Taylor Fashions Ltd and Old & Campbell Ltd, who held leases on two business premises on Westover Road, Bournemouth. Both companies asked to have their leases renewed by their landlord, the Liverpool Victoria Trustees Co Ltd. All parties had assumed that the two leases were accompanied by a statutory right of renew when they came to an end. Based on this assumption, both of the claimant companies had spent money improving their premises. However, it transpired that Liverpool Victoria was under no legal obligation to renew. The claimants argued that Liverpool Victoria should be estopped from not renewing, based on their reliance. In response, Liverpool Victoria argued that estoppel was not relevant because they had not acted unconscionably but simply by mistake. Judgment Oliver J noted that Mr Scott and Mr Essayan for the claimants said: one‚Äôs state of mind was irrelevant. Mr Millett for Liverpool Victoria argued that unconscionability was necessary, following Fry J in the earlier leading case of Willmott v Barber. The judge noted: Oliver J clarified that Willmott was only a case applicable to situations where someone had stood by without protest as his rights were infringed.151-152 Knowledge of one of the parties alleged to be estopped is just one of many relevant factors. One should consider all the circumstances. On the facts of the case, the claim by Taylor Fashions failed, with 'regret', because they had not been encouraged in their belief by Liverpool Victoria. Old & Campbell, however, did succeed because they had been encouraged to spend a very large sum in the belief that they could renew. Significance The case underlines the importance of businesses renting leased premises to be well-advised before entering into their leases, and in particular to be aware of the pitfall of doing authorised works without business security of tenure. It also underlines the importance of clear communication with the landlord as a clear written promise from the landlord that the business tenants could renew their premises leases, having looked at the leases, would have enabled the business tenants to benefit somewhat from the works they had carried out.

The book consists of assignments that push the reader to go in public, or to risk losing the copy of the book.

Some challenge the reader to risk looking silly in front of others, or to do something that the reader have always wanted to do.

Variations of definitions for the \\"A\\" exist, but no other definition formally defines the arts with research or links the disciplines together as a whole with research. STEAM is designed to integrate all subjects with each other for a way to teach across the disciplines. These programs aim to teach students innovation, to think critically and use engineering or technology in imaginative designs or creative approaches to real-world problems framed in social studies. STEAM programs add art to STEM curriculum by drawing on reasoning, ethics and design principles and encouraging creative solutions, effectively removing the meaning of the STEM distinction as the term now includes nearly all academic fields, yet still oddly leaving some behind. History The founder of the STEAM initiative is Georgette Yakman, who in addition to raising the idea of adding the arts to the STEM acronym, has conducted research and practicum since 2006 based on researching the formal way that subjects work together and correspond to the global socioeconomic world: \\"Science and Technology, interpreted through Engineering and the Arts, all based in elements of Mathematics.\\" She provides professional development training to individual educators and programs on how to use the STEAM framework. In 2009, Senator Mark Warner announced Yakman's nomination as NCTC‚Äôs STEAM Teacher of the Year 2009.  National STEAM Day  National STEM/STEAM Day is celebrated on November 8 and is intended to be a play on the word innovate (Nov 8). Children and science STEAM Day was established and made an official holiday by MGA Entertainment in 2015. \\"We want to show children that S.T.E.M. and S.T.E.A.M. are already all around them, and that their favorite hobbies are actually rooted in science, technology, engineering, art and math,\\" said Isaac Larian, CEO of MGA Entertainment. STEAM programs *A joint resolution was introduced in the United States House of Representatives expressing the sense that adding art and design into federal programs that target the STEM fields encourages innovation and economic growth in the United States. John Maeda co- hosted the kickoff briefing of the bipartisan Congressional STEAM Caucus.  STEAM in children's media  *Sesame Streets 43rd season continues to focus on STEM but finds ways to integrate art. They state: \\"This helps make learning STEM concepts relevant and enticing to young children by highlighting how artists use STEM knowledge to enhance their art or solve problems. It also provides context for the importance of STEM knowledge in careers in the arts (e.g. musician, painter, sculptor and dancer).\\" *MGA Entertainment created a S.T.E.A.M. based franchise Project Mc2.  Other uses of the STEAM acronym  *Other variations that have been promoted, include art, fine arts, agriculture, architecture and applied mathematics. *The Rhode Island School of Design has a STEM to STEAM program and maintains an interactive map that shows global STEAM initiatives. Relevant organizations are able to add themselves to the map. John Maeda, (2008 to 2013 president of Rhode Island School of Design) has been a champion in bringing the initiative to the political forums of educational policy. *Some programs offer STEAM from a base focus like mathematics and science. *SteamHead is a non-profit organization that promotes innovation and accessibility in education, focusing on STEAM fields. * Wolf Trap's Institute of Education, as part of a $1.5 million Department of Education grant, trains and places teaching artists into preschool and kindergarten classrooms. The artists collaborate with the teachers to integrate math and science into the arts. * American Lisa La Bonte, CEO of the Arab Youth Venture Foundation based in the United Arab Emirates, uses the STEAM acronym, but her work does not include arts integration. Starting in 2007, La Bonte created and ran high profile free public STEAM programs having added an A for \\"inspired STEM\\", with the A standing for Aeronautics, Aviation, Astronomy, Aerospace, Ad Astra! and using all things \\"air and space\\" as a hook for youth to embark on greater experimentation, studies, and careers in the region's burgeoning space related industries. One of AYVF's best-known programs, \\"STEAM@TheMall\\", served over 200,000 its first two years at the most popular shopping malls and provided free weekend activity stations such as Mars robotics, science experiments, SkyLab portable planetarium, art/design, and creative writing.

Wolkers based the character Olga on his second wife Annemarie Nauta, his third wife Karina Gnirrep and photographer and poet Ida Sipora. In 2017, Sam Garrett published an English translation of the novel entitled Turkish Delight. Plot summary Turks Fruit begins with the unnamed lead character, a sculptor, lying on his bed and thinking about Olga, who has left him. He first met her when he was hitchhiking and she picked him up and succumbed to his charms. When they started driving again, they were in a non-lethal car crash. Two months later they met again and married. The sculptor describes her father and mother. Her father was a fat, funny man. He repeats the same jokes time after time. Her mother is her father's complete opposite. The sculptor hates her, and she hates him. She wants to destroy the relationship between him and Olga. She is the reason Olga's father died. He was on a diet, but she secretly fed him fat. The sculptor saw her doing it and considers it to be murder. He never tells Olga or her father. Olga's mother also cheats and the father knows it, but doesn't mind. One of the mother's breasts was amputated because she had breast cancer. After the sculptor describes Olga's parents, he describes his sexual relations with her, which was very important. During a dinner, the sculptor witnesses Olga flirting with someone her parents know. She goes to the bathroom with him, where he hits her. She leaves him and returns to her mother. After she leaves, the sculptor has short relationships with other women, but none as good as Olga. Olga has several relationships and marriages after the sculptor, but none equal the first. Olga discovers she has an inoperable brain tumor and tells the sculptor. He visits her in the hospital nearly every day for six months, until she dies. She slowly loses her hair and the sculptor buys her a red wig. She is afraid that her teeth will fall out, so she only eats Turkish delight, explaining the title. Olga dies on an early spring evening. She is cremated while wearing her wig. Adaptations *In 1973 Turks Fruit was turned into an award-winning film, Turkish Delight, directed by Paul Verhoeven. Rutger Hauer stars as the sculptor, and Monique van de Ven as Olga. *In 2005 the musical adaptation of Turks Fruit called Turks Fruit the Rockmusical hit theatres. It was written by , in collaboration with Wolkers. *In 2016 Dick Matena published a comic book adaptation of the novel, made in text comics format.

Birmingham's location away from established centres of power, its dynamic merchant-based economy and its weak aristocracy gave it a reputation as a place where loyalty to the established power structures of church and feudal state were weak, and saw it emerge as a haven for free-thinkers and radicals, encouraging the birth of a vibrant culture of writing, printing and publishing. The 18th century saw the town's radicalism widen to encompass other literary areas, and while Birmingham's tradition of vigorous literary debate on theological issues was to survive into the Victorian era, the writers of the Midlands Enlightenment brought new thinking to areas as diverse as poetry, philosophy, history, fiction and children's literature. By the Victorian era Birmingham was one of the largest towns in England and at the forefront of the emergence of modern industrial society, a fact reflected in its role as both a subject and a source for the newly dominant literary form of the novel. The diversification of the city's literary output continued into the 20th century, encompassing writing as varied as the uncompromising modernist fiction of Henry Green, the science fiction of John Wyndham, the popular romance of Barbara Cartland, the children's stories of the Rev W. Awdry, the theatre criticism of Kenneth Tynan and the travel writing of Bruce Chatwin. Writers with roots in Birmingham have had an international influence. John Rogers compiled the first complete authorised edition of The Bible to appear in the English Language; Samuel Johnson was the leading literary figure of 18th century England and produced the first English Dictionary; J. R. R. Tolkien is the dominant figure in the genre of fantasy fiction and one of the bestselling authors in the history of the world; W. H. Auden's work has been called the greatest body of poetry written in the English Language over the last century; while notable contemporary writers from the city include David Lodge, Jim Crace, Roy Fisher and Benjamin Zephaniah. The city also has a tradition of distinctive literary subcultures, from the Puritan writers who established the first Birmingham Library in the 1640s; through the 18th century philosophers, scientists and poets of the Lunar Society and the Shenstone Circle; the Victorian Catholic revival writers associated with Oscott College and the Birmingham Oratory; to the politically engaged 1930s writers of Highfield and the Birmingham Group. This tradition continues today, with notable groups of writers associated with the University of Birmingham, the Tindal Street Press, and the city's burgeoning crime fiction, science fiction and poetry scenes. Medieval and early modern literature John Rogers, editor of the first complete authorised version of the Bible to be printed in the English language Little evidence remains of the culture of medieval Birmingham, but with a priory and two chantries in the town itself, another priory in Aston, grammar schools in Deritend, Yardley and King's Norton, and the religious institutions of the Guild of the Holy Cross and the Guild of St. John, Deritend, the area would have supported a substantial community of learned religious men from the 13th century onwards. The first Birmingham literary figure of lasting significance was John Rogers, who was born in Deritend in 1500 and educated at the Grammar School of the Guild of St. John, and who compiled, edited and partially translated the 1537 Matthew Bible, the first complete authorised version of the Bible to be printed in the English language. This was the most influential of the early English printed Bibles, providing the basis for the later Great Bible and Authorized King James Version. Rogers' translation of Philipp Melanchthon's Weighing of the Interim probably took place between Rogers' return to Deritend from Wittenberg in 1547 and his move to London in 1550, and is the earliest book written by a Birmingham author known to have been printed in England. Rogers' profile as a prominent figure in the Protestant church led to his arrest after the restoration of Roman Catholicism by Mary I, and on 14 February 1555 he became the first Protestant to be burned at the stake in the Marian Persecutions, leaving behind a written account of his three interrogations that was to establish him as an icon of martyrdom and the refusal to recant one's individual conscience. The poem he left to his children at his death, exhorting them to a Godly life and including his famous instruction for them to \\"Abhor that arrant Whore of Rome\\", was included in The New England Primer of 1690, becoming a major influence on the Puritan educational outlook of 18th century Colonial America. Thomas Hall's The Font Guarded of 1652 ‚Äì the first known Birmingham-published book It is in the mid 17th century that the first evidence of a distinctive and sustained literary culture emerges within Birmingham, based around a group of writers working at the heart of the town's growth as a centre of religious puritanism and political radicalism. John Barton, the headmaster of King Edward's School, was the author of The Art of Rhetorick in 1634 and The Latine Grammar composed in the English Tongue in 1652, but is best known for Prince Rupert's burning love for England, discovered in Birmingham's flames ‚Äì a widely circulated, influential and vitriolic anti-Royalist tract that documented the sacking of the town by Prince Rupert of the Rhine at the Battle of Birmingham of 1643. Anthony Burgess wrote numerous sermons and theological works while the rector of Sutton Coldfield between 1635 and 1662, entering into a prolonged if amicable theological dispute in print with Richard Baxter that culminated in a face-to-face debate in Birmingham in September 1650. Francis Roberts was similarly prolific during his tenure as vicar of Birmingham's St Martin in the Bull Ring, with many of his works of popular or scholarly theology becoming nationally-known and running through numerous editions. Thomas Hall was the master of the King's Norton Grammar School from 1629, and the minister of the adjacent St Nicolas' Church from 1650, but from the 1630s onwards was drawn into the radical circles of nearby Birmingham. He was the author of a long series of polemical works, combining both populist and erudite writing on religious and social matters. His 1652 volume The Font Guarded ‚Äì a defence of the practice of infant baptism ‚Äì was the first book known to have been published as well as written in Birmingham, and provides the first definite evidence of booksellers operating within the town. Between 1635 and 1642 Roberts, Hall and Barton were involved in establishing the first Birmingham Library, one of the earliest public libraries in England. This culture of radical writing grew with the influx of Nonconformists and ejected ministers seeking asylum in Birmingham following the Act of Uniformity of 1662 and the Five Mile Act of 1665, which forbade dissenting ministers from living within five miles of a chartered borough but didn't apply to highly populous but unincorporated Birmingham. A vast number of essays and printed sermons on issues of religious controversy were produced by these radical clerics and their opponents over the following decades, in turn encouraging the further growth of the town's book trade. The era also saw the birth of a Birmingham street literature, with broadside ballads on Birmingham subjects surviving from the middle years of the 17th century. An Act of Parliament restricting the number of master printers in England meant that literature written and published in Birmingham could not be printed in the town, however, being produced only in London until the Act was repealed in 1693. Literature of the Midlands Enlightenment Birmingham during the 18th century lay at the heart of the English experience of the Age of Enlightenment, as the free- thinking dissenting tradition developed in the town over the previous century blossomed into the cultural movement now known as the Midlands Enlightenment. Birmingham's literary infrastructure grew dramatically over the period. At least seven booksellers are recorded as existing by 1733 with the largest in 1786 claiming a stock of 30,000 titles in several languages. Books could be borrowed from the eight or nine commercial lending libraries established over the course of the 18th century, and from more specialist research-driven libraries such as the Birmingham Library and St. Philip's Parish Library. Evidence of printers working in Birmingham can be found from 1713, and the rise of John Baskerville in the 1750s saw the town's printing and publishing industry achieve international significance. By the end of the century Birmingham had developed a highly literate society, and it was claimed that the town's population of around 50,000 read 100,000 books per month. Samuel Johnson, whose literary career started in Birmingham in 1732The most significant author associated with Birmingham during the enlightenment era was Samuel Johnson: poet, novelist, literary critic, journalist, satirist and biographer, the author of the first English Dictionary; the leading literary figure of the 18th century and \\"arguably the most distinguished man of letters in English history\\". Johnson's background was closely tied to Birmingham and its book trade: his father maintained a bookstall on the Birmingham Market, his uncle and brother were both booksellers in the town, his mother was a native of King's Norton, and his wife Elizabeth (\\"Tetty\\"), whom he married when both were living in the town in 1735, was the widow of Henry Porter, a Birmingham merchant. Johnson's own literary career started in Birmingham where he lived for three years from 1732 after failing to establish himself as a teacher in his native Lichfield. His essays for Thomas Warren's Birmingham Journal were his first published writing, and it was in Birmingham ‚Äì also for Warren ‚Äì that he wrote and had published his first book: a translation of Jer√≥nimo Lobo's A Voyage to Abyssinia. This \\"combination of the travelogue and religious polemic\\", with a preface written by Johnson himself, was pitched towards the dissenting culture of the Birmingham area and its widespread suspicion of religious fanaticism, but also aligned Johnson with the empirical and renaissance humanist tradition of the post-reformation European intellectual elite, themes that would emerge repeatedly throughout his following work. This early work also established Johnson's practice of building his literary output around adapting and responding to the work of others ‚Äì \\"a sort of rhetoric applied to the print world\\" ‚Äì that was to form the basis of his prodigious output over the course of his career. Johnson maintained an extensive set of social and business connections in Birmingham throughout his lifetime and continued to visit the town regularly until a month before his death in 1784. Joseph PriestleyAlthough the Lunar Society of Birmingham is best known for its scientific discoveries and its influence on the industrial revolution, it also included several members notable as writers. Erasmus Darwin's 1791 poem The Botanic Garden established him for a period as the leading English poet of his day, and was a major influence on the Romantic poetry of William Blake, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats. Thomas Day ‚Äì an ardent follower of the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau ‚Äì wrote an early series of radical poems including the anti-slavery work The Dying Negro (with John Bicknell) in 1773, and a passionate defence of the American Revolution The Devoted Legions in 1776. He is however best known for his books for children, particularly his 1789 work Sandford and Merton, which remained the most widely read and influential children's book for a century after its publication, and whose proto-socialist outlook was \\"to play a crucial role in moulding the ethos of nineteenth-century England\\". Joseph Priestley wrote voluminously on an exceptionally wide range of subjects including theology, history, education and rhetoric. As a philosopher he had considerable contemporary influence, arguing for materialist, determinist and scientific realist viewpoints and influencing the thought of Richard Price, Thomas Reid and Immanuel Kant. His political writings centred around the ideas of providentialism and the importance of individual liberty, while his work The Rudiments of English Grammar established him as \\"one of the great grammarians of his time.\\" William ShenstoneThe 18th century saw Birmingham's written output diversify further from its earlier focus on religious polemic. William Hutton, though born in Derby, became Birmingham's first historian, publishing his History of Birmingham in 1782. The rationalist philosopher William Wollaston ‚Äì best known for his 1722 work The Religion of Nature Delineated ‚Äì was a master for a period at the Birmingham Grammar School. The poet Charles Lloyd was born in Birmingham, the son of one of the partners in Lloyds Bank. Noted for his radicalism, he was a friend of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Lamb, William Wordsworth, Robert Southey and Thomas de Quincey; and was widely attacked by conservative publicists in the aftermath of the French Revolution for poems such as his 1798 Blank Verse, celebrating \\"the promis'd time ‚Ä¶ when equal man / Shall deem the world his temple\\". Henry Francis Cary, a translator best known for his version of Dante's Divine Comedy, was educated at grammar schools in Sutton Coldfield and Birmingham during the 1780s and published a volume of Odes & Sonnets in 1788 while at the latter. The poet William Shenstone had houses in Birmingham and Quinton as well as his famous estate The Leasowes to the west of Birmingham near Halesowen. He lay at the centre of the Shenstone Circle ‚Äì a group of writers and poets from the Birmingham area that included Richard Jago, John Scott Hylton, John Pixell, Richard Graves, Mary Whateley and Joseph Giles ‚Äì a role that saw him described as the \\"Maecenas of the Midlands\\".; John Freeth and his Circle ‚Äì the radical Birmingham Book Club, which met at Freeth's Coffee HouseThe century also saw Birmingham emerge as the centre of a vibrant and sophisticated culture of popular street literature, as the town's printers produced increasing numbers of the broadsides and chapbooks that formed the primary reading matter of the poor. Cheaply printed and carrying traditional songs, newly written ballads on topical matters, simple folk-tales with wood-cut illustrations, and news ‚Äì particularly salacious coverage of gruesome crimes, executions, riots and wars ‚Äì broadsides and chapbooks were sold or exchanged by itinerant chapmen ‚Äì also called \\"patterers\\" or \\"ballad-mongers\\" ‚Äì who often displayed their goods in the street on a small table or pinned to a wall. Although much of this work was by its nature ephemeral and low in literary quality, Birmingham was unusual in that the town's high level of social mobility meant that printers of street literature often overlapped with printers of weightier material, some writers of street literature were highly educated and of respectable social standing, and several writers of Birmingham broadside ballads had a lasting influence on the town's literary culture. Job Nott ‚Äì probably a pseudonym of Theodore Price of Harborne ‚Äì was a largely conservative figure who produced a wide range of pamphlets and broadsides on topical matters, attracting imitators as far afield as Bristol. John Freeth's influence was even greater: nearly 400 of his political ballads were published and distributed nationally in a dozen separate collections between 1766 and 1805, the best-known being his 1790 collection The Political Songster. An outstanding figure in the radical circles of the late-Georgian town, he hosted the Birmingham Book Club at John Freeth's Coffee House, giving him a national political importance and placing him at the heart of Birmingham's developing political self-consciousness during the upheavals of the American Revolution. Regency and Victorian literature =19th century fiction= Catherine HuttonThe 19th century saw the short story and the novel emerge as major features of Birmingham's literary output. A transitional figure was Catherine Hutton, the daughter of Birmingham historian William Hutton, who was first notable as a correspondent of many of the leading literary figures of the late 18th century, but who published her first novel The Miser Married in 1813. This was itself written as a series of 63 letters discussing personal, social and literary issues among the fictional correspondents, and was followed by two further epistolary novels ‚Äì The Welsh Mountaineers in 1817 and Oakwood Hall in 1819. Washington Irving Washington Irving, who was born in New York City and is regarded as the United States' first successful professional man of letters, spent many years in Birmingham after his first visit to the town in 1815, living with his sister and her husband in Ladywood, the Jewellery Quarter and Edgbaston. His best-known works ‚Äì the short stories \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" and \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" ‚Äì were both written in Birmingham, as was his first and best-known novel Bracebridge Hall of 1821, whose setting was loosely based on Birmingham's Aston Hall. Many of his later works, including Tales of the Alhambra and Mahomet and His Successors, were completed in Birmingham after being drafted on his wider European travels. Thomas Adolphus Trollope worked as a schoolteacher in Birmingham before establishing himself as a successful novelist, journalist and travel writer and moving to Florence in Italy, where his house became a magnet for British literary figures such as Charles Dickens, George Eliot and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Isabella Varley Banks was born in Manchester and is best known for her 1876 novel The Manchester Man, but her career as a novelist started only after she moved to Birmingham in 1846 after marrying local journalist, poet and playwright George Linnaeus Banks. Her twelve novels were set in a variety of locations including Birmingham, Yorkshire, Wiltshire, Durham, Chester, and Manchester; each book being particularly notable for its faithful reproduction of local dialect and pronunciation. West Bromwich-born David Christie Murray received his training as a writer as a journalist under George Dawson on the Birmingham Daily Post. Several of his novels were set in Birmingham including A Rising Star of 1894 ‚Äì the story of a Birmingham reporter with literary aspirations ‚Äì with many more set in surrounding areas such as the Black Country and Cannock Chase. Joseph Henry ShorthouseProtestant religion remained a theme common to much of Birmingham's literary output during the 19th century. John Inglesant ‚Äì the \\"philosophical romance\\" that was the first and best-known work of the Birmingham novelist Joseph Henry Shorthouse ‚Äì became a publishing triumph in the atmosphere of highly charged religious controversy of the 1880s, seeing its author \\"f√™ted throughout the literary world\\", the object of admiration from writers as varied as Charlotte Yonge, T. H. Huxley and Edmund Gosse, and the subject of an invitation to breakfast at 10 Downing Street by William Gladstone. The result of 30 years of study and over 10 years of writing, the novel told the story of a 17th-century English soldier and diplomat, his travels through England and Italy and his excursions through the principal religious philosophies of the time ‚Äì Puritanism, Anglicanism, Roman Catholicism, Quietism and Humanism ‚Äì as a recreation of Shorthouse's own intellectual journey from Quakerism to the Church of England . Shorthouse wrote four other novels and a book of short stories over subsequent years, all of which catalogued their protagonists \\"protracted torments of conscience\\". Emma Jane Guyton published over fifty popular and oft-reprinted novels between 1846 and 1882, most of which used their commonplace domestic settings to communicate an ecumenical Protestant or strongly anti-Catholic message. Ashted-born George Mogridge started writing for children on religious and moral issues in 1827 after a varied early life that included periods working as a japanner in Birmingham's metal trades and living as a tramp in France. He eventually wrote 226 successful and widely marketed books, including stories, collections, verse and plays; anonymously and under more than 20 pseudonyms including Old Humphrey, Ephraim Holding, Old Father Thames, Peter Parley, Grandfather Gregory, Amos Armfield, Grandmamma Gilbert, Aunt Upton, and X.Y.Z. At the time of his death in 1854 it was estimated that his books had sold a total of over 15 million copies across Britain and America. The Victorian era also saw Birmingham featuring as a setting for novelists from outside the town, placing it at the forefront of the fictional representation of industrial England's major urban centres. Five years before Elizabeth Gaskell's 1848 portrayal of Manchester in Mary Barton, and nine years before Charles Dickens' Hard Times was loosely set in Preston, Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna gave a graphic depiction of working life in Birmingham in her 1843 four- part novel The Wrongs of Woman, emphasising the exploitation of women in backstreet factories and the corrosive influence of industrial employment. The anonymously-written 1848 novella How to Get on in the World: The Story of Peter Lawley presented a more optimistic view, showing the positive consequences of learning to read for the poverty-stricken son of a Birmingham nailer. George Gissing's Eve's Ransom of 1894 presented Birmingham as a bustling metropolis of questionable values, with traffic \\"speedily passing from the region of main streets and great edifices into a squalid district of factories and workshops and crowded by-ways\\", while Mabel Collins used Birchampton ‚Äì a thinly disguised Birmingham ‚Äì as the setting for her gothic novel The Star Sapphire of 1896. Passing references in more widely set fiction also provide evidence of Birmingham's growing significance in the culture of Victorian England. Benjamin Disraeli's 1845 novel Sybil uses Birmingham as a background political barometer ‚Äì \\"They're always ready for a riot in Birmingham‚Ä¶ The sufferings of '39 will keep Birmingham in check\\", while Charlotte Bront√´'s 1849 Shirley sees the town at the root of the changes sweeping England ‚Äì \\"In Birmingham I considered closely, and at their source, the causes of the present troubles of this country\\". =Crime fiction, science fiction and other genre fiction= Arthur Conan Doyle The Victorian period also saw authors with a Birmingham background produce fiction in a far broader range of genres. Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, started his career as a writer in Birmingham. His first story \\"The Mystery of Sasassa Valley\\" was written and published in 1879 while he was working as a medical assistant in Aston, as was his second \\"The American's Tale\\", whose success led his editor to advise him to give up medicine and pursue a full-time literary career. Birmingham appears in Conan Doyle's early stories as Birchespool, and several of Conan Doyle's later Sherlock Holmes stories, including \\"The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk\\" and \\"The Adventure of the Three Garridebs\\", have explicit Birmingham settings. The adventure novelist Max Pemberton caricatured in Vanity Fair in 1897 Edwin Abbott Abbott, who worked for a period as a schoolmaster at Birmingham's King Edward's School, was the author of a wide range of writings dominated by his highly imaginative theological works. He is best known, however, for the classic early science fiction work Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions, which combined a satirical treatment of contemporary social class structures and gender roles, a deep expression of his own religious principles, and a speculative exploration of geometrical dimensions that anticipates Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Louisa Baldwin wrote poetry, two collections of children's stories and four novels for adults; but is most highly regarded for her gothic ghost stories, which were originally published in literary magazines but were collected together and published as The Shadow on the Blind by John Lane in 1895. The imaginative adventure novels of Max Pemberton, the Edgbaston-born son of a Birmingham brass foundry owner, sold vastly well, from The Iron Pirate of 1893, a seafaring tale of ironclad buccaneers, to The Garden of Swords, an 1899 story of the Franco-Prussian War. This swashbuckling genre was also represented by the highly successful 1884 novel The Adventures of Maurice Drummore (Royal Marines) by Land and Sea, which claimed to be written by Linden Meadows and illustrated by F. Abell, though both in fact were pseudonyms of the Birmingham-born Charles Butler Greatrex. The literary output of the Canadian-born author Grant Allen, who was brought up in Birmingham from the age of 13 and attended King Edward's School, was prodigious and varied even by Victorian standards. The Scottish critic Andrew Lang called him \\"the most versatile, beyond comparison, of any man in our age\\". Allen is best known for his best-selling but controversial 1895 novel The Woman Who Did, whose tragic plot combined support for free love with opposition to the institution of marriage, and whose success scandalised Victorian society. He is also noted for innovations in detective fiction, creating independent-minded female detectives modelled on the feminist ideal of the New Woman in Miss Cayley's Adventures; and for playing with the conventions of the crime genre in An African Millionaire, where the criminal is the hero, and the short story \\"The Great Ruby Robbery\\", where the culprit turns out to be the detective investigating the crime. Allen's incorporation of his own scientific preoccupations into novels such as the time travel-based The British Barbarians also made him an important early pioneer of science fiction. H. G. Wells later wrote to him, acknowledging that \\"this field of scientific romance with a philosophical element that I am trying to cultivate, properly belongs to you.\\" =Oscott, Newman and the Catholic literary revival= Oscott CollegeAlthough Victorian Birmingham was known as a stronghold of Protestant Nonconformism, St. Mary's College, Oscott in the north of the city lay at the heart of the mid-19th century revival of English Catholicism. The college built a reputation for Catholic literary scholarship after Thomas Walsh brought major collections of Renaissance scholarship including the Harvington Library and the Marini Library to the college in the 1830s, and in 1840 Nicholas Wiseman was appointed the college's rector. As a man of wide cultural achievements and a prolific author himself, Wiseman established the college as the favoured educational establishment of the country's Catholic social and intellectual elite, attracting many students who would become leading figures of the Catholic literary revival that would follow. William Barry, who was educated at Oscott as a boy and later returned as Professor of Theology, has been dubbed \\"the creator of the English Catholic novel\\". His provocative, controversial and often witty books varied from The New Antigone of 1887 ‚Äì a cutting attack on socialism, atheism, free love and the cult of the New Woman ‚Äì to the more overtly Catholic The Two Standards of 1898, and The Wizard's Knot of 1901 ‚Äì a satire on the Celtic Revival. Alfred Austin, who studied at Oscott in the 1840s, succeeded Tennyson as Poet Laureate in 1896, though it was widely believed that this had more to do with his support for the Tory Party than for his literary merit. Lord Acton became the editor of the Catholic monthly The Rambler, a trusted advisor to William Gladstone and one of the leading liberal historians of the 19th century, best known for his editorship of the monumental Cambridge Modern History. The \\"first great modern philosopher of resistance to the state\\", he was the originator of the famous aphorism \\"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\\". An Oscott student under Wiseman, Acton later remarked on the international influence of the college at the time: \\"apart from Pekin, Oscott was the centre of the world\\". John Henry Newman's writing desk at the Birmingham OratoryThe most influential writer to be attracted to Oscott by Wiseman however was John Henry Newman, who was to become the outstanding Catholic literary figure of 19th century England and the major influence on the Catholic literary revival that was to follow. Newman moved to Birmingham shortly after his conversion from the Church of England in 1845, staying initially at Oscott before founding the Birmingham Oratory in Edgbaston in 1849. Living at the Oratory almost continuously until his death in 1890, his major works written in Birmingham include the autobiographical Apologia Pro Vita Sua, the novel Loss and Gain, his principal philosophical work Grammar of Assent, and the poem The Dream of Gerontius, later set to music by Edward Elgar. Under Newman the Oratory became the focus of a literary culture itself, attracting further Catholic writers of note. The poet Gerard Manley Hopkins taught at The Oratory School when he graduated and converted to Catholicism in 1867; it was here that he was to first develop the ideas of inscape and instress that were to prove central to his poetic practice. The novelist, poet and polemicist Hilaire Belloc came from a long line of Birmingham radicals ‚Äì his mother was Bessie Rayner Parkes, his grandfather Joseph Parkes and his great-great grandfather Joseph Priestley. He studied at the Oratory School from 1880 to 1886, and it was there he wrote his first published work Buzenval. The poet Edward Caswall lived at the Oratory from 1852 until his death in 1878, writing his major works Lyra Catholica and The Masque of Mary and other Poems. George Moore Oscott also produced writers whose relationship with their Catholic background was ambiguous or actively hostile, and who ‚Äì often writing from exile ‚Äì were to become leading figures of the decadent literature of the close of the 19th century. The Irish-born George Moore was provoked into becoming a writer by his seven years at Oscott, which he called \\"a vile hole, a den of priests\\", turning to Byron and Shelley and noting that \\"it pleased me to read 'Queen Mab' and 'Cain' amid the priests and ignorance of a hateful Roman Catholic college\\". His early novels ‚Äì particularly his 1885 work A Mummer's Wife, which dealt with alcoholism and the seedy underside of theatrical life ‚Äì \\"opened up new possibilities for the novel in English\\", being the first to break away from the literary conventions of the Victorian style under the influence of the naturalism of √âmile Zola. Moore constantly developed the form of his literary self-expression, with his later novels having a more fragmented, tapestry-like structure. He was a pivotal figure in the transition from Victorian to modern fiction, and a particular influence on James Joyce: the critic Graham Hough wrote that \\"neither the title nor the content of Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man would have been quite the same in 1916 if it had not been for the prior existence of George Moore's Confessions of a Young Man in 1886.\\" \\"The Dead\\", the final story of Joyce's Dubliners, was directly inspired by Moore's 1891 novel Vain Fortune. The eccentric novelist and artist Frederick Rolfe studied at Oscott from 1887, but left after it was decided he was an unsuitable candidate for the priesthood. Despite his open homosexuality he strongly felt himself to have a vocation for the priesthood throughout his lifetime. His most famous work was the decadent semi-autobiographical wish-fulfilment novel Hadrian the Seventh, published under his self-styled title Baron Corvo, in which he imagined himself as the Pope, but he also wrote short stories, poetry and essays. Wilfrid Scawen Blunt was inspired to become poet by the metaphysical teachings of Oscott's professor of philosophy during the 1850s, but embarked upon a succession of affairs during his subsequent career as a diplomat, becoming a self-confessed hedonist. He is best known for his erotic verse, and for his anti-imperialist opposition to British policy in Ireland, Egypt, Sudan and India. In 1914 a group of poets including W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, and Richard Aldington entertained Blunt to a lunch of roast peacock, paying tribute to him as the first poet to relate poetry to real life. Pound wrote of Blunt's \\"unconquered flame\\", though Yeats was more ambivalent, confiding in T. Sturge Moore that \\"only a small part of his work is good but that is exceedingly fine\\". =19th century poetry and drama= Although writing and, particularly, playwrighting were still not considered respectable activities for women throughout much of the period, 19th century Birmingham featured a notable concentration women poets and dramatists. Constance Naden, who was born in Edgbaston and lived most of her life in Birmingham, published two well-received volumes of poetry in the 1880s while studying science at Mason Science College. She has been celebrated as the foremost female poet to hail from Birmingham. Sarah Anne Curzon was born and educated in Birmingham, where she began writing and contributing essays and fiction to periodicals at an early age. \\"At any one time there must be five or six supremely intelligent people on the earth,\\" The New Yorker poetry editor Howard Moss wrote shortly after Auden's death, \\"Auden was one of them\\". Auden's family roots were strongly tied to the West Midlands and he grew up from the age of six months in the Birmingham area, first in Solihull and then in Harborne, the son of George Augustus Auden, the Schools Medical Officer for Birmingham City Council. Auden's early poetry carried strong social, political and economic overtones, reflecting an interest in the thought of Marx and Freud inherited from his father, but his later work was characterised by a greater interest in religious and spiritual issues. The huge range of form, style and subject exhibited by his work, the variety of its outlook and its accessibility and emotional directness initially provoked scepticism amongst modernist critics who placed greater value on consistency and objectivity, but his reputation grew as modernist orthodoxy waned, and he has since increasingly come to be viewed as the first writer of the postmodern era. By 2011 the American critic Edward Mendelson could write: \\"at the start of the twenty-first century Auden's stature had reached the point where many readers thought it not implausible to judge his work the greatest body of poetry in English of the previous hundred years or more\\". Birmingham remained Auden's principal home for three decades, until he left for the United States in 1939 (he was noted for going shopping for cigarettes in Harborne in his dressing gown) and he identified with the city throughout his lifetime. Birmingham also featured widely in his work. \\"As I Walked Out One Evening\\", one of his best-known early poems, moves a ballad constructed from a series of allusions to folksong and popular culture into the decidedly 20th century context of Bristol Street in Birmingham City Centre. In \\"Letter to Lord Byron\\" he rejects the Lake District idyll of William Wordsworth in favour of a decisive if irony-tinged commitment to the contemporary urban landscape of the Midlands, declaring \\"Clearer the Scafell Pike, my heart has stamped on / The view from Birmingham to Wolverhampton\\"; before continuing \\"Tramlines and slagheaps, pieces of machinery / That was, and still is, my ideal scenery\\". The wider influence of the city on Auden's outlook and work was noted in 1945 by the American critic Edmund Wilson who observed that Auden \\"in fundamental ways ... doesn't belong in that London literary world ‚Äì he's more vigorous and more advanced. With his Birmingham background ... he is in some ways more like an American. He is really extremely tough ‚Äì cares nothing about property or money, popularity or social prestige-does everything on his own and alone.\\" Auden lay at the forefront of the Auden Group that dominated English poetry of the 1930s and also included the Birmingham-born Rex Warner and the Birmingham- based Louis MacNeice, who had moved to the city from Oxford in 1930 to teach Classics at the University of Birmingham. MacNeice's experience of Birmingham's urbanity lay behind the major advances in his poetry in the early 1930s, as his work increasingly reflected the city with the sympathetic detachment that was to become his distinctive poetic voice. His 1935 collection Poems established him as one of the leading new poets of the time, being described by Cecil Day-Lewis as \\"in some ways the most interesting of the poetical work produced in the last two years\\" ‚Äì a particularly significant comparison for a period that included major publications by T. S. Eliot, Auden, Stephen Spender and Day-Lewis himself. As well as marking a high point in his poetic practice, MacNeice's period in Birmingham was one of domestic happiness, abruptly shattered in 1934 when his wife left him and his son to move to the United States with an American football player. In response MacNeice \\"began to go out a great deal and discovered Birmingham. Discovered that the students were human; discovered that Birmingham had its own writers and artists who were free of the London trade-mark.\\" With his mentor E. R. Dodds leaving the city, however, he came to feel increasingly isolated and in 1936 accepted a lectureship at Bedford College, London. Early 20th century Birmingham also featured several notable poets who were not associated with the Auden circle. John Drinkwater was one of the originators of the Georgian Poetry movement in 1912, and one of only five poets whose work was to feature in all of the Georgian Poetry anthologies. Later editions of the series also included the work of the Halesowen-born, Birmingham-educated writer Francis Brett Young. Charles Madge, later the founder of Mass-Observation and Professor of Sociology at Birmingham University, was a leading Surrealist poet during the 1930s. His poetry featured regularly in the London Bulletin, and his 1933 article \\"Surrealism for the English\\" advocated that English surrealist poets would need to combine knowledge of \\"the philosophical position of the French surrealists\\" with \\"a knowledge of their own language and literature\\" two or three years before most people in England had even heard of the movement. Henry Treece, who was born in Wednesbury and educated at the University of Birmingham, led the neo-romantic reaction against Auden Group in the late 1930s and 1940s as one of the founders of the New Apocalyptics, describing the movement in his 1946 work How I See Apocalypse: \\"In my definition, the writer who senses the chaos, the turbulence, the laughter and the tears, the order and the peace of the world in its entirety, is an Apocalyptic writer. His utterance will be prophetic, for he is observing things which less sensitive men may have not yet come to notice; and as his words are prophetic, they will tend to be incantatory, and so musical.\\" =Highfield and the Birmingham Group= W. H. Auden and Louis MacNeice also formed part of the remarkable wider group of writers and artists that formed in Birmingham in the 1930s around the Edgbaston home of the poet and classicist E. R. Dodds; the Birmingham Film Society; and Highfield, the rambling Selly Park home of the economist Philip Sargeant Florence and his wife, the journalist and radical Lella Secor Florence.; United by their broadly left wing views, this group included a diverse range of writers. The Erdington-born poet and dramatist Henry Reed became involved as an undergraduate studying under MacNeice, later becoming well known for \\"The Naming of Parts\\" ‚Äì one of the best-known poems of the Second World War ‚Äì and establishing a reputation as a noted radio dramatist. Another radio dramatist associated with the group through MacNeice was Lozells-born R. D. Smith, who later married the novelist Olivia Manning. The architectural writer and critic Nikolaus Pevsner first visited Highfield in 1933 as a refugee from Nazi Germany. From 1934 he lived at the Ladywood home of Francesca Wilson, which housed a varied group of international political refugees, while he conducted the study at the University of Birmingham for Sargeant Florence that led to the publication of Pioneers of the Modern Movement in 1936 and An Inquiry into Industrial Art in England in 1937: pivotal works in the study of modern design. Also living at Duchess Road was the emigre Russian linguist, classicist and cultural critic Nicholas Bachtin, whom Wilson had met in Paris in 1928 and who was a former member of the \\"Bakhtin Circle\\" that had formed in Russia around his brother Mikhail Bakhtin. The literary critic and poet William Empson took refuge at Highfield after his expulsion from Cambridge, living in the city for 6 months and unsuccessfully seeking a post at the University. George Thomson associated with the group after his move to Birmingham in 1937. A classical scholar and Marxist philosopher, he wrote on an extraordinarily wide range of subjects ‚Äì \\"kinship, poetry, land tenure, textual criticism, word order, linguistics, religion, Marxism, Thomas Hardy, communist political strategy, and much else\\". The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein was also closely associated with the Highfield group: although living in Cambridge he found Birmingham's intellectual culture more outward- looking and made the city the focus of his primary social circle, being particularly close to Thomson and Bachtin, whom he visited frequently. He had had earlier links with Birmingham, visiting the city regularly in the years leading up to World War I to stay with his friend David Pinsent in Selly Park. It was in Paradise Street opposite Birmingham Town Hall in 1913 that Wittgenstein had dictated the typescript that would become Notes on Logic, his first philosophical work. Also connected with Highfield were Walter Allen and John Hampson, who formed a link to the separate group of novelists and short story writers known as the Birmingham Group, which formed in 1935 after the American critic Edward O'Brien announced of \\"a new group of writers emerging in the Midlands, chiefly in and near Birmingham\\". Despite their reputation as working class novelists, the Birmingham Group had the varied social backgrounds characteristic of highly socially mobile Birmingham. John Hampson was born into a prosperous middle-class family impoverished by the collapse of the family business, living a chequered existence including spending time imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs for book theft. His first published novel Saturday Night at the Greyhound was set in a pub in Derbyshire but featured flashbacks to the protagonists' Birmingham backgrounds, proving an unexpected success for the Hogarth Press in 1931 and bringing Hampson fame and literary friendships with Leonard and Virginia Woolf, William Plomer, John Lehmann and E. M. Forster. The Woolfs published Hampson's second novel O Providence ‚Äì a bleaker semi-autobiographical story of the descent into poverty of a boy born into luxury in Five Ways, written in a sparse, angular style of short unconnected sentences ‚Äì but they baulked at the explicit homosexual content of Go Seek a Stranger, the stylistically sophisticated portrait of the dilemmas facing a Birmingham-born homosexual man in the 1930s that is considered Hampson's finest work. Hampson published two further Birmingham-set works: 1936's Family Curse and the 1939 short story Good Luck. Walter Allen was born the son of a silversmith in Lozells, but went on to study at the University of Birmingham, becoming a friend of Louis MacNeice and John Hampson while an undergraduate. He established himself as a successful author in the late 1930s with a series of realist novels ‚Äì including Innocence is Drowned of 1938, Blind Man's Ditch of 1939 and Living Space of 1940 ‚Äì set in Birmingham and depicting the political and social tensions of working class life. After the war he became well known as a journalist and critic and in 1959 wrote All in a Lifetime, also set in Birmingham and his most highly regarded novel. The most authentically working class of the Birmingham Group authors was Leslie Halward, who was born over a butchers shop in Selly Oak and worked as a plasterer and toolmaker. Halward's major works were his short stories, collected in the two anthologies To Tea on Sundays and The Money's Alright and Other Stories, which captured an ambience \\"peculiarly appropriate to Birmingham\\" and were commended by E. M. Forster for their \\"good humour, the sureness and lightness of touch, the absence of any social moral\\" In contrast to Halward's origins Peter Chamberlain was the grandson of Birmingham architect J. H. Chamberlain and of the city's first Lord Mayor James Smith. He was born in Edgbaston and educated at the private Clifton College. A notable motorcycle journalist and writer of short stories for the New Statesman, his novel Sing Holiday is a tale of motor racing set in Birmingham and the Isle of Man. Two further members of the group ‚Äì Walter Brierley and Hedley Carter ‚Äì were from Derbyshire and had few connections with Birmingham, attending meetings of the group irregularly. Despite their variety of style, purpose and genre, the writers of 1930s Birmingham from Auden through Highfield to the Birmingham Group shared some distinctive characteristics ‚Äì particularly their high level of political engagement and their use of cinematic narrative techniques such as montage in their writing. These were to form their greatest collective influence as, passed on through Hampson, Auden and MacNeice, they were to be adopted by Virginia Woolf and through her much of 1930s literary London. =Early 20th century novelists= J. R. R. Tolkien The best-known early to mid 20th century novelist associated with Birmingham was J. R. R. Tolkien, whose books The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are two of the world's four best-selling books of all time, with over 100 million and over 150 million copies in print respectively. Although Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein in South Africa, he later called this a \\"fallacious fact\\" claiming that he \\"happened to be born there by accident\\". Both of his parents were from Birmingham and he was brought up in the city from the age of three, living in Sarehole ‚Äì an area of Hall Green then on the semi-rural southern edge of the city ‚Äì and in Moseley, Kings Heath, Edgbaston and Rednal. Tolkien later remembered his time in Hall Green in particular as \\"the longest-seeming and most formative part of my life\\" and numerous connections have been made between his Birmingham upbringing and features of his work: Sarehole Mill has been seen as the inspiration for the \\"Great Mill\\" of The Hobbit; Moseley Bog as the basis of the \\"Old Forest\\" of Book One of The Lord of the Rings; and the gothic brick towers of Perrott's Folly and Edgbaston Waterworks ‚Äì dominating the skyline from the bedroom window of Tolkien's home in Stirling Street, Edgbaston ‚Äì as the inspiration for \\"The Two Towers\\" of Book Two of The Lord of the Rings. The relationship between Birmingham and Tolkien's universe is a broader one, however. Tolkien's cultural outlook was deeply influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, whose origins lay with the Birmingham Set of the 1850s and of which Birmingham was a key hub.; He was unambiguous that The Shire of the Lord of the Rings was based on a pre-industrial Birmingham area, claiming \\"I lived, for my early years, in the Shire, in a pre-mechanical age\\", and his earliest tales of Middle Earth explicitly related it to the wider West Midlands region. The language that underlies his imaginary worlds was also strongly tied to the Birmingham area: \\"I am a West-midlander by blood\\" he wrote to W. H. Auden in 1955, \\"and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it.\\" Tolkien's entire legendarium has been seen both as a lament for the lost world of his childhood, and as an imaginary reconstruction of the mythology of the rural Forest of Arden landscape that underlay the West Midlands' advancing modernity. Another novelist to take inspiration from the landscape of the early 20th century West Midlands was Francis Brett Young. Born just west of Birmingham in Halesowen, Young was educated in Sutton Coldfield, at Epsom in Surrey and at the University of Birmingham before training as a doctor in the city; but he only started writing the stories of Midlands life that were to make his name after leaving Birmingham in 1907. His first published novel was Undergrowth of 1913, but it was not until the late 1920s that he became firmly established as a best-selling writer with the resounding commercial success of 1927's Portrait of Clare, which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and was later being adapted into a film; and 1928's My Brother Jonathan, also made into a film and later serialised for BBC Television. 27 of Young's novels ‚Äì from Undergrowth of 1913 to Wistanslow of 1956 ‚Äì are set in \\"North Bromwich\\", a historically and geographically detailed portrayal of Birmingham and its suburbs that collectively forms the city's most extensive fictional representation. Like Tolkien, Young saw Birmingham's man-made urbanity and its mechanically-driven economy as despoiling influences on the natural beauty and simple lifestyle of the rural Midlands, but other writers took a less nostalgia-driven approach. Hardware: a novel in four books was written in 1914 and is recognised as the major work of the Birmingham-educated author Kineton Parkes. It is set in the Midlands town of \\"Metlingham\\", which it depicts in prodigious detail and which is very obviously based on Birmingham. Parkes, like Tolkien, was influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement but his writing also reflected the urbanist values of the Civic Gospel ideology with which the movement in Birmingham was closely associated, concluding \\"at heart Metlingham was sound: the City and its Council‚Ä¶ the life of the City and of its suburbs‚Ä¶\\". The structure of Hardware was also innovative and progressive, reflecting the fragmentation of urban life through its division into 4 books, 40 chapters and nearly 300 sections in a form that anticipated James Joyce's later work Ulysses. The most influential modernist novelist of early 20th century Birmingham however was Henry Green, whose oblique approach to writing ‚Äì \\"displacing the centrality of plot, undermining the integrity of character, silencing the narrative voice and questioning the authenticity of the self\\" ‚Äì has seen him described by the critic Edward Stokes as \\"one of the most elusive, tantalizing and enigmatic of novelists\\", though the novelist Sebastian Faulks has also written that Green's writing brings \\"a pleasure more intense, more original, more rewarding than that offered by any of his contemporaries\\". Green's 1929 novel Living ‚Äì set in a Birmingham foundry ‚Äì was one of the earliest of the novels of working class life that would become common during the 1930s. It was more notable, however, for its experimental prose style, defamiliarised through the avoidance of the use of the articles \\"the\\" and \\"a\\", and the removal of adjectives from descriptive passages, both as a reflection of the local accent and as a conscious rejection of the residual romanticism of the psychological realist and stream of consciousness styles of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf. =Genre fiction= Barbara CartlandThe romantic novelist Barbara Cartland, who was born in Edgbaston in 1901, was cited by the Guinness Book of Records at the time of her death as the world's bestselling living author, with over 700 books to her name having sold 900 million copies. Also notable as a romantic novelist was Jeffery Farnol, who was born in Aston in 1878 and first found work as a Birmingham brass-founder. He wrote over 40 novels that combined regency romance with swashbuckling adventure, becoming an influence on George MacDonald Fraser, Jack Vance and Georgette Heyer, and forming \\"a link between the major writers of the 19th century and the popular romancers of the present\\". * Charles Talbut Onions: Birmingham born and educated, he was a prominent etymologist who worked on the Oxford English Dictionary and was general editor of its shorter version. * Sax Rohmer, author of the Fu Manchu thrillers,Several of these can be read on Google Books was the pseudonym of Arthur Henry Ward, who was born in Birmingham but pursued his writing career in London and then New York. Post-war and contemporary literature =Literary fiction= The University of Birmingham continued as one of the main points of focus for the city's literary culture in the post-war era. The novelist and critic Anthony Burgess worked in the university's extramural department between 1946 and 1950. Of longer lasting influence on Birmingham literature were David Lodge and Malcolm Bradbury ‚Äì the two leading late-20th century practitioners of the campus novel ‚Äì who both joined the staff of the English Department in the early 1960s, collaborating on the 1963 satirical revue Between these Four Walls for the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and becoming lifelong friends. Bradbury wrote his second novel Stepping Westward in the city but moved to the University of East Anglia in 1965, while Lodge remained in Birmingham, retiring in 1987 to concentrate on writing. Many of Lodge's novels are set in Rummidge, \\"an imaginary city ... which occupies, for the purposes of fiction, the space where Birmingham is to be found on maps of the so-called real world\\". These include Nice Work, described by Arthur Marwick as \\"the novel of life in Thatcherite Britain\\", and the Booker Prize shortlisted Small World: An Academic Romance. Lodge's novels use parody and pastiche, formal experiments such as chapters composed entirely of newspaper clippings, and ironic allusions to other literary genres, to examine moral dilemmas and document changes in British society. Jim Crace Jim Crace moved to Birmingham in 1965 to study at what is now Birmingham City University, where his contemporaries included the novelist and journalist Gordon Burn, whose later writing blurred the lines between fact and fiction to examine the trauma, spectacle and dysfunction of contemporary celebrity, and new gothic psychological novelist Patrick McGrath. Crace wrote short stories from the early 1970s and published his first novel Continent in 1986. Still living in Moseley in the south of the city, his reputation unusually combines both a broad popular readership and substantial acclaim among critics and academics. His work sits outside the social realist mainstream of English novelists, having more in common with European and South American authors such as Italo Calvino, Vladimir Nabokov, Franz Kafka, W. G. Sebald, Jorge Luis Borges or Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Although his novels have settings as diverse as the Bronze Age, the Judaean Desert in the time of Christ, an 1830s Cornish fishing village and an invented eighth continent, Crace claims that the subject of all of his books is present-day Birmingham, seen through \\"some idea or inspiration that would allow me to take the subject and dislocate it to another place and time to see if it cracks, if it bends.\\" Jonathan Coe ‚Äì described by Nick Hornby as \\"the best English novelist of his generation\\" ‚Äì was born and raised in Lickey on the southern edge of Birmingham and educated at King Edward's School, where he wrote his first novel at the age of 15. Coe's largely satirical novels combine the techniques of postmodern fiction with a focus on the more traditional values of humour and plot. His novel The Rotters' Club was set in Birmingham and satirised the city's society in the 1970s, with its sequel The Closed Circle taking a similar approach to Birmingham society of the first decade of the 21st century. The novelist Susan Fletcher, who was born in Birmingham in 1979, won both the Betty Trask Prize and the Whitbread First Novel Award for her 2004 debut novel Eve Green, which used the forced relocation of an 8-year-old girl from Birmingham to rural Wales to explore themes of loss, loneliness and guilt. Another focus of literary culture within Birmingham is the Tindal Street Press, which grew out of a Balsall Heath-based group of writers in 1998. The city's most notable publisher of literary fiction, Tindal Street Press has built a remarkable record of bringing West Midlands writers to wider attention: of the 48 titles published in its first ten years, 12 were nominated for one or more national or international prizes. Astonishing Splashes of Colour was the first novel by Quinton-based music teacher Clare Morrall. Set in Birmingham and featuring a lead character with synesthesia, it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2003, and subsequently translated into twelve languages, becoming Tindal Street's bestselling title. The Birmingham area also provides settings for several of Morrall's subsequent novels, including 2008's The Language of Others , and 2012's The Roundabout Man. In 2007 Tindal Street published What Was Lost, the debut novel by Hall Green shopworker Catherine O'Flynn. Part ghost story and part mystery, it used the story of the disappearance of a 10-year-old girl from a Birmingham shopping centre to illustrate the changes in an industrial community over two decades, being nominated for both the Booker Prize and the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2007, and winning the first novel award at the 2007 Costa Book Awards. O'Flynn's 2010 second novel The News Where You Are led Fay Weldon to describe her as the \\"J. G. Ballard of Birmingham\\", noting how O'Flynn \\"deals with her particular city, finding poetry and meaning where others see merely boredom and dereliction ... as if the lonely dead of the city's past and present were determined to be heard\\". Other local writers who've seen notable success with Tindal Street include the Edgbaston-based social worker Gaynor Arnold and the Black Country writers Raphael Selbourne and Anthony Cartwright. The impact of Tindal Street on promoting the city's writers was summed up by The Observer in 2008: \\"The company has an ability to mine local talent, even when their authors' biographies don't ooze glamour ... There are aspiring authors all over the country writing stories between night shifts, but only in Birmingham, it seems, does anyone pay attention.\\" =Crime fiction, thrillers and science fiction= John Wyndham, who was born to a Birmingham family in Knowle to the south-east of the city and brought up in Edgbaston, was the most significant single writer in the post-war rebirth of science fiction in Britain, becoming the founding figure of a school of writers that would include John Christopher, Charles Eric Maine, J. G. Ballard, and Christopher Priest. 1951's The Day of the Triffids marked the first of a series of novels ‚Äì including The Chrysalids, The Midwich Cuckoos and Chocky ‚Äì that \\"with a skilful anatomy, laid bare the abyss beneath the comfortable lives of his audience\\". Wyndham is one of the few science fiction writers to have successfully crossed over to mainstream appeal, with his post-apocalyptic novels capturing the British mood of unease in the 1950s and making him one of the most important British writers of the early post-war era. Ian Watson was one of the leading British figures of the New Wave science fiction that emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Watson wrote highly imaginative narratives that explored the relationships between consciousness, language, and reality and taught one of the United Kingdom's first academic courses in science fiction at Birmingham Polytechnic. His first novel, The Embedding of 1973, remains his most respected single title and formed a searching exploration of the Whorfian hypothesis and the nature of communication through language, with his many subsequent novels and over 170 short stories also often taking the form of thought experiments on the nature of perception. The science fiction critic David Pringle wrote that \\"British SF in the 1970s belonged to Ian Watson\\" with the author Brian Stableford concluding that \\"There is no other writer in the field who provides such a bold challenge to the imagination\\". Also influential within the New Wave was Birmingham-born Barrington J. Bayley, whose work focused on metaphysical and absurdist themes and was to prove influential on M. John Harrison, Iain M. Banks, William Gibson and Bruce Sterling. Mike Gayle Harborne-based Mike Gayle is one of the key exemplars of lad lit, a genre of fiction that developed in the 1990s exploring \\"unheroic\\" tales of masculinity. Many of his books have Birmingham settings, including Turning Thirty of 2000, telling the story of its hero's return from New York City to Kings Heath, and His 'n' Hers of 2004, a tale of students in Selly Oak. Also exploring the life of the contemporary urban male is the fiction of John McCabe, who combines a career as a best-selling novelist with one as a geneticist. His 1998 debut novel Stickleback used Birmingham's Number 11 Outer Circle bus route as a metaphor for unproductive routine and futility. * Maureen Carter's Bev Morriss crime novels are set in present-day Birmingham. * Judith Cutler's crime novels are set in present-day Birmingham. * W.V.

Bruce Chatwin was born in Sheffield into a long line of \\"Birmingham worthies\\" and brought up in the Birmingham area in West Heath, Edgbaston and Tanworth in Arden. His 1977 book In Patagonia effectively redefined the genre of travel literature and was described by the travel writer William Dalrymple in 2011 as \\"probably the most influential travel book written since the war\\".

Biography Little is known about his origins, but he was an M. D. He was a partner in the Manchester firm of Taylor and Maxwell, fustian manufacturers, dyers and printer, and was involved with the development of printing machinery for calico in about 1770. About 1785 Taylor set up a dye-house in Manchester for Turkey Red dyeing. Taylor and Maxwell were early experimenters in the use of 'dephlogisticated marine acid' (chlorine) following the work of Berthollet and Scheele. The idea was suggested to Taylor by Dr Richard Kirwan F.R.S. and according to the article on 'Bleaching' in Rees's Cyclop√¶dia, which Taylor wrote: :... a whole piece of calico, in the state received from the loom, was in the spring of 1788 actually bleached white, printed in permanent colours and produced in the Manchester market ready for sale, having undergone all these operations in less than 48 hours by the joint efforts of Mr. Cooper, Mr. Baker and Mr Taylor, which is perhaps the first time an entire piece, either in France or England, that fully ascertained the real merits of a new mode of bleaching, and certainty that it might be generally useful in commerce.

Life  Dedo was a younger son of the Wettin margrave Conrad I of Meissen and his wife Luitgard of Ravenstein. From 1144, he administered the lordship of Groitzsch as heir apparent of the late Count Henry of Groitzsch (d. 1135), and also as an adopted son of his aunt Bertha (d. 1143), Henry's sister and Groitzsch heiress. When Margrave Conrad retired in 1156, the extended Wettin estates were divided and Dedi formally received the County of Groitzsch and the Lordship of Rochlitz, with jurisdiction over the Bishopric of Naumburg. Dedi participated in five campaigns of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa to Italy. In 1177, he served as Frederick's envoy to Pope Alexander III and swore, on Frederick's behalf, to uphold the Treaty of Venice, which ended the schism between pope and emperor. Back in Germany, Dedi appears to have spent most of his life in Rochlitz. Like his elder brother Margrave Otto II of Meissen, he encouraged the settlement of ethnic Germans in his territory. He founded Wechselburg Priory as a private monastery, where he and his descendants were buried. Together with his elder brothers Margrave Otto II of Meissen and Margrave Theodoric I of Lusatia, he was a loyal supporter of Emperor Frederick in his conflict with the Welf duke Henry the Lion. When his brother Theodoric I, who also styled himself a \\"Margrave of Landsberg\\", died in 1185, Dedi inherited his Lusatian possessions and by appointment of Emperor Frederick succeeded him as margrave. In the succession dispute in Meissen upon the death of Margrave Otto II in 1190, Dedi and his sons sided with their cousin Albert the Proud. In order to get into shape for participating in the Third Crusade, Dedi had his doctors attempt a liposuction. The operation was botched, and as a result, Dedi died on 16 August 1190.  Marriage and issue  Dedi married Matilda of Heinsberg and had six children with her: * Dietrich (before 13 September 1159; - 13 June 1207), Count of Sommerschenburg and Groitzsch and later provost of Magdeburg * Philip, provost of Xanten (1182-1190) * Conrad II (after 13 September 1159 - 6 May 1210), Margrave of Lusatia * Henry (d. 1174) * Goswin (d. 1174) * Agnes ( - 24/26 March 1195) Dedi was the grandfather of Saint Hedwig of Silesia and great-grandfather of the French prince Philip Hurepel.

The group believed that the Women's Suffrage movement was being damaged by class divisions, such as those that split the Women's Social and Political Union and the Women's Freedom League. They also thought that universal suffrage would be more popular with the liberal Government, as it was likely that voting rights only for privileged women would likely increase the conservative vote.

Club career In 1983, Davidson played for Doncaster Belles in their first ever WFA Cup final, a 3‚Äì2 win over St Helens at Sincil Bank. She remained the South Yorkshire club's regular goalkeeper in the 1994 FA Women's Cup Final win over Knowsley United, representing a period of unprecedented success which saw Doncaster Belles reach 11 out of 12 Cup finals, winning six of them. Davidson, known as Davo to teammates, also collected doubles in 1992 and 1994. In the summer of 1994, Davidson, who worked in Merseyside as an accountant, joined Belles teammates Janice Murray and Louise Ryde in signing for newly‚Äìformed Liverpool Ladies. In 1994‚Äì95 she played the Cup final again, as Liverpool lost 3‚Äì2 to Arsenal. Marieanne Spacey scored the winning goal in the 81st minute. Liverpool also reached the 1996 final but 15-year‚Äìold schoolgirl Rachel Brown had taken over in goal, following Davidson's sudden retirement in summer 1995. International career Manager Martin Reagan handed Davidson her senior England debut on 29 March 1987, in a 1‚Äì0 victory in the Republic of Ireland, a friendly match played ahead of the 1987 European Competition for Women's Football in Norway. She spent a period as understudy to regular number one Theresa Wiseman before enjoying a spell as the first choice number one. When The Football Association (FA) took over running the national team in 1993, incoming manager Ted Copeland selected Lesley Higgs for the 1995 UEFA Women's Championship qualifiers, with Davidson as back‚Äìup. In the final group match, a 10‚Äì0 win over Slovenia at Griffin Park, Davidson came on as a second-half substitute for Higgs. Davidson enjoyed a five year international career whilst seeing out her playing days at Liverpool. Pauline Cope was called‚Äìup as a replacement and went on to become first choice for the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup and beyond.

N44 is an emission nebula with superbubble structure located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way in the constellation Dorado. Originally catalogued in Karl Henize's \\"Catalogue of H-alpha emission stars and nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds\\" of 1956, it is approximately 1,000 light-years wide and 160,000-170,000 light-years distant. N44 has a smaller bubble structure inside known as N44F. The superbubble structure of N44 itself is shaped by the radiation pressure of a 40-star group located near its center; the stars are blue-white, very luminous, and incredibly powerful. N44F has been shaped in a similar manner; it has a hot, massive central star with an unusually powerful stellar wind that moves at 7 million kilometers per hour. This is because it loses material at 100 million times the rate of the Sun, or approximately 1,000,000,000,000,000 tons per year. However, varying density in the N44 nebula has caused the formation of several dust pillars that may conceal star formation. This variable density is likely caused by previous supernovae in the vicinity of N44; many of the stars that have shaped it will eventually also end as supernovae. The past effects of supernovae are also confirmed by the fact that N44 emits x-rays. N44 is classified as an emission nebula because it contains large regions of ionized hydrogen. However, the three strongest emission lines in the nebula are singly ionized oxygen atoms, which emit at an ultraviolet wavelength of 372.7 nm, doubly-ionized oxygen atoms, which emit at a blue-green wavelength of 500.7 nm, and neutral hydrogen atoms, which emit the hydrogen-alpha line at a red wavelength of 656.2 nm.

She is trained in a variety of styles of dance including ballet, modern dance, African dance, the Horton technique, Spanish dance, jazz, movement and mime, flying low technique, release technique, gumboot dance and Butoh. Her style of dance and choreography blends aspects of traditional and contemporary dances, allowing her to make dance political. Nyamza has performed nationally and internationally and has choreographed autobiographical, political, and social pieces both on her own and in collaboration with other artists. She draws inspiration from her daily life and her childhood growing up in Gugulethu, as well as her identity as a homosexual, black, South African woman. Nyamza's abstract dance style allows her to use dance as a way to share both her own personal stories as well as those of South African women with the world. She specifically uses her platform to share some of the traumas faced by South African lesbians, such as corrective rape. Additionally, she has created various community outreach projects that have helped to spread the positive influence of dance to different communities within South Africa, including the University of Stellenbosch's Project Move 1524, a group that uses dance therapy to educate on issues relating to HIV/AIDS, domestic violence and drug abuse. Early life Mamela Nyamza was born in 1976 into a large family living in Gugulethu, Cape Town in South Africa. Growing up in Gugulethu had an enormous influence on Nyamza's career as a dancer. She explained that the environment in which she was immersed \\"did not give (her) a choice but to love dance. There was music and sound, all day long, and even in the streets the noise became the music\\". Dancing became a way for Nyamza to understand all that was happening in the world around her, \\"I used my body as the instrument to react to all forms of sound, whether it be playing, crying, or watching all sorts of things that one can imagine happened in Gugulethu in the '80s\\". Since childhood, Nyamza has continued to use dance as a means to interpret, cope with, and reconcile her life's events. When her mother was raped and murdered in 1999, dance gave her the inner strength to face this experience. In the future, her mother's death greatly would come to influence her abstract style of dancing: \\"After my mother died, I could feel her in my dreams telling me to use my dance to tell real stories. I also later came out of the closet, and I started experiencing discrimination in society and that's when I thought, 'You know, I'm an artist, so let me be the voice that addresses all these issues'\\". Nyamza‚Äôs childhood has continued to influence her dance through her choices to use her platform as a means of amplifying the voices of her female family members onto an international stage. As with her mother, she choreographs pieces that display the trauma of the women in her life. Education Mamela Nyamza began her training as a dancer at the Zama Dance School under the Royal Academy of Dance while also attending Fezeka High School in Gugulethu. She continued her training at the Pretoria Dance Technikon where she received a National Diploma in Ballet. In 1998 Nyamza was granted a one-year fellowship to dance at the Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre in New York. The Alvin Ailey school provided Nyamza with an opportunity to dance alongside other black ballet dancers, which was an experience she did not have in South Africa. Upon graduation, she joined the State Theatre Dance Company with whom she did performances both nationally and internationally. Additionally, she has attended various intensive workshops and classes including a choreographic workshop at the Vienna International Dance festival, ballet training with Martin Schonberg through the Pact Dance Company, African Dance workshops in Soweto with Jamaine Acogny, and a course in directing at London's prestigious Sadler‚Äôs Wells Theatre. Community Outreach Programs Nyamza believes that others too, can use dance as a means to heal themselves by using it to express experiences they may find too difficult to put into words. It is this belief that has motivated her to take on various volunteer and community outreach projects‚Äîincluding ballet teaching in Mamelodi, volunteering at Thembalethu Day School for the Disabled, and launching a project at the University of Stellenbosch that uses dance therapy to educate the public on issues relating to HIV/AIDS, domestic violence, and drug abuse. Nyamza‚Äôs own past has continued to influence the outreach that she chooses to do, as she herself used artistic output as a means of coping with trauma: \\"Art has developed me, and opened a totally different book for me to explore the impossible which is now possible‚Ä¶Giving back to the community is helping those that come from where I come from, and showing them that this art‚Ä¶can heal a lot of them that are born out of issues just like myself\\". Career Nyamza has created her own style of dance which is easily identifiable as her own. Her self- choreographed ballets take on contemporary aspects, which has allowed activists such as Nyamza to explore cultural problems in society. As a consequence of her contemporary style, her choreography is able to blend modern and traditional forms of music. Her use of ballet as a building block for her style of dance is powerful due to the fact that black ballet dancers have not fit into the historically-driven image of a ballet dancer. Due to her style of dance and choreography, Nyamza has become immensely popular in the South African dance scene, as she continues to critique the ways in which ballet enforces idealized forms of the female body and shows how perspectives of womanhood are changing. Thus far in her dance career, Nyamza has held the role of dancer, choreographer, and teacher. In her early career she performed in various major international musicals including The Lion King in Den Haag, Netherlands in 2004,We Will Rock You in South Africa in 2006 Africa, and African Footprints. Since 2006, Nyamza has mainly focused on her own choreography, which she makes political by amplifying the voices that have long been silenced through systematic racism. The South African ballet scene has historically been a white, Eurocentric scene in which black dancers were segregated. As such, Nyamza‚Äôs choreography focuses on the narratives of black women. Some of the topics she examines are domesticity, traditional roles of black women in society, and commodification of female bodies. Her work also portrays the violence that women in South Africa face, displaying scenes of corrective rape and murder that would be avoided in most traditional ballet choreography. By inviting conversation that has long been ignored, Nyamza‚Äôs choreography holds a mirror to society, uplifting the perspectives that have long been absent. One of Nyamza's most known choreographic pieces is Hatch. Hatch was choreographed in 2008, and has since been performed at the Out The Box Festival, the Baxter Dance Festival, and at the World Population Foundation. Additionally, Nyamza did informal studio performances of Hatch in Brazil and Vienna and at selected schools in the Eastern Cape, Durban and Cape Town and at the South African Domestic Violence conference in Johannesburg. She has also performed the piece in various shelters for abused women in the Netherlands. The choreography of Hatch served as a means for Nyamza to connect with her murdered mother, and she has often performed the piece with her son, Amukele. In 2009 Nyamza was selected to be the South African representative to travel to Los, Angeles, United States and compete as one of eight countries and six different continents in Superstars of Dance‚Äîa show on the NBC television network. There she performed a tribal piece entitled Afro-fusion, which told the story of a woman deeply frustrated with her marriage and life. Although she did not win the show, the judges loved her piece and awarded her 58 points. Nyamza also served as a choreographer for the American television show So You Think You Can Dance? in 2008. In 2011 Nyamza was honoured with the Standard Bank Young Artist Award. Along with the other Standard Bank Young Artist Award winners, Nyamza showcased her work at the 2011 National Arts Festival in South Africa. There she performed the pieces Isingqala and Amafongkong, which featured a solo work by Nyamza and was a collaborative production with the Adugna Dance Theatre Company from Ethiopia. Nyamza said that her intention in creating Amafongkong was to use an open space to explore the notion of \\"collaboration\\" by \\"seeing how and where similar and different bodies could meet in movement\\". Nyamza choreographed Isingqala to be a personal, biographical narrative surrounding the rape and murder of her mother. She both shared the story of her mother to bring light to the phenomenon of female violence, while also juxtaposing it with South Africa as a traumatized nation. The sorrow behind these two narratives is made visible through darkness and through crying out. Crying and crying out are used repeatedly by Nyamza throughout Isingqala in order to demonstrate experiences of pain. In her choreography, crying in pain is deeply personal, but is also able to encompass the feelings of an entire community, namely the black women of South Africa. Mamela Nyamza collaborated with UK-based artist, Mojisola Adebayo, to create I Stand Corrected. The powerful piece addresses issues of homophobia and rape that Nyamza describes as \\"Dark, strange, witty and absurd\\". In it, Nyamza is killed for being a lesbian, and is coming back to \\"correct herself\\". The piece premiered in South Africa and successfully ran for three weeks at the Ovalhouse in London, where it was met with full houses and fantastic reviews. Additionally, I Stand Corrected recently received six Off West End Theatre nominations in London. I Stand Corrected was also performed at the Soweto Theatre in South Africa. This was a major accomplishment for Nyamza because of the difficulty she has experienced securing a spot in national theatres; \\"I have performed in Soweto, and because of that I'm the proudest artist ever\\". Obtaining funding from South Africa has also proved to be a barrier for Nyamza, \\"It's sad that we still have to struggle for funding here at home, while internationally we don't even have to apply, we just get invited\\". In March 2013 she performed at Infecting the City in Cape Town, South Africa. This project \\"places exciting new artworks in unexpected spaces in the middle of the City (to) challenge Cape Town's ideas of art and public space\\". Nyamza is excited for her future and plans to continue creating work that shares African stories and experiences with the rest of the world for as long as she can. In 2013, Nyamza choreographed 19-born-76-rebels. Her choreography considers South Africa‚Äôs past in relation to its present by recreating the Soweto riots and massacre in 1976. The narrative she develops focuses on lack of good education available to black South African children at the time. She again brings her personal experience into her choreography to take a political stand against the effects of poor education in the country. Some of the issues highlighted by the choreography, and by extension the riots, were the problems resulting from overcrowded classrooms, ill-equipped teachers, and the implementation of Afrikaans as the compulsory language of instruction. Nyamza herself was born in 1976, the same year as the rights. Her mother had been pregnant while involved in the riots. Nyamza therefore uses her personal experience to show the legacies of intergenerational trauma through choreography.

He was a recipient of the Rechter Prize.  Biography  Zolotov was born in 1926 in the city of Warsaw, Poland and moved with his family to Israel in 1935, where he settled with them in Tel Aviv. In 1939, he began working as a sculptor's apprentice alongside the sculptor Moshe Sternschuss, with whom he stayed in touch and collaborated on many projects, with the most prominent being the Nitzanim Memorial Building dedicated to the fallen of the Battle of Nitzanim. The Memorial, constructed in 1965, became known as one of the most important buildings in the history of Israeli architecture. The Memorial building also served as a cultural center. The building, built in the brutalist style, is reminiscent of a bunker or military station and overlooks the original site of the Kibbutz. The building, with its different components, tries to evoke in the visitors the feelings of the combat soldier in war over his home, as well as a sense of loss for those who fell. Alongside the building, Zolotov invited the sculptor Moshe Sternschuss to construct a monument for the fallen. After one year of service in the police force of the Hebrew settlements (during which he did guard duty in the fields of the Kibbutz Ein HaShofet), he began his studies in architecture at the Technion in Haifa. In light of the war, he missed a year and finished his studies in 1950. Since 1955, he has worked independently. In the 1950s and 1960s, Zolotov became one of the leading and most successful architects of the brutalist style, in Israel, and he was a pioneer of advanced thinking about city planning in Tel Aviv. In 1958, Zolotov planned the first tall building in Tel Aviv. The building, which was built on Ben Yehuda Street 77-79, was eleven stories high (a commercial floor, open floor, eight residential floors, and the top floor, where his office was found). This building represented a turning point in city planning in Israel as it was a pioneer project for the construction of tall buildings. It contained the first supermarket in Israel, which the Supersol company founded. Due to his persistence, the construction was completed and became the tallest in Tel Aviv built in a technologically advanced manner, advancing Zolotov as he became nominated for the Rokach Prize of Architecture in 1961. Zolotov requested to continue building tall buildings and planned a large neighborhood of towers, tens of floors high, in Givatayim. His theory states that tall buildings should be permanently constructed to allow for large open areas in places like Givatim where the weather permits for large parks. Due to the opposition of the council for city building, and of the contractor company, the project never materialized. Another significant project that he suggested, which was not executed, was his plan for Rothschild Boulevard in which he planned to remove the lines of trees and instead install a circular highway and residential, business and commercial tower. Additionally he suggested a station for public transportation in Tel Aviv (on the site of Beit Hadar and the parking lot connected to it). In 1963, he won the Rechter Prize for his guest house in Ein Avdat. In 2011, the book Nahum Zolotov - Architect and City Planner was published by the architect, Tula Amir.

The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station. History Bieber station was opened as a station of the Rodgau Railway (Offenbach‚ÄìReinheim line) on 30 October 1896. The Rodgau Railway has been operated since 2003 as part of S-Bahn line S1 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn, but only as far as R√∂dermark-Ober-Roden. Services between R√∂dermark-Ober-Roden and Dieburg are operated as an extension of services on the Dreieich Railway (Dreieichbahn), which was opened in 1905. The track between Dieburg and Reinheim has been dismantled. On 1 December 1898, the Offenbach-Bieber-Dietzenbach railway was opened as a branch line of the Rodgau Railway. On 18 June 1982, passenger services on the line were discontinued. In the 2003/2004 timetable, starting on 14 December 2003, passenger services were re-established with the commencement of S-Bahn services of line S 2 on the route between Niedernhausen and Dietzenbach. In the course of the upgrade for the S-Bahn, changes were made to the tracks at the station as the lines were duplicated and electrified. The station was rebuilt to provide barrier-free access for the disabled. The level crossing on Dietesheimer Stra√üe was removed and replaced by an underpass. Entrance Building The station building, built in 1896, is a listed monument under the Hessian Heritage Act. The two-story brick building was sold into private ownership on 30 December 2009 and subsequently there was a dispute over the status of its heritage listing. The building has deteriorated.

The company is operating from offices located in Copenhagen, Denmark, and in Fairfax, Virginia. Immudex specializes in the production of MHC Dextramers. MHC Dextramers are chemical reagents that are designed to detect antigen- specific T cells.Davis MM, Altman JD, Newell EW. ‚ÄúInterrogating the repertoire: broadening the scope of peptide-MHC multimer analysis‚Äù. Nat Rev Immunol. 2011 Jul 15;11(8):551-8. doi: 10.1038/nri3020. All Immudex products, whether on the marked or in development, are based on its proprietary MHC Dextramer technology. The use of MHC Dextramers offers a new method to accurately detect and quantify antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. While some of the technology is currently only sold for Research use only (RUO), clinical applications are being actively pursued. Currently, Immudex has several development projects for clinically applicable MHC Dextramers. Even so, the first MHC Dextramers clinical reagent has been developed and approved for clinical in vitro diagnostics in Europe. Namely the CE-marked kit for enumeration of cytomegalovirus-specific T cells. Immudex primarily focuses on the identification of producing large quantities of CD8+ T cells by the means of MHC class I molecules. Even so, the research and development into the application of MHC class II Dextramers might expand the technology.  History  Originally, Immudex operated as an individual division within the much larger Danish pharmaceutical company Dako. Immudex was later spun out as a separate business, when the focus of Dako largely shifted to cancer diagnostics.B√∏rsen, Oct. 9th, 2009, Tom Frovst. \\"Milliardpotentiale i Dako- satsning\\". Copenhagen, DK. pg. 8. Immudex currently have clients world wide with major markets in the United States and Europe. Patents for the MHC Dextramer technology were filed at Dako in 2001, and the Immudex division was launched in 2005. In 2011, Immudex received the prestigious ‚ÄúEntrepreneur of the Year 2011‚Äù award in the Life Sciences category granted by Ernst & Young.Ernst & Young, Nov. 24th, 2011. \\"Immudex vinder kategorien Life Sciences Entrepreneur Of The Year 2011\\". Copenhagen, DK Immudex received this award because of the commitment of the company, articulated in the company's \\"make it work and make it better\\" strategy to generate results for both practitioners and patients. The award is given to companies not only focused on financial growth, but also for softer values such as the entrepreneur's social responsibility and the ability to aspire an motivate the organization.  Dextramer technology  A large number of immunotherapies, currently in development, seek to induce, expand, activate or eliminate antigen-specific T cells. It is therefore important to be able to quantify and characterize the T cell responses before, during and after treatment in order to understand if the proposed change to the T cells has been effectuated. The process of negative selection in the thymus guarantees that virtually all T cells have very weak affinity for self-antigens. Therefore, the study of these lymphocytes in autoimmune diseases and cancer has been difficult, until the fairly recent introduction of MHC multimers. Tetramers, which are among the most popular form of these multimer complexes, have four binding sites. The Tetramers were originally developed in Academia. Many further developments in this technology have taken place at biotechnology companies.Altman, J.D. et al. ‚ÄúPhenotypic analysis of antigen-specific T lymphocytes.‚Äù Science, 274 (5284): October 1996, 94-96. The Immudex MHC Dextramers, which represent the latest advancement in this field, provide an exponentially greater probability of successful identification of antigen-specific T cells. This can be done, because the MHC Dextramers have nine, or more binding sites per dextran backbone. Scientists have been optimistic about the potential of such technology, since it will help broaden the understanding of T cell responses and will in the future be clinically applicable to many different antigen- specific T cells.  Products  The MHC Dextramers are fluorescent MHC multimer reagents, developed for sensitive, specific and accurate detection of antigen-specific T cells by using Flow cytometry. The MHC Dextramers covers human, mouse, and monkey alleles that all display disease relevant antigenic peptides. The MHC Dextramers can thereby be used for monitoring antigen- specific T cell responses. Virus Dextramer collection 1 - provides reagents for detection, quantification and isolation of virus specific T cells. It furthermore enables detection for CMV-, EBV-, influenza-, and BK virus specific CD8+ T cells. Dextramer CMV kit - These MHC Dextramers provide a method for quantification of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells in whole blood samples as an aid in predicting and monitoring patients at risk of developing CMV- related disease. Melanoma Dextramer collection 1 - comprises MHC Dextramers specific for 6 different melanoma-associated antigens and can be used for the detection, enumeration and isolation of melanoma-specific CD8+ T cells from blood or tumor tissue. Cancer Testis Antigen CD1d Dextramer - These MHC Dextramers are flow cytometry reagents for the identification and sorting of Natural killer cells (NKT), as well as an extensive range of single reagents for detection of cancer- and viral-specific T cells. The CD1d/Œ±-GalCer displays human CD1d molecules loaded with Œ±-GalCer.  Development Projects  Though Immudex specializes in MHC Dextramer technology, the company is also pursuing development projects in diagnostics for Lyme disease/Borreliosis, based on the detection of Borrelia-specific T cells in diseased patients. Clinical application of the CE-market Dextramer CMV kit has been approved for the European market. The CMV kit will also be attempted approved for the US market through a number of clinical trials and S10K approval. The CMV kit is intended for identification and enumerication of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells in whole blood samples. Furthermore, the MHC Dextramer CMV kit can be used for the assessment of CMV-specific immune status in HLA-matched patients. Knowledge of the level of viral-specific T cells allow evaluation of the patients preparedness for fighting the viral infection and thereby avoid unnecessary antiviral treatment. CMV infections are often unnoticed by healthy people, but can be life threatening for immune compromised individuals, such as HIV-infected persons and organ-transplant recipients.  Collaborations and partnerships  In 2013, Immudex entered into a co-distribution and co- promotional partnership with JPT Peptide Technologies. The goal of this partnership is to synergistically combine JPT's innovative peptide technologies along with existing products with Immudex's sophisticated MHC Dextramer products. This product combination will provide a comprehensive portfolio of high quality T cell relevant products and services for the immunotherapy and vaccine community.  International Proficiency Panels  Proficiency panel testing comprises an interlaboratory system for the regular testing of accuracy that the participating laboratories can achieve. The MHC multimer panel tests the proficiency of a given laboratory in performing the flow cytometry based MHC multimer assay on blood and in performing an ELISpot Assay. In the fall of 2013 Immudex entered an agreement with the US cancer Immunotherapy consortium (CIC) and the European Association for Cancer Immunotherapy (CIMIT). The agreement dictates that Immudex will provide MHC- peptide multimers and Elispot proficiency panels to laboratories worldwide, independently of their background and associations. CIC and CIMT originally established proficiency panel programs to offer an external validation of assay performance and to enhance assay harmonization. Over the years, more than one hundred laboratories have participated. Not only from the cancer field, but also from other immunological fields utilizing immune monitoring. As a result, two frequently used immune monitoring methods, have now reached a high degree of harmonization. Immudex, specialized in the detection of antigen-specific T cells has been an active participant in the proficiency panel process and is globally recognized for its expertise in immune monitoring. Thus Immudex was the logical choice as a partner for proficiency panels. Immudex will continue the external validation program established by CIC and CIMT under the successfully implemented harmonization guidelines and will promote a more widespread use of these technologies in the development of new cancer immunotherapies and vaccines against other diseases such as HIV, TB, diabetes and others.

He received his Ph.D. in 1985 from the University of Amsterdam with Hendrik Lenstra (Elliptic Curves and Class Groups).Ren√© Schoof, Mathematics Genealogy Project He is now a professor at the University Tor Vergata in Rome.R. Schoof's homepage, University Tor Vergata In 1985, Schoof discovered an algorithm which enabled him to count points on elliptic curves over finite fields in polynomial time.Ren√© Schoof: Elliptic curves over finite fields and the calculation of square roots mod p, Mathematics of Computation, No. 44, 1985, 483‚Äì494. This was important for the use of elliptic curves in cryptography, and represented a theoretical breakthrough, as it was the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm for counting points on elliptic curves. The algorithms known before (e.g. the baby-step giant-step algorithm) were of exponential running time. His algorithm was improved by A. O. L. Atkin (1992) and Noam Elkies (1990). He obtained the best known result extending Deligne's Theorem for finite flat group schemes to the non commutative setting, over certain local Artinian rings. His interests range throughout Algebraic Number Theory, Arakelov theory, Iwasawa theory, problems related to existence and classification of Abelian varieties over the rationals with bad reduction in one prime only, and algorithms. In the past, Ren√© has also worked with Rubik's cubes by creating a common strategy in speedsolving used to set many world records known as F2L Pairs, in which the solver creates four 2-piece \\"pairs\\" with one edge and corner piece which are each \\"inserted\\" into F2L slots in the CFOP method to finish the first two layers of a 3x3x3 Rubik's cube. This strategy is also used for all cubes of higher order (4x4x4 and up) in the Reduction, Yau, and Hoya methods if CFOP is used for their 3x3x3 stages. He also wrote a book on Catalan's conjecture.

Originally built in 1936 and opened in 1939, the Rock Caf√© reopened on May 29, 2009 after extensive repairs by historic preservationist David Burke due to damage from a 2008 fire. The restaurant's cookbook, written during the rebuilding effort, was published in November 2009. Rock Caf√© proprietor Dawn Welch, a long-time promoter of U.S. Route 66 in Oklahoma selected by The Oklahoman as Oklahoma's 2009 Woman of the Year, is the basis for animated character Sally Carrera in the Pixar film Cars.  History  Roy Rieves started building the Rock Caf√© in 1936 during the Dust Bowl era of the Great Depression and relied on local materials to build the caf√©'s distinctive stone exterior, doing much of the construction work himself or hiring students. The original costs included $100 for the land and $5 for local Kellyville sandstone left over from construction on the U.S. Route 66 roadway which had come to Stroud, Oklahoma in 1926. The caf√© opened in August 1939, initially operating under manager Miss Thelma Holloway, and was a busy local Greyhound bus stop during World War II. Its neon signage was installed in the late 1940s. Mamie Mayfield operated the Rock Caf√© twenty-four hours a day in 1959 and retired at age 70 on July 14, 1983. Business from cross-country truckers declined with the construction of Interstate 44 in Oklahoma, a toll road, although Highway 66 remains as a free alternative to the Turner Turnpike. After U.S. Route 66 was decommissioned in 1985, highway 66 became Oklahoma State Highway 66. Dawn Welch, the current proprietor, acquired the caf√© from Ed Smalley in 1993. Mamie J. Mayfield's (December 22, 1912 - September 25, 1994) name was kept alive in the form of a souvenir shop, Mamie's General Store. In 1999, an F3 tornado heavily damaged Stroud, destroying the town's 53-store Tanger Outlet mall and wiping out a handful of key local employers including a Sygma food service distribution facility. The Rock Caf√© survived, though its neon sign was damaged, but business was down by half due to the state of the fragile local economy. In 2001, the Rock Caf√© was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying it for matching grants and loans to finance its historic restoration. When the first Pixar crews researching Route 66 stopped at the Rock Caf√© in 2001, restoration and repair of the 1999 tornado damage was not yet complete; the neon flickered briefly but failed to come to life. With a federal grant and a loan of $30,000 in matching funds, the Rock Caf√© was restored with new heating and air conditioning systems, replacement of the original wiring, restoration of neon signage and a return of the building to its original layout. (archived) In 2007, travelling artist Bob Waldmire depicted the caf√© in one of his works; the Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives also devoted part of an episode to the Rock. On January 21, 2010 Dawn Welch appeared on NBC-TV¬¥s Today show, cooking and promoting her book. The January 2010 edition of \\"Oklahoma Living\\" magazine named the Rock Caf√© \\"Best Oklahoma Diner\\", featuring its proprietor in a cover photo. Stroud, Oklahoma also slowly began to recover economically through increased activity in the oil and gas sectors and in tourism. While the destroyed outlet shopping mall was not rebuilt, the community successfully marketed its industrial park, and is now a leading small city in oilfield manufacturing and transportation, particularly in the rail and pipeline sectors.

Degree of reaction (R) is an important factor in designing the blades of a turbine, compressors, pumps and other turbo- machinery. It also tells about the efficiency of machine and is used for proper selection of a machine for a required purpose. Various definitions exist in terms of enthalpies, pressures or flow geometry of the device. In case of turbines, both impulse and reaction machines, Degree of reaction (R) is defined as the ratio of energy transfer by the change in static head to the total energy transfer in the rotor i.e. :R = \\\\frac {\\\\text{Isentropic enthalpy change in rotor}}{\\\\text{Isentropic enthalpy change in stage}} .Peng, William W., Fundamentals of turbomachinery, John Wiley, 2008 For a gas turbine or compressor it is defined as the ratio of isentropic heat drop in the moving blades (i.e. the rotor) to the sum of the isentropic heat drops in the fixed blades (i.e. the stator) and the moving blades i.e. :R = \\\\frac {\\\\text{Isentropic heat drop in rotor}}{\\\\text{Isentropic heat drop in stage}} . In pumps, degree of reaction deals in static and dynamic head. Degree of reaction is defined as the fraction of energy transfer by change in static head to the total energy transfer in the rotor i.e. : R = \\\\frac {\\\\text{Static pressure rise in rotor}}{\\\\text{Total pressure rise in stage}} . Relation Most turbo machines are efficient to a certain degree and can be approximated to undergo isentropic process in the stage. Hence from Tds = dh - \\\\frac{dp}{\\\\rho}, Figure 1. Enthalpy vs. Entropy diagram for stage flow in turbine it is easy to see that for isentropic process ‚àÜH ‚âÉ ‚àÜP. Hence it can be implied :R = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta H\\\\text{ (Rotor)}}{\\\\Delta H\\\\text{ (Stage)}} The same can be expressed mathematically as:S.M,Yahya, Turbines, Compressors and Fans, 4th ed. McGraw,2011 :\\\\ R = \\\\frac{\\\\int_{3ss}^{2s} \\\\textrm{dh}}{\\\\int_{3ss}^1\\\\textrm{dh}} \\\\,\\\\ \\\\textrm{Or} \\\\,\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\int_{3ss}^{2s} \\\\textrm{dp } }{\\\\int_{3ss}^1\\\\textrm{dp}} Where 1 to 3ss in Figure 1 represents the isentropic process beginning from stator inlet at 1 to rotor outlet at 3. And 2 to 3s is the isentropic process from rotor inlet at 2 to rotor outlet at 3. The velocity triangle (Figure 2.) for the flow process within the stage represents the change in fluid velocity as it flows first in the stator or the fixed blades and then through the rotor or the moving blades. Due to the change in velocities there is a corresponding pressure change. Figure 2. Velocity Triangle for fluid flow in turbine Another useful definition used commonly uses stage velocities as: :\\\\, h_2 - h_3 = {1 \\\\over {2}}( V_{r3}^2 - V_{r2}^2) + {1\\\\over {2}}( U_2^2 - U_3^2) is the enthalpy drop in the rotor and :\\\\, h_{01} -h_{03} = h_{02} - h_{03} = ( U_2\\\\,V_{w2}- U_1\\\\,V_{w1}) is the total enthalpy drop. The degree of reaction is then expressed asDixon, S. L., Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Turbo- machinery, 5th ed. Elsevier,2011. : R =\\\\frac{[{1 \\\\over {2}}( V_{r3}^2 - V_{r2}^2) + {1\\\\over {2}}( U_2^2 - U_3^2)]}{( U_2\\\\,V_{w2}- U_1\\\\,V_{w1})} For axial machines U2 =U1= U, then : R=\\\\frac{( V_{r3}^2 - V_{r2}^2)}{2U(V_{w3} +V_{w2})} The degree of reaction can also be written in terms of the geometry of the turbomachine as obtained by : R= (\\\\frac{V_f}{2U})(\\\\tan {\\\\beta_3} - \\\\tan{\\\\beta_2}) where \\\\beta_3 is the vane angle of rotor outlet and \\\\beta_2 is the vane angle of stator outlet. In practice (\\\\frac{V_f}{2U}) is substituted as œï and (\\\\tan {\\\\beta_3} - \\\\tan{\\\\beta_2}) as \\\\tan{\\\\beta_m} giving R= \\\\phi \\\\tan{\\\\beta_m}. The degree of reaction now depends only on œï and \\\\tan{\\\\beta_m} which again depend on geometrical parameters Œ≤3 and Œ≤2 i.e. the vane angles of stator outlet and rotor outlet. Using the velocity triangles degree of reaction can be derived as: : R=\\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{V_f}{2U}(\\\\tan{\\\\beta_3} - \\\\tan{\\\\alpha_2}) This relation is again very useful when the rotor blade angle and rotor vane angle are defined for the given geometry. Choice of reaction (R) and effect on efficiency Figure 3. Influence of reaction on total-to- static efficiency with fixed value of stage loading factor The Figure 3Shapiro, A. H., Soderberg, C.

The governing equation is written as : R= 1 + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta W}{2 U^2} - \\\\frac{C_{y2}}{U} where \\\\frac{\\\\Delta W}{2 U^2} is the stage loading factor. The diagram shows the optimization of total - to - static efficiency at a given stage loading factor, by a suitable choice of reaction. It is evident from the diagram that for a fixed stage loading factor that there is a relatively small change in total-to-static efficiency for a wide range of designs. =50% reaction= The degree of reaction contributes to the stage efficiency and thus used as a design parameter. Stages having 50% degree of reaction are used where the pressure drop is equally shared by the stator and the rotor for a turbine. Figure 4. Velocity triangle for Degree of Reaction = 1/2 in a turbine This reduces the tendency of boundary layer separation from the blade surface avoiding large stagnation pressure losses. If R= then from the relation of degree of reaction, Œ±2 = Œ≤3 and the velocity triangle (Figure 4.) is symmetric. The stage enthalpy gets equally distributed in the stage (Figure 5.) . In addition the whirl components are also the same at the inlet of rotor and diffuser. Figure 5. Stage enthalpy diagram for degree of reaction = 1‚ÅÑ2 in a turbine and pump. Figure 6. Stage enthalpy for Reaction less than half =Reaction less than 50%= Stage having reaction less than half suggest that pressure drop or enthalpy drop in the rotor is less than the pressure drop in the stator for the turbine. The same follows for a pump or compressor as shown in Figure 6. Therefore the stator has a larger contribution to the total work extracted or work done. From the relation for degree of reaction,  Œ±2 > Œ≤3. Figure 7. Velocity triangle for reaction more than 50%. = Reaction more than 50% = Stage having reaction more than half suggest that pressure drop or enthalpy drop in the rotor is more than the pressure drop in the stator for the turbine. The same follows for a pump or compressor. Thus in this case the rotor has a larger contribution to the total work extracted or work done. From the relation for degree of reaction, Œ±2 < Œ≤3 which is also shown in corresponding Figure 7. = Reaction = zero = This is special case used for impulse turbine which suggest that entire pressure drop in the turbine is obtained in the stator. The stator performs a nozzle action converting pressure head to velocity head and extracting work. It is difficult to achieve adiabatic expansion in the impulse stage, i.e. expansion only in the nozzle, due to irreversibility involved, in actual practice. Figure 8 shows the corresponding enthalpy drop for the reaction = 0 case. Figure 8.

It is spoken in the Sola de Vega District by around 3000 speakers in Santa Mar√≠a Lachix√≠o and San Vicente Lachix√≠o. While many other Zapotec languages have suffered major language shifts to Spanish, most children in these towns are raised with Zapotec and learn Spanish at an early age (Sicoli 2007: 28). Lachix√≠o is part of the West Zapotec language branch, which is considered the earliest divergent branch of the Zapotec family and adjacent to the Chatino language family (Sicoli 2015). Many of the Zapotec languages are mutually unintelligible. However, some Zapotec languages share many grammatical features such as word and morpheme order as well as many lexical items. Like other Zapotec languages, Lachix√≠o Zapotec is a tonal language with VSO word order. The language contains a variety of clitics, including subject and object enclitics pronouns, which are prosodically bound to the following or preceding stressed unit (Sicoli 2007: 70).

In its current form, it was a penitential Passion procession. It was written on the basis of an older tradition in 1715, with minor corrections until 1727, by Father Romuald (Lovrenc Marusiƒç; 1676‚Äì1748), a Capuchin monk who lived for a period in the ≈†kofja Loka Capuchin monastery in the town of ≈†kofja Loka. The passion presents Biblical stories, particularly from the life of Jesus. It consists of 869 verses, written in the old ≈†kofja Loka dialect. They are divided into 13 tableaux. It belongs to the Baroque period and represents the oldest preserved director's book in the world. The play's manuscript is kept by the ≈†kofja Loka monastery. The play was originally staged on Good Friday each year until 1751. After almost three hundred years, it was presented again in 1936 as part of an exhibition, and revived in 1999, 2000, 2009, and 2015. The first two reprisals were directed by Marjan Kokalj, and the latest by Borut Gartner. They were performed by around 640 amateur actors and actresses, among them 80 cavalrymen. The tableaux were divided into 20 scenes. The National Youth Council of Slovenia bestowed the Municipality of ≈†kofja Loka a special recognition for a volunteer project in 2010, after the municipality had organised the play in the previous year. In 2008, the performance has been entered in the Slovenian intangible cultural heritage register. The play will be performed again in 2021. Its reprisals in ≈†kofja Loka are the largest open-air theatre productions in Slovenia. References See also *Oberammergau Passion Play External links * * ePassion: The ≈†kofja Loka Passion Play.

He is considered to be first fully Persianized ruler of the dynasty. Starting from his rule, the Shirvanshahs favoured names from the pre-Islamic Iranian past and claimed descent from characters such as the Sasanian monarch Bahram V Gur (). Reign In 1027, Manuchehr succeeded his father Yazid II as the Shah of Shirvan. Two years later, he declared war against the Hashimids of Derbent. He was, however, defeated by an Hashimid army which ravaged his land. The following year, his kingdom was invaded by a Rus' army under Ingvar the Far- Travelled. Manuchehr tried to repel them from Caucasus, but was soundly defeated at Baku; many prominent men of Shirvan were killed, such as certain Ahmad ibn Khasskin. Manuchehr then had the Araxes river closed in order to stop the Rus'. However, this resulted in the death of a number of Muslims. Nevertheless, some time later, Manuchehr managed to finally repel the Rus'. In 1032, an combined army from Sarir and Alania invaded Shirvan and seized its capital Shamakhi. Many people were massacred and many riches were seized by them. During their withdrawal from Shirvan, however, they were attacked and defeated by the people of Derbent. Death In 1034, Manuchehr was betrayed and stabbed by his younger brother Ali, who had with the help of Manuchehr's wife Sitta entered the latter's house. Ali thus became the new Shirvanshah.

History  The abbey was founded in or around 1140 (or possibly in 1152) by Duke Frederick II of Swabia for Cistercian nuns. It was one of the wealthiest religious houses in Alsace, and among other privileges had customs immunity for a ship on the Rhine. It was plundered during the German Peasants' War in 1525, and again during the Thirty Years' War in 1621. Between 1621 and 1673 the nuns were unable to live in it, and moved to Haguenau. It was reconstructed in the 18th century, when Peter Thumb built the abbey church. The abbey was dissolved during the French Revolution, in 1793, when the nuns moved to Lichtenthal Abbey near Baden-Baden.  Structures  Apart from a mill, there are no visible remains of the buildings except for a few foundation walls near the inn Au Vieux Couvent. A number of altars formerly in the abbey church are now in the church of Roeschwoog. The abbey's later town house in Haguenau remains, the H√¥tel de Koenigsbruck, Grand-Rue 142 (built in 1748), notable for its wrought iron work. It was listed as a monument historique in 1930.

In a career which lasted from June 2002 until December 2004, he ran eighteen times and won four races. Brian Boru was made favourite for The Derby after winning the Racing Post Trophy in 2002. In September 2003 he recorded his most important win when winning the St Leger at Doncaster. Background Brian Boru is a dark bay horse with a narrow white blaze bred by Juddmonte Farms. He was sired by the thirteen time Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland Sadler's Wells out of the Park Hill Stakes winner Eva Luna (USA). Eva Luna later produced Sea Moon, who won the Great Voltigeur Stakes and finished second in the Breeders' Cup Turf. She was also the dam of Soviet Moon, who in turn produced the Epsom Derby winner Workforce. Before his racing career began, Brian Boru was acquired by the Coolmore organisation. He was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle and raced in the colours of Susan Magnier, the wife of John Magnier. Racing career =2002: two-year-old season= Brian Boru began his racing career in a seven furlong maiden race at the Curragh on 28 June 2002. Ridden by Mick Kinane he started slowly but took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by a neck from the filly Evelyn One. Brian Boru was immediately moved up to Group Two class for the Beresford Stakes for which he started 2/1 favourite. He took the lead in the straight but was caught in the closing stages and beaten a head by the future Irish Derby winner Alamshar. On his final start of the year, Brian Boru was sent to England to contest the Group One Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster on 26 October. Brian Boru was made 11/8 favourite and was ridden by Kevin Darley. Darley tracked the leaders into the straight but struggled to obtain a clear run until the final furlong. In the closing stages Brian Boru produced a \\"storming late run\\" to take the lead and won by one and a quarter lengths from his stable companion Powerscourt. Following the race he was made favourite for the following year's Epsom Derby. =2003: three-year-old season= Brian Boru began his three-year-old season in the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial at Leopardstown on 11 May in which he finished third behind Alamshar and The Great Gatsby. In The Derby on 7 June, Brian Boru started the 9/2 third favourite in a field of twenty runners. he made no impression in the race and finished sixteenth behind Kris Kin, The Great Gatsby and Alamshar. Three weeks later, Brian Boru finished fourth of the nine runners behind Alamshar and Dalakhani in the Irish Derby. In August, Brian Boru took the lead in the straight in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York but was caught inside the final furlong and beaten a neck by Powerscourt. On September 13, Brian Boru started 5/4 favourite for the St Leger at Doncaster against eleven opponents. Ridden by Jamie Spencer, he was held up in the early stages before making his challenge in the straight and taking the lead a furlong from the finish. He \\"kept on well\\" in the closing stages to win by one and a quarter lengths from High Accolade with Phoenix Reach in third. Brough Scott writing in the Telegraph, described the race as \\"ruthlessly run\\" and the finish as being \\"admirably committed\\". Spencer dedicated the win to his friend Kieran Kelly, a National Hunt jockey who had been killed in an accident at Kilbeggan Racecourse. In October, Brian Boru was sent to Canada to contest the Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack. He started 5/4 favourite, but finished third of the ten runners to Phoenix Reach. =2004: four-year-old season= On his first start as a four-year-old, Brian Boru won the Listed Alleged Stakes at Leopardstown, beating Napper Tandy by three quarters of a length. The rest of Brian Boru's season was disappointing as he failed to win in eight subsequent races. His best efforts came when finishing second in the Irish St. Leger (to Vinnie Roe) and the Prix Kergorlay and third (to Sulamani) in the Canadian International Stakes. Stud career Brian Boru was retired to stand at the Coolmore Stud, where he is marketed as a \\"dual-purpose\\" sire. He has had little success with his flat racers but has shown promise as a National Hunt stallion, siring the useful steeplechaser Bold Sir Brian.

Though out of print for a long time, interest in this narrative, dealing with the war experience of a B-24 tail gunner in Southern Europe during the Second World War was rekindled when it was suggested that it inspired Joseph Heller while writing his well-known war novel Catch-22. Plot The novel is told by a first-person narrator, a 36-year-old American airman of Jewish descent, Ben Isaacs, who had worked as a teacher before volunteering for the Air Force. He has been assigned to the newly formed crew of a B-24 Liberator heavy bomber, called \\"Flying Foxhole\\", as tail gunner, and sent to Mandia, an air base in Apulia, southern Italy, in the summer of 1944. Isaacs is frightened by his first bomb run, which is against the heavily defended industrial area of Wiener Neustadt in Austria. He feels alienated from his fellow crewmembers because he is older than them, and also because he is the only Jew on the bomber. However, he manages to get accustomed to the terrifying flights over Nazi-occupied Europe, and to establish some camaraderie with the other crewmembers. The life of the American airmen is described in detail, and Falstein focuses on the relations with the \\"natives\\", that is, the Italian people of Apulia, hindered by the linguistic barrier, and the sometimes uneasy relations between airmen from different parts of the United States and different ethnic backgrounds (one of the gunners, Cosmo Fidanza, is the son of an Italian immigrant coming from Bari, the capital of the region). The novel also analyses the psychological burden put on the airmen by the repeated stress of the bomb runs, which leads to alcohol abuse and brings some of them (such as Cosmo) to the verge of breakdown. =Crew of the \\"Flying Foxhole\\"= * 1st Lt.

The Times noticed that there are indeed similarities between the two books, inasmuch as \\"both have central characters who are using their wits to escape the aerial carnage; both are haunted by an omnipresent injured airman, invisible inside a white body cast\\". However, Heller declared that he had never read Falstein's novel, or heard of him, and said: \\"My book came out in 1961[;] I find it funny that nobody else has noticed any similarities, including Falstein himself, who died just last year\\".The Washington Post, April 27, 1998 1\\\\. \\"Heller introduces the soldier in white who \\"was encased from head to toe in plaster and gauze\\" in chapter one. He continues, He had two useless legs and two useless arms and had been smuggled into the ward at night. Later in his book, Falstein also has a soldier in white who looked entombed in the cast, like an Egyptian mummy. This invalid is the crew's new pilot, wounded in action. In Catch-22, the figure is as mysterious and as metaphorical as the Unknown Soldier.\\" 2\\\\. In Falstein's book a character sleeps with five cats. In Heller's book, Hungry Joe dreamed that Huple's cat was sleeping on his face, suffocating him, and when he woke up, Huple's cat was sleeping on his face. 3\\\\. Both Falstein's Isaacs and Heller's Yossarian take extra flak jackets into combat as did many flight crews in combat. 4\\\\. A holiday party ends in gunfire in both books. 5\\\\. There is a rape scene with some similarity in both books. Both Falstein and Heller flew bomber missions in southern Italy and Corsica during the Second World War, so it is understandable that their stories might have some similarities. There are also remarkable differences in the two writers' approach to their war experience: Falstein uses a more traditional narrative style, with a linear plot and well- written prose aiming at a realistic description of events and the narrator's feelings, while Heller adopts a fragmented non-linear plotline, and a deliberately repetitive prose whose obsessive rhythm underscores the absurdity of his characters' predicament; moreover, several scenes of Heller's novel are surrealistic, while Falstein always strives to achieve verisimilitude. As a consequence of this controversy Falstein's novel was reprinted in March 1999 by Steerforth Press.

Epigenetic alterations may be just as important, or even more important, than genetic mutations in a cell's transformation to cancer. In cancers, loss of expression of genes occurs about 10 times more frequently by transcription silencing (caused by epigenetic promoter hypermethylation of CpG islands) than by mutations. As Vogelstein et al. point out, in a colorectal cancer there are usually about 3 to 6 driver mutations and 33 to 66 hitchhiker or passenger mutations. However, in colon tumors compared to adjacent normal-appearing colonic mucosa, there are about 600 to 800 heavily methylated CpG islands in promoters of genes in the tumors while these CpG islands are not methylated in the adjacent mucosa. Manipulation of epigenetic alterations holds great promise for cancer prevention, detection, and therapy. In different types of cancer, a variety of epigenetic mechanisms can be perturbed, such as silencing of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes by altered CpG island methylation patterns, histone modifications, and dysregulation of DNA binding proteins. Several medications which have epigenetic impact are now used in several of these diseases. Epigenetics patterns in a normal and cancer cells Epigenetic alterations in tumour progression Mechanisms =DNA methylation= A DNA molecule fragment that is methylated at two cytosines In somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are in general transmitted to daughter cells with high fidelity. Typically, this methylation only occurs at cytosines that are located 5' to guanosine in the CpG dinucleotides of higher order eukaryotes. However, epigenetic DNA methylation differs between normal cells and tumor cells in humans. The \\"normal\\" CpG methylation profile is often inverted in cells that become tumorigenic. In normal cells, CpG islands preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated, and tend to be transcriptionally active, while other individual CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome tend to be methylated. However, in cancer cells, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are often hypermethylated, while CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and parasitic repeat sequences is often decreased. Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoter regions can result in silencing of those genes. This type of epigenetic mutation allows cells to grow and reproduce uncontrollably, leading to tumorigenesis. The addition of methyl groups to cytosines causes the DNA to coil tightly around the histone proteins, resulting in DNA that can not undergo transcription (transcriptionally silenced DNA). Genes commonly found to be transcriptionally silenced due to promoter hypermethylation include: Cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor p16, a cell-cycle inhibitor; MGMT, a DNA repair gene; APC, a cell cycle regulator; MLH1, a DNA-repair gene; and BRCA1, another DNA-repair gene. Indeed, cancer cells can become addicted to the transcriptional silencing, due to promoter hypermethylation, of some key tumor suppressor genes, a process known as epigenetic addiction. Hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in other parts of the genome leads to chromosome instability due to mechanisms such as loss of imprinting and reactivation of transposable elements. Loss of imprinting of insulin-like growth factor gene (IGF2) increases risk of colorectal cancer and is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome which significantly increases the risk of cancer for newborns. In healthy cells, CpG dinucleotides of lower densities are found within coding and non-coding intergenic regions. Expression of some repetitive sequences and meiotic recombination at centromeres are repressed through methylation The entire genome of a cancerous cell contains significantly less methylcytosine than the genome of a healthy cell. In fact, cancer cell genomes have 20-50% less methylation at individual CpG dinucleotides across the genome. CpG islands found in promoter regions are usually protected from DNA methylation. In cancer cells CpG islands are hypomethylated The regions flanking CpG islands called CpG island shores are where most DNA methylation occurs in the CpG dinucleotide context. Cancer cells are deferentially methylated at CpG island shores. In cancer cells, hypermethylation in the CpG island shores move into CpG islands, or hypomethylation of CpG islands move into CpG island shores eliminating sharp epigenetic boundaries between these genetic elements. In cancer cells \\"global hypomethylation\\" due to disruption in DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) may promote mitotic recombination and chromosome rearrangement, ultimately resulting in aneuploidy when the chromosomes fail to separate properly during mitosis. CpG island methylation is important in regulation of gene expression, yet cytosine methylation can lead directly to destabilizing genetic mutations and a precancerous cellular state. Methylated cytosines make hydrolysis of the amine group and spontaneous conversion to thymine more favorable. They can cause aberrant recruitment of chromatin proteins. Cytosine methylations change the amount of UV light absorption of the nucleotide base, creating pyrimidine dimers. When mutation results in loss of heterozygosity at tumor suppressor gene sites, these genes may become inactive. Single base pair mutations during replication can also have detrimental effects. =Histone modification= Eukaryotic DNA has a complex structure. It is generally wrapped around special proteins called histones to form a structure called a nucleosome. A nucleosome consists of 2 sets of 4 histones: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Additionally, histone H1 contributes to DNA packaging outside of the nucleosome. Certain histone modifying enzymes can add or remove functional groups to the histones, and these modifications influence the level of transcription of the genes wrapped around those histones and the level of DNA replication. Histone modification profiles of healthy and cancerous cells tend to differ. In comparison to healthy cells, cancerous cells exhibit decreased monoacetylated and trimethylated forms of histone H4 (decreased H4ac and H4me3). Additionally, mouse models have shown that a decrease in histone H4R3 asymmetric dimethylation (H4R3me2a) of the p19ARF promoter is correlated with more advanced cases of tumorigenesis and metastasis. In mouse models, the loss of histone H4 acetylation and trimethylation increases as tumor growth continues. Loss of histone H4 Lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac), which is a mark of aging at the telomeres, specifically loses its acetylation. Some scientists hope this particular loss of histone acetylation might be battled with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor specific for SIRT1, an HDAC specific for H4K16. Other histone marks associated with tumorigenesis include increased deacetylation (decreased acetylation) of histones H3 and H4, decreased trimethylation of histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4me3), and increased monomethylation of histone H3 Lysine 9 (H3K9me) and trimethylation of histone H3 Lysine 27 (H3K27me3). These histone modifications can silence tumor suppressor genes despite the drop in methylation of the gene's CpG island (an event that normally activates genes). Some research has focused on blocking the action of BRD4 on acetylated histones, which has been shown to increase the expression of the Myc protein, implicated in several cancers. The development process of the drug to bind to BRD4 is noteworthy for the collaborative, open approach the team is taking. The tumor suppressor gene p53 regulates DNA repair and can induce apoptosis in dysregulated cells. E Soto-Reyes and F Recillas-Targa elucidated the importance of the CTCF protein in regulating p53 expression. CTCF, or CCCTC binding factor, is a zinc finger protein that insulates the p53 promoter from accumulating repressive histone marks. In certain types of cancer cells, the CTCF protein does not bind normally, and the p53 promoter accumulates repressive histone marks, causing p53 expression to decrease. Mutations in the epigenetic machinery itself may occur as well, potentially responsible for the changing epigenetic profiles of cancerous cells. The histone variants of the H2A family are highly conserved in mammals, playing critical roles in regulating many nuclear processes by altering chromatin structure. One of the key H2A variants, H2A.X, marks DNA damage, facilitating the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to restore genomic integrity. Another variant, H2A.Z, plays an important role in both gene activation and repression. A high level of H2A.Z expression is detected in many cancers and is significantly associated with cellular proliferation and genomic instability. Histone variant macroH2A1 is important in the pathogenesis of many types of cancers, for instance in hepatocellular carcinoma. Other mechanisms include a decrease in H4K16ac may be caused by either a decrease in activity of a histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or an increase in deacetylation by SIRT1. Likewise, an inactivating frameshift mutation in HDAC2, a histone deacetylase that acts on many histone- tail lysines, has been associated with cancers showing altered histone acetylation patterns. These findings indicate a promising mechanism for altering epigenetic profiles through enzymatic inhibition or enhancement. DNA damage, caused by UV light, ionizing radiation, environmental toxins, and metabolic chemicals, can also lead to genomic instability and cancer. The DNA damage response to double strand DNA breaks (DSB) is mediated in part by histone modifications. At a DSB, MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) protein complex recruits ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase which phosphorylates Serine 129 of Histone 2A. MDC1, mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1, binds to the phosphopeptide, and phosphorylation of H2AX may spread by a positive feedback loop of MRN-ATM recruitment and phosphorylation. TIP60 acetylates the Œ≥H2AX, which is then polyubiquitylated. RAP80, a subunit of the DNA repair breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein complex (BRCA1-A), binds ubiquitin attached to histones. BRCA1-A activity arrests the cell cycle at the G2/M checkpoint, allowing time for DNA repair, or apoptosis may be initiated. =MicroRNA gene silencing= In mammals, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate about 60% of the transcriptional activity of protein-encoding genes. Some miRNAs also undergo methylation-associated silencing in cancer cells. Let-7 and miR15/16 play important roles in down-regulating RAS and BCL2 oncogenes, and their silencing occurs in cancer cells. Decreased expression of miR-125b1, a miRNA that functions as a tumor suppressor, was observed in prostate, ovarian, breast and glial cell cancers. In vitro experiments have shown that miR-125b1 targets two genes, HER2/neu and ESR1, that are linked to breast cancer. DNA methylation, specifically hypermethylation, is one of the main ways that the miR-125b1 is epigenetically silenced. In patients with breast cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands located proximal to the transcription start site was observed. Loss of CTCF binding and an increase in repressive histone marks, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, correlates with DNA methylation and miR-125b1 silencing. Mechanistically, CTCF may function as a boundary element to stop the spread of DNA methylation. Results from experiments conducted by Soto- Reyes et al. indicate a negative effect of methylation on the function and expression of miR-125b1. Therefore, they concluded that DNA methylation has a part in silencing the gene. Furthermore, some miRNA's are epigenetically silenced early on in breast cancer, and therefore these miRNA's could potentially be useful as tumor markers. The epigenetic silencing of miRNA genes by aberrant DNA methylation is a frequent event in cancer cells; almost one third of miRNA promoters active in normal mammary cells were found hypermethylated in breast cancer cells - that is a several fold greater proportion than is usually observed for protein coding genes. Metabolic recoding of epigenetics in cancer Dysregulation of metabolism allows tumor cells to generate needed building blocks as well as to modulate epigenetic marks to support cancer initiation and progression. Cancer-induced metabolic changes alter the epigenetic landscape, especially modifications on histones and DNA, thereby promoting malignant transformation, adaptation to inadequate nutrition, and metastasis. The accumulation of certain metabolites in cancer can target epigenetic enzymes to globally alter the epigenetic landscape. Cancer-related metabolic changes lead to locus-specific recoding of epigenetic marks. Cancer epigenetics can be precisely reprogramed by cellular metabolism through 1) dose-responsive modulation of cancer epigenetics by metabolites; 2) sequence-specific recruitment of metabolic enzymes; and 3) targeting of epigenetic enzymes by nutritional signals. MicroRNA and DNA repair DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. If DNA repair is deficient, DNA damage tends to accumulate. Such excess DNA damage can increase mutational errors during DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Excess DNA damage can also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer (see malignant neoplasms). Germ line mutations in DNA repair genes cause only 2‚Äì5% of colon cancer cases. However, altered expression of microRNAs, causing DNA repair deficiencies, are frequently associated with cancers and may be an important causal factor for these cancers. Over- expression of certain miRNAs may directly reduce expression of specific DNA repair proteins. Wan et al. referred to 6 DNA repair genes that are directly targeted by the miRNAs indicated in parentheses: ATM (miR-421), RAD52 (miR-210, miR-373), RAD23B (miR-373), MSH2 (miR-21), BRCA1 (miR-182) and P53 (miR-504, miR-125b). More recently, Tessitore et al. listed further DNA repair genes that are directly targeted by additional miRNAs, including ATM (miR-18a, miR-101), DNA-PK (miR-101), ATR (miR-185), Wip1 (miR-16), MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 (miR-155), ERCC3 and ERCC4 (miR-192) and UNG2 (mir-16, miR-34c and miR-199a). Of these miRNAs, miR-16, miR-18a, miR-21, miR-34c, miR-125b, miR-101, miR-155, miR-182, miR-185 and miR-192 are among those identified by Schnekenburger and Diederich as over-expressed in colon cancer through epigenetic hypomethylation. Over expression of any one of these miRNAs can cause reduced expression of its target DNA repair gene. Up to 15% of the MLH1-deficiencies in sporadic colon cancers appeared to be due to over-expression of the microRNA miR-155, which represses MLH1 expression. However, the majority of 68 sporadic colon cancers with reduced expression of the DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1 were found to be deficient due to epigenetic methylation of the CpG island of the MLH1 gene. In 28% of glioblastomas, the MGMT DNA repair protein is deficient but the MGMT promoter is not methylated. In the glioblastomas without methylated MGMT promoters, the level of microRNA miR-181d is inversely correlated with protein expression of MGMT and the direct target of miR-181d is the MGMT mRNA 3‚ÄôUTR (the three prime untranslated region of MGMT mRNA). Thus, in 28% of glioblastomas, increased expression of miR-181d and reduced expression of DNA repair enzyme MGMT may be a causal factor. In 29‚Äì66% of glioblastomas, DNA repair is deficient due to epigenetic methylation of the MGMT gene, which reduces protein expression of MGMT. High mobility group A (HMGA) proteins, characterized by an AT-hook, are small, nonhistone, chromatin-associated proteins that can modulate transcription. MicroRNAs control the expression of HMGA proteins, and these proteins (HMGA1 and HMGA2) are architectural chromatin transcription-controlling elements. Palmieri et al. showed that, in normal tissues, HGMA1 and HMGA2 genes are targeted (and thus strongly reduced in expression) by miR-15, miR-16, miR-26a, miR-196a2 and Let-7a. HMGA expression is almost undetectable in differentiated adult tissues but is elevated in many cancers. HGMA proteins are polypeptides of ~100 amino acid residues characterized by a modular sequence organization. These proteins have three highly positively charged regions, termed AT hooks, that bind the minor groove of AT-rich DNA stretches in specific regions of DNA. Human neoplasias, including thyroid, prostatic, cervical, colorectal, pancreatic and ovarian carcinoma, show a strong increase of HMGA1a and HMGA1b proteins. Transgenic mice with HMGA1 targeted to lymphoid cells develop aggressive lymphoma, showing that high HMGA1 expression is not only associated with cancers, but that the HMGA1 gene can act as an oncogene to cause cancer. Baldassarre et al., showed that HMGA1 protein binds to the promoter region of DNA repair gene BRCA1 and inhibits BRCA1 promoter activity. They also showed that while only 11% of breast tumors had hypermethylation of the BRCA1 gene, 82% of aggressive breast cancers have low BRCA1 protein expression, and most of these reductions were due to chromatin remodeling by high levels of HMGA1 protein. HMGA2 protein specifically targets the promoter of ERCC1, thus reducing expression of this DNA repair gene. ERCC1 protein expression was deficient in 100% of 47 evaluated colon cancers (though the extent to which HGMA2 was involved is unknown). Palmieri et al. showed that each of the miRNAs that target HMGA genes are drastically reduced in almost all human pituitary adenomas studied, when compared with the normal pituitary gland. Consistent with the down-regulation of these HMGA-targeting miRNAs, an increase in the HMGA1 and HMGA2-specific mRNAs was observed. Three of these microRNAs (miR-16, miR-196a and Let-7a) have methylated promoters and therefore low expression in colon cancer. For two of these, miR-15 and miR-16, the coding regions are epigenetically silenced in cancer due to histone deacetylase activity. When these microRNAs are expressed at a low level, then HMGA1 and HMGA2 proteins are expressed at a high level. HMGA1 and HMGA2 target (reduce expression of) BRCA1 and ERCC1 DNA repair genes. Thus DNA repair can be reduced, likely contributing to cancer progression. DNA repair pathways A chart of common DNA damaging agents, examples of lesions they cause in DNA, and pathways used to repair these lesions. Also shown are many of the genes in these pathways, an indication of which genes are epigenetically regulated to have reduced (or increased) expression in various cancers. It also shows genes in the error prone microhomology-mediated end joining pathway with increased expression in various cancers. The chart in this section shows some frequent DNA damaging agents, examples of DNA lesions they cause, and the pathways that deal with these DNA damages. At least 169 enzymes are either directly employed in DNA repair or influence DNA repair processes.Human DNA Repair Genes, 15 April 2014, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas Of these, 83 are directly employed in repairing the 5 types of DNA damages illustrated in the chart. Some of the more well studied genes central to these repair processes are shown in the chart. The gene designations shown in red, gray or cyan indicate genes frequently epigenetically altered in various types of cancers. wikipedia articles on each of the genes highlighted by red, gray or cyan describe the epigenetic alteration(s) and the cancer(s) in which these epimutations are found. Two broad experimental survey articles also document most of these epigenetic DNA repair deficiencies in cancers. Red-highlighted genes are frequently reduced or silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in various cancers. When these genes have low or absent expression, DNA damages can accumulate. Replication errors past these damages (see translesion synthesis) can lead to increased mutations and, ultimately, cancer. Epigenetic repression of DNA repair genes in accurate DNA repair pathways appear to be central to carcinogenesis. The two gray-highlighted genes RAD51 and BRCA2, are required for homologous recombinational repair. They are sometimes epigenetically over- expressed and sometimes under-expressed in certain cancers. As indicated in the wikipedia articles on RAD51 and BRCA2, such cancers ordinarily have epigenetic deficiencies in other DNA repair genes. These repair deficiencies would likely cause increased unrepaired DNA damages. The over-expression of RAD51 and BRCA2 seen in these cancers may reflect selective pressures for compensatory RAD51 or BRCA2 over-expression and increased homologous recombinational repair to at least partially deal with such excess DNA damages. In those cases where RAD51 or BRCA2 are under-expressed, this would itself lead to increased unrepaired DNA damages. Replication errors past these damages (see translesion synthesis) could cause increased mutations and cancer, so that under-expression of RAD51 or BRCA2 would be carcinogenic in itself. Cyan-highlighted genes are in the microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathway and are up-regulated in cancer. MMEJ is an additional error- prone inaccurate repair pathway for double-strand breaks. In MMEJ repair of a double-strand break, an homology of 5-25 complementary base pairs between both paired strands is sufficient to align the strands, but mismatched ends (flaps) are usually present. MMEJ removes the extra nucleotides (flaps) where strands are joined, and then ligates the strands to create an intact DNA double helix. MMEJ almost always involves at least a small deletion, so that it is a mutagenic pathway. FEN1, the flap endonuclease in MMEJ, is epigenetically increased by promoter hypomethylation and is over-expressed in the majority of cancers of the breast, prostate, stomach, neuroblastomas, pancreas, and lung. PARP1 is also over-expressed when its promoter region ETS site is epigenetically hypomethylated, and this contributes to progression to endometrial cancer, BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, and BRCA-mutated serous ovarian cancer. Other genes in the MMEJ pathway are also over-expressed in a number of cancers (see MMEJ for summary), and are also shown in blue. =Frequencies of epimutations in DNA repair genes= Deficiencies in DNA repair proteins that function in accurate DNA repair pathways increase the risk of mutation. Mutation rates are strongly increased in cells with mutations in DNA mismatch repair or in homologous recombinational repair (HRR). Individuals with inherited mutations in any of 34 DNA repair genes are at increased risk of cancer (see DNA repair defects and increased cancer risk). In sporadic cancers, a deficiency in DNA repair is occasionally found to be due to a mutation in a DNA repair gene, but much more frequently reduced or absent expression of DNA repair genes is due to epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence gene expression. For example, for 113 colorectal cancers examined in sequence, only four had a missense mutation in the DNA repair gene MGMT, while the majority had reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region (an epigenetic alteration). Similarly, out of 119 cases of mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers that lacked DNA repair gene PMS2 expression, PMS2 protein was deficient in 6 due to mutations in the PMS2 gene, while in 103 cases PMS2 expression was deficient because its pairing partner MLH1 was repressed due to promoter methylation (PMS2 protein is unstable in the absence of MLH1). In the other 10 cases, loss of PMS2 expression was likely due to epigenetic overexpression of the microRNA, miR-155, which down-regulates MLH1. Epigenetic defects in DNA repair genes are frequent in cancers. In the table, multiple cancers were evaluated for reduced or absent expression of the DNA repair gene of interest, and the frequency shown is the frequency with which the cancers had an epigenetic deficiency of gene expression. Such epigenetic deficiencies likely arise early in carcinogenesis, since they are also frequently found (though at somewhat lower frequency) in the field defect surrounding the cancer from which the cancer likely arose (see Table). { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" + Frequency of epigenetic reduction in DNA repair gene expression in sporadic cancers and in adjacent field defects !

Reduced DNA repair likely allows accumulation of DNA damages. Error prone translesion synthesis past some of these DNA damages may give rise to a mutation with a selective advantage. A clonal patch with a selective advantage may grow and out-compete neighboring cells, forming a field defect. While there is no obvious selective advantage for a cell to have reduced DNA repair, the epimutation of the DNA repair gene may be carried along as a passenger when the cells with the selectively advantageous mutation are replicated. In the cells carrying both the epimutation of the DNA repair gene and the mutation with the selective advantage, further DNA damages will accumulate, and these could, in turn, give rise to further mutations with still greater selective advantages. Epigenetic defects in DNA repair may thus contribute to the characteristic high frequency of mutations in the genomes of cancers, and cause their carcinogenic progression. Cancers have high levels of genome instability, associated with a high frequency of mutations. A high frequency of genomic mutations increases the likelihood of particular mutations occurring that activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressor genes, leading to carcinogenesis. On the basis of whole genome sequencing, cancers are found to have thousands to hundreds of thousands of mutations in their whole genomes. (Also see Mutation frequencies in cancers.) By comparison, the mutation frequency in the whole genome between generations for humans (parent to child) is about 70 new mutations per generation. In the protein coding regions of the genome, there are only about 0.35 mutations between parent/child generations (less than one mutated protein per generation). Whole genome sequencing in blood cells for a pair of identical twin 100-year-old centenarians only found 8 somatic differences, though somatic variation occurring in less than 20% of blood cells would be undetected. While DNA damages may give rise to mutations through error prone translesion synthesis, DNA damages can also give rise to epigenetic alterations during faulty DNA repair processes. The DNA damages that accumulate due to epigenetic DNA repair defects can be a source of the increased epigenetic alterations found in many genes in cancers. In an early study, looking at a limited set of transcriptional promoters, Fernandez et al. examined the DNA methylation profiles of 855 primary tumors. Comparing each tumor type with its corresponding normal tissue, 729 CpG island sites (55% of the 1322 CpG sites evaluated) showed differential DNA methylation. Of these sites, 496 were hypermethylated (repressed) and 233 were hypomethylated (activated). Thus, there is a high level of epigenetic promoter methylation alterations in tumors. Some of these epigenetic alterations may contribute to cancer progression. Epigenetic carcinogens A variety of compounds are considered as epigenetic carcinogens‚Äîthey result in an increased incidence of tumors, but they do not show mutagen activity (toxic compounds or pathogens that cause tumors incident to increased regeneration should also be excluded). Examples include diethylstilbestrol, arsenite, hexachlorobenzene, and nickel compounds. Many teratogens exert specific effects on the fetus by epigenetic mechanisms. While epigenetic effects may preserve the effect of a teratogen such as diethylstilbestrol throughout the life of an affected child, the possibility of birth defects resulting from exposure of fathers or in second and succeeding generations of offspring has generally been rejected on theoretical grounds and for lack of evidence. However, a range of male-mediated abnormalities have been demonstrated, and more are likely to exist. FDA label information for Vidaza, a formulation of 5-azacitidine (an unmethylatable analog of cytidine that causes hypomethylation when incorporated into DNA) states that \\"men should be advised not to father a child\\" while using the drug, citing evidence in treated male mice of reduced fertility, increased embryo loss, and abnormal embryo development.WebCite query result In rats, endocrine differences were observed in offspring of males exposed to morphine. In mice, second generation effects of diethylstilbesterol have been described occurring by epigenetic mechanisms. Cancer subtypes =Skin cancer= Melanoma is a deadly skin cancer that originates from melanocytes. Several epigenetic alterations are known to play a role in the transition of melanocytes to melanoma cells. These alterations are the consequence of deregulation of their corresponding enzymes. Several histone methyltransferases and demethylases are among these enzymes. =Prostate cancer= Prostate cancer kills around 35,000 men yearly, and about 220,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer per year, in North America alone. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-caused fatalities in men, and within a man's lifetime, one in six men will have the disease. Alterations in histone acetylation and DNA methylation occur in various genes influencing prostate cancer. More than 90% of prostate cancers show gene silencing by CpG island hypermethylation of the GSTP1 gene promoter, which protects prostate cells from genomic damage that is caused by different oxidants or carcinogens. Real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) suggests that many other genes are also hypermethylated. Gene expression in the prostate may be modulated by nutrition and lifestyle changes. =Cervical cancer= The second most common malignant tumor in women is invasive cervical cancer (ICC) and more than 50% of all invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is caused by oncongenic human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16). Furthermore, cervix intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is primarily caused by oncogenic HPV16. As in many cases, the causative factor for cancer does not always take a direct route from infection to the development of cancer. Genomic methylation patterns have been associated with invasive cervical cancer. Within the HPV16L1 region, 14 tested CpG sites have significantly higher methylation in CIN3+ than in HPV16 genomes of women without CIN3. Only 2/16 CpG sites tested in HPV16 upstream regulatory region were found to have association with increased methylation in CIN3+. This suggests that the direct route from infection to cancer is sometimes detoured to a precancerous state in cervix intraepithelial neoplasia. Additionally, increased CpG site methylation was found in low levels in most of the five host nuclear genes studied, including 5/5 TERT, 1/4 DAPK1, 2/5 RARB, MAL, and CADM1. Furthermore, 1/3 of CpG sites in mitochondrial DNA were associated with increased methylation in CIN3+. Thus, a correlation exists between CIN3+ and increased methylation of CpG sites in the HPV16 L1 open reading frame. This could be a potential biomarker for future screens of cancerous and precancerous cervical disease. =Leukemia= Recent studies have shown that the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene causes leukemia by rearranging and fusing with other genes in different chromosomes, which is a process under epigenetic control. =Sarcoma= There are about 15,000 new cases of sarcoma in the US each year, and about 6,200 people were projected to die of sarcoma in the US in 2014. Sarcomas comprise a large number of rare, histogenetically heterogeneous mesenchymal tumors that, for example, include chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, osteosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and (alveolar and embryonal) rhabdomyosarcoma. Several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are epigenetically altered in sarcomas. These include APC, CDKN1A, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, Ezrin, FGFR1, GADD45A, MGMT, STK3, STK4, PTEN, RASSF1A, WIF1, as well as several miRNAs. Expression of epigenetic modifiers such as that of the BMI1 component of the PRC1 complex is deregulated in chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and osteosarcoma, and expression of the EZH2 component of the PRC2 complex is altered in Ewing's sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Similarly, expression of another epigenetic modifier, the LSD1 histone demethylase, is increased in chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Drug targeting and inhibition of EZH2 in Ewing's sarcoma, or of LSD1 in several sarcomas, inhibits tumor cell growth in these sarcomas. Identification methods Previously, epigenetic profiles were limited to individual genes under scrutiny by a particular research team. Recently, however, scientists have been moving toward a more genomic approach to determine an entire genomic profile for cancerous versus healthy cells. Popular approaches for measuring CpG methylation in cells include: *Bisulfite sequencing *Combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) *Methylation- specific PCR *MethyLight *Pyrosequencing *Restriction landmark genomic scanning *Arbitrary primed PCR *HELP assay (HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR) *Chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP-Chip using antibodies specific for methyl-CpG binding domain proteins *Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation Methyl-DIP *Gene-expression profiles via DNA microarray : comparing mRNA levels from cancer cell lines before and after treatment with a demethylating agent Since bisulfite sequencing is considered the gold standard for measuring CpG methylation, when one of the other methods is used, results are usually confirmed using bisulfite sequencing[1]. Popular approaches for determining histone modification profiles in cancerous versus healthy cells include: *Mass spectrometry *Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay Diagnosis and prognosis Researchers are hoping to identify specific epigenetic profiles of various types and subtypes of cancer with the goal of using these profiles as tools to diagnose individuals more specifically and accurately. Since epigenetic profiles change, scientists would like to use the different epigenomic profiles to determine the stage of development or level of aggressiveness of a particular cancer in patients. For example, hypermethylation of the genes coding for Death-Associated Protein Kinase (DAPK), p16, and Epithelial Membrane Protein 3 (EMP3) have been linked to more aggressive forms of lung, colorectal, and brain cancers. This type of knowledge can affect the way that doctors will diagnose and choose to treat their patients. Another factor that will influence the treatment of patients is knowing how well they will respond to certain treatments. Personalized epigenomic profiles of cancerous cells can provide insight into this field. For example, MGMT is an enzyme that reverses the addition of alkyl groups to the nucleotide guanine. Alkylating guanine, however, is the mechanism by which several chemotherapeutic drugs act in order to disrupt DNA and cause cell death. Therefore, if the gene encoding MGMT in cancer cells is hypermethylated and in effect silenced or repressed, the chemotherapeutic drugs that act by methylating guanine will be more effective than in cancer cells that have a functional MGMT enzyme. Epigenetic biomarkers can also be utilized as tools for molecular prognosis. In primary tumor and mediastinal lymph node biopsy samples, hypermethylation of both CDKN2A and CDH13 serves as the marker for increased risk of faster cancer relapse and higher death rate of patients. Treatment decitabine Epigenetic control of the proto-onco regions and the tumor suppressor sequences by conformational changes in histones plays a role in the formation and progression of cancer. Pharmaceuticals that reverse epigenetic changes might have a role in a variety of cancers. Recently, it is evidently known that associations between specific cancer histotypes and epigenetic changes can facilitate the development of novel epi-drugs. Drug development has focused mainly on modifying DNA methyltransferase, histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). Drugs that specifically target the inverted methylation pattern of cancerous cells include the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors azacitidine and decitabine. These hypomethylating agents are used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, a blood cancer produced by abnormal bone marrow stem cells. These agents inhibit all three types of active DNA methyltransferases, and had been thought to be highly toxic, but proved to be effective when used in low dosage, reducing progression of myelodysplastic syndrome to leukemia. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors show efficacy in treatment of T cell lymphoma. two HDAC inhibitors, vorinostat and romidepsin, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. However, since these HDAC inhibitors alter the acetylation state of many proteins in addition to the histone of interest, knowledge of the underlying mechanism at the molecular level of patient response is required to enhance the efficiency of using such inhibitors as treatment. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors has been found to promote gene reactivation after DNA methyl-transferases inhibitors have repressed transcription. Panobinostat is approved for certain situations in myeloma.http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2015/205353Orig1s000MedR.pdf Other pharmaceutical targets in research are histone lysine methyltransferases (KMT) and protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT). Preclinical study has suggested that lunasin may have potentially beneficial epigenetic effects.

The nineteenth century introduced a change in economic circumstances in Germany. The rise of industrialization and urban expansion introduced a new marketplace for music. Individuals were able to participate within the music culture as small social clubs and orchestras were easily able to purchase sheet music and instruments. Out of this developed an extensive network of music among German citizens. The spawned more localized concert halls and orchestras, greatly increasing the circulation of both German and Jewish compositions. When the Nazi Party took power in Germany, it found it necessary to step in and control these cultural music products. Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda, famously decreed the radio to be \\"the most influential and important intermediary between a spiritual movement and the nation, between the idea and the people\\". He put much effort into the proliferation of radio technologies amongst German citizens regardless of socioeconomic status, introducing a low-cost people's receiver. As the music industry of Nazi Germany grew, institutions within the regime devoted their efforts to promote Aryan ideologies through heavy censorship and cultural control. From blacklisted Jewish compositions to banned concert hall performances, Nazi intervention was obvious. The regime issued strict authoritative control of these mediums in order to promote nationalism through cultural unity. By controlling the mediums of communication in its society the Reich's Chamber of Culture was able to dictate public opinion (in regards to musical culture) and reaffirm their hegemonic beliefs. Through this authoritative control they were able to silence the works of Jewish musicians effectively eliminating their voice in rational-critical discourse while promoting the Aryan works consistent with Nazi ideology.  Concert Halls  In 1928 competing national-socialist entities separately claimed control of all musicians and publications of musical material, each hoping to eventually become the administration of music culture. Alfred Rosenberg played a key role in these early institutions, spawning many sub-organizations such as The Militant League for German Culture (Kampfbund f√ºr deutsche Kultur). This important organization created departments for music, cinema, visual arts, and radio, and effectively served as the forerunner of the Joseph Goebbels Ministry. In hopes of strengthening the ‚Äòsuppressed‚Äô Aryan artists and eliminating ‚Äòdegenerate‚Äô artists (Jewish & Jazz artists) Rosenberg's institutions published many inflammatory brochures warning citizens of non-German nationalist music.See Levi pp.16. His institution funded Aryan musicians and even went as far as to disrupt concerts, threaten Jewish performers and intimidate audiences. These practices were the beginning of the overarching political intervention of concert halls and orchestras of the 19th century. In March 1933 Hitler appointed Joseph Goebbels as the Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. The institution effectively replaced Rosenberg's, issuing much stricter control over all cultural products of the era including newspaper, film and radio.See Levi pp.19. Within the music realm Goebbels initially focused on the rapidly expanding concert hall industry. With the increase of both music publications and instrument production, a public sphere of music emerged. German citizens were able to exchange music unlike ever before, increasing circulation of all genres of music. Since the performance of Jewish or Romani music was prohibited by the state, this expanding circulation of sheet music was problematic. In an effort to regain control of this industry, and eliminate degenerate music, Goebbels soon instituted a harsh purge of Jewish musicians. On September 22, 1933 Goebbels established the Reichskulturkammer, the Reich's Chamber of Culture. This organization required all German artists to register for membership, those rejected resulted with a profession ban. The chamber of culture specifically promoted art produced by Aryans (such as film, fine art and literature) whose views were consistent with Nazi ideologies. The organization blacklisted many Jewish musicians and composers (who opposed Nazi ideology) from performing live in concert halls. The Chamber of Culture famously banned Jewish composer Bruno Walter from performing in public in 1933. Walter's performance in Leipzig was cancelled due to \\"threats of violence.\\" Four days later Walter was officially blacklisted when Richard Strauss replaced him at the Berlin Philharmonic Hall. The chamber of commerce eventually purged all orchestras of Jewish members, from local chorals to professional symphonies including the Berlin Philharmonic. This was made possible in April 1933 with the passage of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. This law essentially dismissed hundreds of Jewish citizens from civil service including musicians and composers from German orchestras and concert halls. More than any other law, this one pushed Jewish musicians out of German culture at large. These factors produced a music industry overrun with Aryan influence and focus on classical German composers. Goebbels believed that music could create a public emotional and spiritual experience competitive with religion. Concert halls with their darkened halls and formal setting expose the audience to an experience similar to church. The music of Bruckner and Wagner were the centerpiece of the new Aryan spirituality, aiming to attain the same \\"impact generated by traditional Christian religious ecstasy and devotion\\". Goebbels strongly believed music could bring about national pride through cultural identification. Striving to increase the reach of his musical unity Goebbels shifted his sights towards radio.  Radio  Goebbels famously stated that the radio is an instrumental tool for the nation-state to influence the masses. In \\"Radio as the Eight Great Power\\" Goebbels stresses the importance of the radio as an intermediary between the government and the nation.See Goebbels pp.206. He blamed the profit-driven radio industry for diluting the political potential of this medium. The corporate entities focused more on profit than political enlightenment, motivating Goebbels to institute strict Nazi control of the industry. Under the Chamber of Culture the Party Propaganda Department, or Reichspropagandaleitung, was responsible for radio regulation. The radio division was split into three offices: Cultural Radio and Radio Organization, Radio Technology, and Radio Propaganda. The Office of Radio propaganda censored music and programming, adhering to the strict authority seen in the concert hall regulation. Stations played music of approved Aryan composers like Wagner, prohibiting any Jewish compositions or ‚Äòdegenerate music‚Äô such as newly popular American Jazz. Goebbels acknowledged the importance of pop music, claiming \\"Not all music suits everyone. Therefore that style of entertaining music that is found among the broad masses also has a right to exist\\". Unlike degenerate music, pop music was accepted as long as it reiterated the theme of nationalism. \\"Everything should include the theme of our great reconstructive work, or at least not stand in its way\\".See Goebbels pp.206. He stressed that popular music & entertainment, though not directly affecting political enlightenment, provides cultural enrichment and a potential step towards cultural imperialism. The Office of Radio Technology released the Volksempf√§nger aka \\"the people‚Äôs receiver\\" in August 1933. The low price of 76 German Reichsmarks, roughly two weeks pay, enabled the broad masses to become radio consumers.See Goebbels pp. 207. Now instead of regulating music on the local level in concert halls, the Chamber of Culture had a centralized control of the massive media outlet of radio. The various amount of bureaucrats and committees involved in the radio industry resulted in unorthodox structuring. The lack of unified organization across the industry was a hindrance to productivity and a sign of corruption, according to Goebbels.See Goebbels pp.207. State-regulated radio was necessary to meet the needs of the masses, placing their common good in the forefront. Now with the Party's Propaganda Department in place, Goebbels exercised complete control of the radio industry from content to distribution. He created a direct link to the masses through which he could broadcast so-called \\"Aryan\\" music, continually producing a dialogue of reconstruction/nationalism among the German people. Through the saturation of German nationalist music and boycotting of Jewish compositions, Goebbels harnessed cultural products to further political control. The musical rhetoric of the Third Reich led to the spread of nationalist enthusiasms, uniting German Nazis through the medium of music.

History The traces of oil painting reproduction are found since 16th century. Traditionally, students of the old masters learned how to paint by working in the style of their teachers. This process of mimicking their master‚Äôs work would enable a student to practice a skilled mode of painting before developing their own approach. Many famous artists employed this practice, such as John Singer Sargent, Edgar Degas, and Pablo Picasso. Perhaps the most well known of all students who learned by reproduction was Leonardo da Vinci. Beginning as an apprentice under the master sculptor and painter Andrea Del Verrocchio, Leonardo would have learned to paint in the style of the master himself.

She was the co- founder of the Danske Kvindeforeningers Valgretsforbund or DKV (Danish Women's Society Suffrage Union) and first chairperson in 1889-1891. Life Line Luplau was born on 22 April 1823 in Mern, the daughter of the vicar Hans Christian Monrad (1780-1825) and Ferdinandine Henriette Gieertsen (1783-1871) and married the vicar Daniel Carl Erhard Luplau (1818-1909), in 1847. Luplau developed an early frustration over the fact that women was not recognized full rights as humans because of their sex. This interest is regarded to have developed from the public debate following the controversial novel Clara Raphael by Mathilde Fibiger (1851). Her spouse served as a vicar in a parish in Slesvig-Holsten, and the family was forced to leave for Varde when this part of Denmark was lost after the war in 1864. In Varde, Luplau founded a charity organisation, and became the first woman in Denmark to speak at a national celebration. Line luplau seen in the foreground on her daughter Marie Luplau's large group portrait painting From the Early Days of the Fight for Women's Suffrage (1897). In 1872, Luplau became a member of the local branch of the women's organisation Dansk Kvindesamfund (DK) alongside her spouse and her daughter Marie Luplau. Her interest in women's rights focused on woman suffrage and equal political rights, and she belonged to the opposition group within the DK. In 1888, she delivered a list of 1702 names in support to Fredrik Bajer's motion in the parliament of women suffrage as the representative of the DK. In 1885, she belonged to the supporters of the newly founded women's organisation Kvindelig Fremskridtsforening (KF), a fraction of former DK- members, and served in the KF central comity in 1886. In 1886, she moved to Copenhagen after her husband's retirement, and in 1888, she represented KF at the first Nordic women's conference in Copenhagen, where she and Johanne Meyer presented women suffrage as one of the four main issues within women's rights. Line Luplau became one of the leading figures of the Danish women suffrage movement, and served in the board of the KF-paper Hvad vi vil alongside Matilde Bajer, Anna Nielsen and Massi Bruhn. In 1889, Line Luplau founded the Danish suffrage movement Kvindevalgretsforeningen (KVF) together with Louise N√∏rlund, and served as its chairperson in 1889-91. Her goal was to form an organisation exclusively for women suffrage rather than the DK and KF, which handled many different women's issues, and she gathered support from both males and various different political groups, especially the left wing political groups. Line Luplau was a controversial, strict and energetic activist with a direct approach, whose activism aroused strong emotions, and she was not popular among other women's groups, who considered her to have split the women's movement. In 1891, she was forced to resign as chairperson of the KVF for health reasons. In 1917, her daughter Marie Luplau created a group portrait painting for the Danish parliament depicting the notable members of the women suffrage movement, where Luplau was placed in the front.

He was Acting Director of the National Museum of Ireland from 1916-1922. Life Scharff was born in Leeds on 9 July 1858 to German parents. He studied at University College London for a B.Sc., and furthered those studies at the universities of Edinburgh with an MA graduating in 1885, and Heidelberg where he completed a Ph.D. From there he went on to study at St. Andrews Biological Station in New Brunswick and Stazione Zoologica in Naples. Scharff was twice married, his first wife Alice Hutton died during the 1918 flu pandemic, they had two sons together. In 1920 he married Jane Stephens with whom he had a daughter. Scharff died in Worthing on 13 September 1934. Career Scharff was appointed as an Assistant in the Natural History Division of the National Museum of Ireland in 1887, becoming Keeper in 1890. In the years after 1916 and the resignation of George Noble Plunkett as Director of the National Museum of Ireland Scharff became the acting Director until his retirement in 1922. Scharff was one of the main organisers and contributors to the Clare Island Survey, serving as a chair of the organising committee. He is best known for his work on biogeography, particularly the recolonisation of Ireland after the ice age. He was a vocal proponent of the land-bridge hypothesis of animal migration. This work was informed by his experience excavating caves in Kesh. Scharff was a well-known figure in his time receiving many honours like the prize of Emperor Nicholas II in 1897, and he holding the Swiney lectureship in geology in London in 1906 and 1908. He was an active member of many societies in Ireland and the UK. Whilst a member of the Royal Irish Academy over a forty-year period, he served as vice-president, secretary for foreign correspondence, and chairman of the flora and fauna committee. He was also an active member of the Royal Zoological Society of Ireland, the Royal Dublin Society, the Conchological Society of Great Britain & Ireland, the Linnean Society and the Zoological Society of London. He collected zoological specimens extensively, many of which are housed with the National Museum of Ireland. In 1899 a species of land planarian was named in his honour, Microplana scharffi (Graff, 1899). Following his retirement, Scharff moved back to the UK, to Worthing. He still remained an active member of Irish zoological groups until his death in 1934.

McLaughlin or simply J.H. McLaughlin) was a wrestling champion in the United States in the 19th century. He is generally considered the first American professional wrestling champion, and along with William Muldoon, was one of the two key people to establish and popularize professional wrestling in the United States. The 6-foot-1 McLaughlin weighed between 215 and 265 pounds, depending on whether he'd kept himself in fighting shape. He was born in Oriskany Falls, New York. McLaughlin was known for his superior Irish-style \\"collar-and-elbow\\" standing skills, in which throwing an opponent was the aim. However, he also excelled at the rougher, undisciplined catch-as-catch-can style which was then prominent, and three opponents are known to have died as a result of wrestling McLaughlin. Newspaper accounts of the time are sometimes exaggerated, and even in the late 19th century, numerous fans and reporters already regarded the burgeoning sport's credibility with skepticism. However, contemporary reports of McLaughlin's earnings, including the side bets that were commonly several multiples of his official pay, indicate that he was phenomenally well-compensated. Adjusting for inflation, it is possible that he was the highest-paid wrestler in history. Career McLaughlin's wrestling career began in earnest with a few matches just before the U.S. Civil War. His first was in 1859 against the irascible Hiram McKee. Though half McKee's age, McLaughlin may have outweighed his opponent, who he successfully pinned. When McKee angrily demanded a rematch, McLaughlin lost his temper and threw McKee to the ground, fracturing McKee's leg. McKee fought for the Union Army during the war, while continuing to pursue wrestling, which was a popular pastime among the troops. After defeating Louis Ainsworth in 1866 or 1867, McLaughlin declared himself to be the collar-and-elbow champion of America. Even after losing a bout to Homer Lane in 1868, the public still regarded McLaughlin's claim to the title. In March 1870, a tournament was held, and is believed to have been wholly legitimate. McLaughlin emerged as the winner, and was awarded a belt with a gold buckle, which he would later put at stake in matches. In the tournament final, McLaughlin was safely ahead in a match against Barney Smith, but the referee declined to end the match. McLaughlin ended the match by either slamming Smith on his head or off the stage (accounts differ), delivering an impact which led to Smith's mental incapacitation and eventual death from cranial trauma. The remorseful McLaughlin gave his tournament winnings to Smith's widow, saying \\"I forgot I was so wicked strong.\\" McLaughlin successfully defended his golden belt for the next year, before announcing his retirement in mid-1871. Despite remaining inactive for nearly four years, he was generally considered the reigning champion. His next match came in February 1875, with a decisive win over Mike Whalen in which he collected $2,500 for the match itself, and another $15,000 by betting on himself, more than half a million dollars in today's money. McLaughlin did not fight again for a year, winning a January 1876 rematch against Joe Benjamin, who he'd beaten five years earlier. He fought several times that year, including two draws and a win against James H. Martin. But the year took its toll on McLaughlin's opponents. Dutch Hogan died after wrestling McLaughlin, and Charles Meier was paralyzed. It was at this point that McLaughlin publicly declared his intention to restrict his future fights to collar-and-elbow rules, rather than the anything-goes style that led to those in-ring tragedies. In December 1876, McLaughlin injured his heel in an exhibition tune-up match, leaving him at a disadvantage for a title match against James Owens a few weeks later. That bout lasted more than five hours, with McLaughlin protecting his injured foot, and Owens being reluctant to press the advantage against the larger and stronger McLaughlin. Ultimately Owens won the title in two straight falls. McLaughlin spent a few months healing before winning three matches in the spring, then retired again. McLaughlin gained a substantial amount of weight during his sabbatical, but was lured out of retirement in November 1878 against the formidable John McMahon. McLaughlin defeated McMahon in a rematch three weeks later, and a third contest the following March resulted in a draw. Almost four years later, at the end of 1882, McLaughlin beat Canadian champion Edras Lambert. In 1884, he reentered the competition with a series of bouts. In January, he beat top star H.M. Dufur to capture his third collar-and-elbow championship. In March, he lost to Duncan C. Ross, then beat Ross three weeks later, then lost a rematch to Dufur three weeks after that. A month later, in June, he defeated Dufur for his fourth title, before relinquishing it to Dufur at the end of July. Wrestling reporter/historian Dave Meltzer believes the back-and-forth results and the shortened time between the matches suggests that the sequence and outcomes of these matches were most likely deliberately prearranged by the wrestlers to excite public interest, and maximize the payout. Four months later, McLaughlin split a pair of matches with William Muldoon in November and December. Muldoon won the rematch, and assumed McLaughlin's spot as the nation's preeminent wrestling star. The second Muldoon match marked the effective end of McLaughlin's professional career and title hopes. However, in 1901, McLaughlin emerged in the Yukon Territory as part of a threesome of wrestlers, travelling from town to town pretending to confront and challenge one another over the \\"real\\" championship. The other wrestlers, primarily future star Frank Gotch and Joe Carroll, used pseudonyms, but McLaughlin's name was still a draw after forty years. Their alleged antipathy included the first high-profile \\"three way\\" match, in which McLaughlin, Gotch and Carroll wrestled one another in five different styles, purportedly to determine which of the three was the most versatile. Gotch would emerge the winner of these round robin challenges.Meltzer, Dave, The Wrestling Observer, December 5, 2016, pgs. 5-7 McLaughlin died four years later, aged 61, on September 11, 1905, in Fairmont, Alaska. He was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame class of 2016.

The dispute was whether World Programming had infringed copyrights on SAS Institute Products, and Manuals and whether World Programming used SAS Learning Edition to reverse engineer SAS system in violation with its term of usage. The case is interesting because World Programming did not have access to the SAS Institute's source code, and so the court considered the merits of a copyright claim based on observing functionality only. The European Committee for Interoperable Systems say that the case is important to the software industry. Some observers say the case is as important as the Borland versus Lotus case. The EU Court of Justice ruled that copyright protection does not extend to the software functionality, the programming language used and the format of the data files used by the program. It stated that there is no copyright infringement when a company which does not have access to the source code of a program studies, observes and tests that program to create another program with the same functionality.  High Court of England and Wales  On 23 July 2010 Justice Arnold in the High Court of England and Wales referred a number of questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), but expressed his initial views of the main claims via the following observations in the initial judgment ([2010] EWHC 1829 (Ch, [2011] RPC 1).Initial High court Judgment :1. On his preferred interpretation of Article 5(3), WPL's use of the Learning Edition is within Article 5(3), and to the extent that the licence terms prevent this they are null and void, with the result that none of WPL's acts complained of was a breach of contract or an infringement of copyright except perhaps one (see paragraphs 313-315 of the initial judgment). :2 WPL has infringed the copyrights in the SAS Manuals by substantially reproducing them in the WPL Manual (see paragraphs 317-319 of the initial judgment). :3 WPL has not infringed the copyrights in the SAS Manuals by producing the WPS Guides (see paragraphs 320-329 of the initial judgment). :4 On the assumption that Pumfrey J's interpretation of Article 1(2) of the Software Directive (from Navitaire v Easyjet [2004]) was correct, WPL has not infringed SAS Institute's copyrights in the SAS Components by producing WPS (see paragraphs 245-250 of the initial judgment). Justice Arnold quoted (at paragraph 56) from the \\"SAS language\\" article of wikipedia (as at 25 April 2010) in support of his view that SAS is a \\"programming language\\" (and thus not protected under the Software Directive): :\\"SAS can be considered a general programming language, though it serves largely as a database programming language and a language with a wide variety of specialized analytic and graphic procedures.\\" First, the decision confirms what WPL has always admitted, namely that it has used the SAS Manuals to emulate functionality of the SAS System in WPS. Secondly, it shows that to some extent WPL has reproduced aspects of the SAS Manuals going beyond that which was strictly necessary in order for WPS to emulate the functions of the SAS System. What it does not show is reproduction of the SAS source code by WPS going beyond the reproduction of its functionality. WPL's manual writers did not directly copy from the SAS Manuals in the sense of having one of the SAS Manuals open in front of them when writing the WPS Manual and intentionally either transcribing or paraphrasing the wording. A considerable degree of similarity in both content and language between the SAS Manual entries and the WPS Manual entries is to be expected given that they are describing identical functionality. The degree of resemblance in the language goes beyond that which is attributable to describing identical functionality. Justice Arnold referred certain questionsQuestions referred to the CJEU to the CJEU. After the CJEU handed down its decision later in 2012, Justice Arnold in the High Court handed down his final judgementFinal High Court Judgment on 25 January 2013, which concluded (as summarised in the final statement of the judgment): :\\"82. For the reasons given above, I dismiss all of SAS Institute's claims except for its claim in respect of the WPS Manual. That claim succeeds to the extent indicated in my first judgment, but no further.\\"Judges Final Statement  Court of Justice of the European Union reference  The High Court referred several questions of the interpretation of the Computer Programs Directive and the Information Society Directive to the Court of Justice of the European Union, under the preliminary ruling procedure. Advocate-General Yves Bot gave his Opinion on 29 November 2011.AG Opinion The full judgement was handed down by the European Court of Justice on 2 May 2012.JUDGMENT OF THE COURT (Grand Chamber) It largely adopted the Advocate-General's Opinion, holding that neither the functionality of a computer program nor the programming language and the format of data files used in a computer program in order to exploit certain of its functions are covered by copyright. The Court concluded that: :1. Article 1(2) of the Computer Programs Directive (Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991) must be interpreted as meaning that neither the functionality of a computer program nor the programming language and the format of data files used in a computer program in order to exploit certain of its functions constitute a form of expression of that program and, as such, are not protected by copyright in computer programs for the purposes of that directive. :2. Article 5(3) of the Computer Programs Directive must be interpreted as meaning that a person who has obtained a copy of a computer program under a licence is entitled, without the authorisation of the owner of the copyright, to observe, study or test the functioning of that program so as to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program, in the case where that person carries out acts covered by that licence and acts of loading and running necessary for the use of the computer program, and on condition that that person does not infringe the exclusive rights of the owner of the copyright in that program. :3. Article 2(a) of the Information Society Directive (Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001) must be interpreted as meaning that the reproduction, in a computer program or a user manual for that program, of certain elements described in the user manual for another computer program protected by copyright is capable of constituting an infringement of the copyright in the latter manual if ‚Äì this being a matter for the national court to ascertain ‚Äì that reproduction constitutes the expression of the intellectual creation of the author of the user manual for the computer program protected by copyright. The case returned to the High Court of England and Wales which provided its final judgementFinal High Court Judgement on 25 January 2013 applying the CJEU findings to the particular facts of this case.  US lawsuit (initial filing) The initial US case filed by SAS Institute against WPS was dismissed :SAS INSTITUTE INC., Plaintiff, v. WORLD PROGRAMMING LIMITED, Defendant. :In their briefing, the parties have raised for the court‚Äôs consideration a variety of interesting and complex questions of law. But after considering the able arguments of counsel for both sides, the court is unable to conclude that it clearly erred in dismissing this action on for forum non conveniens. As such, and for the reasons set forth more particularly above, plaintiff‚Äôs motion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e) (DE # 53) is DENIED. :SO ORDERED, this the 22nd day of June, 2011.US Case by SAS Against WPS  US lawsuit (subsequent filing)  A subsequent US case filed by SAS Institute against WPL was won by SAS. After a three-week trial that ended on October 9, 2015, a jury in federal court awarded SAS $79.1 million in damages, after trebling. The jury ruled that WPL had engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices - specifically, that it had misrepresented its intentions in order to obtain the license to the software, and violated the contract granted, which only allowed for non-commercial use - and that it had infringed on the copyright of its manual by copying portions of it into its own manual. However, Judge Flanagan ruled against SAS in summary judgement that WPL had infringed on the copyright of SAS's software. WPL has announced its intention to appeal.SAS awarded damages in trial against World Programming Ltd., sas.comWorld Programming US Litigation, worldprogramming.com Implications The UK case limited the aspects of computer programs which were eligible for copyright protection, and was subsequently cited in the case of Oracle Corporation's lawsuit against Google over the latter's use of Java in Android.

He was the undefeated middle and light heavyweight South African champion and held both titles at the same time. He retired from the ring in 1977. He died on 21 June 1980, a few days before his 37th birthday in a motor vehicle accident at Cecil Payne Park in Roodepoort South Africa. He was the first white boxer in Apartheid South Africa to fight against a non-white opponent, American Bob Foster on 21 August 1973 in South Africa. Career Trained by Allan Toweel, Pierre joined the professional boxing ranks on 2 May 1966. He won his very first fight with a knockout in the first round. The partnership between Fourie and Toweel, one of the most successful in the history of South African boxing, continued throughout the eleven years of Fourie's career as a boxer. In his 60 professional fights, Fourie distinguished himself as a hard but clean and scientific boxer rather than a rough fighter. He beat Johnny Wood twice and Willie Ludick to retain his South African middleweight title and was undefeated. He moved into the light heavyweight division. He fought Sarel Aucamp twice to retain his South African light heavyweight title and was undefeated. He fought Bob Foster for the WBC light heavyweight title and WBA World light heavyweight title twice and Victor Gal√≠ndez for the WBA World light heavyweight title twice. He lost these on points. His last fight was contentious and many believed he had won. Ironically, Galindez also died in a motor vehicle crash, only 4 months after Fourie.

The second fight between Fourie and Foster on 1 December 1973 was the first between a white and black boxer in South Africa and constituted a breakthrough for the removal of racial discrimination in professional boxing and other sports. At the time the attendance figure of 37,4704 spectators, the gate money of approximately R500,000, and the guaranteed purse of $200,000 to Foster, were world records for the light heavyweight division.

Biography Hansen was born October 22, 1859 in Assens, the daughter of Christian Jacob Hansen (1832‚Äì80) and Johanne Margrethe Rasmussen (1822‚Äì91). In 1876-77 she was a student at N. Zahles privatl√¶rerindekursus for governesses in Copenhagen; she graduated as a teacher in 1883 and worked as one at Aarhus h√∏jere Pigeskole in 1884-89, and at the public schools in Copenhagen in 1889-1910. Eline Hansen became interested in gender equality as a student, and during her career as a teacher she worked for equality between male and female students and teachers. Hansen became a pioneer in Denmark as a school kitchen inspector, when she was educated in this profession in Norway on the expense of the Danish government and employed as such in Copenhagen in 1897. In 1898, she petitioned the government with a demand to start professional university courses for cooks at school kitchens, which was granted and put in effect in 1899. She herself became a teacher at this course. Eline Hansen was a member of the Copenhagen School Direction in 1904-1910 and chairperson of the Copenhagen Public School Teacher's Association in 1905-1909. In 1908, she successfully managed to raise the salary for female teachers. Eline Hansen was an important member of the Danish women's movement. In 1886 she co-founded the local √Örhus section of the women's organisation Dansk Kvindesamfund (DK) and the contact between the section of √Örhus and Copenhagen. She was a member of the central comity of the DK in 1893-1903, and alongside chairperson Jutta Bojsen-M√∏ller credited with preserving the DK in a difficult period of split of the Danish women's movement. In 1899, she co-founded the Dansk Kvinderaad, later Danske Kvinders Nationalr√•d (DKN). In 1915-16, she arranged demonstrations for poor housewives. She functioned as an interpreter at the International Woman Suffrage Alliance‚Äôs congress in Copenhagen in 1906. During World War I she managed to maintain contact between British and German women, and in 1915, she was a delegate in the international women's peace conference in the Hague. Upon her return, she co-founded the peace movement Danske Kvinders Fredsk√¶de, later Kvindernes Internationale Liga for Fred og Frihed, with Thora Daugaard, Clara Tybjerg, Louise Wright and Eva Moltesen. She was also active in the struggle for women's suffrage, and chairperson of one of the Danish suffrage movements. In 1918, the first election after women suffrage, she was nominated for parliament, but was not elected. Hansen died on January 6, 1919 in Copenhagen.

The Chepman and Myllar Press was the first printing press to be established in Scotland.Norman Macdougall, The Stewart Dynasty in Scotland, James IV, Tuckwell press, 1997, pp. 218. The press was founded in 1508 in Edinburgh by Walter Chepman and Androw Myllar, both burgesses of the Scottish capital. The two partners operated under a charter of King James IV issued in 1507 which gave them a monopoly in printed books within Scotland.The Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland. Scottish National Archives. Very few products of the press are preserved today. Those that have survived largely intact are nine chapbooks of vernacular literature known collectively as The Chepman and Myllar PrintsThe Chepman and Myllar Prints at the National Library of Scotland and a Latin religious text known as The Aberdeen Breviary. The Aberdeen Breviary at the National Library of Scotland Fragments of two other publications also exist. These were editions of The Wallace and The Buke of the Howlat. The press seems to have had a brief existence. The earliest surviving example of its work dates to 1508 and the latest to 1510. Chepman and Myllar's press is also referred to as The Southgait Press. Historical context Johannes Gutenberg developed printing with moveable type in Germany in the decade after 1440. The new technology spread rapidly. Scots began to commission the printing of books in other countries. France, with its strong diplomatic and intellectual connection to Scotland, was favoured. Foundation by Royal Charter The entry in the Register of The Privy Seal of Scotland, 15 September 1507, which established the press. (National Archives of Scotland). King James IV authorised the creation of a press in a proclamation of September 1507. He charged his \\"beloved servants\\" Chepman and Myllar to \\"acquire and bring home a press with all accessories and skilled men required to use it\\". :'''' The King intended the press to publish books of laws, acts of parliament, histories and religious texts. :, The King would determine \\"competitive prices\\" for the books. :'''' Chepman and Myllar were awarded a monopoly in print within Scotland. The commissioning of imported printed books would be prohibited. :'''' The charter then specifies a key purpose for the press: the production of liturgical books with a distinctive Scottish character. These were intended to replace the service books of the English Use of Salisbury which was the rite commonly used throughout Scotland at the time. Eventually the importation of books of the English rite would be outlawed. :'''' The Aberdeen Breviary, compiled by the King's \\"traist counsalar\\" Bishop William Elphinstone of Aberdeen, is apparently an example of this policy. Career of the Press The device of Walter Chepman from the chapbook of 'The Goldyn Targe' in the 'Chepman and Myllar prints'. (National Library of Scotland). Androw Myllar was a bookseller who had supplied volumes to the King.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.3 (1901), see index, p.458, 504. He had also published books, printed at Rouen in 1505 and 1506. As such, he can be assumed to have had some knowledge of printing technology. Walter Chepman was a prosperous textile merchant who had supplied goods to the Crown and also carried out clerical duties at the Royal Court. It might be supposed that he provided the bulk of the capital for the enterprise. It is not known where or when Chepman and Myllar acquired their printing press and staff, but in the months following the Royal charter, they established themselves in the Southgait of Edinburgh,Jane E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re- formed, The New Edinburgh History of Scotland, Volume 6. Edinburgh University Press, 2007, p.81. now known as The Cowgate. Their earliest surviving publication dates to 4 April 1508. It not known when the press closed, but the latest surviving copies of the Aberdeen Breviary date to 1510. Surviving Publications of the Press =The Chepman and Myllar Prints= The device of Androw Myllar from the chapbook of 'The Porteous of Nobleness' in the 'Chepman and Myllar prints'. The windmill is apparently a pun on his surname. (National Library of Scotland). The Chepman and Myllar Prints are nine of Chepman and Myllar's chapbooks bound into a single volume alongside two other pamphlets from Scotland in the sixteenth century. This volume was acquired by the Advocates' Library of Edinburgh and is now held in the National Library of Scotland. The volume contains the following texts of Chepman and Myllar's press, all written in vernacular, either Scots or English. :Book 1 :*\\"The Porteous of Nobleness\\". An anonymous Scots translation of Alain Chartier's \\"Breviaire des Nobles\\". A guide to courtly manners. :Book 2 :*\\"Golagrus and Gawain\\". An anonymous chivalric romance. :*\\"Rhyme Without Accord\\". A work of John Lydgate's. :Book 3 :*Eglamour. An anonymous chivalric romance. :*\\"Balade\\". A fragment of an anonymous ballad. :Book 4 :*Dunbar's \\"The Golden Targe\\" An allegory of love. :Book 5 :*'\\"De regimine principum bonum consilium\\" or \\"Ane Buke of Gude Counsale to the King\\". A commentary on statecraft. :Book 6 :*Lydgate's The Complaint of the Black Knight. :*\\"When by Divine Deliberation\\". A short religious poem. :Book 7 :*The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy. :*Henryson's \\"The Praise of Age\\". :*\\"Device, Prowess and eke Humility.\\" A fragmentary anonymous poem. :Book 8 :*Henryson's Orpheus and Eurydice. :*\\"The Want of Wise Men.\\" A short anonymous moral piece. :Book 9 :*Dunbar's \\"The Ballade of Lord Bernard Stewart\\". The same volume contains two other Scottish booklets from the Sixteenth Century. :Book 10 :*Dunbar's The Tua Mariit Wemen and the Wedo, Lament for the Makaris and \\"The Testament of Mr Andro Kennedy\\". :*\\"Kynd Kittok\\". Erroneously ascribed to Dunbar. :Book 11 :*\\"A Gest of Robin Hood\\". A ballad of Robin Hood. The prints have a page height of approximately 15 cm and include the woodcut devices of Myllar and Chepman. The National Library of Scotland speculates that these chapbooks may have been test-pieces for the press. Their sale would also have provided a source of income for the new enterprise. =The Aberdeen Breviary= A litany of saints from the Aberdeen Breviary. Scottish Saints are prominent including, Kentigern, Ebba and Triduana. (Edinburgh University Library). The Aberdeen Breviary or \\"Brevarium Aberdonense\\" is the largest surviving product of Chepman and Myllar's press.The Aberdeen Breviary at Edinburgh University Library. Produced between 1509 and 1510, it is a substantial Latin text consisting of two volumes printed in black and red. Breviaries are handbooks intended to guide priests in conducting Catholic religious ceremonies. They include a psalter and prayers to mark particular festivals and saints' days. The content of breviaries varied across Catholic Europe, with the English Salisbury or Sarum Rite dominant throughout the British Isles. The Breviary was compiled by Bishop William Elphinstone of Aberdeen and aimed to give the rituals of the Scottish Church a character distinctive from that in England and its dependencies. More than seventy of the saints honoured by it are identified with Scotland.Norman Macdougall, The Stewart Dynasty in Scotland, James IV, Tuckwell press, 1997, pp. 262‚Äì263. As such, it forms part of the policy set out in the charter which established the press; :that in tyme cuming mess bukis, manualis, matyne bukis and portuus bukis efter our awin Scottis use, and with legendis of Scottis sanctis, be usit generaly within al our Realme alssone as the sammyn may be imprentit and providit. Copies of the Aberdeen Breviary survive, in varying degrees of completeness, at Edinburgh University, Aberdeen University, The National Library of Scotland, The British Library and a private collection. =Fragments= Fragmentary remains of two further publications survive whose typeface matches that of the Chepman and Myllar press. These were Blind Harry's The Wallace and Holland's The Buke of the Howlat. The fragments of 'The Wallace' are preserved at Glasgow's Mitchell Library and Cambridge University Library. The fragment of 'The Howlat' is kept at Cambridge.

He later became the chief medical examiner for San Joaquin County, California, and is a professor at the University of California, Davis, department of medical pathology and laboratory medicine.  Early life  Omalu is of Igbo ancestry (formerly \\"Ibo\\"), and was born in Nnokwa, Idemili South, Anambra in southeastern Nigeria on September 30, 1968, the sixth of seven siblings. He was born during the Nigerian Civil War, which caused his family to flee from their home in the predominant Igbo village of Enugu-Ukwu in southeastern Nigeria. They returned two years after Omalu's birth. Omalu's mother was a seamstress and his father a civil mining engineer and community leader in Enugu-Ukwu. The family name, Omalu, is a shortened form of the surname, Onyemalukwube, which translates to \\"he who knows, speaks.\\" Education and career Omalu began his primary school at age three and earned entrance into the Federal Government College Enugu for secondary school. He attended medical College starting at age 16 at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. After graduation with a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS) in June 1990, he completed a clinical internship, followed by three years of service work doctoring in the highland city of Jos. He became disillusioned with Nigeria after presidential candidate Moshood Abiola failed to win the Nigerian presidency during an inconclusive election in 1993 and began to search for scholarship opportunities in the United States. Omalu first came to Seattle, Washington in 1994 to complete an epidemiology fellowship at the University of Washington. In 1995, he left Seattle for New York City, where he joined Columbia University's Harlem Hospital Center for a residency training program in anatomic and clinical pathology. Before residency, he trained as a forensic pathologist under noted forensic consultant Cyril Wecht at the Allegheny County coroner's office in Pittsburgh. Omalu became particularly interested in neuropathology. Omalu holds seven advanced degrees and board certifications,IFV 2013 Dr. Bennet Omalu on CTE and Brain Injuries - YouTube and later received fellowships in pathology and neuropathology through the University of Pittsburgh in 2000 and 2002 respectively, a master of public health (MPH) in epidemiology in 2004 from University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health, and a master of business administration (MBA) from Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University in 2008.\\"CV: Bennet Omalu\\", UC Davis Medical Center Omalu served as chief medical examiner of San Joaquin County, California from 2007 until he resigned in 2017 after accusing the county's sheriff, who doubles as coroner, of repeatedly interfering with death investigations to protect law enforcement officers who killed people. An assistant forensic pathologist who joined the office for the opportunity to work with Omalu resigned a few days earlier citing similar allegations. Omalu is a professor in the University of California, Davis Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. Research = CTE = Omalu's autopsy of former Pittsburgh Steelers player Mike Webster in 2002 led to the re-emergence of awareness of a neurologic condition associated with chronic head trauma called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, which had been previously described in boxersSabharwal RK, Sanchetee PC, Sethi PK, Dhamija RM. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy in boxers. J Assoc Physicians India. 1987 Aug;35(8):571-3. and other professional athletes. Webster had died suddenly and unexpectedly following years of struggling with cognitive and intellectual impairment, destitution, mood disorders, depression, drug abuse, and suicide attempts. Although Webster's brain looked normal at autopsy, Omalu conducted independent and self-financed tissue analyses. He suspected that Webster suffered from dementia pugilistica, which is a form of dementia that is induced by repeated blows to the head, a condition found previously in boxers. Using specialized staining, Omalu found large accumulations of tau protein in Webster's brain, which affect mood, emotions, and executive functions similar to the way that clumps of beta-amyloid protein contribute to Alzheimer's disease. Together with colleagues in the department of pathology at the University of Pittsburgh, Omalu published his findings in the journal Neurosurgery in 2005 in a paper entitled, \\"Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in a National Football League Player.\\" In it, Omalu called for further study of the disease: \\"We herein report the first documented case of long-term neurodegenerative changes in a retired professional NFL player consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This case draws attention to a disease that remains inadequately studied in the cohort of professional football players, with unknown true prevalence rates.\\" Omalu believed the National Football League (NFL) doctors would be \\"pleased\\" to read it and that his research could be used to \\"fix the problem.\\" The paper received little attention initially, but members of the NFL's mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) committee later called for its retraction in May 2006. Their letter requesting the retraction characterized Omalu's description of CTE as \\"completely wrong\\" and called the paper \\"a failure.\\" Omalu later partnered with Julian Bailes, a neurosurgeon, concussion researcher, and then chairman of the department of neurosurgery at West Virginia University School of Medicine, and West Virginia attorney Robert P. Fitzsimmons to fund the Brain Injury Research Institute which established a brain and tissue bank. In November 2006, Omalu published a second Neurosurgery paper based on his findings in the brain of former NFL player Terry Long, who suffered from depression, and died by suicide in 2005. Though Long died at 45, Omalu found tau protein concentrations more consistent with \\"a 90-year-old brain with advanced Alzheimer's.\\" As with Mike Webster, Omalu asserted that Long's football career had caused later brain damage and depression. Omalu also found evidence of CTE in the brains of retired NFL players Justin Strzelczyk (d. 2004 at 36 years old), Andre Waters (d. 2006 at 44), and Tom McHale (d. 2008 at 45). In summer 2007, Bailes presented his and Omalu's findings to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell at a league-wide concussion summit. Bailes later said that the research was \\"dismissed\\". The NFL's MTBI committee chair, Dr. Ira Casson, told the press: \\"In my opinion, the only scientifically valid evidence of a chronic encephalopathy in athletes is in boxers and in some Steeplechase jockeys.\\" The NFL did not publicly acknowledge the link between concussions sustained in football and long-term neurological effects until December 2009, seven years after Omalu's discovery. However, as late as 2013, the annual meeting of the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology (AACN) included a debate between two sports concussion experts regarding the validity (or existence) of CTE.\\"Sports concussions debate: Does CTE really exist?\\". Science Daily. Loyola University Health System. June 19, 2013. Finally, in March 2016, the NFL's senior vice president for health and safety policy, Jeff Miller, testified before congress that the NFL now believed that there was a link between football and CTE. In 2016, the American Medical Association awarded Omalu with their highest honor, the Distinguished Service Award, for his work on CTE. Omalu also discovered CTE in the brains of military veterans, publishing the first documented case in a November 2011 article. Omalu found evidence of CTE in a 27-year-old Iraq War veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and later died by suicide. Omalu's paper links PTSD to the CTE spectrum of diseases and calls for further study. Omalu is lead author in a study published in November 2017 that for the first time confirmed CTE in a living person. A chemical tracer, FDDNP, binds to tau proteins, detectable by positron emission tomography, and associated with the distinctive topographical distributions characteristic of CTE. Tested on at least a dozen former NFL players, it was confirmed postmortem in former linebacker Fred McNeill. Konstantine Kyros, an attorney who represented over 60 professional wrestlers in a class action lawsuit against WWE, claimed that Omalu posthumously diagnosed six wrestlers he represented with CTE. = Other = In March 2018 Omalu conducted an independent autopsy of Stephon Clark, who had been shot by Sacramento Police officers. On March 30, he released his findings, stating that Clark had been shot eight times from the back or side, adding, \\"You could reasonably conclude that he received seven gunshot wounds from his back.\\" In popular media = Concussion, book and film, and NFL controversy = Omalu's efforts to study and publicize CTE in the face of NFL opposition were reported in a GQ magazine article in 2009 by journalist Jeanne Marie Laskas. The article was later expanded by Laskas into a book, Concussion (Penguin Random House, 2015), and adapted into a drama film of the same name. In the film, Omalu, portrayed by Will Smith, is the central character. Although the film claims merely to be \\"based on real events\\", it has been criticized for inaccuracies.Engber, Daniel (December 21, 2015). \\"Concussion Lies: The film about the NFL's apparent CTE epidemic feeds the pervasive national myths about head trauma.\\". Slate.\\"'Concussion' Subject Bennet Omalu Exaggerated His Role, Researchers Say\\". CBS New York. December 17, 2015. Nevertheless, the movie's production led to the creation of a foundation named after Omalu to advance CTE and concussion research. A January 2020 article in The Washington Post contends that, Omalu \\"routinely exaggerates his accomplishments and dramatically overstates the known risks of CTE and contact sports, fueling misconceptions about the disease, according to interviews with more than 50 experts in neurodegenerative disease and brain injuries, and a review of more than 100 papers from peer-reviewed medical journals.\\" Further, \\"Omalu did not discover CTE, nor did he name the disease. The alarming statistics he recites about contact sports are distorted, according to the author of the studies that produced those figures. And while Omalu cultivates a reputation as the global authority on CTE, it‚Äôs unclear whether he is diagnosing it correctly, according to several experts on the disease.\\". On January 28, 2020 Omalu released a rebuttal titled \\"We are Becoming a Nation of Lies\\" to the Washington Post article by Will Hobson. He also responded with a statement, titled \\"Top 10 Lies Behind the Washington Post‚Äôs Personal Attack on Dr. Bennet Omalu\\" on his website. Omalu's book, Truth Doesn't Have a Side: My Alarming Discovery about the Danger of Contact Sports, was published in August 2017 by HarperCollins. He previously wrote, Play Hard, Die Young: Football Dementia, Depression, and Death, published in 2008. = Other = In September 2016, Omalu attracted media attention when he suggested on Twitter that Hillary Clinton was possibly poisoned and advised members of her presidential campaign to \\"perform toxicologic analysis of Ms. Clinton's blood.\\" He further tweeted, \\"I do not trust Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump. With those two, all things are possible.\\"  Personal life  Omalu is married to Prema Mutiso, originally from Kenya. They live in Elk Grove, California and have two children, Ashly and Mark. He is a practicing Catholic and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in February 2015.

It was one of the best-known units in the war, and it was active until a 2008 reorganization when it was merged into the Motorized Guard Brigade. Name Nicknamed The Spiders (), the brigade was named after one of its commanders, general Andrija Matija≈° Pauk, who was killed by in fighting with Army of Republika Srpska forces in Mrkonjiƒá Grad, Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 October 1995, during Operation Southern Move, the final action of the Croatian army in the war. The 4th Guards Brigade took his nickname for the unit soon after. Pauk means \\"spider\\" in Croatian. Formation The 4th Guards Brigade was founded on 28 April 1991 as part of the formation of a Croatian National Guard at the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence. At first, the brigade was composed of young policemen (130 of them) who had left the police to receive military training for special purposes in Kumrovec under the command of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. A majority of them were from Livno, Tomislavgrad, Kupres, ≈†iroki Brijeg, Trebi≈æat, Ljubu≈°ki, Stolac and Bugojno in Western Herzegovina and Central Bosnia. They arrived in Split on 30 May 1991 and settled in Hotel Split. From Hotel Split they moved their headquarters to Hotel Resnik in Resnik. There, the brigade's first battalion was founded, under the command of Gento Meƒëugorac, whose deputy was Ivan Zeliƒá. Within the battalion, a first company (named the \\"2nd Company\\") was formed from the first members of the brigade, under the command of Ilko Pavloviƒá, while the commander of the second company (named the \\"1st Company\\") was Jo≈°ko Macan. Soon afterwards, they received volunteers from Ka≈°tela and other places, which enabled the formation of a 3rd company commanded by Mario Udiljak. Part of the brigade went to Imotski to form and reinforce the 3rd battalion, part of them went to Vrlika and Sinj to form and reinforce the 2nd battalion, and the other part went to Metkoviƒá and Dubrovnik to form a unit in those two towns. The 2nd Company was, formally, without soldiers, who got an order to disband Yugoslav People's Army, form a unit and go to their first task in Kru≈°evo near Zadar. War The 4th Guards Brigade was one of the units which was not trained, so they gained their skills during the war. The slogan of the brigade was \\"In hoc signo vinces\\". Their first task was to liberate Kru≈°evo near Zadar which they did in July 1991. Soon, the brigade was involved in defence and liberation actions from Zadar, Sinj, Drni≈°, ≈†ibenik, Vodice until the liberation of Dubrovnik and region in Operations Tiger and Vla≈°tica. After the liberation of Dubrovnik and actions in the Southern Front, the unit was involved in Operation Maslenica which they finished successfully. After Operation Maslenica, the brigade was involved in Operation Winter '94, Operation Leap 1, Operation Leap 2, Operation Summer '95, Operation Storm and Operation Maestral. The 4th Guards Brigade was famous because it never lost a battle or position, so Croatian Defence Minister, Gojko ≈†u≈°ak stated that \\"the Croatian Army has 7 brigades in its composition, which are well-trained and well-armed, but only one brigade is a shock brigade, and that is 4th Guards Brigade.\\" During the Croatian War of Independence, 193 members of this brigade were killed, and their pictures were added to the memorial site in the Sveti kri≈æ chapel of the Draƒçevac barracks in Split. During its existence, the brigade changed number of commanders: general Ivo Jeliƒá, general Mirko ≈†undov and general Damir Krstiƒçeviƒá were war commanders, while peacetime commanders were brigadier Ante Kotromanoviƒá (present-day defence minister), brigadier Zvonko Asanoviƒá, brigadier Bla≈æ Beretin, and brigadier Mladen Fuzul. Reorganization Sign of the 2nd Motorized Battalion \\"Spiders\\" Following a reorganization of the Croatian Army, the 4th Brigade was downsized to battalion size becoming the 2nd Motorized Battalion \\"Spiders\\" of the Motorized Guard Brigade. The Motorized Guard Brigade is composed of several other units, the 1st Guards Brigade (the \\"Tigers\\"), the 2nd Guards Brigade (the \\"Thunders\\") and the 9th Guards Brigade (the \\"Wolves\\"), which have similarly been downsized. This was done to preserve unit histories and lineages rather than just disbanding the excess brigades. Veterans' association 16th anniversary of the Operation Storm in Knin Hajduk's fan club Torcida salutes to 4th Guard Brigade of Croatian Army War veterans of the 4th Guards Brigade founded the Association of Veterans' of the 4th Guards Brigade on 21 June 2007. They mark various anniversaries, organize veterans' meetings, professional teams for health relief, social and other difficulties for veterans. The President of the association is Bo≈æo Zadro.

History Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force was formed in 1951 with its area of responsibility covering the Germany south of the city of Kassel. Commander of Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force at its inception was the commanding Major General of the American Twelfth Air Force based in the southwest of Germany. After Twelfth Air Force returned to the continental United States in 1958, the commander of Seventeenth Air Force took over command of Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force. Headquarters 4 ATAF moved several times over more than forty years. Established about 1951 at Trier Air Base, the headquarters was moved to Ramstein Air Base in November 1957 where it remained until December 1980 when it was moved to Heidelberg where it was colocated with Headquarters Central Army Group. An operational Air Defence Operations Centre was operated at Ouvrage Molvange from 1961 until 1967 when it was moved to a USAF site in Kindsbach just south of Ramstein Air Base. The headquarters also operated a number of communications sites which were concerned with secure communications for the release of tactical nuclear weapons through the NATO Quick Reaction Alert Force. In 1985 NATO began with the construction of a new Static War Headquarters bunker in Ruppertsweiler, Germany. Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force commanded besides Seventeenth Air Force, the U.S. 32nd Army Air Defense Command, 1 Canadian Air Group and two German Air Force (Luftwaffe) divisions, as well as extensive secure communications, air defense and radar installations manned by Germany and the U.S. Air Force. If needed, 4 ATAF would have been reinforced with units from the US Third (UK based), Eighth (reconnaissance and bombing), Ninth (immediate reinforcements) and Twelfth Air Force (follow on reinforcements), and with Royal Canadian Air Force and French Air Force units. At the start of hostilities 4 ATAF would have had immediately around 600 combat aircraft at its disposal. The following units would have come under 4 ATAF in wartime: 4 ATAF was disbanded on 30 June 1993, its duties were taken over by Allied Air Forces Central Europe.

Luftwaffe styles of uniform and rank insignia had many unique features between 1935 and 1945. By Hitler's decision on February 26, 1935, the Luftwaffe was to be officially the third branch of the Wehrmacht as of March 1, 1935. The new Luftwaffe was faced with the problem of uniforms, as they wanted a uniform distinct from those of the other two branches of the Wehrmacht (Heer and Kriegsmarine) and also wanted a clear differentiation in dress of military and civilian flyers. The basic uniform consisted of a blue-grey single-breasted, open-collared jacket with four pockets and flaps, white shirt and black necktie, blue-grey trousers, black leather boots and a blue-grey peaked cap, side cap or Model 1935 Stahlhelm. Ranks were indicated by collar patches, along with Army-style shoulder boards. While on field service the jacket would often be worn 'collared up', Army-style, without shirt and tie. The flying suit typically consisted of a beige jumpsuit, leather flying helmet and thick fur-lined boots. Black leather jackets were also worn by fighter pilots. A popular item of clothing was the fliegerbluse, a blue-grey, single-breasted jacket without external buttons, intended to be worn in the confined space of an aircraft. WW2 German air force uniforms officers and enlisted men Illustration: \\"Handbook On German Military Forces\\" (US War Department, 1943) WW2 German Air force uniforms: miscellaneous Illustration: \\"Handbook On German Military Forces\\" (US War Department, 1943) As Reichsmarschall, Hermann G√∂ring had specialized uniforms and insignia. The collar patches featured crossed batons; the shoulder boards was similar to that of a Field Marshal, but with a Reichsadler clutching the batons. The Luftwaffe eagle insignia was different from the rest of the Wehrmacht: its wings curved upward and the swastika did not have a circle around it. Though the Luftwaffe had variety of field divisions besides Flak units, it was the Hermann G√∂ring Panzer Regiment ‚Äì later Division ‚Äì that was most unusual as the premier tank unit of the Luftwaffe. In late 1938 with the creation of the Panzersp√§hzug (armored reconnaissance platoon), the personnel of this company of the General G√∂ring Regiment have taken the design of the Army styled black panzer uniform, but with Luftwaffe insignia, shoulder boards and collar patches. A number of various uniforms evolved in cut and design which were designated to cover any occasion Luftwaffe personnel would encounter. Among these were: * Flying suit for flying personnel * Field Dress * Service Dress * Guard Uniform * Undress Uniform for officers and NCOs which lead (on duty) * Reporting Uniform * Parade Dress * Walking-Out Dress * Informal Full Dress (day) for officers * Formal Full Dress (day) for officers * Informal Full Dress (evening) for officers * Formal Full Dress (evening) for officers (m)Informal Full Dress for NCOs and men * Formal Full Dress for NCOs and men * Summer Uniform for officers * Sports kitRoger James Bender: \\"Air Organizations of the Third Reich-The Luftwaffe\\", 1972. R. James Bender Publishing Rank insignia  Luftwaffe headgear  =Paratrooper helmet= See article:Stahlhelm#Fallschirmj.C3.A4ger version Werner M√∂lders wears an Officer's M35 Flying Cap (Fliegerm√ºtze), also called (side cap) Fallschirmj√§ger in 1943/1944 The Luftwaffe introduced the Fallschirmj√§ger (Airborne and Glider borne troops) helmet in 1936. With its lighter weight and lack of helmet crimping, the Fallschirmj√§ger helmet was similar to the Model 1935 Stahlhelm but without a helmet edge. There was also more filling in the internal of the helmet to protect the head during airborne operations. The visor and ear guards were removed to enable the headgear to be more compact and thus avoiding much of the protrusive parts in air maneuvering. The necessity of a different strap assembly was provided to prevent the loss of the helmet in the air and also giving more safety to the chin and neck regions from jolts and pressures.Floyd R. Tubbs, \\"Stahlhelm, Evolution of the German Steel Helmet\\", Author Published, 1971 The second Fallschirmj√§ger Division that saw service in North Africa, used the standard paratrooper helmet with Luftwaffe decal insignia. All were painted an Africa Korps tan, by the parachute riggers and personal equipment men of each Regt. They brushed on two or three coats of standard paint that was used on trucks. In doing this they covered up the flying eagle insignia. The paint jobs ran from excellent to poor, depending on how rushed they were and the craft ability of the artist. =Flying helmets= The LKp S-101 Luftwaffe Flying Helmet made by Siemens for the Luftwaffe. The 101 model is similar to the leather 100 model and was improved with brownish-grey flecked material lined with grey-green satin. Oval fleece cushions are fitted inside the helmet, over the ears, with plastic inserts tucked inside. Goggle straps and chinstraps are made of leather. The hard rubber ear cups are covered with dark brown leather and feature the ridge for goggle retention. =Caps= Luftwaffe side cap (Fliegerm√ºtze) is made in blue-grey wool and comes with silver cord piping on top of the turn-up for officers. The Luftwaffe side cap or Feldm√ºtze comes with smaller version of Luftwaffe eagle and national cockade, while the Luftwaffe field cap (Einheitsfliegerm√ºtze) comes in blue-grey fabric with silver piping on the crown for officers without insignia. The Luftwaffe peak cap is made in dark blue-grey fabric with a black ribbed band and a black patent leather peak. The Luftwaffe peak cap crown and band edge are piped in silver with double silver cap-cords, it comes with silver bullion embroidered Luftwaffe eagle supported by two stylized wings with cockade in the center. Officers‚Äô uniform Hilmer Freiherr von B√ºlow wearing schirmm√ºtze and blue dress uniform with yellow collar litzen, and peaked cap Officers‚Äô uniforms had an embroidered Luftwaffe eagle over the wearer‚Äôs right breast pocket. Headgear saw further use of the aluminium coiled wire in the embroidered cockades, oak leaves, wings, chin cords and a smaller Luftwaffe eagle together with aluminium effect piping. Collars were edged in twisted aluminium cording and the four patch pocket tunics had aluminium pebbled buttons. =Service dress uniform= The Luftwaffe uniform Fliegerbluse is made in blue-grey wool and is hip length. All three models of Luftwaffe Fliegerbluse are fly-fronted with no visible buttons. The German Luftwaffe Tuchrock tunic has a falling collar with deep lapels and 5 buttons. The Luftwaffe uniform Tuchrock has four pleated pockets with square flaps. Luftwaffe uniform Waffenrock tunic is made in blue grey wool and closely matches the design of the Wehrmacht M 1935 tunic in construction. The Waffenrock tunic has 4 pleated pockets with pointed flaps and the lower two pockets on the skirt are pouch pockets. The officers' Luftwaffe uniform Waffenrock tunic has deep turn-back cuffs coming to the mid- forearm and a 5 button front. = Luftwaffe jackets = The Luftwaffe Leather Pilots‚Äô Jacket were made in black or dark brown very thin split cowhide. The jacket is waist length with zip front. It has two zip chest pockets and two pockets under the ribs with pointed flap closure. The jacket features and standard tailored collar. Luftwaffe produced greatcoats made from heavy blue- grey wool fabric. It is double-breasted, has two rows of six metal buttons and reaches to mid-calf. There is a cloth half-belt with two buttons in the rear of the waist, and a central rear vent hidden in an inverted pleat which reaches from the hem to the waist. It has two slanted slash pockets just below the wait with rounded flaps. Black Panzer jacket The Luftwaffe style black Panzer jacket was identical in style to that of the Army and was drawn from Army stocks. It was manufactured with black wool and was double-breasted, short waisted and with a large collar with pointed lapels. The wrap of the double-breasted front was nearly all the way across and then angled back down to the waist. The insignia consisted of the Luftwaffe national emblem, first on the blue-gray wool backing and later in a matching black backing. These were machine-woven or embroidered in white thread.  Luftwaffe officers‚Äô sword and dagger  Luftwaffe dress dagger, in the Fort Lewis Military Museum, Fort Lewis, Washington, USA. =Edged weapons= Luftwaffe Edged Weapons included 1st and 2nd Model daggers, Paratrooper Gravity knives, swords and bayonets. The Luftwaffe Officers‚Äô 2nd Pattern dagger made by Eickhorn, Solingen. The second model of Luftwaffe dagger was adopted for wear by officers and certain high-ranking NCOs in 1937. =Gravity knife \\"Fallschirmj√§ger-Messer\\"= The Paratrooper Gravity Knife is a knife with a blade contained in its handle, made by Paul Weysersberg, Solingen, and which opens its blade by the force of inertia or gravity. The main purpose of this opening method is that it allows opening and closing to be done one handed, in situations where the other hand is occupied. A major historical use has been in issue to parachutists to cut off their parachutes when tangled in a tree or similar. The gravity knife uses a button, trigger, or fulcrum lever to release the blade from both the open and the closed positions, and may use a side- folding or telescoping mechanism. While most military gravity knives utilize a locking blade design, other types may not mechanically lock open but rely instead upon friction to wedge the rear section of the blade against the interior of the handle. Factory-made gravity knives have various types of buttons, triggers, and fulcrum levers, which usually are used to release the blade from both the open and the closed positions.LUFTWAFFE GRAVITY KNIVES\\", \\"Der Haren Kreuz\\" c. 1968 Luftwaffe pilot wristwatches The use of wristwatches by Luftwaffe pilots became very widespread as accurate timings were required to assist them in their mission. The Hanhart Chronograph was a one-button watch made by Swiss-German manufacturer Hanhart. The one-button version was a simplified design that first appeared in 1942 and was the version worn by the Luftwaffe's aces like Major Erich Hartmann. The watch is a 17-jewel mechanical movement and only 2500 units were produced. The Tutima Flieger Chronograph watch was a high quality chronograph wrist watch that was developed in 1939. However it was not until 1941 that the watch was available for sale either individually to pilots or to the German Air Ministry, and then supplied to the German Luftwaffe. The Lange und S√∂hne Luftwaffe Observers‚Äô Watch was used in aircraft which required a highly reliable and easily readable timepiece. From approximately 1941, a standardised design was manufactured. These watches were very large even by today‚Äôs standard. A large navigation mechanical watch, the Laco Aviator for German Pilots was used in military Luftwaffe Pilots. The hours markers and watch hands are fluorescent. The Reichs Air Ministry recognized the need for an efficient observer watch ‚Äì \\"Beobachtungsuhr\\" in German, also shortened B-Uhren or B-Uhr ‚Äì to be used by the aircraft navigator, assisting crews of long range bombing missions. Observers‚Äô Watches were also worn by the pilots who needed wrist watches that could be accurately and instantly read when both hands were used to pilot the aircraft. This design was given the Reichsluftfahrtministerium classification number FL 23883 (RLM FL 23883). This number appeared on all Luftwaffe watches of this design. Laco also produced a compass which would have been worn by the pilot on his other arm. Battalion commander of the Fallschirmj√§ger, Walter Gericke wears Camouflage Jacket, M1942 Fallschirmj√§ger The Luftwaffe produced a camouflage jacket as a consequence of the heavy casualties inflicted on German armed forces in Russia. As the Luftwaffe Fallschirmj√§ger jump smock was too overpriced to produce in the quantities required, a simplified camouflage over-jacket was put into production and became the signature of the Luftwaffe infantry. When made, the only insignia printed to the jacket was the standard Luftwaffe eagle and swastika emblem, on the other hand, rank insignia, in the form of conventional epaulettes, was added and even some metal combat awards and cuff titles are known to have been worn. Luftwaffe Field Divisions were deployed in the East, Italy and the Western Front. It's a three-quarter length lightweight single-breasted camouflage jacket with stand and fall collar and two flapped lower pockets. =Knochensack= Fallschirmj√§ger (Wehrmacht) German Parachutist; German Soldier\\". Knochensack (bonesack) was the nickname for German parachute jump smocks designed to be worn over a paratrooper's equipment made for the Luftwaffe Fallschirmj√§ger during World War II. They were made in a variety of camouflage patterns and from tough cotton material. There were several models in use in 1936, when the German paratroops were still part of the German army. The first pattern used by the German air force (in 1938) was manufactured in a plain green pattern. The cotton fabric used was a mix of green fibres with a few orange fibres intermixed. It had a front zipper opening but did not open fully, and had to be stepped into much like coveralls. The use of zippers in (military) dress was still something of a novelty. The earlier models had no pockets. Over time first one, two, and then four pockets were added, with some having a flare pistol holster at the rear. By 1943/1944 the Knochensack was modified to include a fully opening front and no longer had to be stepped into. After ca. 1942 the fabric used was camouflage-printed. The German Knochensack formed the basis for the British paratroop jacket that was developed into the Denison smock and the jump smock used by the USMC Parachute Battalions in the Pacific Theater. Luftwaffe Medical Corps The Medical Branch of the Luftwaffe was one of the original career fields present when the Luftwaffe came out into the open in March 1935. The standard Waffenfarbe for the Luftwaffe Medical branch was cornflower blue. When attached to the Hermann G√∂ring Division and the Luftwaffe Field Division, the solid blue collar tabs and shoulder boards were to be retained. Luftwaffe uniforms in the Afrikakorps The cuff title was introduced on March 6, 1942 and was carried by units or formations the Luftwaffe that were stationed in Africa. It was carried 16 cm above the end of the right sleeve.

Coleman overcame challenging life conditions after being enrolled in youth wrestling classes. As a high school senior for Oak Park and River Forest High School finished third in the state wrestling championships. On several occasions, Coleman executed a takedown by jumping over his opponent and grabbing him as he flew over his back. Coleman is sometimes referred to as the Flying Squirrel for this takedown move that he has made famous. Background Coleman was raised by his single mother, Yolanda Barral, in Chicago, Illinois. Coleman describes his biological father, Lewellis Coleman, as a person who was \\"in and out of jail [his] whole life.\\" Apart from visiting him in jail, the only memory he has of his father is the time his father sold all the family's televisions and the PlayStation for drugs. Federal records describe his biological father as a \\"career offender\\" with 19 aliases. His mother raised the family, including Coleman's brother (Lillashawn) and sister, in the Humboldt Park community area, then the West Side and finally Oak Park. Coleman describes his stepfather as a long-time gang member with an extensive criminal record. After enduring formative years with gunfights outside elementary school, home loss due to an apartment fire, and expulsion hearings, his stepfather, Mose Oliver, introduced him to wrestling to keep him out of trouble. Federal records confirm that Oliver is an alleged 1990's gang enforcer who served time from 2004 to 2011 for participation in Operation Day Trader. The wrestling started in about 2001. By sixth grade both his father and stepfather were incarcerated and his father figure was his wrestling coach, Mike Powell. Coleman attended Ella Flagg Young elementary school. Barral raised her family with little assistance away from the gang influences of the West Side. She applied for section 8 assistance. Coleman, who was nearly expelled as a sophomore, graduated from Oak Park and River Forest High School in Oak Park, IL in 2009. He has studied at Northern Michigan University. Wrestling career As a high school senior at the 2009 Illinois High School Association Class 3A tournament, Coleman endured his only loss of the season to Maxamillian Schneider of Lane Technical College Prep High School to finish third and end the season with a 49-1 record. Following the loss, his heart rate reached 225, necessitating treatment by paramedics. In 2011, a video of Coleman was posted to YouTube. Subsequently, Coleman gained a cult- following for the recording of him performing a move at the 2011 World Junior Championships that he calls \\"The Flying Squirrel\\", which involves somersaulting over his opponent just before his takedown. He has performed the move at the 2009 Sunkist Open against Joe Betterman. He also performed the move against Iran's Mehdi Zidvand at the 2011 World Junior Championships. Coleman claims he has used the \\"Flying Squirrel\\" move over a dozen times in competition. The move was ranked third on the ESPN 2011 Best of the Best Highlights. He appeared on ESPN's morning shows, such as ESPN First Take. The move made him so famous that he received lucrative offers to begin a professional wrestling career, but he declined in favor of continuing his Olympic dream. Coleman credits his brother for the move. Ellis is a five-time Greco-Roman US Open champion in (2013, 2016-2019) winning the Outstanding Wrestler Award in 2013. Ellis defeated Betterman 2 to 0 at the finals of the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials. Coleman had attended Betterman's wrestling clinics when he was younger. Coleman is the youngest member of the American wrestling delegation going to the Olympics. After Coleman qualified for the Olympics, he realized that his mother, who works in customer service for the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, could not afford to attend due to financial hardship. Coleman was living at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs on a limited monthly stipend from the United States Olympic Committee and could not assist her. Powell rented Coleman's family a one-bedroom flat in London out of personal funds and the Oak Park High School wrestling program subsequently raised $14,000 to ensure that his mother, aunt and siblings could attend. Coleman dropped from the 66 kg division to the 60 kg division for the Olympics. Coleman lost in the first round of Olympic competition to Ivo Angelov of Bulgaria by a 3-1 score. 2012 Olympic American gymnast Gabby Douglas also became known for the nickname \\"Flying Squirrel\\". In an attempt to solidify his nickname while training in Colorado Springs, Coleman purchased a pet flying squirrel that he keeps in a cage and feeds apples. His Twitter handle is @daFlyinSquirrel.

He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand under the ring name Shorty G (shortened from his former ring name Shorty Gable, and before that, Chad Gable). A prolific amateur wrestler who competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Betts signed with WWE in late 2013 and underwent training before he was deployed to developmental branch NXT. A tag team specialist, he won the NXT Tag Team Championship with his partner Jason Jordan as American Alpha, before being called up to the main roster in 2016, where the two won the SmackDown Tag Team Championship before disbanding in mid-2017. He formed a tag team with Shelton Benjamin before being traded to Raw in the 2018 Superstar Shake-up and subsequently forming a team with Bobby Roode, winning the Raw Tag Team Championship with him in December 2018. With this, Gable became the second man (after his former tag team partner Jason Jordan) to hold the NXT, Raw, and SmackDown Tag Team Championships.  Early life  Charles Betts was born in Saint Michael, Minnesota. He is a graduate of Northern Michigan University.  Amateur wrestling career  Betts was a Minnesota high school state champion. (2004) He defeated Jordan Holm 2 to 0 in the final of the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials in the 84 kg category. He progressed to the 2012 Summer Olympics, where he competed in the Greco-Roman style 84kg event. He defeated Keitani Graham from the Federated States of Micronesia in the qualification round. He was eliminated from the competition in the next round by Pablo Shorey of Cuba, losing 3‚Äì0.  Professional wrestling career  = WWE =  Training (2013‚Äì2015)  In November 2013, Betts signed a contract with the professional wrestling promotion WWE. He was assigned to the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida and adopted the ring name Chad Gable (a nod to Olympian Dan Gable). He made his in-ring debut at a NXT house show in Cocoa Beach, Florida on September 5, 2014, defeating Troy McClain. He made his television debut on the January 8, 2015 episode of NXT, losing to Tyler Breeze.  American Alpha (2015‚Äì2017)  Gable (left) with Jason Jordan in 2015 Starting in May 2015, NXT newcomer Chad Gable began a storyline with Jason Jordan, in which he tried to convince Jordan to form a new partnership, following the dissolution of Jordan's team with Tye Dillinger. After nearly two months of coaxing, Jordan finally agreed to a tag team match with Gable as his teammate. On the July 15 episode of NXT, Jordan and Gable were successful in their official debut together against the team of Elias Samson and Steve Cutler. On September 2, Jordan and Gable competed in the first round of the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic tournament, beating the team of Neville and Solomon Crowe. After defeating the Hype Bros, they would get eliminated from the tournament by the team of Baron Corbin and Rhyno. Originally villains, the duo turned into fan favorites even in defeat, when they showed fighting spirit and resiliency throughout the match. At NXT TakeOver: London, Gable and Jordan were successful in a fatal four-way tag team match which was taped for the December 23 episode of NXT. On the January 8 tapings of NXT, the team of Jordan and Gable began using the name American Alpha. American Alpha after winning the NXT Tag Team Championship at the NXT TakeOver: Dallas event in April 2016 American Alpha faced off with the Vaudevillains on the March 16 episode of NXT in a number one contender's match where they emerged victorious, earning them an NXT Tag Team Championship match against Dash and Dawson, now called \\"The Revival\\", at NXT TakeOver: Dallas. The pair won the NXT Tag Team Championship at the event. On June 8 at NXT TakeOver: The End, American Alpha lost the titles back to The Revival, ending their reign at 68 days. After the match, they were assaulted by the debuting Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar), who were managed by the legendary manager, Paul Ellering. The pair subsequently failed to win back the NXT Tag Team Championship after being defeated by the Revival in a two out of three falls match on the July 6 episode of NXT, before wrestling their final match on the brand on July 20, where they were defeated by The Authors of Pain. As a result of the 2016 WWE draft on July 19, the team was drafted to the SmackDown brand, being their first tag team pick overall. On the August 2 episode of SmackDown, American Alpha made their debut, defeating The Vaudevillains. The pair teamed with The Usos and The Hype Bros at SummerSlam to defeat the team of The Ascension, Breezango and The Vaudevillains. The pair then entered an eight-tag team tournament which would determine the inaugural SmackDown Tag Team Champions, defeating Breezango in the first round to advance to the semi-finals where they faced The Usos. Despite defeating The Usos quickly on the September 6 episode of SmackDown, Gable's knee was kayfabe injured during a post-match assault when the Usos turned heel, rendering American Alpha unable to compete at Backlash and undoing their attempts to become the inaugural champions. They returned on the September 20 episode to face the Usos in a number one contender's match to establish who would face inaugural Smackdown Tag Team Champions Heath Slater and Rhyno at No Mercy, where they were defeated due to Gable's injury, marking their first loss on the main roster. At the event, they would instead team with the Hype Bros to face the Ascension and the Vaudevillians where they were successful. On the November 1 episode of SmackDown, American Alpha defeated The Spirit Squad to qualify for Team SmackDown for the 10‚Äìon‚Äì10 Survivor Series tag team elimination match at Survivor Series. Team SmackDown was defeated by Team Raw at the event, with American Alpha being eliminated by Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson after eliminating The Shining Stars. On the December 27 episode of SmackDown Live, they defeated Randy Orton and Luke Harper of The Wyatt Family, Heath Slater and Rhyno, and The Usos in a four corners elimination match to become the new SmackDown Tag Team Champions, celebrating with their families afterward. After defeating The Wyatt Family (Orton and Harper) in a rematch to retain their titles on January 10, the pair would go on to defend their titles in a tag team turmoil match at Elimination Chamber successfully against The Ascension, Usos, Vaudevillians, Breezango and Heath Slater & Rhyno, entering fourth and eliminating the Usos and Ascension, despite an attack by the Usos after their elimination, continuing their feud. On the March 21 episode of SmackDown Live, American Alpha lost the SmackDown Tag Team Championships to The Usos after suffering a non-title match loss to the pair the prior week. After making their Wrestlemania debut at WrestleMania 33 where both were unsuccessful in winning the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal they failed in their championship rematch to the Usos, being attacked by Primo and Epico afterward, who defeated them the following week. On the June 20 episode of SmackDown, Chad Gable answered the United States Championship Open Challenge put forward by champion Kevin Owens where he was ultimately unsuccessful. In a July interview, Gable spoke about going solo, citing his will to fight against top competition. On the July 17 episode of Raw, Jason Jordan was moved to the Raw brand. This effectively disbanded the team.  Tag team specialist (2017‚Äì2019)  On the August 22 episode of SmackDown Live, General Manager Daniel Bryan announced that he had signed a returning Shelton Benjamin to team up with Gable, therefore creating a tag-team between the two. The following week on SmackDown Live, Gable and Benjamin picked up a win over The Ascension in their first match as a tag team; this was also Benjamin's first WWE match since 2010. On the September 12 episode of SmackDown Live, Benjamin and Gable would defeat The Hype Bros, before defeating them again in a rematch at Hell in a Cell. On the October 10 episode of SmackDown Live, Benjamin and Gable would defeat The Hype Bros, The Ascension and Breezango in a fatal four-way match to become the number one contenders for The Usos' SmackDown Tag Team Championship. On the November 7 episode of SmackDown Live, they received their title opportunity and won the match by count-out, however, the Usos retained their championships. After trading victories with The Usos the following weeks, they competed in a fatal four-way match for the SmackDown Tag Team Championships against defending champions The Usos, The New Day, and the team of Rusev and Aiden English at Clash of Champions, but failed to win the titles. Two days later on SmackDown Live, Gable and Benjamin defeated The Usos in a non-title match. They had quietly turned heel during the period of time where they had been challenging The Usos for the Smackdown Live Tag Team Championships by showing more villainous tactics. On the January 2, 2018 episode of SmackDown Live, they defeated The New Day and Rusev and English in a triple threat match to earn another shot at the SmackDown Tag Team titles, which they lost the following week after pinning the wrong twin for the apparent victory and then losing the impromptu rematch. The following week on SmackDown Live, the duo confirmed their heel turn when they insulted the referee of their title match the week before, demoralized the fans, and accused General Manager Daniel Bryan of being biased, which resulted in Bryan booking them for a two out of three falls match against The Usos at Royal Rumble, where they lost in two straight falls. That following week, Gable and Benjamin interrupted an episode of Fashion Files, and traded insults with Breezango (Tyler Breeze and Fandango), challenging them to a match, Gable and Benjamin would eventually win the match. The next week, Gable and Benjamin mocked The New Day and faced them in a losing effort. On March 27 episode of SmackDown Live, he accompanied Benjamin to a match against Shinsuke Nakamura in a losing effort, after which they attacked WWE Champion AJ Styles before being fought off by Nakamura. On April 16, Gable was moved to Raw as part of the 2018 WWE Superstar Shake-Up, thus disbanding with Benjamin. On the April 23 episode of Raw, Gable turned face after he took offense at Jinder Mahal insulting Raw General Manager Kurt Angle. Gable would defeat Mahal on his first match on the brand. On the September 3 episode of Raw, Gable formed a tag team with Bobby Roode and went on to defeat The Ascension. At Survivor Series, they would become captains for Team Raw, but lost to Team SmackDown in the 10-on-10 Survivor Series tag team elimination match. During this time, Gable changed his attire to trunks and began wearing a robe in his entrance, mirroring Roode's look. On the December 10 episode of Raw, Gable and Roode defeated AOP (Akam and Rezar) and their manager Drake Maverick in a three-on- two handicap to capture the Raw Tag Team Championship. With the win, Gable became the second man (after his former partner Jason Jordan) to have won the NXT, SmackDown, and Raw Tag Team Championships. At the Royal Rumble kick-off show, Gable and Roode defeated Rezar and Scott Dawson in a non-title match. The match stipulation stated that if Rezar and Dawson were to win, their respective teams (AOP and The Revival) would both receive tag team championship matches. The Revival would eventually receive their title match on the February 11 episode of Raw, in which Gable and Roode lost the championship. Gable and Roode failed to regain the championship from The Revival in a triple threat tag-team match also involving Ricochet and Aleister Black at Fastlane on March 11. On the Raw episode following WrestleMania 35, after losing a tag team match to Black and Ricochet, Roode and Gable began wrestling as heels until their eventual split by the Superstar Shakeup of 2019.  Shorty G (2019‚Äìpresent)  During the 2019 WWE Superstar Shake- up, Gable was drafted to SmackDown. Roode remained on Raw, effectively ending the team. Gable made a surprise appearance on the June 11 episode of 205 Live as a fan favorite, sporting a shorter haircut and trunks (as opposed to a singlet). He defeated Gentleman Jack Gallagher by count-out. The two had a rematch on the July 16 episode of 205 Live, where Gable emerged victorious. In August, Gable was announced as one of sixteen competitors in the King of the Ring. On the August 27 episode of SmackDown Live, Gable defeated Shelton Benjamin in the first round of the tournament. Gable would eventually make it to the finals, defeating Andrade in the quarterfinals and Shane McMahon, who was a replacement for an injured Elias, in the semifinals. Gable was then set to face Baron Corbin in the finals on the September 16 episode of Raw, but was ultimately defeated. At Hell in a Cell, Gable defeated King Corbin, with the announcer announcing him as \\"Shorty Gable\\" (upon Corbin's request making fun of his height), which officially became his ring name. On the October 18 episode of SmackDown, Gable would shorten his name to \\"Shorty G\\". At the Crown Jewel event, Shorty G competed in a ten-man tag team match as a part of Team Hogan, coming out victorious against Team Flair. At Survivor Series, Shorty G competed as a part of Team SmackDown, and was eliminated by Kevin Owens. However his team won the match. After this event, Shorty G continued to wrestle in the tag team division with Mustafa Ali as his partner. On 3 January 2020 episode of SmackDown, Sheamus returned from injury, appearing to save Shorty G from an attack by The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson), but then delivered a Brogue Kick to him. Sheamus then defeated Shorty G at Royal Rumble and on 31 January episode of SmackDown. After three months away from television, Shorty G made his return on the May 29 episode of SmackDown in a 10-man battle royal for a spot in the Intercontinental Championship tournament but was eliminated by Cesaro. Later on in the night, Shorty G defeated Cesaro. On the July 31 episode of SmackDown, Shorty G turned heel by attacking Matt Riddle and aligning himself with King Corbin. Personal life Betts married Kristi Oliver, who he had been dating for nine years, on June 19, 2011. The couple have three children together. Other media As Chad Gable, he made his video game debut as a playable character in WWE 2K17 and has since appeared in WWE 2K18, WWE 2K19, and WWE 2K20.

Within the film universe, the character is an alias taken on by other characters who participate in the titular race. The character has been played by David Carradine, Jason Statham, Luke Goss, Dougray Scott, Manu Bennett, and Velislav Pavlov. Character biography =Death Race 2000 (1975)= In the original 1975 film, Frankenstein is portrayed as the reigning champion of the Transcontinental Road Race, an annual gladiator-style cross- country race. A symbol of the ruling totalitarian government, he is a feared racer who is purported to be half-man, half-machine. In reality, it turns out that there have been several Frankensteins over the years ‚Äì each one recruited by the government to replace their injured or killed predecessors. In this way, with each man donning the same alias and disguise, Frankenstein seems to be an unkillable opponent who survives any crash or injury. The current Frankenstein (David Carradine) is disillusioned with the government, as well as the race, and he plans to assassinate the tyrannical Mr. President (Sandy McCallum). Although his plans to win the race and destroy the government are nearly ruined by the actions of a Resistance movement, he eventually succeeds in both winning the race and killing Mr. President. He then assumes the office of President himself and puts an end to the race. =Death Race (2008)= In the 2008 remake of the 1975 film, ex-race driver Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is imprisoned on Terminal Island after he is framed for his wife's murder. Terminal Island is home to a televised gladiator-style race called the Death Race, and Ames soon finds himself forced to race by the tyrannical Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen). Ames must assume the mantle of Frankenstein, the current leading racer, whose appearance is covered by a mask. The previous Frankenstein was killed in a fiery crash, though the prison population believes he has simply spent the last six months recovering in the infirmary. The previous Frankenstein had already won four out of five races necessary to secure freedom, requiring Ames to only win one more race. Hennessey explains that Frankenstein is the most popular racer in the history of the race, and ratings would take a sharp hit if his death were announced. Ames soon learns that Hennessey was behind his wife's murder, using Ulrich (Jason Clarke), the lead guard, and Pachenko (Max Ryan), a fellow racer. Ames decides to win the Death Race and use it as a means of revenge. With only his pit crew knowing the truth about Frankenstein, Ames goes on to uncover what happened to his predecessor, kills Pachenko during the race, and ultimately succeeds in using the race to escape, along with his chief rival, Machine-Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson). Afterwards, Coach (Ian McShane), a member of his pit crew, detonates a bomb in Hennessey's office, killing both her and Ulrich. It is unknown if the Frankenstein mantle was resurrected by the next warden. =Death Race 2 (2010)= The first prequel to the 2008 film reveals the origins of Frankenstein. Getaway driver Carl \\"Luke\\" Lucas (Luke Goss) is captured after a bank robbery gone bad, in which he was to protect the nephew of crime boss Markus Kane (Sean Bean). Although loyal and refusing to cooperate with the authorities, Lucas is marked for death by Kane because he knows too much. He is sent to Terminal Island and recruited to compete in the Death Match, a brutal gladiator-style show, ostensibly run by the aging warden but, in reality, controlled by producer September Jones (Lauren Cohan). His fight results in a large-scale prison riot and ultimately spells the end of the controversial show. The Death Match is replaced by the Death Race, a gladiatorial race that uses custom cars and unused space along the island's outer edges. The prize for winning five races is freedom. Lucas initially does well, but is targeted by the other drivers due to the bounty on his head. When he saves the life of fellow driver 14K (Robin Shou), 14K pays back this favor by killing Kane. Ultimately, Lucas is driven off the track and ends up in a seemingly fatal crash. However, he returns under a new identity created by Jones, Frankenstein, a horribly scarred racer who wears a mask. However, at the start of his next race, he rams and kills Jones, to the pleasure of her many enemies. =Death Race 3: Inferno (2013)= In the second prequel, a direct bridge to the 2008 film, Lucas' (Luke Goss) appearance is restored with reconstructive surgery, but he still does not reveal his identity to his pit crew. However, they discover that Lucas is Frankenstein after his mask is knocked off during a brawl at Kalahari Prison in South Africa, where Lucas and his crew are sent to compete in the first International Death Race. The new race is the brainchild of British billionaire Niles York (Dougray Scott). Because Lucas has won four of the five races required for his freedom, York demands that he throw the final race or face death. At the end of the race, Lucas crashes his car into the operations center, where York has been handcuffed to a table by his producer, incensed by York firing and replacing her. York is horribly burned in the fiery crash, and the world at large is then led to believe that York is the survived Frankenstein, despite his protestations. Lucas and his crew stage their deaths and escape, while the disfigured York, resigned to the fact that everyone believes that he is Frankenstein, adopts the mantle. The film ends with York, now using an American accent (strongly implying that it is he who is the Frankenstein killed at the start of the 2008 film), stating in voiceover, \\"I am Frankenstein. And I will have my revenge.\\" =Death Race: Beyond Anarchy (2018)= In the first sequel of the remake series, a new Frankenstein (played by Bulgarian actor Velislav Pavlov and voiced by Nolan North) has become the ruler of a prison colony called the Sprawl and has won seven races, despite the race now being illegal. Weyland International had tried to have Frankenstein killed several times, all without success. Frankenstein takes an interest in newly-arrived prisoner Connor (Zach McGowan) when the man not only beats up several of Frankenstein's henchmen, but also shows no fear or respect towards him when he confronts him personally. After observing Connor win a qualifying match in the Death Pit by gruesomely defeating his henchman the Butcher, Frankenstein has Connor brought to him and tells him that if he wins the Death Race, he will become king of the Sprawl, and asks if he is ready for that responsibility. The next day, Frankenstein discovers that Connor is actually Sergeant Connor Gibson, a soldier sent by Weyland International with the purpose of killing him. He outs Connor in front of the prison populace and declares that Connor will be allowed to take part in the Death Race, earning Connor much hate from the populace. At the starting line of the Death Race, Frankenstein reveals to Connor that he has made Jane (Christine Marzano), the prison bartender who has become Connor's love interest, his new co-pilot as an \\"insurance policy\\" against Connor. Throughout the Death Race, competitors are taken out one by one until at the final stretch, when Connor finally catches up to Frankenstein, Connor runs out of gas. Despite pleading from Jane, Frankenstein chooses to run Connor down with his car when he is suddenly T-boned by the other remaining runner-up, Gypsy Rose (Yennis Cheung), who shoots him dead, revealing herself to also be a soldier sent by Weyland International. In the aftermath, Connor is convinced by Sprawl resident Baltimore Bob (Danny Glover) to take up the mantle and become the new Frankenstein, which he does.

After The Free Network folded in March 2005, Vi was purchased by wireless Internet developer Ryan Blair with investment from Ropart Asset Management, a private equity firm owned by Robert B. Goergen. Sarnicola and Mallen were retained as sales chief and CMO, respectively. The company was moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. The 2008 recession put Vi near bankruptcy, with the business $6 million in debt. In 2008, Vi was acquired by Blyth, Inc., a multi-level marketing company that sells home decor which had been founded by Georgen. In the first stage of the takeover ‚Äì completed in 2008 ‚Äì Blyth purchased a 43.6% equity interest for $14.0 million. By 2010 the company had returned to profitability, and Vi was making over $15 million a month. Blyth completed the second phase of the takeover in 2011, investing an additional $2.5 million and increasing their ownership share to 57.5%. In August 2012, Blyth ‚Äì which then owned a 73% share of Vi ‚Äì planned to spin off the company in an initial public offering of shares worth up to $175 million. In September 2012, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Blyth's credit from \\"stable\\" to \\"negative,\\" Vi reported extremely high growth rates in 2012, being audited at 450%, which made it one of the fastest growing companies of its size. Blyth stated that the company's growth was not properly valued. Blyth withdrew the Vi IPO citing uncertain market conditions. According to the Detroit Free Press, one reason why the Vi IPO was cancelled was because the co-founders were artificially inflating sales numbers: \\"Vi has been criticized for allegedly puffing up its record sales in 2012 by recruiting top product distributors in the industry. Like mercenaries, these distributors were purportedly willing to switch company affiliation for a price, and after Vi peaked, they jumped to another direct sales company. Such a practice would be legal.\\" In September 2014, Vi announced that it had become a private, independent company. Vi arranged a transaction with Blyth to convert the company's stock to common stock, although Blyth remains an equity holder with 10% of Vi's stock. The transaction eliminated Blyth's obligation to pay the co-founders $143.2 million as part of the 2008 acquisition. At the time of the transaction, Vi' earnings and revenue had declined from a high- point in 2012, and the company had been operating at a loss for 2013 and the first two quarters of 2014. After becoming private, Vi stopped reporting sales figures. According to the Detroit Free Press, Vi was at a high of 114,000 distributors in the summer of 2012. According to a report in Crain's Detroit Business, Vi had 76,000 distributors in June 2013, which declined to 31,800 distributors in September 2014. The article also reported that Sarnicola is the largest distributor in Vi, with his distributor team accounting for 74% of company revenue. In 2016 the company laid-off 87 workers at its Troy facility, following years of declining sales and legal problems. Controversies =Racketeering= In October 2013, charges were filed in US Federal Court that Nick Sarnicola and Blake Mallen on behalf of Vi committed Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) violations, engaged 3rd party individuals to commit criminal acts, extortion and other violations against Fred Ninow & Ken Dunn of Ocean Avenue. In the lawsuit, Ocean Avenue, a competing direct selling nutrition company, accused Vi officials of hiring two private investigators in California, Nathan Moser and Peter Siragusa, who in turn contracted with computer experts to illegally hack into the files of Ocean Avenue, and former Vi distributors who switched to Ocean Avenue in late 2012. Vi denied the allegations. In July 2015 the two private investigators pleaded guilty to the charges, which are Federal offenses with sentences of one to three years. Vi' security director Carlo Pacileo was convicted and sentenced to three years' probation. =Pyramid scheme= In 2012, CNBC Commentator Herb Greenberg said Vi walks \\"a controversial line between legal direct selling and pyramid scheme.\\" Vi was investigated by the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation which published a detailed report that assailed the company's business model and high probability that investors will lose their money in the scheme.National Council Against Health Fraud, Consumer Health Digest #13-10, March 7, 2013 In April 2016, a class action suit was filed against Vi, Robert Goergen, Sr., Todd Goergen, Nick Sarnicola, Blake Mallen and Ryan Blair in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan alleging racketeering and fraudulent pyramid scheme selling of distribution rights. =Robocalls= In April 2019, a jury awarded a plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit $925 million against ViSalus for making millions of robocalls, which was upheld by a federal judge in 2020. Products Weight-management products, including Vi-Shape meal replacement shake, Vi Go Instant Energy and Vi-Trim Clear Control Drink Mix, form the bulk of the company's sales. Other products include Neuro, an energy drink, and Vi- Pak, an energy supplement, which were both developed by Michael Siedman, an ear, nose, and throat specialist. Vi promotes its products with the Body by Vi Challenge, a program where people set weight-loss and physical fitness goals to be achieved over a 90-day period.  Locations  Vi's products are now available in 16 countries including USA, UK, Italy and Canada. In 2013, Vi launched in the United Kingdom. On February 18, 2014, Vi announced its expansion to Germany and Austria.

It was initially called the Commercial Company of the city of Middelburg. However, after the archive industry was published in 1950, it became known as the Middelburg Commercial Company. After the monopoly of the Dutch West India Company for the Atlantic slave trade was abolished in 1730, the MCC became the principal Dutch slave trading company. The company was eventually liquidated in 1889. Thanks to the well-preserved notes and documents of the company, the MCC archives have proved very useful to scholars in understanding and reconstructing Dutch 18th-century slave trade. The archive was listed in 2011 in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register. Moreover, access to many materials can be found in the Zeeuwse Archief in Middelburg.

Background  With Reinhard I the closed genealogy of the Lords and Counts of Hanau begins. He belongs to a family that was initially named after their ancestral Dorfelden Castle. They were first mentioned in a document in 1166/1168. From 1191, the family styled itself \\"Lords of Hanau\\". Their relationship, if any, with the earlier Lords of Buchen or the Lords of Dorfelden who ruled in the Hanau area before 1166, is not entirely clear.  Life  Reinhard I was probably the son of Reinhard II of Dorfelden. Around 1243, he succeeded his uncle Henry II of Dorfelden as Lord, and reunited the possessions of his family in a single hand. In 1260 Reinhard I accompanied his cousin Werner of Eppstein to Rome (\\"defying great hardships and dangers\\"), where Werner was consecrated as Prince-Archbishop of Mainz. As a reward, he received the post of Burgmann of Aschaffenburg, which was a completed fief after the death of Cornrad of Dornburg. { style=\\"float:right; background: transparent; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  Coat of arms of the Counts of Rieneck in 1450-1480, according to Scheibler's Armorial  Coat of arms of the Lords and Counts of Hanau, according to Scheibler's Armorial } He actively participated in the politics of the noble houses surrounding him. In 1260, he was involved in a feud in the Spessart area. In 1265, a Public Peace was concluded by Reinhard I, the House of Hesse and other nobles in the Wetterau area. In a dispute between the Archbishopric of Mainz and the counts of Rieneck about power in the western Spessart, he stood on the side of the archbishop. This conflict lasted until 1271 and was finally won by Werner of Eppstein, who was still archbishop of Mainz. As part of the settlement, Elisabeth, the daughter of Count Louis III of Rienck, married below her station, to Reinhard I's son Ulrich I, bringing a rich dowry, which included the town of Steinau an der Stra√üe.Theodor Ruf: Hanau und Rieneck. √úber das wechselhafte Verh√§ltnis zweier benachbarter Adelsgeschlechter im Mittelalter, in: Neues Magazin f√ºr Hanauische Geschichte, vol. 8 issue 6, p. 300-311, esp. 304 The Lords of Hanau, proud of gaining in status, created a coat of arms resembling the arms of Rieneck. In 1266, Reinhard I reached an agreement with the city of Frankfurt, in which he and his heirs would receive a very high monetary compensation, if one of their subjects were to become a citizen of Frankfurt. This suggests, he was struggling with large numbers of subjects migrating to Frankfurt. Reinhard I was from 1275 to 1279 Imperial Landvogt in the Wetterau area, and Burgrave of Friedberg. He was also Burgmann of the Kaiserpfalz Gelnhausen and of R√∂delheim. During his reign, Reinhard I managed to extend his territory. In 1255, his brother-in-law Ulrich II, Lord of M√ºnzenberg died without a male heir. Reinhard's wife, Adelaide inherited a share of 1/6 of the M√ºnzenberg Inheritance. In 1277, he inherited the district of Schwarzenfels from the Rieneck inheritance. He rounded off his territory by exchanging the manors in Benstadt, Stierstadt and Ossenheim with the Mariengreden chapter in Mainz for the forests of Hanau and Bulau.  Death  He died on 20 September 1281 and was buried in Arnsburg Abbey.  Marriage and issue  In 1245, he married Adelaide, a daughter of Ulrich I of M√ºnzenberg. As her dowry, she brought the district of Babenhausen into the marriage.

In the third volume (published posthumously in Spanish in 2013) he takes on Sergei Eisenstein's writings and describes his own work on La Recta Provincia and Nucingen House. In a March 2016 Lincoln Center masterclass, Ruiz's regular actor Melvil Poupaud said of Ruiz that: \\"He was more political in an aesthetic way than just a director. For instance, the book he wrote when he was a teacher in Harvard at the beginning of the nineties are still very important for me. I read them and I understand them more and more and it's his vision poetical but mostly political finally that matters more and more to my mind... It's very important I think to read it especially nowadays because he was very visionary especially on the narrative theory that is now so important to those TV shows all around the world and he had a very interesting theory about ways of controlling inspiration like the weapon.\\" See also * Historical poetics References External links *Towards a Perverse Neo-Baroque Cinematic Aesthetic: Ra√∫l Ruiz‚Äôs Poetics of Cinema 2004 article by Michael Goddard. *Poetics of Cinema 2 by Ra√∫l Ruiz 2007 article by Strictly Film School. *The Mystery, as Always: Ra√∫l Ruiz, Klimt and the Poetics of Cinema 2007 article by James Norton. *Filming Vienna 1900: The Poetics of Cinema and the Politics of Ornament in Ra√∫l Ruiz‚Äôs Klimt 2013 article by Janet Stewart.

The Baroque abbey church of St Maurice survives.  Foundation  The abbey, dedicated to Saint Maurice, was founded in 667 by Saint Deodatus of Nevers on the island of Novientum in the River Ill, using relics of Saint Maurice which Deodatus had obtained from St. Maurice's Abbey. Thanks to the support of Adalrich, Duke of Alsace, father of Saint Odilia, the monastery flourished. It was destroyed by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, and was not rebuilt until the early 18th century. Much of the Baroque abbey church, now prominent in its own right as a World Heritage Site, was built by the Austrian architect Peter Thumb. The abbey was dissolved during the French Revolution and the conventual buildings were demolished. The contents of the library were taken to Strasbourg, where most of them were burnt in the market place. The site was reoccupied in 1829 by a community of Marianist Brothers and Priests, and from 1887 by the Sisters of St Joseph of Saint-Marc.

She was mother of Queen Tamar, who would preside over the apogee of the medieval Georgian monarchy. Biography Burdukhan was a daughter of Khuddan, whom the Georgian chronicles call \\"king of the Osi\\", a Georgian designation of the Alan tribe in the North Caucasus. She married George, then a crown-prince of Georgia, in the lifetime of his father, King Demetrius I, in the 1150s. She gave birth to Tamar, subsequently queen regnant of Georgia. It is possible that the couple had another daughter Rusudan; but she is only mentioned once in all contemporary accounts of Tamar's reign.Eastmond (1998), p. 108, fn. 49.

Early years From shipping, Doman progressed to sawmilling when his customers wanted more wood than his suppliers could provide. \\"I built the company up for my father, for his family and for the family name,\\" Doman says of his father. The senior Doman, had worked in the industry, logging the big timber of the Cowichan Valley and at one point (1905) leased a mill to cut timber for the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1953, Herb along with his younger brothers, Ted Doman and Gordon Doman, founded Doman Lumber Company, and 1955 incorporated as Doman's Lumber & Transport Ltd.. Doman's first mill was the humble, Nanoose Forest Products. Later years In 1980 Doman Industries formed Western Forest Products as a joint venture with two other BC forest companies. In the 1990s there were severe financial problems, culminating in the Doman Scandal. In 2004 Western Forest Products acquired the assets of Doman Industries. When Doman purchased timber tenures and sawmills from Pacific Forest Products in 1997, he over-extended himself. Twice in the past he successfully rode market cycles and he trusted that markets would pick up as they had before, boosting revenues to cover the debt incurred by the purchase. But in 1998, the Japanese market, which he was counting on, crashed in the Asian meltdown. Personal life Herb had two brothers, Ted and Gordon Doman, and a sister, Mahinder. Herb had four children with wife Harjinder \\"Helen\\" Kaur Doman (n√©e Lashman) -- daughters Darcia, Sherry, Verinda, and son, Jaspaul (Rick). The youngest, Rick Doman (born November 1962) is now the President and CEO of EACOM Timber Ltd. Rick works and lives in Montreal QC, the headquarters of EACOM since its acquisition of the forest division of Domtar in 2010. Rick ran Doman Industries until its acquisition in 2004. He was handling the company's international sales in 2001 when he was asked to take over as chief executive from his father who had suffered a severe stroke. Nephew, Amar Doman (son of Ted Doman) runs one of B.C.'s largest private companies, Futura Corporation, as well as CanWel, one of Canada's largest building materials companies. Controversies In 1996, former B.C. Premier, Bill Bennett was convicted under B.C. securities laws of insider trading involving the sale of shares in Doman Industries, two years after he stepped down as premier. This was known as the Doman Scandal.CBC Digital Archives A British Columbia Securities Commission panel imposed trading sanctions against Herb and ordered him along with brothers Bill and Russell Bennett, to pay the commission $1 million to cover the costs of an insider trading case that spanned 11 years.Commission Panel Issue Consent Orders In Bennett-Doman Insider Trading Case.

Legacy Doman is known for his loyalty to his community, his friends and his family. For example, despite being advised to move the company's head office to Vancouver, Doman stayed in Duncan, building a three-storey office building‚Äîturning it into the economic hub of the Cowichan Valley. \\"Everybody said you couldn't have a head office in Duncan but of course I had to prove differently.

His reign saw many major political balance changes in Caucasus, including expansion by the Seljuqs. He was considered a ruler with great diplomatic skills, and his kingdom extended from Mughan to Kumuk and Alania. Reign Map of Caucasus and its surroundings. =Clash with the Shaddadids= On 20 February 1063, Fariburz's father Sallar died, and thus Fariburz became the new ruler of Shirvan. Although he even already controlled most of the kingdom during his father's reign. In March, the Shaddadid ruler Abu'l-Asvar Shavur I invaded his domains, captured the Quylamiyan castle, and then withdrew back to Arran. However, some time later, he returned to Shirvan and once again began raiding it. The Shirvanians, who fought against him, were defeated and many of them were taken captive and had their riches taken. Shavur then marched towards the capital of Shirvan, Shamakhi. There he seized many riches, captured the wife of Sallar, and then went back to Arran. On July, Shavur once again returned to Shirvan, where he had villages, crops, and houses destroyed. Fariburz, powerless to do anything, sent his son Afridun to gain aid from the ruler of Sarir, whom Afridun was related to through his mother. However, the ruler of Sarir declined his request, and after three months, Afridun returned to Shirvan. In January 1064, Shavur invaded Shirvan for the fourth time, where he seized several towns, and forced Fariburz to pay him 40,000 dinars. On June 1064 (or July), Shavur restored Quylamiyan to Fariburz in return of extra 40,000 dinars. =Hostilities with people of Derbent= In 1065, the people of Derbent revolted and killed its ruler, the Hashimid Mansur ibn Abd al-Malik. However, unfortunately for the rebels, Mansur was a cousin of Fariburz and had good relations with him, which made him raise an army and attack Derbent in order to avenge him, destroying many villages around the city. A battle shortly ensured at a bridge, which resulted in the defeat and massacre of the rebels. Fariburz then plundered Derbent and withdrew back to Shirvan. Fariburz later returned to Derbent and began raiding around the city. This hit the people of Derbent heavily, and forced them to free Fariburz's paternal aunt Shamkuya and pay tribute. This made a certain Mufarrij, who is called the \\"chief-of-chiefs of Derbent\\", request aid from the ruler of Sarir, who agreed to help him. Some time later, Mufarrij, with an army which included his own men and some Saririans, went forth to besiege the city of Shabaran, but was shortly defeated by Fariburz, who managed to capture him. The people of Derbent then finally surrender to Fariburz, who had the city rebuilt. On 30 January 1066, Fariburz appointed his son Afridun as the city's governor, who was warmly received by its people. =Clash with the Turks= However, Fariburz soon faced problems with a rising power - the Turks, who had raided his domains and the territories of the Kurds, taking much booty. Fariburz tried to make the Turks leave by paying them, but this did not work, and the Turkic warlord Qara-tegin arrived to Shirvan for the second time, this time being followed by Fariburz's paternal uncle Mamlan ibn Yazid. Qara-tegin shortly besieged Shamakhi and ravaged its surroundings, bringing great destruction. The situation became so hard that Fariburz had to send his studs to Masqat. In January 1067, for an unknown reason, Fariburz had some people from Shamakhi crucified, including his chamberlain (hajib) Lashkari ibn Rahman. Meanwhile, Qara-tegin resumed his raiding in Shirvan, destroyed many villages and towns, and kidnapped woman and children. He then laid siege to Shamakhi once again. The situation become more difficult for Fariburz when an army consisting of 2,000 Turkic troops arrived as reinforcements to Qara- tegin. These Turks shortly tried to trick Fariburz by sending him a message which said: \\"the Sultan has sent us to help thee and to drive Qara-tegin from thee\\". They then arrested Qara-tegin and Mamlan and asked Fariburz to come to them so that they could give him the prisoners. However, Fariburz did not fall for the bait and remained in his residence. The Turks then freed Qara-tegin and Mamlan and continued the siege of Shamakhi. Meanwhile, Fariburz secretly sent a messenger to the chamberlain of the Seljuq ruler Alp Arslan, who was the overlord of Qara-tegin and the Turks who had been raiding Caucasus. The messenger gave 6,000 dinars to the chamberlain in return that he should give Mamlan to Fariburz, who wanted to kill him. The chamberlain then invited Mamlan to a festival, who accepted his invitation. During the festival, Mamlan got drunk and after he was permitted to leave, he got ambushed and killed by three of Fariburz's men, which included his cousin Lashkarsitan, his servant Shad-tekin and his chamberlain Namdar ibn Muzaffar. The Turks then withdrew back to their territories, while Fariburz agreed to pay the Turks a yearly tribute of 30,000 dinars. = The rebellion of the son of Giorgi and the events that happened after = In April 1067, a unnamed son of a certain Giorgi, rebelled against Fariburz and captured the Daskarat al-Husayn castle, but after some time, ceded it to Aghsartan I, who was the ruler of Kakheti. Fariburz then marched towards the castle in order to recapture it, but was unable to and went back to Shamakhi. During the same year, Qara-tegin once again arrived to Shirvan, this time peacefully, and he was a given a daughter of Fariburz's uncle Qubad in marriage. On June, Lashkarsitan was killed near Qabala by some people from a place named Quni. On October, Fariburz's paternal aunt Shamkuya died and was buried next to her father in Shabaran. = Dispute with Alp Arslan, the invasion of Qum and the betrayal of Guzhdaham = During the end of the year of 1067, the Seljuq ruler Alp Arslan went to Arran, where Fariburz was waiting for him with gifts. Later in 1068, Fariburz aided Alp Arslan during one of his campaigns. When Fariburz returned to Shirvan, he marched towards Quni, where he killed many of its people and ravaged the place in order to avenge Lashkarsitan. Some time later, when Alp Arslan returned from his campaigns against the Byzantine Empire, the inhabitants of Derbent objected to Alp Arslan about the capture of some of their chiefs by Fariburz. Alp Arslan ordered him to free them, which he did. Nevertheless, Alp Arslan had Fariburz imprisoned. Meanwhile, Qara-tegin fled from Shamakhi to Masqat but was killed there. Furthermore, the brother of Fariburz, Guzhdaham, fled to Lezgistan, carrying the tribute which Fariburz had to pay Alp Arslan. After some days, Fariburz was released and sent back to Shirvan, but had to in return pay a great amount of money. On July 1068, Fariburz's son Afridun, left Derbent and returned to Shirvan. Some time later, Fariburz found out that Guzhdaham, who still carried the tribute he had to pay Alp Arslan, had left Lezgistan and arrived to Derbent, where he took refuge with the chiefs of the city. By November, Fariburz had raised an army and thereafter marched towards Derbent. A battle shortly ensured near the city which lasted a few hours and did neither of the sides were able to emerge victorious. Fariburz thus returned to his encampment, while the supporters of Guzhdaham went back to the city. After some time, Fariburz once again attacked Guzhdaham and his supporters. During the battle, Mufarrij, who seems to have been freed and still served as the \\"chief-of-chiefs of Derbent\\", joined Fariburz. The forces of Fariburz almost managed to overcome the forces of Guzhdaham, but due to the bravery of some of Guzhdaham's men, Fariburz was in the end defeated. However, some time later, Mufarrij managed to seize some parts of Derbent and after much fighting, managed to seize all of Derbent, while Guzhdaham fled to Lezgistan. Fariburz, along with his son Afridun, then went to Derbent, and after four days he went back to Shirvan, while Afridun was once again appointed as the governor of the city. = The loss of Derbent, the accession of Malik-Shah I, the Shaddadid-Shirvanian alliance and the invasion of Arghar = Coin minted during the reign of Malik-Shah I. In November 1071, Alp Arslan appointed his slave Yaghma as the governor of Derbent. When Yaghma arrived to the city, he read the letter which stated that he was appointed by the Seljuq ruler to rule Derbent, and thus Fariburz was unable to do anything; he departed his son and men out of the city. Furthermore, Yaghma also demanded Fariburz to cede Masqat, which he also did. During the same year, Guzhdaham died in Shaki and was buried in Shamakhi. In 1072, Fariburz made an alliance with Shavur's son Fadl II, whom he along with destroyed the castle of Malugh, which had earlier been captured by Aghsartan I. On 15 December, Alp Arslan died, and after a brief dynastic war, he was succeeded by his son Malik-Shah I. In 1074, a force of Turkic warriors under another Turkic warlord named Arghar ibn Buqa, arrived to Shirvan. The latter claimed that Malik-Shah had given him Shirvan as a part of his own domains. Fariburz, however, tricked him by giving gifts and money, which made Arghar feel comfort with him. Unexpectedly, Fariburz suddenly had him imprisoned, but later changed his mind due to his fear of Malik-Shah; he freed Arghar with his own hands, made a pretext and gave him gifts once again. Arghar then falsely acted that he had pardoned and fled from his court, raised an army and invaded Shirvan, where he ravaged the country, but in the end was forced by Malik-Shah to restore what he had destroyed, which he did in 1075. During the same year, Fariburz conquered most of Lezgistan.  Death and legacy  Fariburz later died in ca. 1096 and was succeeded by his son Manuchihr II.

The eruption of the conflict in July 1989 was caused by the assassination of KDPI leader Abdul Rahman Qassemlou by suspected Iranian government agents. The most violent episodes took place in 1990 and 1991, when Kurdish soldiers launched massive attacks on Iranian military bases in Kurdish areas of Iran. This brought heavy retaliation from the Iranian government, aiming to eradicate the KDPI leadership by assassinating Sadegh Sharafkandi and other KDPI leaders in 1992 in order to disable the Kurdish party's ability to function. The conflict faded with the effective targeted assassination policy of Iran and by 1996 KDPI was no longer able to function militarily and announced a unilateral ceasefire. The conflict claimed hundreds of lives, mostly Iranian government troops and Kurdish militants. Background In 1979, a wide scale rebellion erupted, as the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran and its Kurdish allies resisted the new regime. As the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps fought to reestablish government control in the Kurdish regions, more than 10,000 Kurds were killed during this process. Pockets of KDPI insurgents continued to engage in low level fighting up until 1983, as the Iranian forces were diverted to the Iraqi front, with the escalation of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. While most of its military and political activity in Iran was greatly overpowered after the 1979 rebellion, the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI) had continued its opposition activities through 1980s. Nevertheless, the crackdown still continued‚Äî'Abd al-Rahman Qassemlou, leader of Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran, was assassinated in July 1989 by the Iranian government. The immediate pretext for the renewed insurgency of KDPI was the event of February 1990, when thousands of Kurds demonstrated in seven Iranian towns and more than 500 were subsequently arrested. These protests are said to be due to the execution of 17 Kurdish activists. As a result of the crackdown, the KDPI renewed its military activities. Conflict timeline =1989= Abdul Rahman Ghassmlou, leader of the KDPI, was assassinated by suspected Iranian intelligence agents in Vienna, Austria on July 13, 1989.University of Arkansas. Political Science department. Iran/Kurds (1943‚Äìpresent). Retrieved 09 September 2012. The assassination sparked an immediate escalation of the Kurdish-Iranian dispute. Government troops and Kurdish rebels clashed near Mahabad in September and October 1989, resulting in the deaths of 172 government soldiers. =1990= From April to August 1990, Kurdish militants mounted numerous attacks against government forces. Over 300 Iranian soldiers were killed and over 150 were captured. The Kurdish opposition freed 152 POWs as a humanitarian gesture on July 28, 1990. In November 1990, Iranian security arrests a Kurdish soldier accused of allegedly killing two revolutionary guards in summer attacks. =1991= Through 1991, Iran increased the political crackdown, being accused by the KDPI over human rights violation. On 14 January 1991, Iran executed seven Kurds, all members of the KDPI, for \\"spying, murder and armed activities\\". In March 1991, Iranian forces crossed over into Iraq and attacked Iranian opposition forces, including Kurdish forces. Throughout the summer, Iranian Kurdish militants mounted attacks against the Iranian Army, allegedly killing five Iranian surveyors near the Turkish border in August. KDPI guerrillas also set fire to an exhibition of industrial machinery and briefly take policemen hostage in the town of Mahabad in retaliation because of Iranian terrorist attacks. =1992= In early 1992, protest and fighting broke out in several Kurdish towns in western Iran. In the town of Bowkan 17 were killed or wounded. In March 1992, there were several reports of Iranian Kurds supposedly attacking Iran from across the Iraqi border. On September 13, 1992 Iran and Turkey agreed to boost border security and clamp down on each other's Kurdish population. Each state's opposition uses the other state as a base for its operations. On September 17, 1992, two gunmen, believed to be working for the Iranian government, shot at eight KDPI officials in Bonn, Germany. Four KDPI politicians and their driver were killed. =1993= Through 1993, Iranian forces shelled Iranian Kurdish opposition forces in Iraq with both artillery and airplanes. Between April and May, 1993 Iranian forces crossed over into Iraq and attacked Kurdish forces. They eventually occupied a \\"security zone\\" of over 100 km2. On August 9, 1993, Iranian forces crossed the border into Iraq and attacked Kurdish forces once again. In the autumn, Kurdish soldiers resumed their fighting against the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. On November 15, 1993 Iran blows up a car in Iraqi Kurdistan killing six including 5 KDPI members. This and other incidents make both the UN and Amnesty International accuse the Iranian government of the political assassination of members of its Kurdish opposition. =1994= On January 7, 1994, a prominent member of the KDPI is assassinated by gunmen believed to be affiliated with Iranian security forces. On August 17, 1994, the KDPI said that it has killed 15 Iranian Revolutionary Guards in a clash in western Iran. Two weeks later, on September 1, 1994, Iran's IRNA news agency said that Kurdish soldiers had blocked a highway in western Iran, set two military vehicles ablaze and wounded one person. On September 25, 1994, Turkey and Iran agreed to stop opposition groups from operating in each other's territory. Following this, Iran launched a harsh crackdown on Kurdish population - on October 11, 1994 The Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran announced that four Kurdish villages had been demolished by Iran and that authorities had told the residents of five more villages to leave. On November 6‚Äì9, Iran bombed several Iranian Kurdish opposition groups in Iraq. =1995= On April 1995, a total of six Iranian Kurds were killed in attacks in Iraqi Kurdistan, by Iranian government agents. On June 5, another two members of an Iranian Kurdish group were shot down in Iraqi Kurdistan by Iranian government agents, according to the State Department's yearly report on terrorism. On August 4, 1995 The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan said that Iranian government agents had assassinated its representative in Baghdad. Tehran denied the charges and claimed that the killings had been the result of political infighting among opposition forces. In September and October, an Iranian Kurdish opposition group accused Iranian officials of torturing and executing ten Kurdish political prisoners who supported a banned political group, Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (KDPI). Another 345 people were also arrested at this time for the same infraction.Reuters, October 3; Foundation for Democracy in Iran, October 20. 1995. Military clashes resumed on December 4, 1995, as the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan killed 15 members of the Iranian security force in clashes in western Iran. =1996= On June 22, 1996 Turkish troops inside Iran murdered seven members of the KDPI in Iran. On July 10, Iranian agents exploded a car-bomb near a housing complex amidst the main concentration of KDPI refugee camps in northern Iraq. On July 28, Rahman Radjabi Hamvand, a member of KDPI, was executed. The charges against him stemmed from a complaint by a private individual that was later withdrawn. On July 29, 1996, 3,000 Iranian troops entered Kurdish territory in northern Iraq in search of KDPI guerillas, reportedly killing 20 members of KDPI, while displacing over 2,000 Iranian Kurd refugees. Iranian officials claimed that the attack was justified on the basis of self-defense Following the operation, on August 4, 1996, KDPI members announced that they will stop crossborder attacks from Iraq into Iran. Aftermath Following the unilateral cease-fire announcement of 1996, the conflict of KDPI against the Iranian regime shifted to the political opposition. On April 1997, improved relations between Tehran and Ankara led to the deportation from Turkey to northern Iraq over 70 KDPI members.The Daily Telegraph, April 19, 1997 On April 13, Iranian Kurds accused Iranian officials of trying to poison KDPI members, after 85 Iranian Kurds were treated for food poisoning with a highly toxic substance. The pressure upon the KDPI eased since the election of the moderate Mohammad Khatami's government in 1997. On February 16, 1999, The arrest of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan leads to riots by Kurds in Iran, especially in western Iran, as well as throughout Europe. Renewed insurgency in Iranian Kurdistan was undertaken since 2004 by another Kurdish organization‚Äîthe Party for the Free Life in Kurdistan (PJAK). =Resurging tensions= On January 2014, Iranian forces killed a KDPI party member, while he was disseminating leaflets. In September 2014, in a number of clashes, the KDPI engaged Iranian security for the first time in many years, killing at least 6 Iranian soldiers. It was unclear whether this was a result of change of policy by the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (which evaded violence since 1996) or an isolated sequence of incidents. In May 2015, a suspected Iranian attack (allegedly disguised as PKK fighters) on PJAK force on Iranian‚ÄìIraqi Kurdistan border resulted in 6 killed‚Äî2 KDPI and 4 PKK (or allegedly Iranian agents). In June 2015, a PDKI attack on Revolutionary Guard forces reportedly left 6 people killed. In 2016, the PDKI resumed its military insurgency against Iran. Responses =Iranian officials= On August 23, 1996, former president of Iran Abolhassan Banisadr stated that during the previous 15 years, the Iranian government ordered the killings of over 60 dissidents, including 4 KDPI leaders in Germany in 1992. =European Union= On April 10, 1997, a German court implicated the Iranian government in the deaths of 4 Kurdish dissidents in Germany in 1992. All EU countries, except Greece, recalled temporarily their ambassadors from Iran following the finding of the court, imposing limited diplomatic sanctions on Iran.

He played college football at San Jose State. He signed with the Denver Broncos as an undrafted free agent following the 2012 NFL Draft. He has also played for the Washington Redskins and New York Giants. Early years Born in Torrance, California, Ihenacho grew up in Carson, California and graduated from Jun√≠pero Serra High School at Gardena in 2007. He is of Nigerian descent. Although Ihenacho's mother did not allow him to play Pop Warner football, he joined the Serra High School football team in junior year after playing basketball and baseball most of his childhood. A three-star recruit, Ihenacho attracted two offers from New Mexico State and San Jose State. On February 27, 2007, Ihenacho signed with San Jose State. College career Ihenacho in September 2011 with San Jose State. At San Jose State University, Ihenacho played five seasons with the Spartans football team under coaches Dick Tomey (2007 to 2009) and Mike MacIntyre (2010 to 2011). Ihenacho played on the team with his older brother Carl Ihenacho until 2009. Ihenacho entered the Spartans in 2007 as the youngest player on the team and ended the year with 32 tackles, the most for a San Jose State freshman since 2004. On September 29, Ihenacho made the only blocked punt in a win against UC Davis. Following the blocked punt, quarterback Adam Tafralis made a 47-yard touchdown pass. Ihenacho made a season-high seven tackles on October 12 against Hawaii and forced a fumble in that game as well. San Jose State ended 2007 with a 5-7 record (4-4 in Western Athletic Conference games). In 2008, ESPN ranked Carl and Duke Ihenacho as one of the top ten brother combinations in college football for being among the top defensive players in FBS football. By mid-October 2008, Duke led the FBS in interceptions. In both the October 11 game against Utah State and October 18 game against New Mexico State, Ihenacho scored a 43-yard touchdown off an interception. Ihenacho's two interceptions in the Utah State game marked the only such time in the 2008 season. Ihenacho played as a linebacker in 2008 and was a first-team All-Western Athletic Conference (WAC) selection. San Jose State finished 2008 one game up from 2007, 6-6 (but still 4-4 in WAC). However, San Jose State finished the 2009 season 2-10 (1-7 WAC). In 2009, Ihenacho made 89 tackles, the second-most in the team that year, and tied his individual game high of 12 on October 10 against Idaho and November 21 against Hawaii. San Jose State football coach Dick Tomey retired after 2009, and Mike MacIntyre became the new head coach. In MacIntyre's first season, the Spartans finished 1-11 (0-8 WAC). Ihenacho played only in two games of 2010 before a season-ending injury. 2011 was a better season for the San Jose State Spartans, who finished 5-7 (3-4 WAC). Ihenacho made 73 tackles in 2011, the third-most in the team, and led the team in deflected passes with six. Ihenacho made his third career touchdown on October 1 with a 20-yard fumble return against Colorado State. That was also the first fumble returned for a touchdown by a San Jose State player since 2004. In four games, Ihenacho made 10 or more tackles, including a season high 11 each against Idaho and Utah State. On October 14, 2011, San Jose State rallied in its homecoming game to beat Hawaii 28-27. ESPN carried that game as part of College Football Friday Primetime. With San Jose State down 27-20 in the fourth quarter, Ihenacho recovered a blocked point after touchdown and took the ball to the end zone for a defensive two-point conversion. San Jose State won despite five turnovers. Geico nominated Ihenacho's conversion as the company's Play of the Year. Ihenacho earned his third first-team All-WAC selection in 2011. In December 2011, Ihenacho graduated from San Jose State with a B.A. in communication studies. Professional career =Pre-draft= Ihenacho was considered one of the top strong safeties in the 2012 NFL Draft. and was projected as a 5th round pick. =Denver Broncos= Ihenacho playing for the Denver Broncos in 2012. Ihenacho signed with the Denver Broncos as an undrafted free agent following the 2012 NFL Draft on April 28, 2012. Ihenacho played all four games of the 2012 preseason and made seven tackles during the preseason. The Broncos signed Ihenacho to the practice squad on September 1 and activated Ihenacho from the practice squad on September 29, 2012. On October 11, 2012, the Broncos released Ihenacho. They later signed him back to the practice squad on October 13 and to the active roster again on November 1. Ihenacho made one assisted tackle in his second game of the season, November 4 (Week 9) in a win over the Cincinnati Bengals. On November 13, 2012, he was waived by the Broncos. Three days later, the Broncos re-signed Ihenacho to the practice squad. In the 2013 offseason, Ihenacho began turning heads, showing very good cover skills and run stopping abilities. In the first released depth chart, Ihenacho climbed all the way to the number two spot for strong safety, pushing Mike Adams for the starting job. In the Broncos' first 2013 preseason game against the San Francisco 49ers, Ihenacho was in with the starters and led the team with 7 tackles, one being for a loss, and also had a forced fumble, which Rahim Moore recovered. On September 5, 2013, Ihenacho started his first NFL game at strong safety against the Baltimore Ravens. He recorded 11 solo tackles and had one assisted tackle in Denver's 49-27 win. On September 15, in the Broncos' win over the New York Giants, Ihenacho hurt his ankle in the fourth quarter and was carted off the field. On October 6, in a game against the Dallas Cowboys, Ihenacho recovered a fumble by Dez Bryant, forced by rookie teammate, Kayvon Webster. Ihenacho started Super Bowl XLVIII for the Broncos and had 9 tackles in the Broncos' 43-8 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Ihenacho was waived by the Broncos on August 30, 2014, before the start of the 2014 season. =Washington Redskins= The Washington Redskins claimed Ihenacho off waivers on August 31, 2014.

Just like search engine optimization (SEO) is for websites, app store optimization is for mobile apps. Specifically, app store optimization includes the process of ranking highly in an app store's search results and top charts rankings. Additionally, app store optimization also encompasses activities focused on increasing the conversion of app store impressions into downloads (e.g. A/B testing of screenshots), collectively referred to as Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO). Earning an app store feature and web search app indexing are two additional activities which may be categorized within the remit of app store optimization.  History  Apple's iTunes App Store was launched July 10, 2008, along with the release of the iPhone 3G. It currently supports iOS, including iPhone and iPad. There is also a non-mobile app store for Macs. Google's app store, Google Play, was launched September 23, 2008. It was originally named Android Market and supports the Android operating system. Since the launch of iTunes App Store and Google Play, there has been an explosion in both the number of app stores and the size of the stores (amount of apps and number of downloads). In 2010, Apple's App Store grew to process US$1.78 billion worth of apps. iTunes App Store had 435,000 apps as of July 11, 2011, while Google Play had 438,000 as of May 1, 2012. By 2016, Apple's App Store had surpassed 2 million total apps and Apple had paid out close to $50 billion in revenue to developers. Industry predictions estimate that by 2020, the App Store will hold over 5 million apps. As the number of apps in app stores has grown, the possibility of anyone app being found has dropped. This has led to the realization of how important it is to be noticed within an app store. As marketers started working on ranking highly in top charts and search results, a new discipline was formed and some app marketers have reported success. The first use of the term \\"app store optimization\\" to describe this new discipline appears to have been in a presentation by Johannes Borchardt on November 4, 2009. It began to take hold as a standardized term not long after, with outlets such as Search Engine Watch and TechCrunch using the term by February, 2012.  Goals  App store optimization works by optimizing a target app's keyword metadata in order to earn higher ranks for relevant keywords in the search engine results page, as well as increasing the rate at which users decide to download that target app. ASO marketers try to achieve goals, such as: * Being found more easily by users on the app stores, due to the fact that 65% of all downloads come from App Store searches * Ranking higher than competitors. * Ranking higher for specific keywords. * Ranking higher in Google's semantic search through relevant backlinking. * Optimize app store assets (e.g. icon, screenshots, promo video, description, etc.) to increase download conversion rate from store features, top chart impressions, and keyword searches.  Methods  Many ASO marketers categorize their work into two distinct processes: keyword optimization and conversion rate optimization. = Keyword Optimization = One of the main jobs of an ASO marketer is to optimize the keywords in an app's metadata, so that the app store keyword ranking algorithms rank that app higher in the search engine results page for relevant keywords. This is accomplished by ensuring that relevant and important keywords are found in an app's metadata, as well as adjusting the mix of keywords across an app's metadata elements in order to increase the ranking strength of target keywords. = Conversion Rate Optimization = In order to increase the downloads of an app, an app's assets (e.g. the icon, preview video, screenshots, etc.) must also be optimized. It is recommended to measure the effect of these optimizations by creating different variations of each asset, showing each variation to users, and then comparing the conversion rate of each variant, in a process referred to as A/B testing. Google Play facilitates this process by providing ASO marketers with an A/B testing platform built into the Google Play Console. For other platforms such as the Apple App Store, ASO marketers can run A/B tests via 3rd party A/B testing tools, running a pre-post test (i.e. pushing new assets live to the store and measuring the impact pre-and-post change), a country-by-country experiment (i.e. testing different asset variations across similar countries, such as UK/AU/CA/US/NZ), or testing different variations via ad platforms such as Facebook Ads.  White hat versus black hat  Many app marketers attempt to perform ASO in a way that most app stores would approve of and accept. This is called \\"white hat\\" ASO and publicly covered by presentations, conferences. Developers also use different platforms available to get their peers to rate their apps for them which provides great feedback. Some app marketers, however, engage in what many call \\"black hat\\" ASO and are practices which the app stores do not condone. Black hat ASO includes falsifying downloads or ratings and reviews, perhaps by using bots or other techniques to make app stores (and their users) believe an app is more important and influential than it actually is. Apple has been proactively fighting against black hat ASO. In February, 2012, Apple released a statement as reported by The New York Times \\"warning app makers that using third-party services to gain top placement in App Store charts could get them banned from the store.\\" Google followed Apple in 2015 and started manually reviewing apps, to enforce app quality and reduce black hat practices.  iOS 11  At WWDC 2017, Apple announced major changes to its App Store experience arriving with iOS 11. The major implications of iOS 11 for ASO are as follows: * Subtitles show for all app impressions ‚Äì The new subtitle metadata element now appears below the title wherever an app preview appears, as well as in the app product page. * Three visual tiles show in search results for apps ‚Äì App results now show either 1 preview video and the first 2 screenshots, or the first 3 screenshots in the search results page. * Preview videos now auto-play on mute ‚Äì App preview videos will auto-play in mute, in both the search results page or app product page. If two videos are in-view, the first video will play until completion, followed by the second video. * Additional results appear in the search results page ‚Äì Apple editorial content, developer pages, and In-App Purchases are all now eligible to show in search results, in addition to apps and Search Ads. * Additional app metadata ‚Äì New app metadata includes: # App subtitle (30 characters, which does rank for keyword searches). # App promotional text (170 characters, which does not rank for keyword searches). Promotional text appears as a second, separate line above the app description. # Up to 3 preview videos (up from 1 preview video in iOS 10). # Up to 20 promoted In-App Purchases, each of which appears in the app product page and is also eligible to appear in the featured tabs and the search results page. In-App Purchase metadata includes a name (30 characters, which does rank for keyword searches), description (45 characters, which does not rank for keyword searches), and an icon (1024x1024 PNG/JPEG). * App titles now limited to 30 characters * Navigation Tabs Revamped ‚Äì The iOS 11 App Store now includes three featured tabs (Today, Apps, and Games), as well as the Updates, and Search items. Additionally, the top charts have been moved to within the Apps and Games tabs. * Top Grossing chart removed ‚Äì The top-grossing chart is now removed from the App Store app. * All time-only ratings ‚Äì Ratings and reviews will no longer reset after a new app update and there is no longer a current set of ratings/reviews. Developers can choose to manually reset their ratings and reviews. * In-App Purchases now rank for keyword combinations ‚Äì In iOS 10, users had to type in the exact name of an In-App Purchase before the app would return (e.g. \\"500 gems\\"). In iOS 11, In- App Purchases rank for combinations of keyword searches, not just the exact match search (e.g. \\"clash of clans gems\\"). * App descriptions locked between releases ‚Äì The app description, which was previously editable before submitting a new app version, will now be immutable between new versions; though the promotional text will be editable between new versions. * Top chart appears in the product page ‚Äì If an app ranks in the top chart for its category or country, the app's best top chart ranking will now appear in the product page, next to the overall star rating. Additionally, Apple now requires developers to use its iOS 10.3 in-app rating prompt, disallowing custom ratings prompts.

He also was a member of the Calgary Stampeders and Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the Canadian Football League. He played college football at the University of Hawaii. Early years Allen attended Baldwin Park High School, where he practiced football and track. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Hawaii, where he was initially recruited to play wide receiver. During a bye-week scrimmage between backups and redshirts in his freshman season, the team was short at running back and he was temporarily used at the position for depth purposes. After showing his running skills and dominating the practice, he was permanently switched and was named the starter against the University of the Pacific, where he ran for 92 yards. He finished his freshman year with a school record 521 rushing yards in half a season. Though there were concerns about his size, his open-field elusiveness and strength made him one of the top players in the Western Athletic Conference. He ran from the I formation and was teamed with fullback David Toloumu. He also was a teammate of Mark Tuinei and Jesse Sapolu. As a sophomore, he posted 1,040 rushing yards, six over 100-yard games and averaged more than 6 yards per carry. His accomplishments included a four-game 100-plus yards rushing streak, a six-carry 112-yard cameo against Prairie View A&M; University, a 202-yard game against the University of Texas at El Paso, a 141-yard, three- touchdown performance against Temple University and a 155-yard game in an upset win against Arizona State University. He was invited to play in the Hula Bowl as a wide receiver. Because of the field conditions at Aloha Stadium, he suffered from turf toe injuries in his last two years. As a junior, he had a down season with 884 rushing yards, 2 rushing touchdowns, 26 receptions for 257 yards and one touchdown. As a senior, he recorded 1,006 rushing yards (five 100-yard rushing games), including 189 yards against San Diego State University. He helped the team accomplish a 9-2 record and their first in season top-20 Associated Press ranking. He finished his college career as the school's all-time rushing leader (3,451 yards) and is considered to be one of its greatest football players. At the time he also set 20 school records including: 4,558 career all-purpose yards, career rushing attempts (647), career 100-yard games (15), 1,000-yard rushing seasons (2), career receiving yards for a running back (895 yards), career receptions for a running back (73), career touchdowns (19) and single-game rushing yards (247). In 1988, he was inducted into the University of Hawaii ring of honor. Professional career =Houston Oilers= Allen was selected by the Houston Oilers in the sixth round (148th overall) of the 1982 NFL Draft, after dropping due to concerns about his short stature. He played in 8 games returning punts and kickoffs. On September 8, 1983, he was waived to make room for running back Vagas Ferguson. =Dallas Cowboys= On September 29, 1983, he was signed as a free agent by the Dallas Cowboys to replace an injured Chuck McSwain. He played only on special teams, returning punts and kickoffs. Against the Kansas City Chiefs, he returned a punt for a 68-yard touchdown. He also fumbled a punt that was the turning point in the wild card playoff loss against the Los Angeles Rams. The next year, he led the team in kickoff returns with a 20.2-yard average, ranked fifth in the NFL in punt return yards (446 yards), tenth in kickoff return yards (666 yards) and tied a team record with 54 punt returns. In 1985, the team tried unsuccessfully to convert him into a wide receiver and was released on August 16. =Calgary Stampeders= In 1986, he signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League and was named the starter at running back, after being originally listed fifth on the depth chart. He was benched in three games for being late to practices and missing team meetings. He still finished as the league's rushing leader (1,153 yards) and punt returner (768 yards), becoming the first player to be selected to the All-star team in two positions in a single season. He also set franchise records with 768 punt return yards in a season and 155 punt return yards in a game (September 14). The next year, he led the West Division in rushing yards (857) and again received All-star recognition. His performance fell off in 1988, before being cut after three games with only 100 rushing yards (5.0 yard avg.). =Winnipeg Blue Bombers= On August 22, 1988, he was signed by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He was released on September 8, after playing in three games and registering 53 rushing yards (5.6 yard avg.). Personal life Allen currently coaches freshman football at his former Alma Mater Baldwin Park High School. His son, a graduate of Bishop Amat Memorial High School, is now a freshman receiver for the University of Hawaii. Allen works as an inspector for the San Gabriel Valley County Water District.

It houses a 200-seat theatre, plus a rehearsal space, dance studio and a visual art gallery. The arts centre hosts touring theatre companies, musicians and other public events, as well as events by the school, with the aim to provide facilities and arts events both for St Edward's students and for the public at large. In 2017, John Hoggarth and Ria Parry were appointed as co-directors of the North Wall, replacing Lucy Maycock, who had been the Artistic Director since September 2010. History The North Wall Arts Centre was built on the site of a Victorian swimming pool, which was the oldest swimming pool in the country, situated on the grounds of St Edward‚Äôs School. The name derives from an ancient stone boundary wall that runs the entire length of the public street elevation. Designed by Haworth Tompkins architects, the project cost more than ¬£3.5 million and won several major architectural awards, including a RIBA in 2008. It also received a Certificate from the Oxford Preservation Trust in recognition of its \\"significant contribution to the conservation and improvement of Oxford‚Äôs built environment.\\" Completed in 2006, The North Wall was officially opened to the public in 2007 with a three-week arts festival. Programs In addition to hosting School events, The North Wall Arts Centre runs a regular programme of public arts events, as well as a Summer Festival in July and a residential drama school in August. It attracted various theatre companies including Birmingham Repertory Theatre, ATC Theatre, Out of Joint, Bush Theatre and Theatre Alibi. It has welcomed some musical acts, as French-Irish chanteuse Camille O'Sullivan, John Tavener, The Unthanks and Spiers and Boden. Comedians who have appeared at The North Wall include Eddie Izzard, Sarah Millican, John Bishop, and Rhod Gilbert. The theatre also hosts jazz evenings, ballets, children‚Äôs shows, contemporary and classical concerts, cabaret, opera, and new exhibitions in the modern gallery every three weeks.

Following the Exclusion crisis, ninety-nine boroughs had received new charters, the aim being to eliminate the influence of the Whigs.Clyve Jones, Britain in the first age of party, 1680‚Äì1750: essays presented to Geoffrey Holmes (1987), p. 56 online at books.google.com The Whigs also lost seats in county constituencies - which were not liable to charter manipulation - dropping from around sixty county seats in 1681 to only eight. In the new parliament, the Tories now had their own majority in both houses, Commons and Lords. The exact exact breakdown of members returned at the election is not clear, but of the 525 members who served during the 1685-89 Parliamentary term, including those elected at later by-elections, 468 are estimated as Tories and 57 as Whigs. This estimate does not treat any members as uncommitted, and up to 30% of members were recorded as inactive.Survey: II. The Politics of Members. The election had significant effects on Parliament demographically as well as politically. The newly elected members were mostly inexperienced, with slightly over half never having sat in Parliament before. The majority of these would stand down or lose their seats at the subsequent election in 1689. Members were much more likely to be High Church Anglicans, with very few Presbyterians or Independents compared to other Parliaments of the period. There was an unusually high share of government officials and military officers, and fewer country gentry.Survey: I. The Composition of the House. Two minors were elected, Peter Legh and the Hon. Thomas Windsor, aged 15 and 16 respectively.

Most of them reside in San Vito, the capital city of the Coto Brus Canton. Migration history After Cristoforo Colombo's discovery of Costa Rica in 1502, only a few Italians - initially mostly from the Republic of Genova - moved to live in the Costa Rica region. The italo-costarican historian Rita Bariatti named Girolamo Benzomi, Stefano Corti, Antonio Chapui, Jose Lombardo,Carmela Velazquez: Chapui-Corti-Lombardo Francesco Granado, and Benito Valerino between those who created important families in colonial Costa Rica.Rita Bariatti: La immigacion esporadica durante la epoca colonial (La inmigracion italiana en Costa Rica, segunda parte) In the 1883 census of Costa Rica there were only 63 Italian citizens and most of them living in the San Jos√© area, but soon in 1888 there were 1433 Italians working mainly in the creation of new railways. In 1888, the railroad brought in laborers from Italy as an alternative workforce. The terrible work conditions prompted them to leave the railroad project although many remained in Costa Rica, settling in a government-sponsored colony known as San Vito in the Southern Pacific region. Italians working on a Costa Rica railway. A few of them remained to live in Costa Rica, and some of their descendants resettled in the San Vito area. However, one third of those Italian workers of the railways remained in Costa Rica: they created a small but important community.Rita Bariatti: El flujo migratorio masivo (La inmigracion italiana en Costa Rica, cuarta parte) In the 1920s and 1930s the Italian community grew in importance, even because some Italo-costaricans reached top levels in the political arena: Julio Acosta Garc√≠a - descendant from a Genoese family in San Jose since colonial times - served as President of Costa Rica from 1920 to 1924. In 1939 there were nearly 15000 Italians resident in Costa Rica and many suffered persecutions during WW2Italians in Costa Rica internment camps In 1952, there was an influx of Italian immigrants, mainly farmers, who arrived in San Vito armed with tractors and other farm machinery, and began to farm the land intensively and to raise cattle. An Italian organization for agricultural colonization purchased 10,000 hectares of land from the government of Costa Rica. Indeed in the 1950s a group of 500 Italian colonists settled in the area of San Vito (that received this name as an homage to San Vito, an Italian saint).Italians of San Vito (in Italian) In 1952, in the midst of the post-war socio-economic crisis in Europe, the two brothers Ugo and Vito Sansonetti organised a group of Italian pioneers from forty different places, from Trieste to Taranto, and including a handful from Istria and Dalmatia. This Italian immigration is a typical example of directed agricultural colonisation, similar in many ways to the process in other places in Latin America. The European immigrants were helped by the Comit√© Intergubernamental para las Migraciones Europeas (CIME), (Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration). Vito Sansonetti, a seaman by profession, was the founder of the colonising company which he named Sociedad Italiana de Colonizaci√≥n Agricola (SICA), (Italian Agricultural Colonisation Society), and was in charge of negotiations with the Costa Rican authorities represented by the Instituto de Tierras y Colonizaci√≥n (ITCO) (Institute of Land and Colonisation). Actually San Vito is the only place in Costa Rica (other than some small communities) in which the teaching of the Italian language is compulsory in the educational system, and promoted by the Ministerio de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica (Ministry of Public Education) in order to save Italian customs and traditions. Additionally there it is an Italian cultural center in San Vito as well as several Italian restaurants. But the Italian language is usually spoken only by the older citizens of San Vito, even if many young people have some superficial knowledge. Culture There are many institutions and cultural associations in Costa Rica. The historical nucleus of the Italian community in Costa Rica was the city of San Jos√©: this community is the one that has received more Italian immigrants in all Central America. Nowadays, the capital still has this centralization role for the local Italians, since it shelters the majority of the Italian citizens (and their descendants) residing in the country, although there are now other centers that concentrate considerable numbers of immigrants (like San Vito). Teatro Nacional in San Jos√© was made by Italian engineer Cristoforo Molinari in 1897. It looks very similar to the famous La Scala of Milano. In 1890, the Italian Philanthropic Society (\\"Societ√† Filantropica Italiana\\") was created, just two years after the first mass immigration from Lombardy and northern Italy. Then, it would evolve in several Italian Organizations of Mutual Aid until 1902, when it was beginning the massive immigration from southern Italy and was created the Italian Society of Mutual Help (\\"Societ√† Italiana di Mutuo Soccorso\\"). In addition, in the capital was inaugurated the \\"Italian Club\\" in 1904, the \\"Italian Center\\" in 1905 and later the \\"Casa d'Italia\\" in the second half of the 20th century. In 1897 Italian engineer Cristoforo Molinari created the Teatro Nacional de Costa Rica, that is considered the finest historic building in the capital, and it is known for its exquisite interior which includes lavish Italian furnishings. On the other hand, many Italian cultural and educational institutions were established in the country; among them many schools while the principal of all is the \\"Dante Alighieri Institute of Costa Rica\\", established in 1932, which currently has four venues (two in San Jose, one in Heredia and another in Quesada,.History: Dante Alighieri Society \\"Our-history\\". Editor Dante Alighieri Cultural Association in Costa Rica (http://www.dantecostarica.org) Also, the \\"Bologna Institute\\" and the \\"Italy-Costa Rica Cultural Center\\" are important in the capital. Furthermore, in the small city of San Vito, where 3000 of the 5000 inhabitants are descendants of Italian colonists, the \\"Centro Cultural Dante Alighieri\\" (Dante Alighieri Cultural Centre) offers historical information on the Italian immigration. There is an Italian \\"meeting\\" center in San Vito's Catholic church, as well as several Italian restaurants. In San Vito there is the Liceo Biling√ºe √çtalo-Costarricense, where it is taught the Italian language as an official compulsory subject.Colegio Italo-Costarricense The Italian language is usually spoken by some of the older citizens of San Vito who moved from Italy in the 1950s. Italian language in Costa Rica Costa Rica is the Central American country with the largest and flourishing Italian- speaking community. Apart from San Jose, the area with the greatest presence of speakers is the Southern Zone, especially in the cantons of Coto Brus and Corredores, where there are communities like San Vito that were colonized by Italian immigrants and where the language is still spoken actively, with a majority of Sardinian, Calabrian and Sicilian varieties. Furthermore, in these communities of Coto Brus,Sansonetti V. (1995) Quem√© mis naves en esta monta√±a: La colonizaci√≥n de la altiplanicie de Coto Brus y la fundaci√≥n de San Vito de Java. Jim√©nez y Tanzi. San Jos√©, Costa Rica the Italian language is taught in regional public education, and throughout the country there are many schools that also teach the language as an optional subject.San Vito, un pueblo de Italianos emigrados (in Spanish) Map showing in green the areas where the Italian language is spoken Also noteworthy is the lasting southern influence in certain phonetic and lexical aspects of Costa Rican Spanish. Among the Italian linguistic inheritances, the best known is the pronunciation of the r and rr, which the majority of the population pronounces as a deaf alveolar rhithic fricative, as do the Sicilians. On the other hand, it exists in modern Costa Rican \\"slang\\" a multitude of Italianisms: acois (from the echo: here), birra (from the beer: beer), bochinche (fight, disorder), capo (someone outstanding), bell (from it: bell jergal: spy, means to watch), canear (from the \\"canne: police baton, means to be in jail\\"), \\"chao\\" (from the \\"ciao: goodbye\\"), facha (from \\"faccia\\": \\"face, used when someone is badly dressed\\"), used when someone is poorly arranged) and sound (from the suonare: sound, means to fail or hit), among many others.

Simon and Hill then had a spell presenting a Saturday afternoon sports show on the Capital Gold network, before joining the Local Radio Company in 2005 to host an independently produced evening show which was syndicated across the group's 27 stations nationwide. This programme had an alternative music focus, and featured regular sessions from both established and upcoming bands. The programme was one of the first in the country to feature Arctic Monkeys. It received a silver Sony Radio Academy award for Best Interactive Programme in 2006. In January 2008, the pair joined Kerrang! Radio in the West Midlands, initially to present drivetime. They took over the breakfast show in May of the same year and held this position until they left Kerrang! at the end of 2011. In that time they secured a further two Sony Radio Academy awards. Firstly, the silver for Music Radio Personalities Of The Year in 2009 (where they were beaten to gold only by Chris Evans), and most recently the bronze for Best Breakfast Show in 2011.https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and- radio/tvandradioblog/2011/aug/04/kerrang-radio-week-listening- tohttp://radiotoday.co.uk/2011/12/simon-james-and-hill-leave-kerrang-radio/ During their time at Kerrang! Radio, Simon and Hill became best noted for blurring reality and theatre. Guests generally appeared remotely (apparently speaking from a mysterious \\"booth\\" in London), and often it was never clear which parts of an interview were genuine and which were the result of deliberately bizarre editing.

The program monitors and enforces maintenance orders and agreements for child support and spousal support. Annually, the program assists approximately 45,000 families, 58,000 children and collects and disburses over $200 million (CAD) in maintenance payments each year. The Canadian courts recognize the ongoing financial responsibility of separated spouses to their children and to each other and regularly issue maintenance orders, which are court orders requiring one party (the payor) to provide payments to another party (the recipient) for the support of the children and/or the other party. By providing services to both payors and recipients, the FMEP ensures that the terms of these maintenance orders are fulfilled. The FMEP's services are available on an opt-in basis to most parents who live in British Columbia and who have valid maintenance orders or agreements filed with any court in Canada, the United States, or in other countries with which British Columbia has reciprocal agreements.  Legislative Authority  Federal and provincial legislation, including the Family Maintenance Enforcement Act (the Act) and the Family Law Act provide the FMEP with authority to enforce maintenance payments. Under the Family Maintenance Enforcement Act, the FMEP is responsible for monitoring and enforcing all maintenance orders and agreements that are filed with the program.  Services  Both payors and recipients have the option of enrolling in the FMEP, although, it only requires one party to enroll both. There is no cost for the program's services but default fees and interest charges apply if support payments are not made on time. While many maintenance payments are made on time, clients often register with the FMEP with the goal of having a third party track payments. If a payment is not made, the FMEP contacts the payor to request voluntary compliance and to make a plan for payment of arrears. If payors fail to comply with maintenance payments, the FMEP will issue administrative enforcement as well as court enforcement to ensure collection of unpaid maintenance. Administrative enforcement actions include Notices of Attachment, which require the garnishment of wages and other sources of income or the interception of federal payments (such as employment insurance benefits and income tax returns), reporting arrears to the credit bureau, refusing to issue or renew a payor's driver's license, and placing a lien on a payor's land or personal property. Court enforcement mechanisms involve requiring a payor to attend in court to explain the non-payment of maintenance and, ultimately, incarceration for the willful failure to pay court ordered maintenance. Cases are assessed individually in order to determine which type of enforcement is appropriate. This decision depends on factors such as the payor's history and the amount of money owed. Under section 11.1 of the Act, the FMEP has the authority to charge payors interest on late and unpaid maintenance. This interest goes to the recipient. Most of the payors and recipients enrolled in the FMEP live in British Columbia, although, out of the current caseload there are approximately 8,400 cases where one parent lives outside British Columbia. These cases involve cooperation with maintenance programs in other Canadian jurisdictions, as well as with international partners, to collect and disburse maintenance payments. The province of Alberta accounts for more than 50% of the program's out-of-province cases in Canada, while the State of Washington accounts for one third of the FMEP's reciprocal cases with the United States.  Administration  The Director of Maintenance Enforcement manages the Family Maintenance Enforcement Program. The Director is a civil servant appointed by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General and acting in a position established by the Act.  Clients  The FMEP monitors child support for just over 58,000 children. Almost one third of the children on the FMEP caseload are 11 years of age and under, and one in four children is over 19 years of age. The percentage of older children on the FMEP caseload reflects the widespread need for ongoing financial support from parents through high school and post-secondary school. Most parents registered with the FMEP are in their early 40s; the average age of payors is 45, and the average recipient age is 43.  Payments and Disbursement  The average child support order registered with the program requires payment of just under $400 per month. Following registration, payors are required to send all maintenance payments to the FMEP, rather than send payments directly to the recipient. Payors are encouraged to make payments electronically. Payments are recorded by the FMEP and then disbursed to recipients, usually on the same day they are received. Payments are disbursed to recipients through direct deposit to bank accounts. An average of just under 43,000 payments per month are processed by the FMEP. As an incentive for prompt payment, where a payor misses or is late making a payment twice in a calendar year, the program charges a default fee. The fee is equal to one month's maintenance up to a maximum of $400 and is paid to the provincial government. These fees help offset the costs of the FMEP, and together with funds collected for clients in receipt of income assistance, help to ensure that the FMEP is a cost-neutral program for the government. In 2015-16 just under $1.3 million was collected in default fees.  Program Costs  The FMEP is a very cost efficient program. The total funding for the FMEP in 2015-2016 was $18 million which translates to $1 spent for every $11.67 collected.

It is developed by Telltale Games. It is canon with the comic book universe and is set as a prequel to the comic book. The game consists of five episodes that were released throughout 2013. Retail versions for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360, and Xbox One consoles were released in November 2014. The Wolf Among Us has been generally well received by critics and garnered a cult following. In July 2017, Telltale announced that a season 2 of The Wolf Among Us was scheduled for release in 2018. However, Telltale eventually had to shut down for financial reasons in 2018, with its assets being acquired by LCG Entertainment. One of the first original games from this new company, doing business as Telltale Games, will be The Wolf Among Us 2, announced in December 2019. Gameplay In-game conversations are presented in the form of dialogue trees The Wolf Among Us is a graphic adventure game, played from a third- person perspective. The player controls protagonist Bigby Wolf, who must investigate the murder of a woman. Throughout the game, the player explores various three-dimensional environments, such as apartment buildings and a bar. When exploring an environment, the player may find an object they can interact with; when this occurs, they must move a cursor over the object to select and examine it. Items of interest are stored in an inventory, and can be used later in the story. The player may also talk with non-player characters, and see the conversations presented in the form of dialogue trees. The dialogue options chosen during conversations would either have a positive or negative effect on how other characters view Bigby, and their perceptions would influence future events in the story. Some scenes are more action-oriented, forcing the player to respond to a series of quick time event (QTE) prompts. The player is not required to complete every QTE prompt, and skipping certain prompts may affect future events in the story. Synopsis =Setting= The Wolf Among Us is set in the year 1986, nearly twenty years before the events of Fables. For years, many of the magical lands described in myth, legend, and folklore (known as The Homelands) have been occupied by an enigmatic tyrant known as the Adversary. To escape the Adversary's totalitarian regime, many of The Homelands inhabitants (collectively known as Fables) fled to colonial America, and created an enclave known as Fabletown, now located in modern-day Manhattan. To mask their presence from the native humans (referred to as \\"mundys\\"), all non-human Fables have to purchase an enchantment known as a \\"glamour\\" which allows them to appear human, or be relocated to a rural community known as \\"The Farm\\". =Characters= The protagonist of The Wolf Among Us is Bigby Wolf (Adam Harrington), formerly the Big Bad Wolf. He is the sheriff of Fabletown, currently working at the \\"Business Office\\" under corrupt interim mayor Ichabod Crane (Roger L. Jackson), aided by Snow White (Erin Yvette) and the Magic Mirror (Gavin Hammon) in his investigation along with the help of Bufkin the winged monkey (Chuck Kourouklis) that manages Fabletown's records. Aristocrat Bluebeard (Dave Fennoy) also works at the Office though his motives are unclear. Bigby resides at the Woodlands apartments where Colin (Brian Sommer), one of the Three Little Pigs, occasionally crashes at his place. Beauty and the Beast (Melissa Hutchison and Gavin Hammon) are also residents of the Woodlands, though currently struggling with a troubled marriage. One of the Fables that Bigby frequently contacts is Mr. Toad (Chuck Kourouklis) and his son TJ (Toad Jr.), who live in a run-down apartment building nearby. In the first episode, the player is introduced to The Woodsman (Adam Harrington), who lives in the same building as Mr. Toad. Standing in Bigby's way are Dee and Dum Tweedle (Gavin Hammon), twin private investigators and criminals. Bigby also encounters Holly (Janet Lipsey), a Troll who runs the Trip Trap bar, and barfly Grendel (Kid Beyond). The second episode introduces trickster and thief Jack Horner (Colin Benoit), Georgie Porgie (Kevin Howarth), a pimp and the owner of the Pudding & Pie strip club, along with prostitute Nerissa (Molly Benson), the former Little Mermaid, Vivian (Sandy Delonga), and Clever Hans (Ben Knoll), the club's bouncer. The third episode introduces the janitor Flycatcher (Dustin Rubin), Bloody Mary (Kathryn Cressida) as a minion of the Crooked Man (Philip Banks), and Aunty Greenleaf (Laura Bailey), a rogue witch who illegally sells cheap black-market glamours to Fables. The fourth episode introduces the Jersey Devil (Bobby Vickers), the manager of the Lucky Pawn shop and Johann the butcher (Terry McGovern), the former owner of the Cut Above butcher shop who has been forced out of his business by the Crooked Man's henchmen. =Plot= This is a broad overview of the plot. Certain decisions made by the player will alter details of specific events. Bigby Wolf, formerly the Big Bad Wolf, is the Sheriff of Fabletown, a hidden community of fairytale characters located in 1980s New York City. Receiving a call from Mr. Toad, Bigby protects a prostitute from an intoxicated Woodsman. Before she departs, she tells him he is not as bad as everyone says he is. Later that night, Bigby and Snow White find the woman's head left on the Woodlands doorstep. Clues left with the head identify her as Faith, a Fable from Allerleirauh. Deputy Mayor Ichabod Crane orders him and Snow to investigate her death. They head to the apartment she shared with her husband Prince Lawrence and find the Tweedles, Dee and Dum, snooping through it. They learn that Lawrence and Faith struggled to make ends meet and Faith took up prostitution to help pay the bills. Bigby leaves Snow at the Woodlands while he continues to trace leads. When he returns, he finds the Woodlands surrounded by police, Snow's head sitting on the building's steps. Bigby is taken in for questioning by the mundy police, but Crane uses a spell to wipe the incident from the police's minds. When they return, they are surprised to find Snow still alive; the head is shown to be disguised by a black-market glamour, a spell that non-human Fables use, and belongs instead to a troll named Lily. Bigby tracks Lily's connections to the Pudding & Pie, a strip club run by Georgie Porgie, but Georgie claims innocence. One of his other prostitutes, Nerissa, cryptically directs Bigby to a nearby hotel room. There he finds Lily's blood on the bed, and photographic evidence of Crane engaging in sexual acts with Lily glamoured to look like Snow. He informs Snow of this, and they race back to the Woodlands to find Crane gone, and the Magic Mirror, which could have revealed his location, shattered with one shard missing. Bigby follows a trail of clues to Crane's whereabouts to the apartment of Aunty Greenleaf, one of the witches that makes the black-market glamours. Along the way, Bigby discovers that Crane has been embezzling money from Fabletown over the years to pay off a loan shark known as the Crooked Man. Greenleaf points the two back to the Pudding & Pie. Storming the club, they find Crane trying to extract information out of the prostitutes to prove his innocence. Snow realizes Crane's actions are not that of a murderer, and he is arrested for his embezzlement. Leaving the club, they are attacked by the Crooked Man and his henchmen, the Tweedles and Bloody Mary. Mary and the Tweedles goad Bigby into his werewolf form, and a fight breaks out. When Mary critically wounds Bigby with a silver bullet, Snow steps in to stop the fight and willingly gives up Crane to the Crooked Man to save Bigby's life. Back at the Woodlands, Bigby struggles to find clues when Nerissa appears. He realizes the ribbon she wears prevents her from speaking the truth, that Faith wore an identical ribbon, and that she died when the ribbon was removed. He follows another trail of clues, and finds evidence of the black-market glamour ring in the Cut Above butcher shop, a pawn shop called the Lucky Pawn where the Crooked Man distributes his loans to Fables owned by Jersey Devil, another henchman of the Crooked Man, and Crane's presence, as well as the missing Mirror Shard. The Mirror reveals Mary putting Crane onto an overseas flight to Paris to keep him from talking, as well as the next location of the door to the Crooked Man's lair, which moves around the city. Bigby enters the Crooked Man's lair alone, meeting him and his agents. The Crooked Man reveals Georgie as Faith and Lily's killer and claims he misunderstood his orders to deal with them, but Georgie asserts the Crooked Man told him to kill the women. A fight ensues and the Crooked Man and a fatally stabbed Georgie escape. When Bigby pursues Georgie and his lover Vivian to the Pudding & Pie, she explains that the Crooked Man and Georgie were acting to stop a plot spearheaded by Faith with the other prostitutes to escape their forced servitude. Vivian is revealed to be the girl with the ribbon around her neck and, having made copies of her ribbon, trapped women like Faith, Lily, and Nerissa for Georgie whilst guaranteeing their silence. Regretting her actions, Vivian undoes her ribbon, breaking the spell but severing her head. Bigby then finds the Crooked Man hiding in an old foundry, and after turning into his true wolf form to kill Bloody Mary, corners him in an office, where he demands a fair trial at the Woodlands. Bigby returns to the Witching Well at the Business Office to recount events to the assembled Fables of the Woodlands, where he and Snow are forced to defend their actions against claims from the Fables. Bigby recounts Vivian's and Georgie's confessions regarding the Crooked Man's involvement, but his word is deemed untrustworthy. Nerissa appears and testifies that she and five other women heard the Crooked Man order the murders. Their testimonies are considered sufficient to believe what Bigby did was right. In the epilogue, Snow becomes the new Deputy Mayor and deals with the fallout of the Crooked Man's actions, while Bigby sees off the Fables being taken back to the Farm. Afterward, he encounters Nerissa, who is moving on with her life. She admits that Faith concocted a plan with her and Lily to blackmail Georgie and the Crooked Man for their freedom, using a picture of Lily and Crane together, but Georgie killed the two women when she panicked and revealed their plot to him. Nerissa left Faith's head at the Woodlands to get Bigby involved, and gave false testimony to have the Crooked Man punished, knowing that he was the one who ordered their deaths. Leaving, she comments that Bigby is not as bad as everyone says he is, causing Bigby to recall Faith saying the same before her death. Several past conversations with Faith and Nerissa play out in Bigby's head, leading him to question the true identity of Nerissa. Episodes Episodic releases for the Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, OS X and PlayStation 3 platforms were released near-simultaneously within the same week; the iOS and PlayStation Vita episodic releases were expected to trail these by about a month or so. Development In 2011, Telltale Games announced that it had acquired licenses to develop video games based on two comic book series, The Walking Dead by Robert Kirkman, and Fables by Bill Willingham. This announcement came around the same time that the television series The Walking Dead became critically successful, leading to Telltale to put much of their initial focus on developing The Walking Dead property through 2011 and 2012. This game was released by April 2012, and was a critical success for Telltale. With The Walking Dead shipping, the company then started working on their Fables title, but according to Telltale's Job Stauffer, they struggled with the narrative of the title over a year and a half. Stauffer said at one point, they found the game to be more of a comedy, but without much humorous substance and in an un-shippable state. Stauffer said that their team rallied together to refocus the game, delaying it from an early 2012 release to late 2012, and ultimately to October 2013 when it finally shipped. This did allow for Telltale to incorporate mechanics that had proven successful in The Walking Dead into their Fables game. Due to these delays, Telltale re-announced the Fables game at the New York Comic Con in October 2012. The name The Wolf Among Us was revealed in March 2013, and is based on the main character Bigby Wolf. Pre-orders were made available October 3, 2013 from Telltale Games and Steam. Those who pre-ordered through Telltale received a collector's DVD at the end of the season. The game was initially released across five episodes between October 2013 and July 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 platforms. =Release announcements and dates= Reception The Wolf Among Us has received mostly positive reviews from critics.

Awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. The series was nominated for two 2014 BAFTA Games Awards for Story and Performer (Adam Harrington as Bigby Wolf), losing both to The Last of Us: Left Behind. At the 2014 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) awards the game won Direction in a Game Cinema and received six nominations: Writing in a Drama (Pierre Shorette), Performance in a Drama, Lead (Adam Harrington), Original Dramatic Score, Franchise (Jared Emerson- Johnson), Game, Original Adventure (Joe Pinney), Camera Direction in a Game Engine (Dennis Lenart) and Art Direction, Contemporary (David Bogan). Comic adaptation At the 2014 New York Comic Con, Vertigo Comics announced that they will be adapting The Wolf Among Us into comic form, to be released digitally first in December 2014 and later as print comic. The story was adapted for the comic by Lilah Sturges, who has previously written for the Fables series, and Dave Justus, staying otherwise true to the game's story but exploring some of the characters and back story in more depth. The comic has since been completed. Sequel When The Wolf Among Us was completed by July 2014, Telltale had thought of doing a second season, but they had already committed to the projects leading to Tales from the Borderlands, Minecraft: Story Mode, and Game of Thrones. The company was aware of strong interest in a second season through the intervening years, and they were looking for the right time to develop it. A second yet-to-be-named season was announced during the July 2017 San Diego Comic Con, and was originally set to premiere in 2018 for personal computers, consoles, and mobile devices. Both Harrington and Yvette were to return to voice Bigby and Snow White, respectively. Stauffer said that Season Two would not resolve the apparent cliffhanger related to Nerissa's connection to Faith; he said that it was meant to be ending similar to a film noir work that made the viewer think about the implications, but never saw this themselves as a cliffhanger. Instead, Season 2 would have continued on with more narrative related to Bigby and Snow White. By May 2018, Telltale announced that due to recent internal studio issues, they had to push back the release of the sequel until 2019. In September 2018, Telltale had a majority studio closure due to \\"insurmountable challenges\\", cancelling The Wolf Among Uss second season among other projects in development. Upon Telltale's revival by LCG Entertainment, The Wolf Among Us was one of the titles reacquired by LCG, but no announcement was made at that time about the sequel. The company announced The Wolf Among Us 2 at The Game Awards 2019. The sequel will continue events after the first game, though still remain as a prequel to the comic series. The game is being developed in association with AdHoc Studio, formed by former Telltale Games staff, who will focus on the game's narrative and cinematic elements while Telltale will implement the gameplay and other designs. In addition to returning Telltale staff, Harrington and Yvette will return to voice Bigby and Snow White, and Emerson- Johnson will compose music for the game. The game is being developed on the Unreal Engine, and will be released in an episodic approach. This sequel will be worked completely from scratch, using none of the ideas and initial work that had been done under the former Telltale banner before its closure.

He participated in the Action T4 euthanasia program, in Operation Reinhard, and the Einsatzgruppen actions in the Adriatic operational zone. He was convicted at the Treblinka trials in September 1965 and spent four years in prison.  Career  Franz Suchomel was born in Krumau, Bohemia in 1907, when it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After leaving school he worked as an apprentice in his father's tailor shop and took over the family business in 1936. At the end of the 1920s, and again briefly in the fall of 1938, he served in the Czechoslovak Army. Suchomel joined the Sudeten German Party (SdP) in 1938. After the incorporation of the Sudetenland to the Third Reich as a result of the Munich Agreement, he became a member of the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK), a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party.Henry Friedl√§nder: The Origins of Nazi Genocide ‚Äì From Euthanasia to the Final Solution, Chapel Hill 1995, p. 240. At the beginning of the Second World War, Suchomel was a tailor in the German Army and served in the Battle of France in 1940. In March 1941 he became a photographer at the Hadamar Euthanasia Centre in the Action T4 headquarters in Berlin, where he took photographs of victims before their killing.Ernst Klee: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich: Wer war was vor und nach 1945., Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 615 = Operation Reinhardt = In August 1942, Suchomel was transferred to the Treblinka extermination camp. There he was responsible for handling incoming transports of Jewish victims as well as the confiscation and collection of valuables. He urged Jewish women on their way to the gas chambers disguised as showers:Treblinka Trial at Shoah.de \\"Dear ladies, quickly, quickly, quickly, the water is getting cold.\\" In October 1943 he served at the Sobibor extermination camp for a short time. After Operation Reinhard ended in November 1943, Suchomel was transferred along with the rest of Globocnik's staff to Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral in Trieste. Here he was a member of Sonderabteilung Einsatz R (English: \\"Special Action Unit R\\"), involved in extermination of Jews, confiscation of Jewish assets, and fighting partisan activity. As the end of the war approached, the \\"Special Unit\\" withdrew from northern Italy at the end of April 1945. Suchomel wound up in American captivity there as a prisoner of war and was released in August 1945.Short Biography of Franz Suchomel at deathcamps.org, retrieved 07-May-2012 After 1949 Suchomel lived in Alt√∂tting, Bavaria. There he was again employed as a tailor, and served in five amateur orchestras as well as in the Catholic church choir. Trial, conviction, later life  Twenty years after the end of the war, in the framework of first official investigations into crimes against humanity at the Treblinka extermination camp, German authorities collected evidence of Suchomel's participation in the Holocaust. He was arrested on 11 July 1963. The Treblinka trials took place from 12 October 1964 until 3 September 1965 against ten defendants before the 3rd District Court of D√ºsseldorf. The charges consisted of the murder of at least 700,000 mainly Jewish people in the gas chambers, as well as deadly assault, shootings, and hangings of individual prisoners. Suchomel was convicted of accessory to murder and sentenced to six years in jail. Suchomel was released from prison on 20 December 1967. Franz Suchomel was secretly recorded during an interview for the documentary film Shoah, directed by Claude Lanzmann and released in 1985. During the interview at the Hotel Post in Braunau am Inn he provided details of Treblinka criminal operations. He also performed the Treblinka song which prisoners had to learn upon arrival at the camp. The lyrics in English translation were: \\"We know only the word of our Commander. We know only obedience and duty. We want to serve, to go on serving until little luck ends it all. Hurray!\\"Micha Brumlik: Der z√§he Schaum der Verdr√§ngung, in Der Spiegel, Edition 8/1986, 17 February 1986, pp. 192-197. He died on 18 December 1979.

At domestic level, he has played for Gloucestershire County Cricket Club since 2012, having joined the club's academy in 2008. In June 2012, he signed a contract with Gloucestershire till the end of the 2014 season. He made his One Day International debut against Scotland in September 2014. He made his Twenty20 International debut against Scotland on 18 June 2015. Career Born in Derry, Graeme McCarter began playing for Ireland at Under-15 level. He also played badminton, and represented Ireland, but chose to pursue cricket instead as he felt he was better at it. McCarter joined Gloucestershire's academy in late 2008, and in November 2010 he signed a two- year contract with the club. At the same time, McCarter was also recognised as a future prospect for Ireland. The International Cricket Council (ICC) held a Europe Men's Academy in February 2011 for twelve of Europe's best players, and McCarter was one of four Ireland players to attend. In June that year, he was called up to Ireland's senior squad for the first time. However, he had to wait until September to make his first-class debut. The 2011 Under-19 Cricket World Cup Qualifier was held in July and August; McCarter took 14 wickets as Ireland secured one of the available places at the following year's Under-19 World Cup. Ireland faced Namibia in the 2011‚Äì13 ICC Intercontinental Cup, and in the absence of several first-choice players due to commitments to county cricket McCarter was included in the squad. Ireland won by five wickets and McCarter took a single wicket (that of Pikky Ya France, bowled) in the match while conceding 90 runs (1/90). In February 2012, McCarter was again part of the ICC's Europe Men's Academy. After playing regularly for Gloucestershire's second XI, he made his debut for the first team on 7 May 2012 during a Clydesdale Bank 40 match against Middlesex. He bowled Joe Denly to claim his maiden wicket in one day cricket, and finished with 3/41 as Gloucestershire won a rain-affected match. The same week, McCarter played his maiden County Championship match for the club; the only other first-class match he had played was for Ireland. The match against Yorkshire ended defeat. While McCarter scored 29 not out from 14 balls in his only innings, when he bowled he conceded 67 runs from 19 overs without taking a wicket.

History The crisis began when Colonel Robert Phayre was appointed as the Resident of Baroda. He had an increasingly negative relationship with Malhar Rao Gaekwad, the Gaekwar of Baroda. This antagonism culminated in the Baroda Enquiry which found 'serious misgovernment' in the state. However, instead of taking into account the findings of the report, Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook, the Viceroy of India, instead only gave the Gaekwar a warning. This allowed the bad relationship between Phayre and the Gaekwar to develop, with Phayre increasingly unwilling to work with Rao. The situation came to a head in November 1874. Phayre sent the Viceroy a damning report detailing the failings of the governance of the state. On the same day, the Gaekwar sent an urgent request to the Viceroy that Phayre be removed. Northbrook was sympathetic to the Gaekwar and, on 12 November sent word to Bombay that Phayre should be replaced. However, this action was taken too late as, on 9 March, an attempt was made to poison Phayre with a compound of arsenic. This led to the Gaekwar being convicted of high treason. By order of the Secretary of State for India, Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, Malhar Rao was deposed on 10 April 1875 and exiled to Madras, where he died in obscurity in 1882. Copland; traditional perspective Traditionally, most notably put forward by Ian Copland,http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid;=3862496 the Baroda Crisis can be viewed as a demonstration of governmental rivalries of British India. 'Official warfare' had long been occurring between the existing presidencies of Bombay and Calcutta, however, the Baroda crisis intensified the conflicts. Aitchinson, the British Foreign Secretary believed that India should be more centralised, which lead to Calcutta increasingly attempting to break into Bombay's sphere of influence. This was worsened by a series of reforms which meant that Bombay no longer had the power to appoint the Resident of Baroda. Bombay's poor handling of the Baroda crisis allowed Calcutta a convenient excuse to assume all of Bombay's powers. Bombay's key failing was its indecision, which ultimately allowed the crisis to develop far more that it otherwise would have done. Phayre had been established as unfit for residency long before the crisis began, but due to the volatile political situation, he was allowed to remain. This is because, if Bombay removed Phayre, it would appear that they could not control their staff, and therefore strengthen Calcutta's case for centralisation. When Bombay finally took the decision to remove Phayre, it was made far too late. Rowbotham; postcolonial perspective Judith Rowbotham puts forward the view that, when looked at from a post colonial perspective, the Baroda Crisis should primarily be viewed as a miscarriage of justice, and can be viewed as a way in which the British in India were able to manipulate the law to meet their political aims. Rather than being tried by a jury, the Gaekwar of Baroda was convicted via an enquiry, meaning that the British Raj was ultimately allowed to decide if he should be convicted. Furthermore, the Gaekwar could be found guilty under reasonable suspicion, rather than the more stringent requirements of a criminal trial. If the Gaekwar had been tried fairly, there is no doubt that the verdict would have been 'innocent'. Rowbotham argues that this verdict could then be used as a warning to princes of other states.

Narasinga Muniyaraiyar Nayanar is the 40th Nayanar saint. Traditional hagiographies like Periya Puranam (13th century CE) and Thiruthondar Thogai (10th century CE) detail his legendary life and services to the Hindu god Shiva.Narasinga Muniyaraiyar Nayanar was the chieftain of the state Tiru Munaipadi.Muniyaraiyar The saint was a contemporary of Sundarar. Hagiography Narasinga Muniyaraiyar Nayanar was the chieftain of the state Tiru Munaipadi. Muniyaraiyar The saint was a contemporary of Sundarar. Swami Sadananda points out that Sundarar lived few generations after Sambandar and Thirunavukkarasar. It is also learnt that the saint lived at Tirunavalur (Tirunamanullur), Narasinga Muniyaraiyar was the foster-father of Sundarar. The saint brought up Sundarar as a prince. The chieftain was the great devotee of Shiva and people were happy during his reign. He would arrange special pujas at Shiva temples on each Thiruvathirai star day (Ardra (nakshatra)). On this eve he was receiving Saiva devotees. The devotees used to smear with holy ashes on their bodies. On the Puja eve the devotees were fed sumptuously with royal feast. At the end of the feast he was donating more than one hundred gold coins to each devotee. There was a testing day for the chieftain. God has chosen the specific day to reveal the faith and devotion of Narasinga Muniyaraiyar. On one such Thiruvathirai puja day, a devotee attended puja with holy ashes smeared on his plain naked body. His presence gave rise to unusual perturbation among other devotees. Instead of developing detestation at the nudity, Muniyaraiyar rightly understood the amount of self-control and attitude of detachment developed by the devotee within himself. He gave the respectful welcome by prostrating before the saint and served the royal banquet with full of hospitality. The chieftain also extended 200 gold coins to the devotee. The reverence and respect shown by Narasinga Muniyaraiyar earned the benign grace of Shiva and the saint was liberated from the cycle of rebirth.

Distinctions Romero has been awarded with numerous international and national distinctions, such as: *Honorary Fellowship (2015) by American Institute of Architects; *Americas Property Award (2012); *50 Creative Pioneers in (2012) by Fast Company; *Movers and Shakers (of 2011) by Fast Company; *50 personalities of Mexico (2011); *Young Architects Award, Mexican Society of Architects (2009); *Red Dot Award: Best of the Best (2006) *2004 Bauhaus international award in Germany.  Architectectural Projects  =G-20 Convention Center= The Convention Center, located in Los Cabos, Mexico, was designed by fr¬∑ee to host the 2012 G-20 Los Cabos summit. It has a capacity of 6,500 people and an area of 5,400 square meters. It is set for conferences, exhibitions, festivals and other events and was built in less than seven months. One of the features is the green wall found in its structure, which is the largest in the world with an area of 2,700 square meters. = Soumaya Museum = The Soumaya Museum, located in Nuevo Polanco in Mexico City, was designed under the direction of Romero in 2010. It has an area of 22,000 square meters and exhibits about 70,000 objects from different collections from the 15th century until the 20th century. The exterior facade is composed of sixteen thousand hexagonal tiles, which generate a different effect depending on the angle at which you are standing. The internal structure is composed of a ramp with 6 floors, each with a specific theme. In October 2015, the number of visitors reached 5 million, the most visited private museum in the world. = New Mexico City international airport (NAICM) = rightThe new airport in Mexico City was designed in collaboration between fr¬∑ee and Foster + Partners; and promises to be one of the largest airports in the world and the largest in the Americas, with an area of 743,000 square meters. Arup is the engineer on the project and performed original masterplan. The terminal will use very little power, and so it will become the most sustainable airport in the world. It will have short spaces throughout the halls; therefore, no internal trains or subway tunnels will be used. It will have six lanes, and will be able to mobilize up to 120 million passengers per year. It is estimated that the project will require an investment of about 9,150 million dollars and is considered to be the most important work of the administration of the president Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. =Others Projects= *Eco Museum, Mexico City (2006-2007), described by Fernanda Canales in her book \\"Mexican architecture: 1900-2010\\" as a project that allows an association between the architecture with the general culture. *General Offices Inbursa, Mexico City (2001-2003). *Cervantes Tower: residential complex, Mexico City (2009-2010) *Teahouse, Jinhua, China (2004-2006), considered a project that placed Mexican architecture within the architectural platform that seemed unattainable to Mexico a few years ago. The masterplan was designed by Herzog & de Meuron, and the initiative goes back to Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. *Plaza Carso, Mexico City (2005-2017) Initiatives Romero and fr¬∑ee are involved in a wide range of educational and cultural activities. Regeneration, a project restoring selected pieces of modern Mexican architecture, preserves culture and creates awareness about the role of architecture and design in Mexico; Archivo Dise√±o y Arquitectura, located in Mexico City, situates a private collection and experimental exhibition space for industrial design objects; and \\"fr¬∑ee time\\" is a year-long fellowship bestowed upon a Mexican architect under the age of 35, providing an opportunity to travel and research a specific topic in depth.

Only two towers had been constructed before the Armistice with Germany caused the cancellation of the project. Origin British poster made during the 1917 U-boat crisis On 31 January 1917, it was announced to the German Reichstag that unrestricted submarine warfare would resume the next day, 1 February.This Day in History - 1 Feb 1917: Germany resumes unrestricted submarine warfare The renewed U-boat campaign was initially a great success; nearly 500,000 tons of shipping being sunk in both February and March, and 860,000 tons in April, when Britain's reserve of wheat fell to 6 weeks' supply. The British Admiralty redoubled its efforts to find effective remedy. Attention turned to the Strait of Dover, which was used by U-boats based in Bruges in occupied Belgium, to gain fast access to the Atlantic trade routes and the busy Western Approaches. If it could be successfully closed to them, they would have to take the much longer \\"Northern Route\\" around the north of Scotland, and therefore be able to spend less time on patrol. Existing countermeasures were the Dover Patrol of cruisers and destroyers, and the Dover Barrage, a line of steel anti-submarine nets supplemented by minefields stretching across the Strait, patrolled by destroyers, armed trawlers and drifters equipped with powerful searchlights, work on which had started in 1915. Although this had been improved by use of the new Mark H2 mine from mid-1917, it was not initially very successful as there was no agreement on the depth at which the mines should be tethered.Robert M. Grant, U-Boats Destroyed: The Effect of Anti-Submarine Warfare 1914-1918, Periscope Publishing Ltd 2002 (pp. 74-75), Until December 1917, only two U-boats had been destroyed by the barrage. Furthermore, the patrolling vessels were vulnerable to attack by German torpedo boats,Lawrence Sondhaus, World War One: The Global Revolution, Cambridge University Press 2011 (p.287), as in the action of 26‚Äì27 October 1916, and the action of 20 April 1917. The Engineer-in-Chief to the Admiralty, Sir Alexander Gibb, devised a scheme of eight or twelve large concrete and steel towers, placed at intervals on the sea bed across the Dover Strait from Folkestone to Cap Gris Nez. Stretched between the towers would be improved anti-submarine nets; each tower would be equipped with two 4-inch guns, searchlights and hydrophone detection equipment. Gibb had worked with T G Menzies and Colonel William McLellan on a submarine detection system based on a galvanometer, which was also to be incorporated.Engineering Timelines: Guy Maunsell There would be accommodation for 100 men on each of the towers. Construction In June 1918, an advance party of Royal Engineers arrived at Southwick Green in Sussex where they established a camp. Construction of the first two towers was soon underway on the south side of Shoreham harbour nearby, each one consisting of an 80 feet (25 metres) high reinforced concrete raft made from interlocking cells, surmounted by a 1,000 ton steel column 90 feet (27.5m) high and 40 feet (12m) wide. The cost of the whole project was ¬£12 million, an enormous sum for the time. The towers became visible for many miles around and were known locally as the \\"Shoreham mystery towers\\". With the Armistice in November 1918, the whole project was cancelled; only Tower Number 1 was approaching completion.Black Jack (Quarterly Magazine Southampton Branch World Ship Society) Issue No: 152 Autumn 2009: (p.6) SHOREHAM TOWERS - One of the Admiralty‚Äôs greatest engineering secrets, Reproduced from Engineering & Technology IET Magazine May 2009 Legacy The Nab Tower The Number One tower soon found an alternative use as a replacement for the Nab Rock lightship, 40 miles away off Bembridge in the Isle of Wight. On 12 September 1920, it was towed out of Shoreham harbour by five Admiralty tugs, watched by a crowd of thousands and was sunk on a sand spit next to the rock on the following day. The Nab Tower is still in use today. The second tower remained at Shoreham until 1924 when it was demolished over a period of 6 months. Amongst the Royal Engineer officers involved in the construction of the towers was Guy Maunsell who would later design the Maunsell Sea Forts in World War II.Engineering Timelines: Guy Maunsell References Category:20th-century forts in England Category:20th-century history of the Royal Navy Category:Coastal fortifications ","title":"Admiralty M-N Scheme"},{"id":"35748407","text":"The Avro 613 was a 1920s-proposed British design by Avro to meet an Air Ministry requirement for a twin-engined night bomber.

The case inspired widespread coverage, including two books and two television movies. Prosecutors alleged that Frances Schreuder did not want to be cut out of her father's will and wished to continue funding her lavish lifestyle. The killing Heiress Frances Berenice Schreuder (born on April 6, 1938, in Salt Lake City, and died on March 30, 2004) pressured her son Marc Schreuder to murder her father, oil and auto parts millionaire Franklin Bradshaw. The murder was committed on July 23, 1978, when Marc Schreuder shot his grandfather in the back of the head. Once Marc Schreuder's link to the crime was discovered, it was alleged that Frances Schreuder manipulated her son through an unhealthy and abusive form of triangulation, using her son to target and murder her father. One of the wrinkles of the case was that Frances Schreuder's mother Berenice Schreuder continued to support her daughter throughout the case and bequeathed to Frances a share of her estate. Marc Schreuder was convicted of second-degree murder in 1982 and spent 12 years in the Utah State Prison. Frances Schreuder was convicted for first-degree murder in 1983 and spent 13 years in prison. Books The case has inspired at least two nonfiction books: At Mother's Request: A True Story of Money, Murder and Betrayal by Jonathan ColemanColeman, Jonathan.

The island lies between the main flow of the Danube to the north and the parallel channel Karlovesk√© rameno to the south, between Dev√≠nska cesta in Bratislava and the Austrian border. It contains a culturally protected water source supplying tap water to a large portion of Bratislava citizens, as well as numerous nearby villages. Under communism, access to the island was restricted due to its proximity to the Austrian border and the only access bridge to the island was guarded by soldiers. Access to the island remained forbidden even after the end of communism and today, access is highly restricted. Since 15 May 2012, the island is a protected area and there is currently an initiative to declare the island a national park and connect it with the neighboring Danube-Auen National Park in Austria. History In the past, Siho≈• was called K√§smacherinsel in German and Syr√°rsky ostrov in Slovak. The name is derived from the dwellings of peasants who processed milk. It was the largest Danube island in all of the Hungarian kingdom. The area was inspected by Bernhard Salbach from Dresden in 1881‚Äì1882 and the island was found to be a good water source. Salbach also designed the system supplying drinking water to the historical center of the city, which remains operational until today. Bratislava established its first waterworks in the 1880s, becoming one of the first cities in Europe to build a water supply system. The first pilot well was dug on Siho≈• island in 1882 and it is preserved as a historical monument until today. After the properties of the water were confirmed to be sound, construction work was ceremonially launched. Besides the well, the first facilities of the waterworks included a pumping station at Karlova Ves and a reservoir at Som√°rsky vrch. A regular supply of high-quality drinking water has been provided ever since. The main waterworks were built in 1885. Description The 235 hectare-area of the island belongs to the company ≈†t√°tne Lesy, which is conducting timber harvesting on the island despite the area being protected. All water wells, water supply infrastructure and all buildings and roads on the island belong to the Bratislava Water Company. The island is part of the hunting ground Dev√≠nska Kobyla which is casually used by the hunters for the last 60 years, despite the area being protected. In 2007, the head of ≈†t√°tne Lesy Jozef Minƒè√°≈° signed a contract with hunting organization Klenovica giving it the right to hunt on the island for 10 years for the fee of 440 euro per year. Animals being hunted on the island include wild boar, red deer and ducks. Flora and fauna Most of the island is forested with the remnants of the primeval riparian forest that is partially flooded during high water levels on the Danube each year and during extreme events, most of the island becomes submerged. At least since 1886, public access to the island was largely prohibited due to the protection of the drinking water supply system. Due to low human activity, wildlife is abundant on the island. Siho≈• features a variety of protected plants including Snowdrops, Lily of the Valley and Lesser celandine. The ecosystem is largely intact, save for some limited legal logging. Animals include: beavers, wild boar, red deer and ducks.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description The hotel was built in 1896, at a time when Meeker was a prominent stagecoach stop and visitors were drawn to the beauty of the White River Valley.Colorado's Historic Hotels; July 7, 2011; Clark, Alexandra Walker; The History Press At this time there were many hotels in Meeker, but none compared with the brick structure built by Rueben Sanford Ball. An east and west wing were added to the hotel in 1904, greatly expanding its square footage and boosting the number of rooms to forty. A series of pictures by H.A. Wildhack depict the building of the hotel. Between June 9, 1896 and July 15, 1896, a large pile of bricks is transformed into the shell of the building that still stands 115 years later. Materials were being shipped by freight wagon from Rifle. The story is that Ball, after losing an establishment in Creede, Colorado to a fire, went to great lengths to build a hotel that would pass the test of time. The hotel's walls range from three to six bricks thick. The Meeker Hotel is the only historic hotel still standing in the northwest corner of Colorado. Its unique brick fa√ßade adds a picturesque quality as does its rounded glass bays on each side of the main building. The front of the building has a wide balcony overlooking Main Street, the native flagstone courthouse built in 1935, and one of the original barracks used during the time of the Meeker Massacre (now the White River Museum). ‚ÄúEven if you are just passing though, stop off at this old hotel and take a look around the restored lobby.

Most of the Meeker Hotel's elk have joined the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation's national World Record Elk Tour and many guests make the pilgrimage just to see them. ‚ÄúI found a picture of the Meeker Hotel Lobby taken back in 1906‚Ä¶The large bull elk is a big typical 427 3/8. In the hotel there is another great elk that had fallen off the wall over the years and has two large bolts through the antlers holding them onto the old mount. Unfortunately this is another great record elk that cannot officially go into record book because of its cracked skull. It is a 9x8 typical with a gross score of B&C; 460 netting about 450. Just think about that the little town of Meeker with two world record Elk greater than records of today, dating from the turn of the century. I will be displaying them both in the 1999 World Record Elk Tour.‚Äù.Eastman's Journal; Eastman, Mike; Jan/Feb 1997,47-48 Alongside these giants are a collection of different animals from the area slowly collected by a succession of owners. A mountain lion, coyotes, regional foxes, antelope, a bear skin and even porcupines are stuffed and on display. The first owner and current owner have also contributed two moose and a caribou from Alaska. Sitting beside the stairway is an enormous elk that has been observing the lobby since 1904. It is the set of antlers that is now displayed proudly on the hotel's stationery, bumper stickers and T-shirts. All animals depicted in their merchandise come from their collection. The stairway is over six feet wide with a handmade railing that resembles a tree trunk and limbs. At the top of the stairs are twelve rooms and a guest lounge. Over the years, the original rooms have combined to create six two room suites and six single rooms, each with their own bath. Many of the baths still contain the original claw foot bathtubs. The rooms are named for something that has been a part of the hotel's western history or a guest who has stayed there: Susan C. Wright, Gary Cooper, Billy the Kid, Nathan Meeker, Tom Horn, Big Bull Elk, Eleanor Roosevelt, Chief Ouray, Painted Lady, R.S. Ball, Theodore Roosevelt, Augusta Wallihan, and Charlie Dunbar. History As more settlers arrived in the White River Valley during the year 1883, the military encampment slowly transformed into a permanent town. One such settler was a plucky, good-natured, strong-willed woman who had made the trip from South Carolina on her own. Her name was Susan C. Wright. She immediately saw the opportunity available in the sale of the old army barracks and made the decision to acquire one. While she worked to open a hotel, she accepted a position on the newly formed Town Company Association. Susan was the only woman who joined the Town Company and with her common sense approach she organized community harvests and grain saving programs that insured that everyone in town had enough food to get through the winter. One year, when there was a little extra, she was famous for making cornmeal and johnny cakes for each family. She would soon be known affectionately as the ‚ÄúMother of Meeker‚Äù. The large rock in front of the present-day Rio Blanco Courthouse has a plaque commemorating the first members of the Town Company. Both of the Meeker Hotel's founders, Susan Wright and Charlie Dunbar, are engraved on it. Other names include John C. Davis, William H. Clark, Newton Major and J.W. Hugus (the banking future millionaire who still has a building named after him in Meeker- the one sitting beside the Meeker Hotel). The town was incorporated in 1885 and became the county seat of Rio Blanco County. For the next twenty years, Meeker remained the only incorporated town in Northwestern Colorado. Susan Wright opened the Meeker Hotel to the public in the fall of 1883. Initially it was the first hotel within a hundred-mile radius, but quickly more hotels began to spring up, including the Antler Hotel and the Ranch Hotel. The Meeker Hotel became famous for its western hospitality as Susan Wright was known to never turn down a traveler. Her hotel, the caf√© and saloon she ran inside were a welcome respite for many weary travelers. Stories still remain of Sarah Wright's fun-loving side and the long conversations she would indulge in, oftentimes while enjoying a nice cigar! The hotel was opened as partnership between Susan C. Wright and Charlie Dunbar. It seemed a good fit as Susan could focus on the accommodations and food while Charlie could run the saloon. Unfortunately, this did not last long. Susan lost her partner, shortly after the hotel opened. Charlie, a keen gambler, became embroiled in a card game argument, leading to gunshots and his death. The next year, Susan had replaced him with a new partner, Simp Harp, the owner of the successful stagecoach line traveling throughout western Colorado. With the amount of stagecoach travel and expansion west, the Meeker Hotel prospered. The July 3, 1886 issue of the Meeker Herald reports ‚ÄúThe French glass recently arrived from Denver, and has been placed behind the bar and adds greatly to the appearance of the saloon.‚Äù Sadly, in 1892, Susan Wright became ill and after a year died. She willed her personal property and real estate to her brother, Rueben S. Ball, who had moved from Creede, Colorado to help his sister run her beloved hotel while she was ill.The Historic Meeker Hotel and Cafe; Ritchie, Kimberly In 1896, R.S. Ball set out on an ambitious plan to expand the hotel. The humble barrack was replaced with an impressive, two-story structure with a double-brick fire wall that Ball requested. Ball had lost a successful saloon in Creede to a devastating fire and was not going to make the same mistake twice. He hired local builder I.G. Mitchell to help make his dream come true. He designed five large arched windows and instructed the masonry crew in a distinctive design still unique in the 21st century. Above all of it was an engraved flagstone with the name Meeker Hotel and below it in smaller print, R.S. Ball. Throughout the next thirty years, Ball carefully labeled most pieces of Meeker Hotel furniture with these same initials. There are many people in the area who still have antique furniture with R.S. Ball carved neatly into them. In 1904, only eight years his last improvements, Ball felt compelled to expand again. I.G. Mitchell was once again used to add an east and west wing and attention was paid to continuing the same style. Arched windows and corbeled cornices added nice flair to what had become a large brick structure, constituting 200,000 bricks, all shipped by freight wagon from Rifle, Colorado. Among many other things, R.S. Ball left the hotel with a legacy that would carry throughout the next 125 years. His love of hunting and adventure (he traveled to Cuba and Alaska once he had his hotel on solid ground) can still be seen today. Ball created an extraordinary hunting trophy collection that unbeknownst to him has inspired later owners. The names hanging below many of the mounts are Ball, Dunbar, Dunn and Ritchie (all past or current owners). Others are of friends and relatives who over the years have contributed to the Meeker Hotel's rich heritage. A legacy and tribute to the hotel's White River history, the collection is exhibited in the hotel lobby and throughout the hotel. In the spring of 1923, the Ball family sold the Meeker Hotel to Mr. and Mrs. Clarence P. Mathis. In 1935, the hotel was purchased by Paul and Goldie Dunn. The Dunn's were responsible for making extensive improvements, the most important of which was adding bathrooms as well as steam heat. The Dunn's operated the hotel for nearly thirty years. During the late sixties and seventies, the hotel's ownership shifted a number of times. It was owned by a Louisiana oil man as well as a hopeful miner, but in 1979 it was purchased by Dave Stewart. In the next seventeen years, Stewart continued the long process of slowly upgrading and renovating the building. Often it was a labor of love for an old building that had survived a couple of decades of rough treatment. In 1996, he sold the Meeker Hotel to James Ritchie. Since that time, James and Kimberly Ritchie have continued to slowly renovate the building. In 1996, the lobby was entirely renovated. The quarter- sawn oak was stripped of dark brown paint, the lobby was made into one room instead of two, the staircase was redone, the tin ceiling was exposed, and the floors refinished. The large wood stove and the etched glass wildlife scene were added. In 2002, the Caf√© underwent an extensive four-month renovation, uncovering the hardwood floor, the brick walls and the tin ceiling. James Ritchie crafted the lodge pole pine booths and live oak and maple tables. In 2011, upgrades were made to the rooms, including period porcelain tile and pedestal sinks in the baths as well as upgrades to the hundred foot long-eight foot wide main hallway. Meeker Caf√© history The stone building, which currently houses the Meeker Caf√©, was originally called the Vorges Bldg. It opened for business on May 9, 1891 as Meeker's new Post Office building. In 1904, it became the 1st National Bank Building and in 1918, Rueben S. Ball moved the caf√© out of the hotel to its present location. Phil Jensen, longtime resident of Meeker, related a story of how back in the early 1930s he sat in the caf√©'s antique booths when they were located in the Midwest Caf√© in Craig. Sometime in the mid 1930s the art deco style booths, counter top and bar back were moved to the Meeker Caf√©. Famous guests ‚ÄúThe illustrious guest list includes Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt, Gary Cooper, Billy the Kid and more recently Vice President Dick Cheney.‚ÄùColorado, 2011; Insights Guide; Apa Publications UK LTD, 283 =Billy the Kid= July 6, 1889 Here is some background and how the Meeker Hotel came to be a part of the mystery. Billy the Kid was one of the most famous outlaws in the history of the Old West. However, most of his years remain mysterious. He has been described as both a cold-blooded killer and as a romantic Robin Hood. He was extremely loyal to his many friends, and extremely dangerous to anyone he considered an enemy. He will forever be remembered as an immortal figure of a lawless era. Billy the Kid was born William Henry McCarty around the year 1860. His birthplace is uncertain, but during his childhood he lived in Indiana, Kansas and Colorado before his family settled in Silver City, New Mexico. After the death of his mother, Catherine, Billy the Kid was left parentless and turned to a life of crime as early as age thirteen. He became involved in New Mexico's infamous Lincoln County War where he was accused of killing Sheriff Brady. He was arrested in 1880 for that murder, but escaped jail. Billy the Kid was then hunted down by Pat Garrett and is believed by many to have been shot on July 14, 1881. To confuse matters, numerous Billy the Kid sightings were made in New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado after this date- leading many to question the validity of The Kid's death. Claims were made that he lived under his many aliases (Billy McCarty, William H. Bonney) and mischievously flaunted his identity. Always a few steps ahead of the law!. The plot thickens in 1950, when ninety-year-old Brushy Bill Roberts (pictured on right side) claims to be Billy the Kid and seeks a pardon from the Governor of New Mexico. Brushy Bill's attorney had requested a private meeting due to his client's poor health, but the governor ignored the request and invited dozens of guests including photographers and reporters. Brushy Bill suffered a stroke during the interview and answered many questions incorrectly. Unfortunately, before the matter could be further explored Brushy Bill Roberts died of a second heart attack only a few weeks later, leaving the matter unresolved. Billy the Kid historians are split down the middle on whether Brushy Bill Roberts was the real thing, but nonetheless the Meeker Hotel is left with the faded signature of William H. Bonney lingering in the dusty hotel registry from the summer of 1889. =Theodore Roosevelt= Theodore Roosevelt stayed at the Meeker Hotel in the winter of 1901. He was inspired to write a book about the area. The Meeker Herald of January 12, 1901 reported: \\"Gates Keenesburg left Tuesday afternoon for Rifle with a swell tallyho and fours handled by the prince of jehus Ed Wolcott, for the purpose of meeting a select party of gentlemen who had previously made arrangements to enjoy a few weeks‚Äô vacation in this out-of-the-way place. It was nearly eight o‚Äôclock last evening when the rig returned to Meeker, and among its occupants were none less than Hon. Theodore Roosevelt, of Oyster Bay, N.Y. They were at once taken to St. James rectory, where the Rev. H.A. Handel had an elegant spread awaiting them. In deference to the vice-president-elect's wishes it was pre-arranged that there would be no public demonstration, but there was a general desire to meet and shake hands with the distinguished gentleman. However, it was near midnight before the party proceeded to the Meeker Hotel, where rooms were reserved for them, and but few had the pleasure of an introduction. That the famous ‚Äúrough rider‚Äù will find plenty of sport in the next three weeks goes without saying.‚Äù ‚Äú[Theodore Roosevelt] killed his cougar near Meeker, Co in 1901. It measured 15 12/16 inches (skull measurement). President Roosevelt was given outright claim to the record for about 53 years.‚Äù.Outdoor Empire; May 18, 1971 With the assassination of President McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, 42, became the youngest President in the Nation's history. He brought new excitement and power to the Presidency, as he vigorously led Congress and the American public toward progressive reforms and a strong foreign policy. He crusaded endlessly on matters big and small, exciting audiences with his high-pitched voice, jutting jaw, and pounding fist. \\"The life of strenuous endeavor\\" was a must for those around him, Leaving the Presidency in 1909, Roosevelt went on an African safari, then jumped back into politics. In 1912, while campaigning he was shot in the chest by a fanatic. Roosevelt soon recovered, but his words at that time would have been applicable at the time of his death in 1919: \\"No man has had a happier life than I have led; a happier life in every way.\\" Eleanor Roosevelt and Gary Cooper have also stayed at the hotel. Ghosts The Meeker Hotel claims a couple, seldom seen ghosts. One is called Charlie Dunbar (an original owner in 1883) who was shot in a gunfight reportedly on the premises of the hotel when it was still an old barrack. They say the fire, in the big wood-burning stove, is sometimes stoked in the morning, and female guests report feeling a gentleman taking their elbow to help them down the long stairs. Another is referred to as the Painted Lady because guests are sometimes awakened by a strong smell of perfume in the middle of the night and the door of a certain room oftentimes ‚Äòsticks‚Äô and cannot be opened.

She was killed in a car bombing of the United States Embassy, Saigon. Robbins was the first female employee to be killed in action in the CIA's history, the first American woman killed in the Vietnam War and, as of 2012, the youngest CIA employee to die in action. Robbins was born in South Dakota and raised primarily in Colorado, where she received secretarial training at Colorado State University from 1961-1963. She joined the CIA soon after graduation, motivated by a desire to participate in efforts to combat communism. Robbins, who had not previously traveled outside the United States, volunteered for the assignment in Saigon. When asked by her father Buford, a Navy veteran, about her decision, she reportedly told him: \\"When they [the Communists] get to West Colfax [a Denver neighborhood], mister, you'll wish you'd done something.\\" On March 30, 1965, a car bomb exploded outside the embassy. Before the explosion, there was a confrontation between the driver and a policeman and Robbins went to the window of her second-story office to see what was happening; she was killed instantly. A Filipino storekeeper serving in the US Navy was killed, along with 19 Vietnamese. The CIA honored Robbins with a star on the Memorial Wall in its headquarters building in Langley, Virginia. The wall pays tribute to personnel killed while working for the agency. However, for many years the agency omitted Robbins' name from the display's Book of Honor, which lists the names of the slain employees, citing security concerns since Robbins was working under the guise of an employee of the State Department. In May 2011, CIA Director Leon Panetta announced that Robbins' name would be inscribed in the Book of Honor. Robbins was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor First Class by South Vietnamese Foreign Minister Tran Van Do. References External links * Article: Remembering CIA's Heroes: Barbara A.

It covered Swedish Pomerania (New Hither Pomerania [aka New Western Pomerania] and R√ºgen) which had fallen to Prussia in 1815. The special legal position of this territory was the reason for the creation of what was then the smallest government region in the whole of Prussia. Unlike the rest of the Province of Pomerania, neither General Prussian State Law nor the laws and ordinances of the so-called Stein- Hardenberg reforms (such as the Local Government Act of 1808), as they were called at the time, applied here. An alignment of the legal position was only gradually achieved in the second half of the 19th century, and was largely completed on the introduction of the Civil Code (BGB) in January 1900. But in some areas, special legal forms continued to exist, a situation that was unlike anywhere else in Prussia and Germany and which even went back to the time of Swedish rule, for example, the so-called '. As a result, the , which moved from Wismar via Stralsund to Greifswald in 1802/03, still operated under this name when seated in Greifswald and continued as the final arbiter of proper jurisdiction for the region until 1848. The first regional government was inaugurated on 5 January 1818 by the upper president of the Province of Pomerania, , in his office. This followed several years of discussion about the status of the region. That produced three options: # Form a separate province of New Hither Pomerania and R√ºgen # Form a separate government region within the Province of Pomerania # Immediately integrate it into the existing Region of Stettin An appeal by the districts and towns to the king against the formation of the government region was dismissed. However, the Prussian system of taxation was only introduced in New Hither Pomerania following a royal cabinet order of 19 November 1821.Martin Wehrmann: Geschichte von Pommern. Bd. 2, Weltbild Verlag 1992, Reprint der Ausgaben von 1919 und 1921, , p. 286 Because of its small size the Region of Stralsund was one of those Prussian government regions which was up for re-negotiation from the outset. Only a few years after its formation there were further discussions about its future. In the end it was its aforementioned special legal status that prevented its dissolution time and again. Not until 1 October 1932 was it merged in the Stettin Region.  Administrative divisions in the mid-19th century  The Stralsund government region is divided into four counties, three of which take their name from the towns in which the district councils are located. The fourth, however, takes its name after the island of R√ºgen, of which it is composed alone. New Hither Pomerania has three districts: , , . R√ºgen forms the district of R√ºgen. In ecclesiastical terms the government region is divided into eleven superintendencies, of which three cover the Franzburg district, two the Grimmen district, three the Greifswald district and three the island of R√ºgen. All parishes are Protestant.The parishes referred to were then part of the old-Prussian Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania. However, later other religious groups established congregations too. Only in Stralsund is there a Catholic church, to which all Catholics in the government region belong.Provincial Calendar for New Hither Pomerania and the Principality of R√ºgen in the year 1851, p. 240  Population growth in the 19th century  * 1805: 118,112 * 1825: 142,312 * 1840: 169,114 * 1849: 185,426 * 1861: 208,429 * 1871: 208,276 * 1880: 216,130Handbuch f√ºr Neu-Vorpommern und das F√ºrstenthum R√ºgen auf das Jahr 1888, p. 166  Districts in 1900  In 1900 the Region of Stralsund comprised one urban (Stadtkreis) and four rural districts (Kreise). It covered an area of 4,010.88 km¬≤, on which there were 873 towns and villages and in which 216,340 inhabitants lived. * Stadtkreis: ** Stralsund (from 1873): 31,076 inhabitants *Kreise: ** : 41,704 inhabitants ** : 61,840 inhabitants ** : 35,540 inhabitants ** R√ºgen (seat: Bergen on R√ºgen): 46,270 inhabitants  Districts in 1925  In 1925 the population of the Region of Stralsund was 246,941. *Stadtkreise: ** Stralsund: 39,469 ** Greifswald (from 1912): 27,622 *Kreise: ** Franzburg: 45,721 ** Greifswald: 40,085 ** Grimmen: 40,150 ** R√ºgen: 53,894 In 1925 the seat of the council for the Franzburg district was moved to Barth. From 1 February 1928 the district was officially renamed \\"Franzburg-Barth\\". In 1939 all rural districts in Germany were uniformly termed as Landkreis (i.e. rural district), whereas before in Prussia the term Kreis prevailed. However, this played no role for the Stralsund Region which was already absorbed in 1932.

In 1952 on the occasion of redistricting East Germany into new administrative units the eastern part of the Franzburg-Barth became the within the likewise new Region (Bezirk) of Rostock of the GDR. The western part went to the newly formed . The old district of Grimmen lost its southern part around Loitz in 1952, which went to the in the new Region of Neubrandenburg, as did the southern part of the old district of Greifswald which went to the new and thus also to the Neubrandenburg Region. In 1952 the eastern part of the old district of Greifswald around Wolgast formed the new along with that part of the island of Usedom that remained within East Germany post-1945. The district of R√ºgen was divided in 1952 into the and , but they were merged again already in 1955. While Stralsund city maintained its independence as urban district through these changes, Greifswald was meanwhile integrated into the district of Greifswald until the 1970s. In 1994, the districts of Grimmen, Ribnitz- Damgarten and Stralsund, now in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (aka Mecklenburg-Hither Pomerania), were merged into the new district of Northern Hither Pomerania, whilst the districts of Anklam, Greifswald and Wolgast joined Eastern Hither Pomerania. R√ºgen remained unchanged, Greifswald and Stralsund also retained their independence. As part of the planned local government reform, from 2011 the districts of R√ºgen and Northern Hither Pomerania, and the town of Stralsund formed a reshaped district of Northern Hither Pomerania, and the districts of Uecker-Randow, together with the town of Greifswald and parts of the district of Demmin, became Hither Pomerania- Greifswald.

It lies between the settlements of Barrmill and hamlet of Burnhouse on a crossroads of the B706 and the lanes to Nettlehirst and Tandlehill via Thirdpart. It is named after the 'Green Hill' an artificial mound, a Moot, Law or Justice hill that once stood here. The settlement lay within the old Barony of Giffen; the castle no longer exists. The village lies within Barrmill and District Community Association's area and is also covered by Beith Community Council.  History  Greenhills Public School WW1 Memorial, now located at Barrmill.

A temporary building in the playground was used as a dining hall. It was built on the site of the cart wheel workshop and was midway between Burnhouse and Barrmill. Greenhills closed in 1959, it was sold in 1964Jamieson, Page 25 and demolished in the mid-1980s; having been used for some years as a glue factory by Strathbond Ltd who still trade from the Willowyard Estate, Beith.

John Marshall and Francis Douglas at this site made ploughs that sold all over the country, known as the Douglas Grubber. A joiner's shop stood next to the smithy, its machinery being driven by steam. The wheel wright's factory site was later used for the school and more recently a private dwelling.Jamieson, Page 17 A limekiln was situated behind the school, made in the shape of a horseshoe with the opening facing the prevailing south-west wind. It was encased within a bank with a gap at the opening.Jamieson, Page 5 A limestone quarry existed close to the school site. =The Moot or Justice hill= Flower tub at Greenhills installed and maintained by the Barrmill Conservation group. This artificial mound or moot hill was the site where proclamations of the Giffen Castle Baronial Court's judgements were made. For serious crimes the men were hung here and women were drowned a pit which would have been nearby. This situation, known as the feudal Barony right of 'pit and gallows' existed at many other sites, such as at Beith, Kilmarnock, Aiket, Ardrossan, and Dalry. Often the mounds were wooded and a Dule Tree may have been used as the gallows. Brehons or Judges administered justice from 'Court Hills', especially in the highlands. Auchenmade had a Law hill mound nearby, possibly destroyed by the railway. The 'Green Hill' stood near to Greenhill farm.Dobie, Page 163.

Tours focus on topics such as historical quilt making, the lives of children in colonial times, and basic facets of 19th century life. The museum also offers weekend family activities. Exhibitions =American Period Rooms= The museum contains over 30 rooms decorated and furnished in a colonial revival style, with a wide variety of sizes, furnishings and room types. Rooms range from men's studies to contemporary bedrooms to a large attic filled with children's toys. Each room is sponsored by a different NSDAR organization, and vary in age. Photographic tours of period rooms may be taken at the DAR Museum website =Fashioning The New Woman: 1890-1925= The museum is currently hosting an exhibition entitled \\"Fashioning The New Woman: 1890-1925.\\" The exhibition demonstrates trends and changes in women's fashions between the late 19th century and the flapper era. The exhibition discusses trends in women's fashion at the end of the 19th century. At the time, Victorian styles of dress were more common, with bustles, skirts, and other layered items of clothing composing the majority of women's wardrobes. As women began pursuing lifestyles with more activity, activism and sport, these clothing trends began to change towards more modern attire. The exhibit examines the societal changes that accompanied these new fashions, and discusses the lives of key figures in the transformation. =Quilt Collection= The DAR Museum is a contributing member of the Quilt Index searchable quilt database. The museum collects and maintains quilts from the late 1800s and early 1900s in a collection of over 500 quilts and coverlets from the era. Utilizing an active DAR member base and extensive genealogical and family histories of owners, quilt makers and their families, many quilts are accompanied by significant personal histories and stories of their creation and ownership. The museum and NSDAR also run a Quilt Camp summer program for children aged 10‚Äì17. References External links * Category:History museums in Washington, D.C.

When reference is made to its Greek version, this text is usually known as Liturgy of Saint Mark (or Anaphora of Saint Mark). Present usage This liturgy can be used at present by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, as well as by the Coptic Catholic Church, during the Lent time or in the month of Koiak, but its prolongation and particular melodies makes its use uncommon today. This text does not cover the whole Divine Liturgy, extending only from the pre-anaphorical rites (the prayer of the veil) to the distribution of the Communion, thus including the anaphora in the strict sense of the word. The Coptic Liturgy of Saint Basil is used for the remaining part of the service. In the Byzantine Rite, the Liturgy of Saint Mark, as transmitted by the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria, is used in a few places each year on the feast day of Saint Mark by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, which authorized it in 2007. History Saint Barbara church According to liturgical tradition, Christianity was brought in Alexandria in Egypt by Saint Mark. The town then acquired importance as a center of church government and Christian theology with its Catechetical School. The liturgical uses that developed locally are known as the Alexandrian Rite, and the texts used for the celebration of the Eucharist are known as the Liturgy of Saint Mark. The lingua franca of the Western world in the early centuries of Christianity was the Koine Greek, and the Liturgy of Saint Mark was in such a language. The translation of this liturgy in Coptic, used by most of Egyptian population at that time, is attributed to Saint Cyril of Alexandria in the first half of the 5th century. Thus the Greek version of this liturgy is usually known as Liturgy of Saint Mark, while its Coptic version is regularly called Liturgy of Saint Cyril, even if the formal name of the latter is \\"the Anaphora of our holy father Mark the Apostle, which the thrice-blessed Saint Cyril the Archbishop established\\". The oldest survived complete manuscripts of both the Liturgy of Saint Mark and of Saint Cyril date from the High Middle Ages. From the 5th century to the High Middle Ages both versions developed on parallel and mutually interconnected lines, with reciprocal translations and with most of the additions added to both of them. Both versions have some own peculiar material. The use of the Liturgy of Saint Mark by the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria was blamed by the Patriarch of Antioch and canonist Theodore Balsamon at the beginning of the 13th century. Manuscript Tradition The first millennium witnesses of the early stages of this liturgy are the following fragments: * the Strasbourg papyrus, written in the 4th or 5th century, includes the first part of the preface, with the paraphrase of Malachi followed by some short intercessions and it ends with a doxology. Scholars disagree on whether this prayer in the 3rd century was in itself a complete anaphora. * the John Rylands parchment 465, written in Greek in the 6th century and badly conserved, includes the text from the first epiclesis up to the end of the anaphora. * the British Museum Tablet, written in Coptic in the 8th century, includes the text from the first epiclesis up to the second epiclesis. * some Sahidic Coptic fragments. Other ancient texts which belong to the Alexandrian Rite are important in the study of the development of the Liturgy of Saint Mark: the Anaphora of Serapion is the earlier witness of some ancient material, the Anaphora of Barcelona and the Deir Balyzeh Papyrus are different developments based on the same material, the Cathecheses of Cyril of Jerusalem are useful to trace the relationship with the Liturgy of St. James. The earlier manuscripts of the Liturgy of Saint Cyril date from the 12th century and are in Bohairic Coptic. It is not known whether they derive directly from the Greek or through lost Sahidic versions. These manuscripts include some additions not found in the Liturgy of Saint Mark in Greek, but in general their readings are closer to the first millennium fragments than those of the Greek version. The earlier manuscripts of the Liturgy of Saint Mark are: the Codex Rossanensis,Codex Rossanensis, Vatican Library Gr. 1970, 12th century the Rotulus Vaticanus,Rotulus Vaticanus, Vatican Library Gr. 2281 dated 1207 the incomplete Rotulus Messanensis.Rotulus Messanensis, Messina Gr. 177, 12th century Another witness is the lost manuscript of the library of the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria, copied in 1585‚Äì6 by Patriarch Meletius Pegas. The Rotulus Vaticanus, and even more the text copied by Pegas, show a progress in the process of assimilation to Byzantine usages. Structure of the anaphora Saint Cyril of Alexandria The anaphora of Saint Mark (or Saint Cyril) found in the High Middle Ages manuscripts shows all the typical peculiarities of the Alexandrine Rite, such as a long Preface which includes an offering and immediately followed by the intercessions, two epiclesis, the absence of the Benedictus in the Sanctus. The structure of the anaphora (in the strict sense of the word) can be so summarized: * the Opening Dialogue, * the preface, composed by: **praises to the Father for the creation of heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them (quoting as usually found in the Alexandrine anaphoras), followed by praises also to Christ, **a first Oblation, offering the reasonable sacrifice and the bloodless worship (ref. Romans), followed by a paraphrase of Malachi , * Intercessions section, composed by: ** lengthy prayers for the Church, the livings, the deaths, making memory of Saint Mark and of Mary, and followed by the diptychs, ** a second Oblation, requesting that the offerings are received in the heavenly altar as were the sacrifices of Abel and Abraham (similar to the \\"Supra quae - Supplices te\\" of the Roman Canon), ** additional intercessions for the livings, including the names of the current Pope of Alexandria and bishop, * a well developed Pre-Sanctus, * the Sanctus, without the Benedictus as usual in early Egypt, followed by a short Post-Sanctus centered on Christ, * a first epiclesis that simply asks God to fill the sacrifice with blessing through the descent of the Holy Spirit, * the Institution narrative, in which are pronounced the Words of Institution, * the Anamnesis of the Passion, Resurrection and Ascension of Christ, * a third Oblation, offering the bread and the cup, * a second epiclesis directed to the Holy Spirit, with an explicit request to change the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ. This epiclesis uses the aorist tense, thus simply narrating a conversion without stating whether it occurs in the present, future or past. * a final prayer for the fruits of the Communion. In the present use of the Coptic Orthodox Church, the section containing the Intercessions and the second Oblation has been moved to the end of the anaphora, following the pattern used in the Coptic Liturgies of Saint Basil and Saint Gregory based an Antiochene structure.

Jacques (born 24 July 1956) is a Canadian author, activist, sex researcher, and IT consultant based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. His research and writing are in the area of consensual BDSM, sexual fetishism and sexual health. He is also a BDSM switch. Jacques is best known for two notable sex books: On The Safe Edge: A Manual for SM Play and Alternate Sources. Biography Jacques attended St. Joseph's College, Birkfield, Ipswich, a school run by the De La Salle brothers, from 1967 to 1974. He earned his degree in Physics from the Imperial College of Science and Technology in 1978, thereby becoming an associate of the Royal College of Science (A.R.C.S.) and graduate the Institute of Physics (GradInstP.). From 1979, he worked for Seismograph Service Ltd. as a field seismologist off the coast of the French Congo and Gabon and in England, for two and a half years, before designing the acceptance test specifications and procedure for the missile management system of a European aircraft for Computing Devices Company, in Hastings, East Sussex. In 1981, he emigrated to Toronto to work at Spar Aerospace for nine years on an infrared surveillance system for the Canadian and U.S. navies. Subsequently, he moved to SmartStar and Orapro (database companies) in Toronto, as head of technical support and then director of consulting. He was CIO at Stott Pilates (now Merrithew Health and Fitness) for three years (1998-2001), and continues to provide IT consulting to the company. =Later= He co-founded Toronto's Safer SM Education seminar series in 1991, along with co-authors of On The Safe Edge, Dr. Dale McCarthy (1937-2007, co- founder of the AIDS Committee of Toronto (ACT)), Michael Hamilton, and Sniffer (the latter being a dentist and teacher at the University of Toronto), and both organised and presented the seminars for thirteen years (1991-2004). The seminars led to both the publication of On The Safe Edge and updated versions of Safer SM (a BDSM safer sex pamphlet published by the AIDS Committee of Toronto). Jacques edited and published Gay Guide Canada, 1997, and Canada's Gay Guide, 1998 and 1999. He also sponsored the production and printing Toronto's Pride Guide in 1996, 1997, and 1998 on behalf of Pride Toronto. In 2001 and 2002, he edited and published the souvenir guide for the Mr. Leatherman Toronto Competition. Jacques has contributed articles, interviews, and expert advice to dozens of magazines, newspapers, and radio and television stations in North America and Europe. Jacques served as an expert witness in the 1998 \\"Bondage Bungalow\\" case in north Toronto. On The Safe Edge was cited in the submissions by the BDSM community in London, England to the Law Commission as it prepared its report \\"Consent in the Criminal Law\\" (consultation paper 139), as a result of the Spanner case. In 2009, Jacques was featured in the fourth Canadian edition of the sexuality textbook Understanding Human Sexuality.Understanding Human Sexuality, In Focus 15.2, pp. 476-477. , Jacques's most recent publication is BDSM: Safer Kinky Sex, in both English and French, for the AIDS Committee of Toronto. It is the third major revision of a safer sex education pamphlet created and edited by the Toronto BDSM community, this time large enough to take the form of a booklet. He also edited the two variants of the previous version (see References). Jacques was invited by ACT to launch the French version in Montr√©al, in May, 2011.

It was one of the first to use a new type of laminar flow airfoil, optimised for both high and low speed flight. One example finished fourth in the 1963 World Gliding Championships. Design and development The first of the four Uribel variants, the Uribel A, was a single seat version of the earlier EC 38/56 Urendo, mounting its wing at a high position on a new fuselage with a V-tail. The most important development in the series was a change in wing profile from the Uribel A's NACA 6 series to the Eppler 257 of the Uribel B. The Eppler airfoil has low drag in the two speed ranges that sailplanes mostly use: low, when soaring in thermals and high for flight between them. The higher drag region between these speed ranges does not matter, as this speed range is only briefly used. The earlier NACA 6 series provides only a single, wide low drag region. The Uribel B was one of the first sailplanes to use an airfoil with two such \\"drag buckets\\". The Uribel C differs from the B version in having a simpler, straight tapered wing plan, without the forward sweep inherited from the Urendo. The wing is built around a single main spar, with all its surfaces covered in plywood which is generally 1.5 mm (0.059 in) thick except at the roots, where 2.0 mm (0.079 in) ply is used. The plywood skin extends forward almost to the leading edge, where it is bonded to a false spar; the leading edge itself is formed from balsa wood. The wing tips are glass fibre (GRP). Schempp-Hirth type airbrakes are placed aft of the main spar, just inboard of the ailerons. The fixed surfaces of the trapezoidal plan, 100¬∞ butterfly tail are also ply covered, as are the trim tabs on the otherwise fabric covered control surfaces. The fuselage of all the Uribel variants is largely ply covered, elliptical in cross section though becoming slimmer and closer to circular aft. The C version introduced a GRP nose, tail cone and dorsal region behind the cockpit as well as the GRP wing tips. There is a single piece canopy, which smoothly follows the nose line, ahead of the wing. The Uribel lands on a monowheel partly enclosed within a skid. The final development was the Uribel D, in which a reclined pilot's position allows a reduction in frontal area. Operational history The Uribel C competed in two World Gliding Championships. At Junin, Argentina in 1963 L. Brigliadori came 4th in the Standard class. Two years later at RAF South Cerney in the UK he had slipped down the rankings to 16th. One Uribel C was still active in 2002 and two Uribels, variants C and D, remained on the Italian civil aircraft register in 2010.

He experienced a religious conversion in 1782, and was baptised by John Rippon in the Baptist meeting-house in Carter Lane, Tooley Street, Southwark, on 11 May 1783. He subsequently became a Baptist minister and pastor of East Street Baptist church in Walworth from 1792 until his death in 1796. He was a popular preacher, and during the period of his ministry it became necessary to extend the church building on three occasions. He was also a writer of devotional poems and hymns, many of which remained popular through the 19th century, although now largely forgotten. Many were published under the collective title Walworth Hymns in 1792. A version of his hymn \\"My Song in the Night\\" was included on the album Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing released by the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square in 2009. Swain died aged 35 on 14 April 1796. He was buried in Bunhill Fields burial ground in London.

He is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation in Montana, and is a nationally-recognized commentator on Native American issues, politics, and ethics. In 1994, Rodgers founded Carlyle Consulting, a governmental/media/public relations firm located in Alexandria, Virginia that represents the interests of Native Americans. Rodgers played an important role in the investigation that led to the conviction of former lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Since then, Rodgers has waged a Native American Voting Rights effort to help provide Native Americans on remote, poverty-stricken reservations with equal access to voting. Rodgers has dubbed the effort to suppress the Native American vote \\"the Jim Crow of the West.\\" He played a lead role in an historic Native American voter registration and turnout effort in the 2016 elections. The effort drew the support of Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and National Congress of American Indians, prevailing in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Attorney General Eric Holder in June 2014 stated that the Montana native voting rights \\"conditions are unacceptable and they are outrageous......As a nation, we cannot -- and we will not -- simply stand by as the voices of Native Americans are shut out of the democratic process.\\" In May 2015, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, a stalwart proponent of expanding voter access for Native Americans, transmitted to Vice President Joe Biden and Speaker of the House John Boehner a request in statutory form that the outcome sought in the Wandering Medicine litigation should be enacted into federal law. This was soon followed by introduction of legislation by Senators Jon Tester, Heidi Heitkamp, Tom Udall, and Al Franken. The federal action elevated the significance of the Wandering Medicine litigation in the Native Americans empowerment and enfranchisement movement dating back to the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. In the spring of 2018, Tester broadened the Native American voter access fight, demanding Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Director Tracy Toulou of the Office of Tribal Justice establish satellite voting locations on tribal lands. Building off the voter project, in the fall of 2016 Rodgers joined a national advocacy effort on behalf of the Standing Rock Sioux, working to educate lawmakers and officials in Washington, D.C. and nationwide to the need to protect the water supply for the tribe and all downstream residents in the upper Missouri River region from the Dakota Access Pipeline. Rodgers is currently engaged in an effort to repatriate to his native land the remains and spirit of Jim Thorpe, one of the greatest athletes in history known in his Sac and Fox Nation as Wa-tho-huck (the \\"light after the lightning‚Äù). In what Rodgers describes as a \\"sacred covenant\\" with Bill Thorpe, the son of Wa-tho-huck, Rodgers is working to have Wa-tho-huck's remains moved from a tomb in Pennsylvania to Oklahoma, so his spirit can rest in peace in his ancestral home. Rodgers is also leading an ongoing effort to educate people about the impact the opioid crisis has had on Native American tribes and nations. Rodgers is organizing Native Americans as part of a federal class action lawsuit against opioid manufacturers and distributors. Legal action taken by his own Blackfeet Nation was named in July 2018 as one of two Native American bellwether cases in the opioid class action lawsuit. Early life and education Rodgers was born and raised on the Great Plains near Glasgow, Montana, considered to be the most isolated community in the U.S. and located in \\"the middle of nowhere.\\" Rodgers obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Economics, J.D. and L.L.M in Taxation at the University of Denver. He went on to obtain a Masters in International Public Policy with an emphasis in China Studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. He also attended the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business Executive MBA program. Rodgers commitment to education includes regularly speaking before high school and college students. Advocacy and representation From 1990 to 1993, Rodgers served as tax legislative counsel to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus. Before that, he served as tax counsel to United States Tax Court Judge Marvin F. Peterson. Rodgers went on to form Carlyle Consulting. He has written about persistent poverty and high unemployment in Native American communities. Rodgers established a scholarship at his alma mater, The University of Denver Sturm College of Law, named the Tom C. Rodgers O-tee-paym-soo-wuk Ethics in Government Scholarship, to benefit Native American law students, ‚ÄúO-tee-paym- soo-wuk‚Äù means ‚Äúa man who owns himself‚Äù in the Cree language. The purpose of the scholarship is to develop the legal and advocacy skills necessary to participate in the debate surrounding public policy and its creation, using ethics as their guiding value. The total scholarship value is around $160,000 over three years. Rodgers has raised more than $1.2 million in charity for Native American youth, tribal governments, Native American financial literacy programs, and Native American voting rights efforts. Jack Abramoff whistleblower After years of advocating for \\"Indian Country\\", Rodgers was approached in early 2002 by tribal leaders from The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana and The Saginaw Chippewa of Michigan to discuss threats that had been made to them by their lobbyist Jack Abramoff. They expressed concern as to the services they were receiving in exchange for the large amount being charged. Rodgers worked with the tribal members to gather internal invoices and documents, and leak the documents to reporters. They were instrumental in exposing Abramoff's criminal activities, which subsequently led to the arrest of former Rep. Bob Ney (R-Ohio), helping to force then-Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) from office. During this time, Rodgers was represented by whistle-blowers' advocate, Houston attorney Philip H. Hilder. In the aftermath, Congress passed the most sweeping new ethics rules since Watergate. Rodgers has continued to track Abramoff to criticize his reform claims, to question the intentions of organizations that have shown support for Abramoff‚Äôs recent reform efforts,. and the extent to which Abramoff‚Äôs influence reached into the media. Rodgers appeared in the documentary, ‚Äò‚ÄôCasino Jack and the United States of Money‚Äô‚Äô, by Alex Gibney about the career and corruption scandal surrounding Jack Abramoff. He received an ethics award from the University of Denver for his role in bringing to light Abramoff‚Äôs criminal actions. Rodgers has been interviewed on the Abramoff case, as well as on Native American rights, for media outlets, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, USA Today, The Hill, The Huffington Post, BBC, The Nation, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, The Atlantic, Roll Call, Financial Times, Bloomberg News, Talking Points Memo, Washingtonian, Indian Country Today, Democracy NOW, and the National Press Club newsmakers series.

In 1948, following the advent of the communist regime, he was named auxiliary bishop of Timi»ôoara and was secretly consecrated in Bucharest. Together with Bishop Augustin Pacha and other prominent Catholics, he was arrested, given a show trial and sentenced to life imprisonment. Released in 1964, he was not allowed to perform the duties of a bishop until the fall of the regime, instead having to work as a chaplain in Timi»ôoara. In 1990, Pope John Paul II named him titular archbishop of Ressiana. He died in 2003.

This sale resulted in an abnormal flow of vehicles and shoppers to the stores, and the Pol√≠cia de Seguran√ßa P√∫blica (Police for Public Security) registered more than fifty occurrences, among them civil disorder and assaults, more than half having taken place in the Lisbon region. A row between two shoppers in a store in Senhora da Hora resulted in two people getting injured, hospitalised in Porto. Multiple other assaults between customers in Lisbon, Amadora, Cacem and Loures were reported. The Jer√≥nimo Martins Group, who owns the Pingo Doce chain of hypermarkets, has denied accusations of dumping after the media attraction the incidents had in the press and public opinion. The Autoridade de Seguran√ßa Alimentar e Econ√≥mica (Authority for Alimentary and Economic Safety) is currently investigating alleged infractions that have taken place during the sale. The matter was also debated in the Portuguese Parliament, where the parliamentary left accused the Jer√≥nimo Martins Group of illegal practices: Catarina Martins, Member of Parliament for the Left Bloc, accused Jer√≥nimo Martins of \\"crushing\\" the competition by \\"taking advantage of the poor economic situation of the Portuguese people\\". Agostinho Lopes, Member of Parliament for the Portuguese Communist Party, has pointed out that the sale was \\"yet another act of prepotence by a major sales group\\", adding that \\"it's them who run the Government now, apparently.\\" Many people who witnessed the incidents published videos in the web, via sites like YouTube, that show huge numbers of people crowding the stores, along with empty shelves.

Born in Bucharest, he entered that city's seminary in 1892. Sent to Rome in 1899, he was ordained a priest in 1903 at the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. Upon his return to Romania, he was named secretary to Archbishop Joseph-Xavier Hornstein and dean of students at the seminary. After a short time as parish priest at the Bucharest BƒÉrƒÉ»õia and at the Craiova parish, he was named head of a school in Bucharest in 1918. In 1920, he was consecrated bishop at Saint Joseph's Cathedral and was installed in Ia≈üi. He reopened the seminary there that had shut down due to World War I. In 1921, the parishes of Bessarabia, recently united with Romania, were incorporated into his diocese. Following the retirement of Archbishop Raymund Netzhammer in 1924, he was named Archbishop of Bucharest. He was also interim Apostolic Administrator of Ia≈üi until 1925, when Mihai Robu was named bishop. He remained in office until retiring in 1948 and being named titular bishop of Nicopolis. During 1949-1953, the new communist regime forced him to live at the Franciscan monastery in OrƒÉ≈ütie. Twice, with the authorities' approval, he was able to go to Alba Iulia to ordain priests. He was allowed to return to Bucharest in late 1953. He died soon after, and was buried in the Catholic chapel at Bellu cemetery. Ep.

Along with his wife Clarissa, he served in mission fields of the Marquesas Islands and in the Kingdom of Hawaii. He established several churches and schools, and was Kahu (shepherd) of Kawaiaha ªo Church after the departure of Hiram Bingham I. Kamehameha III appointed him Minister of Public Instruction, and his accomplishments established an educational system that earned him the nickname \\"The father of American education in Hawaii\\".  Background  Richard Armstrong was born in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania on April 13, 1805, to James Armstrong and his American-born wife Eleanor Pollock. The elder Armstrong had been born in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, and in 1786 emigrated to the United States, where he married Eleanor. The family were Presbyterian. Richard was the youngest child of the union. He was educated at Milton Academy in Massachusetts, furthering his education at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, and graduating from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1831.Eng (1999) pp.1,2  Nuku Hiva and Hawaii  Princeton president Archibald Alexander provided a letter of recommendation In 1831, when Armstrong made the decision to join the next contingent of missionaries being sent to Hawaii by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. He received his ordination on October 27, and Armstrong and his new bride Clarissa Chapman departed with the other missionaries aboard the Averick on November 26. The ship docked in Honolulu on May 17, 1832, with Clarissa seven months pregnant.Eng (1999) pp.2,3,4 Daughter and first child Caroline Porter was born in Honolulu on July 17. The board sent the Armstrongs to minister to cannibalistic tribes on Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands July 2, 1833 through May 12, 1834, serving alongside missionary couples the Rev. William Patterson Alexander and his wife Mary, and the Rev. Benjamin Wyman Parker and his wife Mary Elizabeth. The first Armstrong son William Nevins was born on Nuku Hiva on January 2, 1834. The Nuku Hiva mission field was abandoned as futile. The Armstrongs were reassigned to the Island of Maui, where the infant William Nevins died March 17, 1835 in Lahaina. Their second son had been born two days before on March 15, and he was given the name of his brother William Nevins. In July of that year, the Armstrongs were assigned to Wailuku. Three more children were born during this assignment. Mary Jane was born June 2, 1836 in Honolulu. Two sons were born in Wailuku, Richard Baxter on August 15, 1837, and Samuel Chapman on January 30, 1839. During his assignment on Maui, Armstrong established churches at Waihee, Wailuku, Ulupalakua, and at Haiku, where he also became an 1858 founder of Haiku Sugar Company on land he owned. In 1840, Armstrong was appointed Kahu (shepherd) of Kawaiaha ªo Church to replace Hiram Bingham I. On August 26, 1854, he was licensed to perform marriages in Hawaii. Armstrong officiated at the June 19, 1856 wedding of Emma Rooke and Alexander Liholiho in Kawaiaha ªo Church. Additionally, Armstrong served on the government Privy council and the House of Nobles. = The father of American education in Hawaii = Under Kamehameha III, the position of Minister of Public Instruction of the Kingdom of Hawaii was created. On April 3, 1846, William Richards was appointed to fill the new position.. When Richards died in 1847, Armstrong was appointed to fill the position. Armstrong held the position until 1855, when he became President of the Board of Education. The educational model he established in the kingdom earned Armstrong the sobriquet \\"The father of American education in Hawaii\\". He created a structured environment that was financially supported by a school tax. With Armstrong at the helm, curriculum was standardized, and the responsibilities of faith-based citizenship became a part of it. The kingdom's teachers were given extended training. Land grants were implemented for additional and improved facilities, and the kingdom began issuing its own textbooks. The public school system accommodated the majority of the students, but Armstrong also chartered private educational institutions.  Personal life and death  Richard Armstrong died September 23, 1860 following a riding accident which punctured an artery in his neck. He was buried on the grounds of Kawaiaha ªo Church. He married Clarissa Chapman of Russell, Massachusetts. on September 5, 1831 in Bridgeport, Connecticut. She died July 20, 1891 in San Francisco, California.

Biography =Early career and wartime assignment= Born in Landau village in what is now Ukraine to a Black Sea German family deported from southern Russia, he studied at the Saratov seminary before continuing his education at the Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum in Rome. He took a doctorate in philosophy and theology before being ordained in Minsk in 1907. From that year until 1916, he taught at and was deputy director of the Saratov seminary. In 1916, he was transferred to Chi≈üinƒÉu, with duties covering the province of Bessarabia until 1920. In 1924, he was named secret chamberlain to Pope Pius XI, and papal prelate in 1930. In 1939, he was named rector of the Ia≈üi seminary and in 1942, head of the Catholic mission to the Transnistria Governorate, with his headquarters at Odessa. There, he was consecrated titular bishop of Caesaropolis in July 1943. While in Odessa, he clashed with the German Army and especially the SS, who wanted to stop all religious activity by Catholics in the area. Due to Romania's losses on the Eastern Front, he retreated westward beyond the Prut. In September 1944, following the death of Bishop Mihai Robu, he was named Apostolic Administrator of the Ia≈üi Diocese.

In April 1946, minister Mihai Ralea explained that to do so might anger the Soviet occupiers, as Glaser was born in Ukraine and had been active on what was now Soviet territory. Starting in 1945, he was subjected to a series of lengthy and difficult interrogations before Soviet authorities lasting four years and dealing with his activity in Odessa and Ia≈üi, as well as a supposed visit to Germany in 1942. He initially refused to appear and only did so after repeated threats from NKVD officers. He headed the diocese until late 1947 when Anton Durcovici was named bishop, remaining vicar general. As such, he accompanied the bishop on pastoral visits and helped administer chrism. Following the arrest of Durcovici in June 1949, he once again took over the running of the diocese, but the authorities of the new communist regime prevented him from carrying out his regular duties. In 1950, Glaser was repeatedly questioned by the Securitate secret police in Ia≈üi, triggering a heart attack. He died that May in circumstances that remain unclear, and was buried in the Eternitatea cemetery. Ep.

The episode is written by Dan Nowak and directed by Nicole Kassell. In the episode, the detectives focus their investigation on the casino. Darren Richmond's renewed campaign holds a press conference with Stan Larsen as a surprise supporter. Plot At Stephen Holder's apartment, Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) suggests that whoever put the drawing on her motel refrigerator knows about her. Holder (Joel Kinnaman) insists his place is safe. Outside, casino security guard Roberta Drays (Patti Kim) watches the apartment from her car. The next morning, Holder cooks breakfast. Linden looks at a book of Holder's about monarch butterflies and finds a butterfly migration observation site within the Wapi Indian reservation. Police technician Ray (Randal Edwards) calls her to report that the sound heard in Rosie's voicemail is likely the cooling fan of a diesel generator used by construction companies. She asks Holder to seek out any business records between Michael Ames' construction company and the Wapi casino. At the hospital, Gwen Eaton (Kristin Lehman) suggests getting Stan Larsen to make a statement on Richmond's (Billy Campbell) behalf, which could change voters' perception. She adds that, as an incentive she can negotiate a reduced sentence with the prosecutor in Stan's assault case, who is a friend. In private, however, she tells Jamie Wright (Eric Ladin) that the prosecutor does not negotiate and their plan is a bluff. Stan (Brent Sexton) is visited by Rosie's friend Sterling (Kacey Rohl), who gives him the contents of Rosie's locker. She thinks the school has been influenced by media coverage and has cleaned out Rosie's locker in an attempt to wash their hands of the situation. Linden drops Jack (Liam James) at a new motel and rushes out again after receiving a call from Holder. In her car, Holder says Ames' construction company is involved in a $50 million renovation project at the casino. She asks him to surveil the casino while she explores Point Yubec, where she believes Rosie filmed the butterfly migration. She also mentions that Chief Nicole Jackson has been publicly accused of pocketing the casino's profits and wonders if Rosie had felt trapped. Linden arrives at Point Yubec and follows a trail, ignoring a posted warning sign. At the casino, Holder tells blackjack dealer Myron (William Belleau) that he is looking for a good time. The dealer hands him a chip, telling him the bartender will help him out. Linden enters a burial ground and is stopped by Jackson (Claudia Ferri). As two more people approach, Linden reminds Jackson that Linden is a cop. Jackson reminds Linden she has no jurisdiction on the reservation and threatens Linden with a warning. At the Larsen house, Gwen and Jamie ask Stan to endorse Richmond in exchange for a lighter sentence in his assault case. Stan refuses when Gwen hesitates at putting the deal in writing. Back at the hospital, Gwen admits to trying to deceive Stan. They decide to instead focus the press conference around Richmond's recovery. In Stan's garage, Richmond assures Stan he had no role in Rosie's murder and Stan does not need to do anything for him. Stan is upset that no one cares about Rosie as a person anymore. Richmond tells him to make them care. At a bar, Holder asks a prostitute (Tantoo Cardinal) to take him to the construction site. After she refuses, male prostitute Benny (Justin Rain) offers to take him. Holder leaves him after being told the site is on the tenth floor. Holder pushes the elevator button for the tenth floor, but it doesn't work. He rides to the ninth floor and walks up the final flight of stairs, only to find a locked stairwell door. Back on the elevator, Holder encounters casino maid Mary (Q'orianka Kilcher), who hands him a book of matches. After stepping off, she mentions Rosie's backpack, and the doors close before Holder can pursue her. He opens the matches to see a simple note: \\"11am tomorrow\\". The elevator arrives at the lobby, where Holder is greeted by tribal policemen. One of them handcuffs Holder, who says he is a cop. The tribesman replies, ‚ÄúNot here, you ain't.‚Äù Linden leaves Holder a voicemail to warn him that Jackson's men chased her off the reservation and he should get out of there. She arrives at her motel and calls Ray to request information about the burial grounds at Point Yubec. Walking to her room, she finds Jack talking to officers from Child Protective Services. At the Larsen house, Denny (Seth Isaac Johnson) mentions that the police talked to Terry at school. When asked about it, Terry (Jamie Anne Allman) tells Stan that they asked about Michael Ames, the boyfriend who had kicked her out and whom she met through Beau Soleil; he is Jasper's father. She admits that Rosie was also on the website. Stan, infuriated, screams at her to leave. Back in the motel room, the officers question Linden. Jack tells Linden he needs to go to the bathroom, from which he climbs out the window. Linden pretends to take a call, leaves the room, and meets Jack at the car. They drive off, she apologizes to him, and he acts coldly toward her. She leaves another message for Holder, warning him that something is going on. Gwen arrives at the press conference with Stan, who has agreed to make a statement. Stan complains to the media about their using Rosie's death to sell newspapers. He then offers a $12,000 bounty for information leading to her killer and leaves, having said nothing about Richmond's innocence. Jackson's men drive Holder past tribal police headquarters. He notices this, mentions it, but gets no response. He is taken to a remote clearing in the woods, where Jackson is waiting along with Roberta and others. Jackson tells him that he and Linden have gone where they were not supposed to. Linden has already been given the \\"warning\\". As Roberta and the others brutally beat Holder, Jackson smiles and calls Linden on his phone, holding it out so Linden can listen to the assault. Reception =Critical reception= \\"Keylela\\" received mixed reviews. Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic rated the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars, stating \\"'Keylela' struck with such a dramatic force that it reinvigorated what made the series compelling in the first place. Suspense soaked the hour and believable emotions rang high. This was an episode that made me care and pushed along fantastic scenes where I wanted to see what would happen next.\\" The A.V. Club's Brandon Nowalk rated this episode a C, saying \\"If it didn't feel like the scent had been lost for no good reason, 'Keylela' would actually be one of the more interesting episodes of the season precisely because it's so atmospheric... Nothing happens, but a lot of that nothing is creepy and evocative...what does happen in the subplots is barely sketched.\\" William Bibbiani of CraveOnline liked the \\"fun, fast-moving\\" episode, adding: \\"'Openings' was a fairly involving episode of The Killing which moved the investigation and campaign forward (hurry for the latter, in particular), and touched upon some disturbing new themes that up the darkness quotient by at least half. We're entering into the final stretch, though, so the time has come to start following through.\\" Paste Magazine's Adam Vitcavage gave the episode a 7.0 rating, commenting: \\"'Keylela' could have been, and should have been, an important episode. Yet, somehow it slipped through the cracks, and it was turned into an extended version of that moment in a film that just ticks you off no matter what happens next. It's that moment where you just ask yourself, 'Why is this happening?' For lack of a better word, it felt stupid.\\" =Ratings= The episode was seen by 1.34 million viewers and obtained an adult 18-49 rating of 0.3, slightly lower than the previous episode.

He was born in 1463 or 1464 and was named Cadi in 1498 or 99 and he died in 1548. Sidi Mahmoud was Ahmed Baba's great uncle. The Tarikh (histories) of Timbuktu attributed him with numerous legends. His tomb is a place of pilgrimage and his descendants count many scholars. The tomb of Sidi Mahmoud Ben Amar is visited by local people who believe he has the power to bring rain, through the blessing of God.

Paige is assigned to Warden, a Rephaite with mysterious motives. He is her master. Her trainer. Her natural enemy. But if Paige wants to regain her freedom she must allow herself to be nurtured in this prison where she is meant to die. Development Shannon began writing The Bone Season while working for book agent David Godwin and attending St Anne's College, Oxford. She had started working for Godwin when he offered her an internship after he declined her earlier novel Aurora. After some time looking over manuscripts and gaining experience in the book business, Shannon came up with the premise for The Bone Season. Shannon imagined \\"a girl, having the exact same day at work that I was, but she happened to be clairvoyant\\" and began planning the novel while on her lunch break. She began using the environment of St Anne's College and the overall University of Oxford architecture and landscaping as an inspiration for the novel's Sheol I penal colony setting. An interviewer noted that Oxford has many \\"impossibly neat, manicured lawns and well-tended buildings that act as a kind of tree-ring- dating window onto Britain's architectural past (and present).\\" Shannon came up with the idea of a shanty town in between the colleges as a way of \\"juxtaposing the squalor the humans were forced to live in and the grand colleges where The Rephaim live on either side.\\" Reception Prior to the release of The Bone Season the book was compared to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series and Shannon was often referred to as \\"the next J.K. Rowling\\". Newspapers drew comparisons due to Shannon signing with the same UK publisher as Rowling did for her Harry Potter series and due to both series comprising seven novels. However Atlantic Wire reporter John Arit commented that the \\"steady drumbeat of press ... has led to comparisons to nearly every mainstream female fantasy and sci-fi novelist with name recognition\\". Critical reception for the book has been mostly positive. USA Today commented upon a similarity to the Harry Potter novels in their positive review for The Bone Season, opining that the book's premise was \\"awfully familiar in certain aspects\\" to the aforementioned series while also stating that it had \\"fresh ideas, excellent original concepts and, best of all, an impressive new voice for fantasy literature.\\" NPR also noted the same comparison, but remarked that it was more similar to The Hunger Games than the Potter series. The Telegraph's review also mentioned that the book was similar to The Hunger Games and commented that the plot would be familiar to fantasy readers but that Shannon \\"shows real skill in combining them so easily into an original and enjoyably escapist fictional world.\\" Sequels The second installment, The Mime Order was released on 27 January 2015. The third instalment, The Song Rising was released on 7 March 2017. The fourth installment is to be released February 16, 2021 and to be called The Mask Falling.

It was updated in 1983. In January 1975, Judy Norsigan outlined how the film illustrated \\"rape culture\\", through the voices of men and women, including rapists, victims, prisoners, rape crisis workers, and the media. The film featured prisoners of Lorton Reformatory, Virginia, \\"Prisoners Against Rape Inc\\" (PAR), a not-for-profit organization founded by William Fuller and Larry Cannon on September 9, 1973, in conjunction with women fighting rape. The prison administration \\"approved\\" self-help status. PAR was set up after Fuller wrote to the DC Rape Crisis Center in 1973 and asked for assistance. The DC Rape Crisis Center had opened in 1972 in response to the high incidence of rape against women of color. Fuller acknowledged his history of rape, murder, and prison rape. He wanted to stop being a rapist. This resulted in a cooperative effort. The women from the DC Rape Crisis Center who initiated work with PAR were Loretta Ross, Yulanda Ward and Nkenge Tour√©. Ross has said that whilst the relationship was seen initially as controversial, it was one of the more interesting aspects of her work at the DC Rape Crisis Center in the 1970s and 80s. In an interview with Joyce Follet, Ross observed that in the work of the DC Rape Crisis center they could bandage up women all they wanted to, but if they did not stop rape what was the point? Maragaret lazarus, the film's producer, said of this relationship that the work was \\"groundbreaking\\". The film featured Mary Daly, radical feminist philosopher, academic, and theologian, and Author and Artist Emily Culpepper. They discussed rapism as an intellectual concept, and phallocentric morality and \\"its 'unholy trinity of rape, genocide and war.'\\". Doreen McDowell, a rape victim, talked of her experience, how sex fantasies play a part in rape, and how male identified behavior in women maintained a \\"state of siege\\". Powerful statistical evidence, refuting rape myths, law enforcement and legislative views of rape were presented by Joanna Morris, author and statistical coordinator for rape crisis centers across the USA. The film also looked closely at the mass media, how filmmakers, songwriters, writers and magazines perpetuated the attitudes to rape, which normalized it and even perpetuated rape myths and stereotypical behavior around rape. Gone with the Wind, Alfred Hitchcock's film Frenzy, and Hustler magazine were some of the media used to illustrate the normalization of rape. In describing the film, the producers say that it attempts to give real and accurate limits to rape and expand society's narrow and sexist concepts of rape. Lazarus has said of the film's title that it came from long discussion about what the film was trying to illustrate. She has also expressed the view that the film is the first time \\"rape culture\\" was used in its widest accepted sense. A mention of the film in the Congressional Record in January 1978 is the first known occurrence of the term 'rape culture' in national-level American politics.

This period is called Araboba (·Éê·É†·Éê·Éë·Éù·Éë·Éê) in Georgian. Compared with other regions which endured Muslim conquests, Georgia's culture, and even political structure was not much affected by the Arab presence, as the people kept their faith, the nobles their fiefdoms, and the foreign rulers mostly insisted on the payment of tribute, which they could not always enforce. Still, repeated invasions and military campaigns by the Arabs devastated Georgia on many occasions, and the Caliphs retained suzerainty over large parts of the country and exerted influence over the internal power dynamics during most of the period. The history of Arab rule in Georgia can be divided into 3 main periods: 1\\\\. from the first appearance of Arab armies around 645 until the establishment of the Emirate of Tbilisi in 736. Those years saw the progressive installation of political control over the Georgian lands by the Umayyad Caliphate. 2\\\\. from 736 until 853, when the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad destroyed Tbilisi to quell a rebellion by the local emir, ending a period of domination of all Eastern Georgia by the Emirate. 3\\\\. from 853 until the 2nd half of the 11th century, when the Great Seljuq Empire replaced the Arabs as the main force in the Middle East. Before that, the power of the emirate of Tbilisi had already declined in favor of independent Georgian states. Tbilisi remained however under Arab rule until 1122. First conquests and installation of Arab domination (645‚Äì736) In the first decades of the 7th century, most of present-day Georgia was under the authority of the Principate of Iberia. This state, like its predecessors, continually played the two main powers of the time, the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires, to guarantee its own survival as an independent state. Allegiances were regularly switched, but from 626, when Byzantine Emperor Heraclius attacked Tbilisi and installed as presiding prince Adarnase I of the pro- Byzantine Chosroid Dynasty, Byzantine influence was dominant. From the next decade however, the Muslim conquests of the Middle East started, upsetting that balance. The first Arab incursions in present-day Georgia happened approximately between 642 and 645, during the Conquest of Persia. It soon turned into a full-scale invasion, and Tbilisi was taken in 645. The presiding prince Stephen II had to recognize the suzerainty of the Rashidun Caliph. The region still remained marginal in the eyes of the Caliphate, and although it was officially integrated into the newly created province of Armƒ´niya, local rulers retained at first as much autonomy as they had enjoyed under the Byzantine and Sassanid protectorates. The Caliphate was then still in its first decades, very unstable politically, and had not yet developed a system of administration able to keep their numerous conquests under control. The main manifestation of Arab power over a region was at the same time a religious command of Islam: the payment of a tax (for territories under direct rule), or a tribute (for vassal states), by non-believers, called the jizya. Payment of it symbolized submission to the Islamic state, but was also, for the Christians of the Caucasus, a way to avoid new invasions, or punitive expeditions by the Arabs against those who did not pay. In Iberia as in Armenia, revolts against the tribute were frequent during the second half of the 7th century, each time the local nobility and presiding princes felt internal weakness in the Caliphate. The most significant of those uprisings, which engulfed the whole Caucasus region, happened in 681‚Äì682, and was led in Georgia by presiding prince Adarnase II. Despite a two-year-long struggle, the revolt was quelled, Adarnase was killed, and the Arabs installed in his place Guaram II of the rival Guaramid Dynasty. In their efforts to assert their rule over Iberia, the Arabs also had to contend with two other major powers in the region, the Byzantine Empire and the Khazars. The latter, a confederation of semi-nomadic Turkic peoples, ruled over the steppes north of the Greater Caucasus range. They had played a role in Caucasian history since the beginning of the 7th century, when they assisted the Byzantines against Persia. Later, they successfully halted the Muslim armies in a series of wars, but also helped them suppressing the Georgian revolt of 682.Toumanoff, Cyril, \\"Armenia and Georgia\\", in The Cambridge Medieval History, Cambridge, 1966, vol. IV, p. 606. Accessible online at The Georgian lands suffered from the confrontation between Arabs and Khazars, as they served a strategic role as a foothold for the Arabs in those repeated confrontations, and also suffered destructive incursions by the Khazars from across the mountains. As for Byzantium, it had not given up hope of reestablishing its suzerainty over Iberia, and responded to the new Arab power by first strengthening its control over the Black Sea coastal regions, Abkhazia and Lazica, which had not yet been reached by the Arabs. Around 685, the Emperor Justinian II concluded a truce with the Caliph, in which they agreed on joint possession of Iberia and Armenia. However, the Arab victory at the Battle of Sebastopolis in 692 upset the balance, and led to a new Arab conquest of Armenia, and their reaching the Black Sea and vanquishing the Kingdom of Lazica (around 697). A new status quo, more favourable to the Arabs, was now in place. The Emirate of Tbilisi (736‚Äì853) Georgia and the Caucasus after the establishment of the Emirate. Around 730, two factors led to a change in Umayyad policy towards Georgia. First, in that year, the Khazars managed to invade Northwestern Iran and went all the way to Mosul before being defeated. The tributary buffer states of the Caucasus had not been able to prevent that invasion. Furthermore, local Christian rulers, such as Guaram III of Iberia still kept contact with Byzantium and hoped for its intervention. The Empire however was weak and Arab raids could reach Constantinople, making the Byzantines less of a menace than the Khazars. In 732‚Äì733, caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik appointed Marwan ibn Muhammad governor of Armenia and Azerbaijan, with the task of waging war against the Khazars and subduing Georgia. The campaign that followed was devastating for Georgia. Marwan did not only invade Kartli as his predecessors had done, but he also led his armies after the retreating Georgian princes into the western half of the country, from Samtskhe to Abkhazia, where they were eventually stopped. According to Cyril Toumanoff, Western Georgia, as a dependency of the Byzantine Empire, was actually the primary goal of the campaign, and the Prince of Iberia would have sided with the Arab forces to help repel the Khazars, who had just devastated his lands.Toumanoff, Cyril, \\"Iberia between Chosroid and Bagratid Rule\\", in Studies in Christian Caucasian History, Georgetown, 1963, p. 405. Accessible online at Anyway, retreating from Western Georgia, Marwan established an emir in Tbilisi to rule over Iberia while he turned his armies against the Khazars (737). This invasion, and its horrors, left a strong mark in the Georgian collective memory, who nicknamed the Arab general Marwan the Deaf. However, the new emirate had to contend with the remaining Georgian nobility and the principate, which had not been fully abolished. Furthermore, Marwan became the last Umayyad caliph and after his death, civil war engulfed the Muslim state. This allowed once again the Christian Caucasians to turn to Byzantium for help and restore large autonomy.Toumanoff (1966), p. 607 But those hopes were soon quashed after the Abbasids restored the caliphate in Baghdad in 762: the new Muslim state was better organized and more able to claim tribute and impose its authority over border regions. This was demonstrated to Georgia in 786, when the wali of the Caucasus, Khuzayma ibn Khazim, bloodily suppressed rebellious sentiments among Georgian aristocracy.Suny (1994), p. 28 Prince Archil of Kakheti among others was killed after refusing to convert to Islam. From that moment, the local balance of power between the Arabs and the Georgian nobility became more favourable to the former. Both the ancient princely dynasties of the Guaramids and Chosroids became extinct,Toumanoff1966, p. 608 giving the emirs of Tbilisi more power over the land. The rural economy had been ruined by the repeated invasions, and many regions were denuded of their population, who had been killed or had fled towards the Byzantine lands. The cities, however, notably Tbilisi, prospered, as the Abbasids encouraged trade between their provinces and the use of currency (the dirham) for tribute, introducing a more open economy.Toumanoff (1966), p. 609 Saint Abo of Tiflis. Some regions, removed from the main cities and trade routes, maintained a large degree of autonomy from the Arab rulers, notably in the west of Georgia.Suny (1994), p. 29 There, in Klarjeti and Samtskhe, a noble family came to prominence during the second half of the 8th century: the Bagrationi, or Georgian Bagratids. Their origin is disputed, but it is now generally admitted that they were a branch of the Armenian Bagratuni dynasty, whose ancestor Vasak migrated to Klarjeti and was given lands there after 772, before receiving most of the former Guaramid lands after the extinction of the latter line around 786. The Bagrationi established their power in Tao-Klarjeti, but soon became rivals of the emirate for the control over Georgian lands. To assert their authority, they could rely both on Byzantine intervention and on the dissensions among the Arabs. In 809, the emir of Tbilisi, Isma'il ibn Shuab, proclaimed independence from the caliphate, which sought the help of Georgian princes against the rebellion, and enrolled the Bagrationi against Ibn Shuab. In 813, the head of the dynasty, Ashot I restored the Principate of Iberia, or Kartli, for himself. He received recognition from both the caliph and the Byzantines, who bestowed upon him the official title of curopalates. This new balance between emirate and independent Bagrationi lands would continue during the next decades, the caliph supporting whichever side was less menacing to its overall authority at the moment. This allowed other Georgian regions more autonomy, and Kakheti gained its independence from both Iberia and the emirate at the time, under its own mtavari.Suny (1994), p. 30 At the same time, Byzantium lost its last dependencies on the Georgian Black Sea coast, as the Kingdom of Abkhazia expanded. This contemporary inscription at Ateni Sioni Church mentions the sack of Tbilisi and the downfall of Ishaq ibn Isma'il. From 833, under Ishaq ibn Isma'il, the emirate regained power over Georgian lands, imposing its authority over many princes and forcing the Bagrationi to pay tribute: after Ashot's death, his domain had been shared among his three sons and was more vulnerable. Emboldened by those successes, the emir stopped recognizing the higher authority of the caliphate. Only when the Armenians also rebelled did Caliph Al-Mutawakkil react, in 853, sending the Turkish general Bugha al-Kabir with an army against the Caucasian rebels. This expedition was, in the words of Cyril Toumanoff, \\"marked with particular ferocity\\".Toumanoff (1966), p. 611 The Abbasid army sacked and burned Tbilisi, and executed the emir. Many Georgian nobles were captured during the invasion, such as Kostanti-Kakhay, and either killed for refusing to embrace Islam, or sent as prisoners to the Abbasid capital at Samarra.Thomas, David & Roggema, Barbara (ed., 2009), Christian-Muslim Relations. a Bibliographical History. Volume 1 (600-900), pp. 852-6. BRILL, . The decision the Abbasids took of not rebuilding the city extensively would considerably weaken their economic and cultural influence in Georgia, and allowed the Bagrationi to become the major power in the country, facilitating its further unification. The progressive waning of Arab rule over Georgia (853‚Äì1120) After the 853 expedition, the Arab rule over Georgia was never again as strong. The emirate of Tbilisi had not been abolished, but the Caliphs would not allow its power to grow again, as it had more than once led to its rebellion against central power. Furthermore, the Byzantine Empire, under Basil I the Macedonian (r. 867‚Äì886), was experiencing a political and cultural renaissance, which could only seduce Caucasians away from the Caliph's authority. Georgia and the Caucasus around 900 Christian feudal states expanded during the second half of the 9th century, and the Bagratids of Armenia and Georgia especially saw their power rise. Both the Caliphate and Byzantium were now courting them to ensure their support, or at least neutrality, in their struggle against the other. Monarchy was restored in Armenia in 886 in favour of the Bagratid Ashot I, who crowned his Georgian cousin Adarnase IV king of Iberia, restoring the title.Suny (1994), pp. 29-30 Strong Christian states now separated the weakened emirate of Tbilisi from its overlords, who exerted only the most theoretical suzerainty over the two restored kingdoms. Another vassal of the Caliphate, Yusuf Ibn Abi'l-Saj, emir of Azerbaijan, led in 914 the last Arab attempt to restore their domination over the Caucasus. The Sajid invasion of Georgia, as it is known, was however a failure, although it devastated Georgian lands, and allowed the Bagratids to restore the alliance with Byzantium, which they had earlier neglected in favour of the Caliphs. This renewed alliance with a strong Christian power kept Georgia free from Arab interference, and allowed an economic and artistic renaissance.Toumanoff (1966), p. 615 From that moment, the Arabs stopped playing a significant role in the history of Georgia, and the progressive unification of the country under the Bagrationi proceeded without any interference on their part. Only Tbilisi and its surroundings was still ruled by an emir, whose relations with the Caliphate were now tenuous at best. During the 11th century, the wealthy citizens of the city gained much power, as a council of elders (birebi), and kept alive the emirate alive mostly as a way to avoid taxation from the Georgian kings.Suny (1994), p. 35 The Georgian king Bagrat IV took the city three times (1046, 1049, 1062), but could not keep it under his rule.Toumanoff (1966), p. 622 By the 1060s, the Great Seljuk Empire, led by Alp Arslan, a Turk, had replaced the Arabs as the main Muslim menace facing Georgia. The Seljuks appointed a new emir in Tbilisi, but after his death in 1080, the city was again ruled by its local elders. In 1121, David IV \\"the Builder\\", King of Georgia, defeated the Seljuqs at the battle of Didgori, allowing him to enter Tbilisi the next year, and putting an end to almost 500 years of Arab presence in Georgia. Tbilisi lost its autonomy and became the royal capital, but its inhabitants long remained predominantly Muslim.

Early life From 2007‚Äì2011, Byrne formed several bands, among them, Pop Punk band called Mr Lightweight, and 'Moses Moorhouse and the Dinosaur Palace'. A desire to pursue music beyond these ventures led Byrne to audition for The Voice of Ireland. Byrne has come a long way since winning the inaugural season of ‚ÄúThe Voice of Ireland‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe Voice‚Äù was a learning experience, that included both highs and lows. Making an album in 3 months meant writing new songs with some talented people, but also, in some ways, compromising on the art Byrne wanted to create. After the initial roar, things went back to normal and Byrne continued gigging around Ireland, UK and Europe; however, with a new sense of confidence. Career =2012: The Voice of Ireland= Byrne entered The Voice of Ireland in 2011, singing Bruce Springsteen's \\"The River\\" at the blind auditions. All four coaches turned around but Byrne ultimately chose Niall \\"Bressie\\" Breslin as his coach. During the battle rounds, Byrne was pitted against Dara Molloy; they sang \\"If It Makes You Happy\\" after which Bressie decided to send Byrne through to the live shows. For the first live show, Byrne sang \\"You Do Something to Me\\" and was saved by the public vote. In week three, he sang \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" and was safe. For the fifth live show Byrne sang \\"The Day We Caught the Train\\" and was sent through to the quarter final by public vote. Before the final, his version of \\"What a Wonderful World\\" topped the iTunes charts in Ireland. Louis Walsh said he could crack America. On 29 April 2012, Byrne was crowned the winner of the first series. *All four coaches turned around. Pat joined team Bressie. *Pat Byrne was against Dara Malloy.

'All Or Nothing', studio album and other ventures Pat Byrne released his album's debut single, titled \\"End Of The World\\" on 2 November 2012, following the release of its music video on 30 October 2012. The single reached No.61 in the Irish Singles Charts. The album, titled \\"All Or Nothing\\", was released on 22 November 2012 and reached No.10 in the Irish Album Charts. A second single from the album, also titled \\"All Or Nothing\\", was released on 15 March 2013 and reached No. 80 in the charts. This followed the release of its music video on 8 March 2013. Since the release of End Of The World, Byrne has confirmed that he is still constantly gigging and writing new music in an interview in April 2015. He also announced in the same interview that he is no longer recording with Universal since 2014.

MCR catalyzes the reaction that releases methane in the final step of methanogenesis: : + HS‚ÄìCoB -> \\\\+ CoB‚ÄìS‚ÄìS‚ÄìCoM { Structure of coenzyme M (HS-CoM) upright=1.5 } It is found only in methanogenic Archaea and anaerobic methanotrophic Archaea. It occurs in relatively high concentrations in archaea that are involved in reverse methanogenesis: these can contain up to 7% by weight of the nickel protein. Structure The trivial name cofactor F430 was assigned in 1978 based on the properties of a yellow sample extracted from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, which had a spectroscopic maximum at 430 nm. It was identified as the MCR cofactor in 1982 and the complete structure was deduced by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. Coenzyme F430 features a reduced porphyrin in a macrocyclic ring system called a corphin. In addition, it possesses two additional rings in comparison to the standard tetrapyrrole (rings A-D), having a Œ≥-lactam ring E and a keto-containing carbocyclic ring F. It is the only natural tetrapyrrole containing nickel, an element rarely found in biological systems. Biosynthesis { uroporphyrinogen III dihydrosirohydrochlorin sirohydrochlorin } The biosynthesis builds from uroporphyrinogen III, the progenitor of all natural tetrapyrroles, including chlorophyll, vitamin B12, phycobilins, siroheme, heme, and heme d1. It is converted to sirohydrochlorin via dihydrosirohydrochlorin. Insertion of nickel into this tetrapyrrole is catalysed in reaction by the same chelatase, CbiX, which inserts cobalt in the biosynthesis of cobalamin, here giving nickel(II)-sirohydrochlorin. Nickel(II)-sirohydrochlorin a,c-diamide is converted to seco-F430 The ATP-dependent Ni-sirohydrochlorin a,c-diamide synthase (CfbE) then converts the a and c acetate side chains to acetamide in reactions , generating nickel(II)-sirohydrochlorin a,c-diamide. The sequence of the two amidations is random. A two-component complex Ni-sirohydrochlorin a,c-diamide reductive cyclase (CfbCD) carries out a 6-electron and 7-proton reduction of the ring system in a reaction generating the 15,173-seco-F430-173-acid (seco-F430) intermediate. Reduction involves ATP hydrolysis and electrons are relayed through two 4Fe-4S centres. In the final step, the keto-containing carbocylic ring F is formed by an ATP-dependent enzyme Coenzyme F(430) synthetase (CfbB) in reaction , generating coenzyme F430. This enzyme is a MurF-like ligase, as found in peptidoglycan biosynthesis.

The Clivus Lautumiarum was the road (clivus, \\"slope\\" or \\"street\\") on which they were located. Platner identified the road as the one running between the Curia and the Temple of Concordia which became the Clivus Argentarius in the later Empire,Platner, Topography and Monuments of Ancient Rome, pp. 171‚Äì172. but the Argentarius is also thought to have been a separate street.Richardson, Topographical Dictionary, p. 88. In Platner's analysis, it was thus one of six streets leading into the Forum, which it connected to the Porta Fontinalis, from there forming the direct link to the Campus Martius until the street plan was altered by the building of the Imperial fora.Platner, Topography and Monuments of Ancient Rome, pp. 171‚Äì172. Vicus Lautumiarum refers to the area as a neighborhood or quarter (see vicus) . The quarries themselves were used as dungeons,Livy 32.26.17; Seneca Rhetor Controversiae 9.4[27].21; Richardson, Topographical Dictionary, p. 234. primarily for low-status prisoners such as slaves. They were adjacent to or near the Tullianum or Carcer,Platner, Topography and Monuments of Ancient Rome, p. 252. forming with it a penal complex that included the Tarpeian Rock and Gemonian stairs.Ann Thomas Wilkins, \\"Sallust's Tullianum: Reality, Description, and Beyond,\\" in Rome and Her Monuments: Essays on the City and Literature of Rome in Honor of Katherine A. Geffcken (Bolchazy-Carducci, 2000), p. 123. The name Lautumiae was supposed to derive from the latomia (ŒªŒ±œÑŒøŒºŒØŒ±) of Syracuse,Platner, Topography and Monuments of Ancient Rome, p. 252. where quarries were used as prisons.Varro, De lingua latina 5.151; Paulus ex Festo 104 (edition of Lindsay); Richardson, Topographical Dictionary, p. 234. Despite Varro's statement that Servius Tullius modeled an underground chamber after the Syracusan latomiae,Varro, De lingua latina 5.151; Wilkins, \\"Sallust's Tullianum,\\" p. 123. the word probably came into use sometime between 212 and 180 BC.Richardson, Topographical Dictionary, p. 234. The fire of 210 BC burned an area along the northeast side of the Forum Romanum as delineated by the Lautumiae.Livy 26.27.3, 27.11.16; Richardson, Topographical Dictionary, pp. 42, 169. The Atrium Maenium was located in lautumiis on the Clivus Argentarius.Richardson, Topographical Dictionary, p. 41. Clivus Argentarius Although Platner identified the Clivus Argentarius (\\"Banker Street\\") with the Lautumiae, Lawrence Richardson distinguishes the two in A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (1992). Richardson identified the Clivus Argentarius as the street that connects the Roman Forum and the Campus Martius, running from the Vulcanal and along the front of the Carcer (Tullianum) over the northeast slope of the Capitoline Hill.
