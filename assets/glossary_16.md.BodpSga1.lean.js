The AKP, led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has ruled Turkey with a large majority in parliament since 2002. During this time Turkey has had good relations with the West, but also cordial ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran and a more pro-Palestinian policy.The Turkish model. A hard act to follow economist.com 6 August 2011 It has had vigorously contested, \\"substantially free and fair\\" elections, a vibrant culture, and has undergone an economic boom, developing a \\"large and growing middle class.\\" However, as of summer 2013 and the crushing of the Taksim Gezi Park protests, some commentators complained that the model has come \\"unstuck\\". Overview The term originated in connection with the Arab Spring and the Arab states—Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya—that had overthrown dictators in 2011 and begun building new political and economic systems.The Turkish Model: Can It Be Replicated? by Peter Kenyon NPR 6 January 2012Effort to Rebrand Arab Spring Backfires in Iran By ROBERT F. WORTH nyt.com 2 February 2012 Turkey's \\"deeply religious\\" Sunni Muslim prime minister, Erdoğan, was received by \\"adoring crowds\\" during a visit to Egypt in September 2011, and Turkey has polled high favorable ratings with many Arab countries. Praise has come from former acting Egyptian president Mohamed Hussein Tantawia, who told reporters after his meeting with Turkey's president Abdullah Gül, \\"The Turkish experience is the closest experience to the Egyptian people. Turkey is the model to inspire from.\\" One observer (Sinan Ülgen) has identified \\"five chief characteristics\\" of the model: accommodation of Secularism, Democracy, and Political Islam; a stabilizing role by the military; successful economic liberalization and trade integration; membership in Western multilateral organizations like NATO, the Council of Europe, and the European Court for Human Rights; and popular confidence in the country’s institutions.Can the Turkish Model Gain Traction in the New Middle East? Sinan Ülgen, Marwan Muasher, Thomas de Waal, Thomas Carothers  carnegieendowment.org 19 December 2011 Some critics have complained about the treatment of minority Alevi and Kurdish groups, and of some imprisoned journalists.Is Turkey the best model for Arab democracy? Despite the country's remarkable progress, Turkey has yet to solve the 'Kurdish problem' and allow press freedom. by Mark LeVine aljazeera.com 19 September 2011Is model Turkey sliding into authoritarianism? By Alexander Christie-Miller/ csmonitor.com / 16 December 2011 As of March 2013, a \\"mounting number of Turkish lawyers, politicians, journalists\\" have been imprisoned, in what journalist Dexter Filkins has called \\"an increasingly harsh campaign to crush domestic opposition\\".Letter from Turkey, The Deep State. The Prime Minister is revered as a moderate, but how far will he go to stay in power? by Dexter Filkins newyorker.com March 12, 2012 Among those imprisoned have been Ragip Zarakolu, a constitutional law professor; Ahmet Şık, a prize-winning investigative journalist; and Nedim Şener, a noted free- speech activist. =Alleged uniqueness= Others have noted that Turkey's unique history may mean the model will be of limited use to Egypt or other countries. According to Şebnem Gümüşçü, the success is based on Islamists accepting the \\"secular-democratic framework of the Turkish state\\", and not Islamists' \\"development of institutional and political structures that accommodated both Islamic and democratic principles\\"; in other words, the current stability and democracy is only a result of Islamists toeing a line set by secular-democratic frameworks rather than of the Islamists' own doing.There is no ‘Turkish model’ for Egypt  By Sebnem Gumuscu The Daily Star 17 January 2012 The Economist magazine also finds \\"many reasons to be cautious about expecting Arabs to follow Turks\\", such as the long evolution of the democratic Islamism, the relative power and prestige of the secularism, and tolerance for electoral politics of military rulers. Journalist Alp Altınörs complains that during the Erdoğan era of 2002–2012, growth has \\"been coupled with little social benefit\\". The main force for economic growth has been foreign capital, but \\"imperialists\\" have \\"effectively plundered the country\\", transferring the equivalent of $120 billion to foreign countries. He also contends that unemployment has remained high, labour rights deteriorated, and inequality worsened,with the top 0.5% of Turkish bank accounts in Turkish banks containing 63% of total money deposited and \\"harsh repression\\" of journalists, unions, and Kurds have kept \\"10,000 political prisoners\\" in Turkish prisons. Cihan Tuğal disagrees with the orthodox claim that Turkey represents a model for other Islamic countries with its unique form of Islamic liberalism and refutes any suggestion that what went wrong in Turkey is limited to the AKP’s or more directly to Erdoğan’s arrogance and authoritarian inclinations Tuğal, Cihan (2016). The Fall of the Turkish Model: How the Arab Uprisings Brought Down Islamic Liberalism. New York and London: Verso. .. On the other hand, his approach is criticised for misreading the Gezi Park protests Altinors, Gorkem. (2017). Book Review: The Fall of the Turkish Model: How the Arab Uprising Brought Down Islamic Liberalism by Cihan Tuğal. Capital & Class. 41, 183-185.. =Possible deterioration= In May–June 2013, there were massive public protests, including a large number of students, against the Erdoğan government. Although Erdoğan described the protesters as \\"just a few looters\\", 3.5 million of Turkey's 80 million people are estimated to have taken part in almost 5,000 demonstrations. Five people were killed and more than 8,000 injured by water cannons and tear gas. The event has been described (by journalist Christopher de Bellaigue) as part of a move by Erdoğan away from a more tolerant, diverse, and democratic Turkey, toward \\"vindictive authoritarianism\\" that is \\"undermining his own reputation as a path-finding democrat in the Muslim world\\". In May 2016, author Mustafa Akyol lamented that \\"the rhetoric of liberal opening\\" in Turkey \\"has given way to authoritarianism, the peace process with the Kurdish nationalists has fallen apart, press freedoms are diminishing and terrorist attacks are on the rise.\\" Supporters of Erdoğan credit the change to conspiracies in the West aided by \\"their treacherous 'agents'\\" in Turkey to undermine the newly powerful and independent Turkey, while Akyol blames it on the corruption of power—AKP members having been \\"tempted, intoxicated and corrupted\\" by the \\"wealth, prestige and glory\\" of being in power.

She is best known for sculpture and installation art, but also works in a variety of other media (drawing, painting, printing, performance, video, music).  Career  Tea Jorjadze studied at the Academy of Arts in Tbilisi from 1988–1993. Due to the Georgian Civil War the school was closed in 1993. Jorjadze left the country and became a student at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam. After one year she left the Netherlands for the Staatliche Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, where Professor Dieter Krieg (until 1997) and Professor Rosemarie Trockel (1998–2001) became her teachers. She graduated as Meisterschüler of Rosemarie Trockel in 2000.Thea Djordjadze on homepage of Galerie Micky Schubert In 1996, she went back to Tbilisi to catch up on her bachelor of arts. From 1999 on, Jorjadze was a member of the artist group hobbypopMUSEUM, alongside for example Björn Dahlem, Bettina Furler, Christian Jendreiko, Matthias Lahme, Dietmar Lutz, André Niebur, Sophie von Hellerman, and Markus Vater. The group was running a studio in a former postal building in Düsseldorf, which they also used regularly as an exhibition space. The collective released several catalogs as well as records, such as Studio Apartment. hobbypopMUSEUM was invited to participate at shows in San Francisco by Luc Tuymans, then curator of the NICC in Antwerp, and by the Tate Gallery. In 2003, Djordjadze stopped working with hobbypopMUSEUM (the artist group still exists).homepage of hobbypopMUSEUM Jorjadze collaborated on several occasions with Rosemarie Trockel, including the Venice Biennale in 2003, and exhibitions at Kunsthalle St. Gallen in (2006), the 11th Biennale de Lyon (2007), Sprüth Magers Berlin (2017), and Deichtorhallen Hamburg (2019), among others. Tea Jorjadze is represented by Galerie Monika Sprüth Philomene Magers in Berlin, London and Los Angeles; by Kaufmann Repetto in Milan; and by Galerie Meyer Kainer in Vienna.  Work  Tea Jorjadze works with materials like plaster, wood, ceramic, glass, along with fabrics, sponge, soap, cardboard or papier-mâché – more openly suggestive of a sphere of feminine domesticity. They are assembled in what looks like an almost intuitive process, where unformed, premature pieces collide with / or rest on precise architectural or domestic structures: hybrid compositions with references to the modernist language. In her works and their titles, she refers to popular culture, film (e.g. Augen ohne Gesicht, 2000), architecture (e.g. le Corbusier in Mondi Possibli 2006), (popular) science and hermetism (e.g. edition Die Mathematik, 2001, installation o.T. (Dipol), 2003, or performances WahrSagen, 2001, and Kaffeesatzlesen, 2008), literature (e.g. Je n'ai besoin de personne pour me souvenir Lilya Brik and Vladimir Mayakovsky or in Archäologie, Politik, Politik, Archäologie, Archäologie, Politik, Politik, Archäologie Andrè Malraux and Joseph Brodsky), as well as Georgian arts and crafts and culture (e.g. in incorporating carpets in her work or in quoting Niko Pirosmani in 2001). The viewer is often invited into an ongoing research, in which the transformation and assemblage of materials is sedimented in the objects. Der Knacks (i.e. the crack) (2007), a plaster sculpture broken and then reassembled in an in-stable formation is emblematic of the artist’s method of production. The title of the work refers to Francis Scott Fitzgerald’s The Crack Up, in which break or failure is indicated as the center part of the creative process.Vanessa Joan Müller: Non-objective Objects: Some Remarks on Works by Thea Djordjadze, London: Afterall #23, 2010Quinn Latimer: Thea Djordjadze - Delicacy, vitrines and Modernism; scaffolding, relics and arcades, London: Frieze #125, 2009Catherine Wood in: Thea Djordjadze, Nuremberg: Verlag für moderne Kunst, 2008  Honors and Grants In 2001, Jorjadze was awarded the Reise-Stipendium (travel grant) of SK-Stiftung Düsseldorf and Peter-Mertes-Stipendium; in 2004 the NRW-Stipendium für Künstlerinnen mit Kindern (scholarship for female artists with children of the state NRW) and Atelier–Stipendium der Imhoff–Stiftung und des Kölnischen Kunstvereins (studio grant); in 2006, she was invited by Sommerakademie des Zentrum Paul Klee and in 2007 to an artist residency by Artist-run space Studio Voltaire London, in 2008 she was granted a Arbeitsstipendium (work grant) of Kunststiftung NRW and the Katalogstipendium der Alfried-Krupp-von- Bohlen-und-Halbach-Stiftung (catalog grant).

Coburn was born in White Sulphur Springs, Montana Territory, the son of Robert Coburn Senior, the founder of the noted Circle C Ranch. John D. Flanagan, \\"Coburn, Walt\\", in Twentieth Century Western Writers, edited by Geoff Sadler. St. James Press, 1991, , (pp. 129-34) Coburn served in the military in the First World War. He later spent time as a cowboy and a surveyor, before becoming a full-time writer in the 1920s. Western author Coburn began his career with Western stories in general fiction pulp magazines such as Adventure and Argosy.Lee Server, \\"Coburn, Walt\\" in Encyclopedia of Pulp Fiction Writers. Facts on File, 2002 (pp. 65-66) Later Coburn moved on to pulps specializing in Westerns, including Western Story Magazine, Lariat Story Magazine, Ace-High Western and Frontier Stories.Jon Tuska, The Western Story: A Chronological Treasury, University of Nebraska Press, 1999, (p.xxviii). He often wrote for the Fiction House pulp magazines, which promoted Coburn as \\"the Cowboy Author\\".Jon Tuska, Star Western, Gramercy Books, 1995, (p.132). Coburn was enormously prolific; Flanagan states Coburn wrote almost two million words of fiction over a thirty year period. Coburn at his most prolific, averaged over 600,000 published words per year. He was so popular that eventually, two pulp magazines - Walt Coburn’s Western Magazine and Walt Coburn’s Action Novels were issued, consisting mainly of reprints of Coburn's work. After the pulps ended in the 1950s, Coburn switched his focus to writing paperback originals. Coburn was a devout Christian. Coburn claimed, in his posthumously published autobiography Western Word Wrangler (1973) that God had chosen him to spread the Christian message through his fiction. Coburn committed suicide at age 82 in Prescott, Arizona.

GSN: Government Security News(ISC)2 at a crossroads: CISSP value vs. security industry growth. SearchSecurity History In the mid-1980s a need arose for a standardized and vendor-neutral certification program that provided structure and demonstrated competence in the field of IT security, and several professional societies recognized that certification programs attesting to the qualifications of information security personnel were desperately needed. In June 1988, a conference was hosted by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Federal Information Systems Security Educators Association (FISSEA) at Idaho State University in Pocatello, Idaho to address the need for standardized curriculum for the burgeoning profession. Organizations in attendance included: • Canadian Information Processing Society (CIPS) • Computer Security Institute (CSI) • Data Processing Management Association Special Interest Group for Certified Professionals (DPMA SIG-CP) • Data Processing Management Association Special Interest Group for Computer Security (DPMA SIG-CS) • Idaho State University (ISU) • Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) • and the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) During the conference, the question was raised why virtually every group represented, save NIST and ISU, was creating a professional certification. The conference participants agreed to form a consortium that would attempt to bring together the competing agendas of the various organizations. In November 1988, the Special Interest Group for Computer Security (SIG-CS), a member of the Data Processing Management Association (DPMA), brought together several organizations interested in this. The (ISC)² was formed in mid-1989 as a non- profit organization with this goal in mind [8]. By 1990, the first working committee to establish something called the Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) had been formed. The work done by that committee resulted in the first version of CBK being finalized by 1992, with the CISSP credential launched by 1994, followed by the SSCP credential in 2001, the CAP credential in 2005, and the CSSLP credential in 2008, the CCFP and HCISPP in 2013 and the CCSP in 2015.[9] In 2001, (ISC)² established its Europe, Middle East and Africa regional office in London. In 2002, (ISC)² opened its Asia-Pacific regional office in Hong Kong. In 2015, (ISC)² introduced its North America regional office in Washington, D.C. Since 2011, (ISC)² organizes the annual (ISC)² Security Congress conference. The 2019 conference will be the first international iteration of the event and will be held in Orlando, Florida.

The factory is part of Daimler- Benz AG and since 1991 it has made Mercedes-Benz vans. It is also the producer of the Multicar line of automobiles. Supplier of aero engines for the Luftwaffe Daimler-Benz DB 603 engine, partly sectioned to show internal working. The Daimler-Benz company established the Ludwigsfelde factory in 1936 to make DB 600 aero engines for new Luftwaffe bomber- and fighter-aircraft. In the course of German re-armament and the Second World War the factory went on to make Daimler-Benz DB 601, DB 603 and DB 605 engines for various Luftwaffe aircraft. During the Second World War (1939-1945) the factory used at least 10,000 prisoners of war, forced labourers and concentration-camp prisoners to work in the factory. From 1943 to 1944 it used the forced labour of about 1,100 women prisoners from the Ravensbrück concentration camp north of Berlin. Ludwigsfelde lies at least from Ravensbrück, so the forced labourers were housed near the factory in a subsidiary concentration camp called the Deutschlandhalle. Early in 1945 the United States Army Air Forces bombed the factory. Then, after the surrender of Germany in May 1945, what remained of the works was dismantled and taken to the Soviet Union as part of the Allies' programme to take reparations from Germany and reduce German industrial capacity. Post-war recovery Multicar M21 being used in the rebuilding of Leninplatz, Dresden in about 1966, photographed by Richard Peter. Pirna 014 jet engine at the Spring Leipzig Trade Fair in March 1958 Brandenburg was part of the Sowjetische Besatzungszone (SBZ or Soviet occupation zone) from 1945 and the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR or German Democratic Republic) from 1949. The Volkseigener Betrieb Industriewerke Ludwigsfelde was founded on 1 March 1952. Initially it made marine diesel engines, machine tools and machine elements. Assembly of Multicar M21 Diesel-Ameise (\\"diesel ant\\") vehicles was transferred to Ludwigsfelde from the Schmiedewerk Roßwein (\\"Roßwein Forge Works\\") in Saxony. In 1953 IWL became involved in the development of motor scooters, which entered production in 1954. In 1958 IWL began production of drop forging, precision-casting, jet engines, agricultural machinery and one-off special machinery. The jets were Pirna 014 engines for the Dresden 152 airliner, whose first prototype made its first test flight in December 1958. In 1960 VEB Flugzeuge Dresden was building 20 aircraft to enter service with Deutsche Lufthansa der DDR (which in 1963 became Interflug), for which IWL had begun series production of the Pirna 014. However, the first 152 prototype crashed in March 1959 killing its crew, and the second prototype was grounded after a fuel tank malfunction caused a dangerous reduction in fuel supply to the engines. During ground testing in September 1960 the third prototype also suffered a fuel tank fault, and its ground tests were ended in December. In February 1961 the SED Politbüro decided to terminate aircraft production, which brought Pirna 014 production to an end at IWL. One engine was tested on an Ilyushin Il-28 aircraft until June 1961 but this did not lead to the Pirna 014's further use or production. In about mid-1961 all Dresden 152 aircraft were scrapped. Cancellation of the 152 left IWL with 30 completed jet engines and a gap in planned industrial production. The engines were later used to power minesweepers for the Volksmarine. IWL motor scooters A farmer on an IWL Pitty scooter near Rostock in Mecklenburg in January 1956. A complete sequence of IWL motor scooter models in historical order. From left to right: Pitty, SR 56 Wiesel, SR 59 Berlin and TR 150 Troll 1. After the Second World War, various manufacturers — and particularly aircraft and aircraft components makers — diversified into other products including motor scooters. In Italy, Piaggio launched the Vespa in 1946 closely followed by Innocenti's launch of the Lambretta in 1947. The new scooters found a market among customers who could not obtain or could not afford a car but wanted a machine that was cleaner, simpler and gave more weather protection than a motorcycle. Both Piaggio and Innocenti fitted specially designed engines mounted on one side of the rear wheel, which kept the wheelbase short and maximised urban maneuverability. A bulbous rear enclosure kept the engine enclosed, which made a scooter cleaner than most motorcycles of the period. The use of aircraft industry techniques, combined with more stylish appearance made Italian scooters commercially successful, and Innocenti and Piaggio both exported large numbers of their scooters and licensed manufacturers in the Bundesrepublik Deutschland (BRD or West Germany) and other countries to make them. Numerous European manufacturers who were not licensed to build Italian- designed scooters, developed their own models in an attempt to compete. In 1951 the automotive manufacturer Hans Glas in Bavaria launched his own design of scooter, the Goggo, initially with a 123 cc engine but from 1953 with more powerful 147 cc and 198 cc engines. In 1953 the West German aircraft maker Heinkel launched the Tourist, initially with a 149 cc engine but from 1954 enlarged to 174 cc. However, West German designers tended to use conventional motorcycle-type engines which were not small or light enough to fit beside the rear wheel. They were therefore mounted in front of the rear wheel, which significantly lengthened the scooters' wheelbase. East German engineers responded to the growing market and competition by developing a number of prototype scooters between 1950 and 1954. August Falz of Döbeln in Saxony had built a primitive motor scooter in 1950, and by 1954 had developed a prototype with streamlined bodywork and powered by a 174 cc ČZ engine imported from the ČSSR. However, the DDR decided that its scooter would be made only with indigenous DDR components, so the MZ RT 125/1 unit was selected. The engine displaced 123 cc, produced 5.5 bhp and had a three-speed transmission. It was smaller and less powerful than 174 cc ČZ engine, and also than engines that were being fitted in West German scooters by 1954 that produced abetween 9 and 12 bhp. This put the DDR's scooter at a competitive disadvantage before it even entered production. The MZ factory at Zschopau would increase engine production to supply the expected scooter demand. The DDR's established EMW, MZ and Simson motorcycle factories were already fully occupied making their own products, so if the country was to make its own scooter it would have to be in a different factory. The DDR's planned economy could be criticised for choosing the IWL factory as thousands of MZ engines would have to be transported at least from Zschopau to Ludwigsfelde. However, Ludwigsfelde was in the centre of the DDR and is on the outskirts of Berlin. The capital's radial rail and road links could distribute the finished scooters efficiently, and East Berlin could be expected to be one of the largest urban markets for them. If there was a mistake, it was to rely on expanding engine production at Zschopau when IWL had nearly twenty years' experience of making engines at Ludwigsfelde. The prototype scooter really needed further development before being put into production. However, in the wake of the June 1953 uprising the DDR government was in a hurry to implement its Neue Kurs (\\"New Course\\") policy to improve the supply of consumer goods. This put the VEB Industriewerke Ludwigsfelde under great pressure to begin scooter production by 1955. =Pitty= 1955 IWL Pitty IWL's first production model, named the Pitty, was launched early in 1955 at a retail price of 2,300 Marks. The Pittys front wheel had leading link suspension, while its rear wheel had hydraulically damped swingarm suspension on which the engine and gearbox unit was mounted: an arrangement that Vespa had pioneered. However, IWL followed West German practice in mounting the engine in front of the rear wheel instead of beside it, thus giving the Pitty a much longer wheelbase than its Italian counterparts. On a scooter, a pressed-steel full enclosure under the seat encases the rear wheel, engine and gearbox. In order to remain within its operating temperature range, a cooling fan was added to the air-cooled MZ engine. Powering this fan sapped the engine's already inadequate 5 PS power output. IWL copied Glas and Heinkel by giving the Pitty a large fairing that enveloped the front wheel. This increased the scooter's weight to , which was heavy for its class and further impeded its under-powered performance. IWL claimed a top speed, but in practice this was seldom achieved. At the beginning of 1955, reporters from the East German Der deutsche Straßenverkehr magazine tested the Pitty and gave IWL numerous suggestions to improve it. Numerous customers who bought the scooter also complained. The Pitty has a dualseat that riders complained was too hard. Unlike most scooters, the Pitty has no steering lock for security. Its only anti-theft device is a flap in the enclosure under the seat that can be closed over the fuel tap and locked. IWL reacted to criticism by quickly developing a successor model, and kept the Pitty in production for only just over a year. In this time a total of only 11,293 Pitty scooters were built. =SR 56 Wiesel= IWL SR 56 Wiesel In 1956 IWL replaced the Pitty with the SR 56 Wiesel. \\"SR\\" stands for StadtRoller (\\"town scooter\\"), 56 is the year, and Wiesel is German for weasel. Instead of the Pittys huge fairing, the Wiesel has a more conventional scooter fairing behind the front wheel and a separate front mudguard. This reduced the weight to : still heavy, but lighter than the Pitty. The rear swingarm was of a new trapezoidal design, which allowed the chain's tension to remain constant as the rear wheel travelled vertically. The fuel tank was increased to , which gave the scooter a range. Also in 1956 MZ introduced the RT 125/2 motorcycle, for which it marginally increased engine power to 6 PS. Both the weight reduction and the power increase were small, and the Wiesels power-to-weight ratio was inferior to that of numerous western competitors. IWL claimed a cruising speed, but in reality the Wiesel was only 3 or faster than the Pitty. Despite customer complaints, the Wiesel retained its predecessor's hard upholstery, lockable fuel tap flap and lack of a steering lock. It was easy for a thief to force the flap, and Der deutsche Straßenverkehrs testers were astonished that IWL had not rectified this fault from the previous model. IWL produced the Wiesel until 1959, by which time a total of 57,400 had been built. =SR 59 Berlin= Some IWL enthusiasts keep their scooters' appearance as standard, while others such as the owner of this SR 59 Berlin have adopted highly individual custom colour schemes. In 1959 IWL replaced the SR 56 Wiesel with the SR 59 Berlin. This shared the same bodywork as the Wiesel but had well-upholstered separate saddles for the rider and pillion passenger. Also in 1959, MZ introduced the RT 125/3 motorcycle, which had not only a slightly more powerful engine but also a four-speed transmission. IWL specially requested that the version of the RT 125/3 motor made for the scooter be bored out to 143 cc, which increased power output to 7.5 bhp. IWL credibly claimed a top speed of and a cruising speed of . The four-speed transmission improved the machine's flexibility, making hill-climbing significantly less strenuous. The Berlin at last gave riders in the DDR a scooter that was good enough for practical use. It was therefore just as well that IWL at last included a steering lock to secure the relatively desirable Berlin against theft. The Berlin still had less power than many of its western counterparts. In common with its predecessors, its front suspension was undamped, which on roads as bumpy as the DDR's was a significant weak point. Nevertheless, the Berlin secured IWL's first export orders. IWL produced the Berlin until the end of 1962, by which time a total of 113,943 had been built. =Campi trailer= Although IWL projected the Berlin as a \\"town scooter\\", new private motor vehicles were in such short supply in the DDR that customers made no such distinction. The Berlin was capable of longer journeys, including holidays, but a scooter has far less luggage capacity than either a small car or a motorcycle and sidecar combination. Instead of devising a sidecar to fit the Berlin, IWL collaborated with Stoye of Leipzig, the DDR's sidecar manufacturer, to develop a lightweight, single-wheel trailer. SR 59 Berlin with IWL-Stoye Campi trailer. The result was the Campi trailer, which was styled to complement a scooter and was roomy enough to carry a set of 1960s camping equipment. IWL made the Campis chassis, including a tubular steel towing link that connected to the scooter behind the pillion seat and above the rear light. Stoye made the bodywork, which is aluminium and contributes to the trailer weighing only . This made it light enough for a Berlins 7.5 bhp engine to cope with the combined weight of its rider, passenger, trailer and luggage, albeit at markedly less speed than when being ridden solo. The Campi added inconveniently to the length of the scooter, while adding less luggage capacity than a sidecar. Because of these limitations, its use was confined chiefly to holiday and leisure journeys. The Campi was made until 1965, by when about 5,700 had been built. =TR 150 Troll 1= 1964 example of the TR 150 Troll 1, with original handlebar-end indicators In 1963 IWL replaced the SR 59 Berlin with the TR 150 Troll 1. Whereas the Wiesel and Berlin had retailed for 2,300 Marks, the same price as a Pitty in 1954, for the Troll 1 the price was increased to 2,550 Marks. \\"TR\\" stands for TourenRoller and the backronym \\"Troll\\" stands for TourenRoller Ludwigsfelde (\\"Ludwigsfelde touring scooter\\"), emphasising the longer journeys on which IWL scooters were now being ridden. The \\"1\\" at the end evidently indicated that IWL hoped to develop a further model. However, in December 1962, during the Troll 1's development, the Ministerrat der DDR (\\"Council of Ministers of the GDR\\") had announced that the factory would switch to making a new model of IFA truck. This decision may have acted as a disincentive to improve the Troll 1 from before the model's launch in 1963 until the end of production in 1965. Both in Germany and in most of the European states to which IWL might have hoped to export scooters, trolls are known from Norse mythology and Scandinavian folklore as beings that are in many cases slow-witted, in some cases ugly, seldom friendly to humans and in a few cases inclined to kill and eat people. Why any vehicle maker would choose to name one of its models after such creatures is not clear. In 1962 MZ had introduced the ES 150 motorcycle, and the scooter version of its 143 cc engine supplied for the Troll 1 had its power increased to 9.5 bhp. The rear chain runs in an oilbath in a patent MZ hard-rubber enclosure, which keeps oil in and dirt out and greatly prolongs chain life. IWL revised the bodywork, giving a tail unit like that of the Heinkel Tourist model A2 and quickly detachable side panels like a Dürkopp Diana. Each side panel is secured by a central bayonet lock and is simple to undo and light to remove, easing access to the engine, gearbox and rear chain. For the Troll 1, IWL reverted to a dualseat, perhaps because twin saddles were becoming dated. The Troll 1 had diameter drum brakes: bigger than on all previous IWL models. On this Troll 1 the original indicators have been replaced with more conventionally positioned modern ones. The Troll 1 had indicators as a standard factory fitment. The front indicators are at the ends of the handlebars in a style that was becoming customary in both the BRD and the DDR at the time. In order to increase economies of scale IWL revised its scooter design to use other MZ ES 150 parts including the headlight nacelle, handlebars, front and rear shock absorbers and Earles front fork. This made the Troll 1 the first IWL scooter to have hydraulically damped front suspension. The front mudguard of the Wiesel and Berlin would not fit with the Earles fork assembly, so IWL designed a new one to accommodate the movement of the front suspension. This necessitated a bulbous shape that was inconsistent with the improved styling of the tail unit. In 1964 East Germany's annual book Motor Jahr circumspectly observed \\"Diese Vorderradhaube liegt jetzt zwischen den Federbeinen, was vielleicht nicht jedermanns Geschmack trifft, aber deren gute Zugänglichkeit gewährleistet\\". (\\"This front mudguard now lies between the shock absorbers, which perhaps does not meet everyone's taste, but it ensures good access\\".) However, in February 1963 Der deutsche Straßenverkehr magazine had been more outspoken: \\"Uns konnte diese ›Linie‹ nicht sonderlich begeistern, und wir beneiden das Institut für industrielle Formgebung keinesfalls um seine Mitarbeit\\". (\\"These 'lines' cannot particularly enthuse us, and we do not at all envy the Institute for Industrial Design in their collaboration.\\"). The main chassis member is a welded box-section frame. IWL scooters had a long wheelbase and the Troll 1 was taller than its predecessors, which made the seating position more comfortable but made the machine more vulnerable to crosswinds. In March 1964 Der deutsche Straßenverkehr strongly criticised this shortcoming, but in the same year Motor Jahr played it down by claiming \\"Die Seitenwindempfindlichkeit des „Troll“ liegt in normalen Grenzen. Er reagiert auf Seitenböen nicht anders als durchschnittliche Zweiradfahrzeuge und is deshalb trotz seiner etwas höheren Schwerpunktlage auch in solchen Situationen risikilos zu fahren.\\". (\\"The Trolls crosswind stability lies within normal limits. It reacts to side gusts no differently than average two-wheeled vehicles and therefore despite a somewhat higher centre of gravity it is safe to ride in such conditions.\\") Customers were not fooled, and the Troll 1's crosswind instability damaged its reputation and was partly responsible for the model selling less well than its predecessors. Czechoslovak-made Tatran S 125 in Slovakia At the end of 1965 IWL ended scooter production in order to switch to making IFA W 50 trucks. By the time scooter production ended, IWL had built a total of 56,513 Troll 1's. =Tatran S 125= From 1966 a scooter from the ČSSR was imported for sale in the DDR. The Tatran S 125 had only a 124 cc engine producing 7 PS. However, with less weight and a shorter wheelbase than any IWL model, the Tatran's power-to-weight ratio was practical and at last offered East Germans a real \\"town scooter\\". Commercial vehicles From 1947 IFA concentrated production of large trucks at the former Horch factory in Zwickau in Saxony. In 1958 VEB Waggonfabrik Werdau at Werdau in Saxony (the former Waggonfabrik Schumann) took over as the main IFA truck factory, leaving the VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau to expand production of the new Trabant small car. In 1966 truck production was moved again, from Werdau to IWL at Ludwigsfelde. =IFA W 50= W 50 trucks from IWL on a quayside at Rostock in March 1982, being loaded onto a ship for export. Ludwigsfelde truck production 1978–90: export sales in light green; domestic sales in dark red. The IFA W 50, built at Ludwigsfelde from 17 July 1965 until 1990, was IFA's most important product for decades. Annual sales peaked at 32,516 in 1986. A high proportion of IWL trucks was exported. Between 1978 and 1987 over 80% of W 50 trucks built each year were sold abroad. Total W 50 production at Ludwigsfelde from 1965 to 1990 was 571,831 vehicles. It continued to be built alongside its intended replacement, the L 60. = IFA L 60= NVA-L60 The first L 60 trucks being previewed at the Autumn Leipzig Trade Fair in September 1986. Ludwigsfelde truck production 1965–90: W 50 in dark green; L 60 in pale red. L 60 truck After the launch of the W 50, IWL undertook development work to increase engine power and reduce fuel consumption, reduce empty weight and increase payload, improve reliability and driver comfort and reduce production time. From 1967 IWL was planning a range of new trucks with sizes of three, five, six and 10 tonnes. Two prototypes were built: a three-tonne truck code- numbered 1013 followed by an 11-tonne one code-numbered 1118. In the first quarter of 1970 development work resumed with two new prototypes, one each of the 1013 and 1118. Considerable capacity at IWL continued to be taken up with looking after the W 50, but development of the 1118 slowly continued. The 1118 became the IFA L 60, and development intensified from 1974. In 1978 the DDR made an agreement with Volvo Trucks to use a Volvo cab on an L 60 prototype. Within two years this resulted in a contract to make Volvo cabs under licence, for which a new production hall would be built at Ludwigsfelde. The contract would include IWL supplying cab shells to the Volvo truck plant at Ghent in Belgium and also allowed IWL to supply cabs to VEB Robur-Werke Zittau in Saxony, which made smaller trucks ranging from about 1.5 to 3.5 tonnes. When the preparatory work for the new assembly hall at Ludwigsfelde was well advanced, Volvo tripled the price. In 1980 the Ministerrat der DDR cancelled the agreement and ordered that series production of the L 60 was to go ahead without the Volvo cab. IWL accordingly started development of a new cab, the 6400, both for the W 60 and to supply to Robur. In 1984 IWL again reached agreement to give the L 60 a foreign cab, this time from Steyr in Austria. However, three years later the DDR could not meet Steyr's asking price for the design and the necessary production tools. Instead the L 60 was given a cab based on that of the W 50, but able to be tilted forward for access to the engine. After the W 51 and W 52 projects were discontinued in June 1983 (see above), the L 60 programme was adapted to the needs of Iran and Iraq. The payload was increased to at least six tonnes and power output was increased to a range from 125 to 180 bhp. The L 60 was finally unveiled to the public at the Autumn Leipzig Trade Fair in September 1986 and its series production began at Ludwigsfelde in June 1987. L 60 development had started by 1967 so the model arguably reached the market about 15 years late, and its cab derived from that of the W 50 made it look even more out of date. L 60 sales did grow each year, and in 1989 they peaked at 8,081 vehicles for that year. Total L 60 production at Ludwigsfelde from 1987 to 1990 was 20,293 vehicles. Potential customers within the DDR were deterred not by its appearance but by its price, which was almost double that of the W 50. As a result, IWL kept the W 50 in production alongside the L 60 until 1990. =The end of IFA= The start of L 60 sales in 1987 was a turning point, but not in the way IWL wanted. After 1986, W 50 sales fell more quickly than L 60 sales grew, so IWL's total unit sales fell from an all-time peak of 32,516 in 1986 to 28,152 in 1989. IWL needed a more competitive product, and in the second half of 1989 it held exploratory talks with the West German commercial vehicle builder MAN. However, these did not lead to a joint project. IFA 1318 prototype with Mercedes cab The DDR's Peaceful Revolution took place in September and October 1989. This was followed by contact between IWL and Mercedes-Benz in February 1990 that launched a joint project designated IFA 1318. A prototype IFA 1318 truck, with a Mercedes-Benz LN2 cab on an L 60 chassis, was completed on 3 May 1990. The IFA-Kombinat Nutzkraftwagen (\\"IFA Goods Vehicle Combine\\") was broken up and in June 1990 a separate IFA-Automobilwerk Ludwigsfelde GmbH was founded under the Treuhandanstalt. However, the DDR's adoption of the West German Deutsche Mark on 1 July 1990 led Mercedes-Benz to withdraw from the intended deal by 18 July. As a result, IWL projected that it would reduce its workforce from 8,334 at the end of June 1990 to about 3,150 by the end of the year. The Treuhand would help with the cost of redundancy payments and 2,514 employees would be converted to other work and would be kept on short time until mid-1991. Even this plan was overtaken by the collapse of its established markets in eastern Europe. Orders and production plummeted and in 1990 a combined total of only 17,275 trucks were completed — the lowest number since 1969. L 60 production was terminated in August 1990, and W 50 production was ended 17 December that year. =Mercedes vans= 1990s Mercedes 814 DA pickup truck with crew cab in 2009 Two 1990s Mercedes Vario outside broadcasting vans in 2010 New Mercedes NCV3 Sprinter pickup truck with crew cab in 2007 On 5 October 1990 Mercedes-Benz and the Treuhand reached an agreement on the future of the IWL factory. On 1 February 1991 the Nutzfahrzeuge Ludwigsfelde GmbH (NLG or \\"Ludwigsfelde Goods Vehicles\\") and Entwicklungsgesellschaft für Kraftfahrzeugtechnik Ludwigsfelde (ELG or \\"Ludwigsfelde Development Company for Motor Vehicle Technology) were founded. The Treuhand owned 75% and Mercedes-Benz owned 25%. On 8 February 1991 Ludwigsfelde assembled its first Mercedes vehicle, an LK 814, and three months later it started making Mercedes cabs. Ludwigsfelde began assembly of the T2 \\"Transporter\\" model in September and afterwards was completely transferred there from Mercedes-Benz' Düsseldorf plant. On 1 December 1993 Mercedes-Benz and the Treuhand made a new agreement, that from 1 January 1994 NLG and EGL would become 100% subsidiaries of Mercedes-Benz. At the same time the Ludwigsfelde factory would take over all production of Mercedes goods vehicles in the 4.5 tonne to 7.5 tonne range. On 1 July 1996 Ludwigsfelde began production of a further development of the T 2, the W670 Vario. On 1 July 1997 NLG and EGL were merged as Daimler-Benz Ludwigsfelde GmbH. Between December 1999 and 2001 DaimlerChrysler (the parent company between 1998 and 2007) invested in the order of 500 million Deutsche Mark to redevelop the Ludwigsfelde plant and prepare it to make the W414 Vaneo. Ludwigsfelde made the Vaneo from 25 September 2001 until 8 July 2005. Since 2006 the plant has made NCV3 Sprinter vans, and major elements of the VW LT3 Crafter.

He is best known for working for Pro Wrestling Noah. Career Hirayanagi was a competitor in amateur wrestling in high school. In June 2004 he entered the Pro Wrestling Noah dojo where, under the mentorship of Akira Taue, he was trained as a professional wrestler. Wrestling under his birth name, his first match was in a 13-man Battle royal won by Muhammad Yone on 15 August 2005. Three days later, he made his official debut in a singles match against Kishin Kawabata. As is normal for inexperienced competitors in puroresu, virtually all of Hirayanagi's early matches were losses. On March 21, 2006 Hirayanagi competed in a match against SUWA for Pro Wrestling SEM during which he suffered a triple-fracture of the jaw. It wasn't until the following October that he was able to return to the ring in a time-limit draw with Shuhei Taniguchi. The summer of 2007 saw Hirayanagi venture to the United Kingdom to perform in 6 matches on the British independent circuit. His UK debut came in July 20 loss to Noah compatriot Shuhei Taniguchi for 3 Count Wrestling. 8 days later, the two teamed up to challenge the 4 Front Wrestling Tag Team Champions Mark Sloan and Wade Fitzgerald. In IPW:UK's Debut In Sittingbourne show he was defeated by James Tighe, which was followed by a loss to veteran Johnny Kidd on a Premier Promotions card before concluding his tour by teaming with Dan Head to gain victory over Mark Haskins and Harry Mills. In 2008, Hirayanagi made his Ring of Honor debut in the opening match of the 14 September ROH: The Tokyo Summit show. Teaming with Kotaro Suzuki, he lost to the NJPW duo of No Limit (Tetsuya Naito and Yujiro Takahashi). Later that year he gained his first trophy when he teamed with Yoshinobu Kanemaru and Kotaro Suzuki to defeat KENTA, Taiji Ishimori and Ippei Ota to win that year's One Day Junior Heavyweight Six Man Tag Tournament in Sapporo, Hokkaido. In 2009, Hirayanagi debuted in Dramatic Dream Team (DDT), teaming with his primary trainer Akira Taue to defeat DDT residents Sanshiro Takagi and Michael Nakazawa at the DDT Judgement 2009 event. On August 30, he teamed with frequent partner Kanemaru in his New Japan Pro Wrestling debut in the main event of the Jado and Gedo 20th Anniversary show, losing to Jado and Gedo. Hirayanagi was selected to participate in another interpromotional contest at the combined AJPW/NJPW/Noah All Together supershow on 27 August 2011 at Budokan Hall, competing in a 10-man tag team match billed as the Junior One Night Carnival. Hirayanagi then became a member of the No Mercy faction in Noah. On 10 March 10, 2013, Hirayanagi won his first title in Noah, when he and Maybach Taniguchi, Jr. defeated Ricky Marvin and Super Crazy for the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. The two were forced to vacate the title on May 30, after Suwa had been sidelined with a neck injury. On July 30, Hirayanagi announced his retirement from professional wrestling.

He used his lace making skills and knowledge to form the company, which was formally incorporated in 1894. History Example of an embroidered patch used by youth soccer team During long cold winter nights, Swiss farmers and their families concentrated on handicrafts that could be sold for extra income. The Swiss embroidery tradition, which has roots in flax and linen production dating back hundreds of years, led to the development of distinctive Swiss lace, an intricate, interlaced pattern of threads, looped, twisted or braided to other threads, known throughout the world for its quality and workmanship. Handmade lace and so called hand machine embroidery was often used in decorative clothing, curtains, table linens and many other applications. Lace making and embroidery changed during the Industrial Revolution with the development of automated lace machines, and the shiffli embroidery machine which greatly increased production efficiency and provided the capability to reproduce any number of identical pieces. In 1913, New Yorker John Avery, an advertising counselor and associate sales manager at Arnold B. Heine Co., a New York-based lace and embroidery company, acquired a one-third interest in the Chicago Embroidery Company.The New York Times, June 3, 1913. The company prospered, but Swiss- style lace fell out of fashion in the 1930s. During this period, The Chicago Embroidery company was asked to stitch designs on men's socks, however no one knew how to do this because the sock had to be stitched after it was made and the power looms could not make a design without stitching the sock closed. The company met this challenge by creating a special holder for the socks that allowed the power looms to stitch a design without ruining the sock and in 1938, Otto DeCardy filed for and was granted U.S. patent 2,141,294 for a specialized hose embroidery machine. http://www.google.com/patents/about/2118788_HAND_EMBROIDERY_MACHINE_FOR_SEAM.html?id=SDJGAAAAEBAJ Patent Application With the start of World War II, the U.S. military suddenly needed for millions of embroidered patches to signify rank, unit, and specialty of members of the armed forces. The U.S. Government ordered the major embroidery companies to begin making embroidered patches (also known as shoulder sleeve insignia or SSI) and the looms were converted from lacemaking to war patch production. After the war, a Chicago cap manufacturer approached the company with an order for patches to be sewn on to caps and sold to members of the Boys Scouts of America. This was the beginning of many decades of a business relationship between Chicago Embroidery and the Boy Scouts of America and other scouting organizations. In the years following the war, the company continued making military SSI patches and many different designs for large and small companies, police and fire departments, municipalities, youth groups, sporting organizations and others. During the 1970s, decorative patches became a fashionable clothing accessory for the general public. Chicago Embroidery opened a second factory, and with three shifts working six days a week on more than 20 looms, millions of patches were produced for shipment around the world. Modern era But with the introduction of new direct embroidery technology in the 1980s, the embroidered patch industry underwent a major upheaval. Computerized digital sewing machines allowed intricate designs to be sewn directly onto shirts, jackets, caps, or other items. While customers continued to buy patches, demand dramatically decreased. Boy Scout membership peaked in 1973 and the number of U.S. military personnel peaked in the early 1980s. Demand for patches began to decline. By the turn of the millennium, direct embroidery had taken a huge portion of market share away from patches, and low-cost competition from the Far East pressured U.S. patch manufacturers. More production shifted to China. In 2007, after three generations of family owners, the company was sold to a former employee. For the first time in its history, a Bodenmann family member was not at the helm. The company continues to offer a full line of multi-color patches for a variety of uses and organizations.

The pant will be located west of Bandung in West Java, Indonesia, and its two reservoirs will occupy area in West Bandung Regency and Cianjur Regency. It will have an installed capacity of 1,040 MW and will be Indonesia's first pumped-storage power plant. Background Studies for the project were carried out in the 1990s and a detailed design was completed in 2002. A World Bank loan for the project was approved in May 2011 and signed in November. The West Java government approved the project in October 2011. Preliminary construction such as access road building began in early 2014. The first generator was then expected to be operational by 2019. However, the project has been delayed and the loan was cancelled in May 2017. Construction did not start partly due to the occurrence of landslides. The access road has been built but is considered unsafe. In 2019, a new loan agreement with the World bank was found, and the facility was expected to become operational by 2025, according to Indonesia's Electricity Supply Business Plan. Of the project's US$800 million cost, US$650 million is being provided by the World Bank. The remaining US$150 million is to be supplied by the project owner Perusahaan Listrik Negara. Design and operation The power plant will operate by shifting water between two reservoirs; the lower reservoir on the Upper Cisokan River (a branch of the Citarum River), and the upper reservoir on the Cirumamis River which is a right-bank tributary of the former. When energy demand is high, water from the upper reservoir is sent to the power plant to produce electricity. When energy demand is low, water is pumped from the lower reservoir to the upper by the same pump-generators. This process repeats as needed and allows the plant to serve as a peaking power plant. Both reservoirs will be formed by concrete gravity dams using roller-compacted concrete. Each will have an overflow spillway at the center of their center. The upper reservoir's dam will be tall and long while the lower reservoir dam will be high and in length. The lower reservoir dam will trap water from a catchment area to create a lake with a gross storage capacity of . Of the total capacity, can be used for pumping up to the upper reservoir. The surface area of the lower reservoir will be . The upper reservoir dam will trap water from a much smaller catchment area, , to create its reservoir with a gross storage capacity of and surface area of . Of that capacity, is active (or usable) storage for power generation. The power plant will be located underground near the lower reservoir. Connecting the upper reservoir and the power plant will first be two headrace tunnels, one long and the other in length. Surge tanks on each headrace tunnel help prevent water hammer. Each headrace tunnel connects to a steel-lined penstock, each of which later bifurcates into two penstocks. Each of these four penstocks will supply water to the turbines during power generation. After power generation the water will be discharged into the lower reservoir via four tailrace tunnels. When pumping water moves through the same conduits back to the upper reservoir. The power plant will contain four Francis pump-turbines which are rated at 260 MW each for power generation and 275 MW for pumping. The upper reservoir will lie at maximum elevation of and the lower at . This difference in elevation will afford the power plant a rated hydraulic head of .

The game is published by E-Line Media and supported by a partnership between E-Line Media and the Institute of Play. Project history Initial development of Gamestar was supported by a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation based on a grant proposal authored by James Paul Gee and Eric Zimmerman. Initial design and development of the game was by Gamelab in partnership with Katie Salen, The Institute of Play and the Academic Advanced Distributed Learning Co-Lab (AADLC) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The game was released commercially in the Fall of 2010 and is currently supported by a partnership between educational game publisher E-Line Media and the Institute of Play. On September 29, 2020, it was announced that the current website will be shut down on December 31, 2020, due to the planned deprecation of Adobe Flash. Audience and game play The game is optimized for youth ages 8–14. Players learn the principles of game design by playing a narrative-based Quest where they play, repair and build games using the in-game design tools. As they advance in the Quest, players also earn \\"sprites\\" (characters, avatars, enemies, etc...) for use in their own games. At any time, players can switch to their Workshops and make an original game using the assets they have earned. Players can publish their games to an online community within the platform called Game Alley where other users can play and leave feedback on their games. Playing on the website is free of charge, but there are premium options available for both consumer and educational use. An online learning program is also offered in which students can take an online course in game design with an instructor and receive video feedback on their designs from professionals in the game industries. Sprites Sprites are all of the things that players can unlock and use in their games. Most sprites can be earned from the quests \\"Addison Joins the League\\", \\"Addison Joins the Rogue\\", and \\"Dungeon of the Rogue\\". The other sprites that can be earned are from the challenges. The \\"Pink Block Caper\\", and the \\"Background Challenge\\" are some. Some challenges are seasonal, but once the player wins the challenge and earns the sprites from them, they can keep them forever. The \\"Wild West\\" challenge is an example. The final way to get some is from the sprite packs that players can buy in the store. The \\"Freezer pack\\" and the \\"Autumn pack\\" are examples. If the player has completed all of these tasks, they now have almost all of the sprites that are available for players. Most sprites are either avatars, enemies, blocks, items, or systems, but some of which are in forms of backgrounds and music. As well as a way to earn sprites that are unobtainable through challenges or the quests, as notified by Gamestar Mechanic User \\"24paidihm.\\" the \\"Healthy\\" and \\"Das Rheingold\\" sprites can be obtained by following the instructions on his game known as \\"Factory 7 Sprite Museum.\\" Sprite packs:https://gamestarmechanic.com/store * Underwater Pack * Freeze Pack * Autumn Pack * Bugging Out Pack * Mystical Pack * Gateway Pack * Winter Holiday Pack * Tank Trials Pack Usage As of March 2014, the game has been used to create over 500,000 games that have been played over 15 million times. Over 6,000 schools and community organizations have adopted the platform. As of October 15, 2020, there are over 2,023,545 games on the platform, and at least 1,695,751 users.

He studied filmmaking at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Biography =Early life= Fried was born in Omaha, Nebraska where he graduated from Westside High School. =Film career= Shortly after graduating from the USC School of Cinematic Arts, Fried's first screenplay, a fairy tale mash-up entitled The Ever After Murders was featured on Franklin Leonard's compendium of 2010's best unproduced screenplays, the Black List. In late 2011, Fried's second screenplay Gaslight was also featured on the Black List. During the same month, Fried was featured on The Tracking Board's \\"best unproduced screenplay\\" roster, The Hit List. Shortly thereafter, Fried sold his first feature film pitch Spectral which was picked up by Legendary Pictures where it is currently in development for a tentative 2015 release. In February 2014, actor James Badge Dale was cast in the lead. Following the surprise success of its horror movie The Woman in Black (2012 film), Exclusive Media’s genre arm Hammer Films purchased Fried's Gothic Horror Thriller, Gaslight. In Gaslight, Jack the Ripper, secretly imprisoned in a London insane asylum, is called upon to help Scotland Yard solve a series of murders that share the iconic death brand: dual puncture wounds to the neck. In late 2013, Fried teamed with producer John Davis (producer) and Davis Entertainment (Chronicle (film)) to sell his top-secret science fiction pitch Prism to Paramount Pictures. During the summer of 2014, Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures announced that commercials director Nic Mathieu would make his feature debut directing Fried's screenplay for the supernatural action movie Spectral which will star James Badge Dale, Max Martini, Bruce Greenwood and Emily Mortimer. Described as a supernatural Black Hawk Down, Spectral centers on a Special Ops team dispatched to fight supernatural beings who have taken over a European city. In the fall of 2014, Fried partnered with Roy Lee (producer)’s Vertigo Entertainment to set up the feature film project Pentacle at Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation. The story is described as a dark, Amblin-style thriller set in the world of magic.

On August 24, 2011 he was arrested on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud, and on February 2, 2012 he pleaded guilty. False claims Youlus claimed he had personally traveled to Eastern Europe and beyond to recover Torah scrolls lost or hidden during the Holocaust, including some from the sites of concentration camps at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. He said that during his travels he had been beaten and imprisoned, and called himself the \\"Jewish Indiana Jones\\" during a Torah dedication in 2004. In court he admitted that from 2004 to 2010 he had made up the stories of his travels; he had never been to the places he had claimed. The Torahs he sold did not have the claimed provenance. Save a Torah foundation Youlus created the non-profit foundation \\"Save a Torah\\", purportedly to finance his travels and the restoration of the rescued Torah scrolls, dedicated to rescuing and restoring Torah scrolls hidden, lost or stolen during the Holocaust and other world upheavals and placing them in Jewish congregations.\\"A Mission To Salvage Holy Message: Wheaton Rabbi Scours World for Torahs Buried, Hidden During Holocaust\\", Katherine Shaver, Washington Post, September 24, 2004; Page B01 Instead he sold Torah scrolls he had obtained by other means, partly at inflated prices. According to prosecutors, he defrauded the charity and its donors of $862,000. Congregations that have acquired Torah Scrolls from Save a Torah include New York's Central Synagogue and Congregation Kol Ami of Frederick. In January 2010, the Washington Post reported that many Torahs purportedly rescued from Holocaust sites in Eastern Europe appeared to be old Torah scrolls mostly acquired when American congregations closed, and resold at high prices because of Youlus's unsubstantiated assertion that they were rescued from Holocaust-related sites.\\"Rabbi to the Rescue: Menachem Youlus is called the Indiana Jones of Torah recovery and restoration. But there are doubts about his thrilling tales\\", Martha Wexler and Jeff Lunden, Washington Post, Sunday, January 31, 2010; W12 Similar questions were reported in an April 14, 2010 New York Times article concerning a Torah at New York's Central Synagogue.James Barron, \\"Two Torahs, Two Holocaust Stories and One Big Question\\", New York Times, April 14, 2010. On August 24, 2011, Youlus was arrested and charged with fraud. According to prosecutors, he made up the stories about the Torahs' origins. Youlus was also accused of taking more than $340,000 of the $1.2 million raised by Save a Torah, including $145,000 or more for his personal use. Through an attorney, Youlus initially denied the allegations.James Barron, \\"Rabbi Fabricated Swashbuckling Tales of Saving Holocaust Torahs, Prosecutors Say\\", The New York Times, August 24, 2011.Jeff Lunden, \\"'Jewish Indiana Jones' charged with fraud\\", The Washington Post, August 25, 2011. He later pleaded guilty to fraud, having used monies from the fraud to cover his personal expenses.Martha Wexler and Jeff Lunden, \\"Maryland Rabbi Pleads Guilty to Fraud in Torah Scheme\\", Washington Post, February 3, 2012. On December 17, 2012, Youlus began serving a 51-month prison sentence at the federal correctional institution in Otisville, New York. Convicted of two counts of mail and wire fraud in a Manhattan federal court on October 11, 2012, Youlus is slated to be incarcerated until August 26, 2016. Complaint Youlus was arrested in Manhattan on fraud charges on August 24, 2011, for claiming to have toured Europe in search of lost or hidden Torah scrolls – the holy Jewish texts containing Hebrew scripture. He distributed the scrolls among American synagogues and communities, sometimes at inflated rates, and diverted almost one third of $1.2 million into his accounts for personal use.The New York Times Rabbi Fabricated Swashbuckling Tales of Saving Holocaust Torahs, Prosecutors Say Youlus embezzled more than a million dollars from \\"Save a Torah\\". He got that money transferred to a Jewish bookstore, owned by him in Wheaton, Maryland, on a pretext of payment for restoring old and damaged scrolls. He was charged for writing $344,000 in checks to himself from the bookstore account, $200,000 in personal expenses, and for using $90,000 to pay private school tuition fee for his kith and kin. He was also charged for donors' $145,000 amount meant for saving a Torah; instead, been diverted to his personal bank account. =Investigation= David M. Rubenstein, one of the founders of Carlyle Group, who had bought a Torah and donated it to Central Synagogue, sought the authenticity of scrolls by hiring Michael Berenbaum, a Holocaust historian and former director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's Holocaust Research Institute. Berenbaum said \\"What I found is the claim for the origin of the Torah could not be verified.\\" Menachem Z. Rosensaft, an adjunct professor of law at Cornell University and general counsel of the World Jewish Congress, was skeptical about Youlus's claim of discovering an old Torah at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp as his parents were liberated from that camp and the camp was burned down by British Army during World War II. On complaint lodged by Menachem Z. Rosensaft, vice president of the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors and their Descendants, the state of Maryland began investigating \\"Save a Torah\\". Having looked into the matter, state officials found that Youlus' stories \\"may be misleading\\". And, Michael P. Schlein, investigator for the Office of the Secretary of State of Maryland said: \\"we could probably or reasonably assume they could not be wholly accurate.\\"The Jewish Chronicle Maryland pact gags Save A Torah under threat of penalty Investigations also revealed that he barely traveled abroad during the years he claimed to have traveled in quest of old texts. Confession Youlus offered this confession on Feb 2, 2012, to Manhattan Federal District Court judge Colleen McMahon: He also pleaded guilty to mail fraud and wire fraud, admitting that he had used the United States Postal Service and email to further a scheme to solicit donations and siphon money claiming for restoration and preservation of Torah scrolls. Plea deal As part of his plea agreement, he will repay his victims $1.2 million. Youlus was free on $100,000 bond until he was sentenced on October 10, 2012, by Judge Colleen McMahon to just over four years in prison.Benjamin Weiser, Torah Fraud Earns Rabbi Prison Term (Oct. 11, 2012).

Created in conjunction with the Mental Health Foundation, the project's overall aim is to \\"raise awareness of mental health and challenge perceptions of mental health problems by creating great art.\\" To date, the project has organised a number of live concerts, and released one studio album, First Edition (2011), featuring contributions from a number of notable Scottish musicians including members of Frightened Rabbit, The Twilight Sad, Sparrow and the Workshop and Take a Worm for a Walk Week, alongside Karine Polwart, Alasdair Roberts and James Yorkston. History =Beginnings (2008–2009)= In both 2008 and 2009, Idlewild guitarist Rod Jones and former Delgados vocalist Emma Pollock curated concerts for Scottish Mental Health Arts & Film Festival, entitled, 'Music Like a Vitamin'. The concerts featured notable Scottish indie acts; Frightened Rabbit, The Twilight Sad, Sons and Daughters and Attic Lights, alongside folk musicians; Karine Polwart, James Yorkston and Alasdair Roberts. Regarding the shows, Pollock noted, \\"They were great gigs, with huge attendance as we always kept the ticket prices so low.\\" =First Edition and mentoring scheme (2010–2011)= Prior to 2009's 'Music Like a Vitamin', Jones suggested that a full-length album featuring contributions from performers could be a possibility, noting, \\"The main idea is to have a more songwriter based project which will culminate in a record and then concerts as part of the festival. Something to keep people involved and talking about these things inbetween festivals. [...] There is a set idea now, and a plan, but I'm just awaiting the right funding. I think the main thing is to keep momentum so that we're not backtracking every year when we start a new festival.\\" In 2010, the project became known as The Fruit Tree Foundation, with a post on the project's website stating: \\"Since 2008 the music events of the Scottish Mental Health Arts & Film Festival, programmed under the banner 'Music Like A Vitamin', have been growing in size and popularity. To build on this success and raise further awareness of the work of the Mental Health Foundation, we decided during early 2010 to go one step further and as well as organise the shows, create some new music to play at those shows too. It seemed natural that creating new music should be our way of getting further involved and getting people thinking and talking even more.\\" The project is supported by Breathing Space Scotland. Musicians gathered in a house in Perthshire, for five days to write material which would become First Edition. Pollock noted, \\"We started putting our ideas together mid-2009, ready to go into the house in early 2010.\\" To coincide with the album's release, there were two \\"launch gigs,\\" with Jones noting, \\"I think the nerves and tension combined with the camaraderie that had been built through the process of writing and recording made for really special couple of evenings.\\" First Edition was subsequently released on Chemikal Underground records.

In a career that lasted from April 1791 to July 1795 he ran twenty-two times and won ten races. In 1791 he proved himself one of the best British colts of his generation, by winning The Derby and four other races. Eager won a further four races in 1792, but the level of his form declined thereafter and he won only one race in his last three seasons. Towards the end of his racing career he was gelded. Background Eager was a brown colt bred by his owner the 5th Duke of Bedford. His sire, Florizel won several important races at Newmarket between 1772 and 1774 and went on to become a successful stallion, siring the 1780 Derby winner Diomed (later an important sire in the United States) and two winners of the St Leger. He was the sixth of sixteen foals produced by his dam an unnamed mare by Matchem who had previously produced Fidget, a successful racehorse and sire. The Duke sent the colt into training with his private trainer Matthew Stephenson who also rode him in some of his races, including the Derby. Racing career =1791: three-year-old season= The 5th Duke of Bedford, owner and breeder of the \\"brother to Fidget\\". Until 1913 there was no requirement for British racehorses to be named, and in the late eighteenth century it was common for horses to be known by their owner, colour, sex and pedigree rather than by an official name. The horse who would later become known as Eager raced unnamed as a three-year-old in 1791, being usually referred to as the \\"brother to Fidget.\\" Later publications refer to the horse as \\"Eager\\" when describing the events of the 1791 Derby. On 25 April \\"D.of Bedford's brother to Fidget, by Florizel\\" made his first appearance in a Sweepstakes over ten furlongs (\\"Across the Flat\\") at Newmarket. He started the 1/4 favourite and won from his only opponent, a filly named Wagtail. At Epsom on 9 June \\"D.of Bedford's br c by Florizel out of Fidget's dam\\" started the 5/2 second favourite for the Derby in a field of nine runners. Ridden by his trainer Matthew Stephenson, he won from Lord Foley's colt Vermin, the 5/4 favourite, with Proteus third and the Prince of Wales's colt St David in fourth. A month after his Derby win, the brother to Fidget raced at Stockbridge where he had two engagements. On 7 July he was allowed to walk over in a one-mile Sweepstakes when the other six horses entered were withdrawn by their owners. On the following day he started 1/3 favourite for a ten furlong Sweepstakes and won from his only opponent, Hector. After a three- month break, the still unnamed colt reappeared for the autumn meetings at Newmarket. On 4 October his unbeaten run ended when he was defeated at level weights by Vermin in the 1400 Guineas Stakes, a subscription race over the two mile \\"Ditch In\\" course. A month later, the brother to Fidget met Vermin for a third time in a match race over the Ditch In course. Carrying six pounds less than his opponent, he upset the 4/1 odds to win a prize of 300 guineas. =1792: four-year-old season= Fidget's brother was named Eager for the 1792 season and began his season with five engagements at the Newmarket spring meetings. The modifier \\"brother to Fidget\\" was still printed in racing literature in conjunction with his new name for a few years after he was officially named. Eager made his first appearance on 11 April in the Oatlands Stakes, a two-mile handicap which carried a first prize of more than £5,000, making it far more valuable than any of the Classics. He finished fifth of the twenty runners behind Toby, with the 1790 Derby winner Rhadamanthus and Vermin among the horses further back in the field. At the next meeting the Duke of Bedford claimed over £1,000 in prize money when Eager was allowed to walk over for a valuable Sweepstakes over the four mile Beacon Course. Four days later he ran in the two mile Fortescue Stakes in which he started 2/5 favourite and won from Vermin (beating Lord Foley's colt for the fourth time in five races) and a filly named Peggy. Eager won another prize for his owner without having to race when Mr Fox paid a forfeit when he withdrew his horse Mercutio from a scheduled match race on 7 May. On the following day Eager defeated the odds-on favourite Halbert to win the Jockey Club Plate over the Round Course, with Vermin third. In summer Eager was sent to Stockbridge for a two-mile Sweepstakes on 27 June. When none of his five opponents appeared to contest the race he was allowed another walk over. A week later, Eager's winning run ended when he was beaten by Sir John Lade's horse Don Quixote in a four-mile Sweepstakes at Winchester. A scheduled match against Vermin at Newmarket on 1 October did not materialise, as Lord Foley elected to withdraw his horse and pay a forfeit. Two days later Eager was beaten by Lord Grosvenor's six-year- old Skylark in a subscription race over the Beacon Course. On his final start of the year on 20 October Eager lost a 200 guinea match race when he failed to concede twelve pounds to Lord Clermont's filly Volantè. =1793: five-year-old season= Eager's five-year-old season was restricted to four races at Newmarket in the spring. On 2 April he failed to concede three pounds to Mr Chichester's horse Mendoza in a 500 guinea match over the Beacon Course. Two weeks later over the Round Course, Eager recorded his only win of the year in a Subscription race. He started at odds of 1/6 and defeated his only opponent, the Duke of Queensberry's Fergus. On 30 April Eager ran twice over the three mile Dutton's Course. He finished second to Mr O'Kelly's gelding Excitement when carrying top weight of 125 pounds in a Sweepstakes, and then finished last of the four runners in a subscription race behind Coriander later that afternoon. =1794: six-year-old season= Eager reappeared as a six-year-old in a £50 subscription race over Dutton's Course on 9 May and finished third of the five runners behind Gabriel and Spider. This proved to be his last race for the Duke of Bedford: before his next race he entered into the ownership of Mr Morant. On 3 September Eager appeared in a race at Egham. The race was run in a series of four mile heats, with the prize going to the first horse to win twice. Eager finished second in the first heat and fourth in the second before being withdrawn from the contest. =1795: seven-year-old season= Eager's final season comprised two races in heats run in summer. On 12 July at Ascot he appeared in the colours of Mr Wood and finished third and fourth in the first two heats before being withdrawn. On 30 July he ran in a race at Blandford when he ran in the ownership of Mr Stag. He finished second in both heats to Mr Hyde's Highflyer horse. In this race he was recorded as being a gelding.

He was born in Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland on 25 June 1859. Johnstone's father, David, was a Congregational minister. In 1868 he, his wife Jessie, and their four children moved to Dunedin, New Zealand. After attending high school, James Johnstone joined the stock and station agency Wright Stephenson and worked his way uip through the business from office boy to stock agent, and by 1885 his business skills saw him made a partner in the business. In 1899 he became senior partner and became chairman of directors when the company was publicly listed in 1906. Johnstone married Margaret Donald in 1894, and together they had three daughters. They made their home at Maori Hill and owned farm property at Bushey Park near Palmerston. The family took frequent international trips, mainly for business reasons. During one of these trips Johnstone became aware of a demand in Argentina for Corriedale sheep, a breed which had been developed in New Zealand. As a result, in 1920 he purchased a large flock of the sheep and turned Bushey Park into a stud- stock breeding centre. He expanded the farm to include imported shorthorn cattle and a Clydesdale stud. Both Johnstones had leadership roles in various agricultural and social organisations. James was the first president of the Clydesdale Horse Society of New Zealand and was also involved in the Royal Agricultural Society of New Zealand, the New Zealand Refrigerating Company and the Commercial Union Assurance Company. He also served as Dunedin's Argentine vice-consul. Margaret became president of the Plunket Society. Johnstone suffered a bad fall from his horse in the early 1930s, which led to a decline in his health. He died at home on 8 May 1933. Margaret was to die later the same year.

Mejía González was often accredited as the \\"second-in-command\\" in the Gulf organization. He is responsible for controlling the flow of cocaine from Central America and South America to the drug corridors between Nuevo Laredo and Reynosa, Tamaulipas. In March 2008, Mejía González was indicted in Washington, D.C. and placed as one of the most-wanted fugitives by the U.S. government. Mejía González is allegedly responsible for ordering the assassination of Samuel Flores Borrego, a drug lord of the Metros faction in the Gulf cartel, on 2 September 2011. Flores Borrego's assassination triggered a series of confrontations between the two factions in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. The Metros faction emerged victorious in early 2012, and Mejía González has fallen off the radar and has not been heard of since then. Kingpin Act sanction On 24 March 2010, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Mejía González under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with fifty-three other international criminals and ten foreign entities. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. Gulf cartel infighting =Background= In the late 1990s, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, the former leader of the Gulf cartel, had other similar groups besides Los Zetas established in several cities in Tamaulipas. Each of these groups were identified by their radio codes: the Rojos were based in Reynosa; the Metros were headquartered in Matamoros; and the Lobos were established in Laredo. The infighting between the Metros and the Rojos of the Gulf cartel began in 2010, when Mejía González was overlooked as the candidate of the regional boss of Reynosa and was sent to La Frontera Chica, an area that encompasses Miguel Alemán, Camargo and Ciudad Mier, Tamaulipas – directly across the U.S.–Mexico border from Starr County, Texas. The area that Mejía González wanted was given to Flores Borrego, suggesting that the Metros were above the Rojos. Unconfirmed information released by The Monitor indicated that two leaders of the Rojos, Mejía González and Rafael Cárdenas Vela, teamed up to kill Flores Borrego. Cárdenas Vela had held a grudge on Flores Borrego and the Metros because he believed that they had led the Mexican military to track down and kill his uncle Antonio Cárdenas Guillén (Tony Tormenta) on 5 November 2010. Other sources indicate that the infighting could have been caused by the suspicions that the Rojos were \\"too soft\\" on the Gulf cartel's bitter enemy, Los Zetas. When the Gulf cartel and Los Zetas split in early 2010, some members of the Rojos stayed with the Gulf cartel, while others decided to leave and join the forces of Los Zetas. InSight Crime explains that the fundamental disagreement between the Rojos and the Metros was over leadership. Those who were more loyal to the Cárdenas family stayed with the Rojos, while those loyal to Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, like Flores Borrego, defended the Metros. Originally, the Gulf cartel was running smoothly, but the infighting between the two factions in the Gulf cartel triggered when Flores Borrego was killed on 2 September 2011. When the Rojos turned on the Metros, the largest faction in the Gulf cartel, firefights broke throughout Tamaulipas and drug loads were stolen among each other, but the Metros managed to retain control of the major cities that stretched from Matamoros to Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas. Supposed death references Los Zetas put up a banner in the state of Zacatecas on 20 September 2012 alleging that Mejía González was dead and speaking out against the alliance between the Gulf Cartel and the Knights Templar Cartel. Family On 20 May 2011, Romeo Eduardo Mejía González, Mejía González's brother, was arrested in Reynosa along with two other cartel members. Indictments Mejía González was charged in a Federal indictment in 2008 with money laundering and drug trafficking conspiracies, and the U.S. Department of State is currently offering up to $5 million US dollars for information leading to his arrest.

He was born in Manchester, Lancashire, England, on 16 March 1827. After a career in journalism and printing in Castleford, Yorkshire, Johnson emigrated to New Zealand in the company of William Rawson Brame's Albertland settlers. The Albertlanders intended to set up a model community in New Zealand; Johnson had been appointed the group's editor and printer. He left the group in 1862, working in Auckland and Dunedin before returning to Albertown in 1863. The settlement collapsed in 1864, and by 1866 Johnson was living in Blenheim, where he and his brother Thomas established the Marlborough Express. Originally a weekly paper, the Expresss circulation eventually increased to twice weekly. Now owned by Stuff Ltd., it prints daily. Johnson was elected to the Marlborough Provincial Council in 1872; he resigned in 1874. He sold his newspaper in 1879 before returning briefly to England.

Summary Martin J. Levitt wrote an \\"autobiography\\" about his journey for forgiveness at every union hall for his past as a union buster.

The plantation was established by Samuel Pickens, the younger brother of Alabama's third governor, Israel Pickens. The house was an unusual example of a raised basement plantation house built on a U-shaped plan. It was recorded by the Historic American Buildings Survey during the 1930s. It was destroyed in a fire in the early 1970s. History Samuel Pickens was the son of Samuel W. Pickens of Virginia and Jane Carrigan of North Carolina. He was born in Cabarrus County, North Carolina in 1791. He and brothers Robert, Israel, John, Robert, and William had all relocated to the western Black Belt of Alabama by the 1820s. Most of them established plantations near Umbria in Greene County (now part of Hale). Pickens married Mary Everard Meade on September 11, 1830 in Greene County. Construction of the main house at Umbria began around this time. Mary died in 1831, while construction was still underway. Pickens then married to Selina Louisa Lenoir, also a native of Cabarrus County, North Carolina, in 1832. That had one son, Thomas Lenoir Pickens, in 1833. The house was completed by about this time. The rear gallery and courtyard. Selina too died in 1839, leaving Pickens twice a widower. He remarried yet again, this time to Mary Gaillard Thomas of Charleston, South Carolina in 1840. They had several children, including James, Samuel, William, John, Mary, Louisa, and Israel. Pickens acquired additional plantations and the family's wealth grew. Two large wings, each almost as large as the original front portion of the house, were added to each side of the house by roughly 1850. Samuel Pickens died on June 23, 1855, leaving his widow an estate that was valued at nearly half a million dollars in 1860 and over 200 slaves. His sons took over the daily operations of the plantations until called to serve in the Civil War. The house stayed in the Pickens family for several additional generations and was extensively renovated in the mid-twentieth century after being sold out of the family. It was destroyed by fire on December 30, 1971. Today the only reminders of what was once at site is a fence and crumbling brick foundations. Architecture This floor plan of the principal floor, shows the U-shaped layout and central rear courtyard. The main house at Umbria began as a raised Carolina-type cottage during the 1830s, with a principal floor over a full, ground-level brick basement. The basement level was fronted by a full-width, sunken loggia with a brick floor. The basement level contained a central hall entered through a central hall. Two rooms, each with its own fireplace, were located on each side of the hall. The principal floor was fronted with a full-width porch supported by six Ionic columns set directly under the main roof. This floor contained four rooms, with the central doorway accessing a large parlor from the front porch. The double-leaf central doors featured a finely detailed fanlight and sidelights. An additional entry point from the porch was located to either side of the main doorway in the form of jib window. By the early 1850s the house had been greatly expanded to include two long rear wings attached to the rear corners of the original house. These matched the house in style and scale, however, they were built on piers rather than an enclosed basement. They each contained two large bedrooms with fireplaces. A gallery on three sides with twelve Doric columns wrapped the house around the rear courtyard. Additional structures on the grounds that were still present during the Historic American Buildings Survey in the mid-1930s included a barn, plantation office, a plantation schoolhouse, and three other plantation outbuildings. The schoolhouse survived the fire and was donated to the former Gulf States Paper Company in Tuscaloosa for relocation and preservation after the fire. It has now been donated to the Tuscaloosa County Preservation Society.

Biography Barnet was born in Brooklyn, New York and attended Erasmus Hall High School. His father was a leather tanner. Barnet served in the U.S. Army at the tail end of World War II. He earned his bachelor's degree at New York University in 1948, and then his M.A. in 1950 and Ph.D in 1954 at Harvard University. In 1951, Barnet met William C. Burto. The two became life partners in 1952. Barnet spent his entire career at Tufts University, where he taught English literature from 1954 to 1984 and served for several terms as chair of the English department. He was the first Jewish member of the department. Barnet authored numerous books and articles on William Shakespeare, including A Short Guide to Shakespeare. In the early 1960s, Barnet successfully proposed to the New American Library the creation a new series of Shakespeare's plays, one that would be aimed at college students. Each low-cost volume in the Signet Classics Shakespeare series focused on a single play. Every book included a general essay by Barnet about Shakespeare's life and times, an introductory essay about the specific play by an eminent scholar, and excerpts of some of Shakespeare's sources and inspirations. Barnet was the co-author (with Burto) of essays on aspects of Japanese art. Their writings on art drew inspiration from the couple's impressive personal collection, which was donated to four different museums after their deaths. Barnet also wrote several textbooks about art, writing, and literature. In total, Barnet wrote, co-wrote, or edited over forty books during his lifetime.

Findlay studied fine arts at Edinburgh College of Art. She moved to England at the end of her first year in 1972 to study at the Architectural Association. While Findlay was studying at the Architectural Association, she was tutored by Peter Cook, Christine Hawley, and Leon Van Schaik. Findlay graduated with an Architectural Association Diploma in 1979. In 1979 Findlay went to Tokyo. While there, Findlay worked in Arata Isozaki's office where she met her future husband, Eisaku Ushida. Findlay formed the architectural practice, Ushida Findlay, in Tokyo in 1986 with her then husband, Eisaku Ushida. While in Japan, Findlay spent twenty years teaching and working in Japan. She was appointed as the first female academic in the Department of Architecture at the Tokyo University and the first foreigner to teach there since the 19th century Meiji Period. Ushida Findlay built the Truss Wall House (1993) and Soft and Hairy House (1994) with their practice gaining recognition. Findlay eventually returned to London and took her practice with her after having split form her husband. Findlay worked on notable projects such as the RIBA Nominated Grafton New Hall (2002) and Pool House 2 (2009). Findlay's practice went into bankruptcy in 2004. Findlay eventually became employed by the School of Architecture at the University of Dundee to eventually become professor of Architecture and Environment in 2006. In 2012 Findlay worked as a delivery architect for Anish Kapoor's monumental ArcelorMittal Orbit for the London Olympics. Findlay was also made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland on the 11th of September in 2013.

Alex Mustakas is the founding and current Artistic Director. Since its foundation in 1991 Drayton Entertainment has grown from a grassroots theatre, into one of the most successful and admired theatre companies in the country, attracting top talent from across North America. Over 25 years of performances have included musicals, comedies, and dramas.  Theatres  = Drayton Festival Theatre (Drayton, Ontario) = Drayton Festival Theatre The tiny village of Drayton is 30 minutes north of Kitchener-Waterloo. Built in 1902, the former Town Hall has a rich history of entertaining audiences with such legendary performers as Beatrice Lillie. The building also housed the town offices and eventually became a complete municipal complex, which included town offices, council chambers, library, fire hall, automobile repair shop and jail. By the 1980s, the theatre was used infrequently, but was revived in 1983 by a group of area residents interested in amateur productions. The Drayton Community Players staged two shows each year until the theatre was closed for safety reasons in 1989. Determined to save their historic theatre from destruction, all 1,000 Drayton residents rallied together and raised $110,000 to retrofit the facility. In 1990, the theatre reopened for public use and The Drayton Festival Theatre Inc. was formed with a mission to \\"promote, produce, and present professional theatre of the highest artistic standards, and to function as facilitator for other cultural and educational activities.\\" Alex Mustakas was hired as the Artistic Director – a position he has held ever since. Mustakas enlisted the help of widely respected Canadian director/choreographer Alan Lund to produce the first show of the 1991 season. Vaudeville! brought the Drayton Festival Theatre to life on Canada Day, July 1, 1991. The first season consisted of three productions over nine weeks and attracted 14,592 visitors to the village. A tiny budget necessitated plenty of creativity as well as volunteer and community involvement – from front of house managers and ushers, to laundry and technical support. A great deal of attention was generated when The Drayton Festival Theatre made Canadian theatrical history by completely selling out both its 1993 and 1994 seasons. All 36,000 available seats for the 1994 season were sold one month prior to the beginning of rehearsals. As the popularity of The Drayton Festival Theatre grew, so did each season and by 1996, the season expanded to 21 weeks with an overall attendance record of 62,660. = St. Jacobs Schoolhouse Theatre (St. Jacobs) = St. Jacobs Schoolhouse Theatre Eager to see if the winning Drayton formula could be replicated in another community, the company launched a second stage in the village of St. Jacobs, in the heart of Mennonite Country in 1997. The Schoolhouse Theatre in St. Jacobs is a renovated schoolhouse that was originally built in 1867. In the fall of 2019, the Mersynergy Charitable Foundation donated the building to Drayton Entertainment. The inaugural production was the musical Forever Plaid, which sold all of its 25,000 available seats. Sold-out performances continued in 1998 with the whodunit Shear Madness – in fact, seats had to be added for most performances to meet demand for tickets, resulting in an overall attendance record of 110 percent. For the 2000 season, Drayton brought the musical A Closer Walk With Patsy Cline to the St. Jacobs stage. All previous attendance records were broken, as more than 31,000 theatregoers were entertained during the 7-month season. = King’s Wharf Theatre (Penetanguishene) = Kings Wharf Theatre In January 1999, newspaper headlines heralded the news that the Drayton Festival Theatre had been chosen by the Ontario Government to assume operation of the King's Wharf Theatre in Penetanguishene. Situated on the shore of Georgian Bay and flanked by tall ships and historic buildings, the King's Wharf Theatre is nestled within Discovery Harbour, an original nineteenth century British naval and military base. The King's Wharf Theatre inaugural production was the musical Me and My Girl. When the 11-week season closed on September 4, 1999, the King's Wharf Theatre had welcomed more than 20,000 visitors. This once again demonstrated that Drayton Entertainment's unique business model could flourish at other locations. = Huron Country Playhouse & Playhouse II (Grand Bend) = Huron Country Playhouse Mainstage At a press conference on May 25, 2000 the Drayton Festival Theatre and Huron Country Playhouse announced a merger between the two organizations, creating one new company – Drayton Entertainment. Huron Country Playhouse launched its 1972 inaugural season in a rented big-top tent while actors and staff lived and worked out of the century-old barn. Audiences are now entertained on two separate stages – the 660-seat Playhouse and 300-seat Playhouse II. Today, Huron Country Playhouse is one of the outstanding success stories in Canadian theatre proudly celebrating more than four decades of entertainment. Beyond its obvious cultural and artistic benefits, are the equally important local economic benefits, which generate millions in revenues for the region and the Grand Bend community. During the summer months from June to September, the Playhouse is one of the area's largest employers, creating over 120 jobs. = St. Jacobs Country Playhouse (Waterloo) = St. Jacobs Country Playhouse In October 2004, Drayton Entertainment officially announced it would be expanding its operations in Waterloo with a new state-of-the-art performance facility that would be housed in the vacant St. Jacobs Winery & Cidery. With its turn-of- the-century style masonry and heavy timber accents, the building was an ideal setting for the new 400-seat St. Jacobs Country Playhouse. The success of the Schoolhouse Theatre in St. Jacobs and support of the new St. Jacobs venue, coupled with the obvious business increases for local retail and hospitality operations, led to the discussion of creating a larger custom-designed theatre on the border of St. Jacobs and the city of Waterloo. The benefits of expansion in this market were numerous, including additional work for artists and administrative staff, potential for new marketing initiatives and national sponsorships. The St. Jacobs Country Playhouse offers a variety of performances year-round, as well as providing performance space as a resource to the community. The theatre opened in the fall of 2005 with Disney's Beauty and the Beast – completing selling out all 25,000 tickets available for the 8-week run. = Hamilton Family Theatre Cambridge (Cambridge) = Hamilton Family Theatre Cambridge In 2009, Cambridge City Council passed a resolution for the development and construction of a 500-seat performing arts venue in the heart of Old Galt, to be operated by Drayton Entertainment. This complex also houses Drayton Entertainment's centralized administration and production facilities. The Dunfield Theatre Cambridge opened in the spring of 2013 with Mary Poppins. Funding partners include the Government of Canada, Government of Ontario, the Corporation of the City of Cambridge, and Drayton Entertainment. Cambridge taxpayers paid $6 million, both the federal and city of Cambridge governments paid the same, Drayton Entertainment gave $4.5 million to the project and continually cover daily costs. In July 2017, Cambridge city council approved a name change for the theatre that took effect in January 2018. Shiplake Properties assumed the original naming rights for the theatre in 2013, as a brand extension of the Dunfield Retirement Residence, a $30 million modern senior retirement living complex located in the Saginaw Parkway and Light Drive neighbourhood. The Toronto-based company sold the building to Revera in the summer of 2017, and it was subsequently renamed Granite Landing. The naming rights for the Cambridge theatre did not transfer with the new ownership. The Hamilton Family initially contributed $500,000 in 2013 during the theatre's inaugural season, in exchange for naming the auditorium. In 2017, John and Terry Hamilton pledged another $500,000 to assume the exclusive 20-year venue naming rights, valued at $1 million. The theatre has been named the Hamilton Family Theatre Cambridge since January 2018.  Youth Musical Theatre Program  The Drayton Entertainment Youth Musical Theatre Program is an auditioned training program designed to cultivate community, encourage leadership, ignite imagination, and boost confidence, while providing aspiring young performers with the opportunity to learn from professional theatre artists and develop a deeper appreciation for live performance. Students train with passionate industry professionals in singing, dancing, acting, audition technique and technical theatre. The Youth Musical Theatre Program is overseen by Associate Artistic Director David Connolly.  Awards  Drayton Entertainment has received 6 Lieutenant Governor's Awards for the Arts – a prestigious honour given to arts organizations that exemplify outstanding private sector and community support.

It caters to career-minded musicians, songwriters, recording artists and assorted music-industry support personnel. The magazine began by focusing on the Southern California music scene, but now has a national focus and national distribution. The publication and its website offer inside information about the music business, including specialized directories of contact information about music professionals and Free Classifieds for musicians. Music Connection also publishes reviews of unsigned and independent live performers and recording artists.http://www.lamusicconnect.com/classifieds/show-ad/967/Artists--Bands- Who-Are-Serious/General A number of acclaimed artists achieved their first music-magazine-cover status from Music Connection. Those artists and groups include Guns N' Roses, Madonna, Jane's Addiction, Alanis Morissette, White Stripes and Adele. Beginnings Music Connection magazine was founded in 1977 in Los Angeles, Ca. by J. Michael Dolan, an unsigned singer-songwriter who worked as a background engineer/projectionist at various film and TV studios. Looking for songwriting gigs but finding no useful resource to help him, Dolan came up with the idea of a weekly music publication, with articles and reviews rivaling Cashbox and Billboard, and free classifieds patterned after the Recycler. After quickly realizing that his idea had a real chance of success he invited long-time pal Eric Bettelli to join the company as its first VP of Advertising. Eventually the publication became a “must read” for industry executives, and a trusted advocate for musicians and songwriters, who promptly dubbed it “the musician’s bible.” Shortly thereafter, Michael got the idea for Songwriter Connection magazine, which became part of the MC family of invaluable products and services. In 2010, after celebrating 33 years as CEO, Michael sold his shares of Music Connection Inc. to his longtime friend and partner, Eric Bettelli (who is now the sole Publisher, with Senior Editor Mark Nardone promoted to Associate Publisher/Senior Editor). Online Music Connection has maintained an online presence since 1997. The main site at www.musicconnection.com features a digital edition of the entire print magazine. The digital edition has an archive that currently dates back to January 2008. The company launched another site, called AMP Network, in 2007. Annual Top Artist lists At the end of each year, Music Connection magazine publishes a Hot 100 Live Unsigned Artists and Bands list of live performers, as well as a Top 25 New Music Critiques list of unsigned recording artists. Artists who've appeared on the Hot 100 list include: 2003 Hot 100 Holy Ghost, 2003 and 2004 Hot 100 Sara Bareilles and 2008 Hot 100 Steel Panther.http://www.neon- entertainment.com/media/promo/reviews/mann/mchot1002004.pdf National Directories In the course of each year, Music Connection publishes a series of annually updated directories containing music industry contact information.

The pagoda is located about 2 km southwest of the centre of Dunhuang city. It was repaired in the Daoguang era (1821-1851) and again in 1992. It is 12 metres (39 feet) high and 7 metres (23 feet) in diameter and consists of 9 levels in total. The exterior is built of adobe bricks and is filled with grass and mud mixed with lime.

They develop a large \\"beak\\" like other parrotfish that is used for scraping algae and small organisms from rocks. They have pharyngeal teeth that grind ingested rocks into sand. No other species has this uniform blue color as adults. They weigh about . Reproduction In summer, blue parrotfish gather in spawning groups. Sexual interaction occurs and the females deposit their eggs into the water column after which they sink to the seabed. The eggs hatch after about twenty-five hours. Distribution and habitat Blue parrotfish are found on coral reefs at depths of in the western Atlantic from Maryland in the United States to Bermuda, the Bahamas, and south to Brazil. They are also found throughout the West Indies but are absent from the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico. Juveniles are found in beds of turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum). Diet Their diet consists of small organisms found in the algae that they scrape off rocks. They are described as professional sand-suckers, due to their foraging of food amongst the sandy areas that surround the reef. They spend 80 percent of their time searching for food. Status The blue parrotfish has a wide range and is abundant in much of that range, some of which is in marine conservation areas. Although larger individuals are targeted by fishermen, the population of this fish seems to be stable overall. For these reasons, the IUCN has listed this fish as being of \\"Least Concern\\".

Vigilante activities continued, although somewhat sporadically, through the Montana Territorial period until the territory became the state of Montana on November 8, 1889. Vigilantism arose because territorial law enforcement and the courts had very little power in the remote mining camps during the territorial period. In 1863–1864, Montana Vigilantes followed the model of the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance that existed in 1850s California to bring order to lawless communities in and around the gold fields of Alder Gulch and Grasshopper Creek. There are estimates that over 100 persons were killed in \\"road agent\\" robberies in the fall of 1863. The Vigilance Committee of Alder Gulch organized in December 1863, and in the first six weeks of 1864 at least 20 road agents of the infamous Plummer gang, known as the \\"Innocents\\", were captured and hanged by the organization. Formal territorial law reached Alder Gulch in late 1864 with the arrival of Territorial Judge Hezekiah L. Hosmer and vigilante activity ceased in the region. As the gold fields of Alder Gulch and Grasshopper Creek declined in 1865, prospectors and fortune seekers migrated to newly discovered areas in and around Last Chance Gulch (now Helena, Montana). As lawlessness increased, vigilante justice continued there with the formation of the Committee of Safety in 1865. During the period 1865–1870, at least 14 alleged criminals were executed by Helena's vigilantes. In 1884, ranchers in Central and Eastern Montana resorted to vigilante justice to deal with cattle rustlers and horse thieves. The best-known vigilante group in that area were \\"Stuart's Stranglers\\", organized by Granville Stuart in the Musselshell region. As formal law enforcement became more prevalent in the region, vigilantism fell into decline. Vigilantism in pre-territorial and territorial Montana has been written about, romanticized and chronicled in personal memoirs, biographies, documentary and scholarly works, film and fiction for well over a century. The first book published in Montana was Thomas J. Dimsdale's 1866 first edition of The Vigilantes of Montana, which was compiled from a series of newspaper articles he wrote for the Montana Post in 1865. Historical analysis of the period ranges from disrepute to heroism, with debates over whether the lack of any functioning justice system and the understanding of due process at the time meant the vigilantes acted in a way they thought was best for their communities or if modern standards of due process should govern analysis of their actions.  Bannack and Virginia City  Bannack, Montana (2005) On July 28, 1862, gold was discovered along Grasshopper Creek, a tributary of the Beaverhead River, in a remote part of eastern Idaho Territory, leading to the establishment of the town of Bannack. Bannack was a gold rush boomtown that was the first territorial capital of Montana Territory for a brief period after the territory was established in 1864. Less than a year after the Grasshopper Creek find, on May 26, 1863, gold was discovered along Alder Gulch, a tributary creek northeast of the Ruby River that lies between the Tobacco Root Mountains and the Gravelly Range and east of Bannack. The Alder Gulch find became one of the largest placer mining gold fields in the western U.S. The mining settlements of Virginia City and Nevada City, Montana, which sprang up in Alder Gulch, boasted thousands of prospectors and fortune seekers by the end of 1863. These new settlements generally lacked justice systems found in populated portions of the territory, such as in the territorial capital in Lewiston, Idaho. In 1863, gold was the preferred form of currency in western frontier communities and had a value, fixed and guaranteed by the U.S. Government, of $20.67 per ounce. Almost all economic transactions in western mining communities were accomplished with gold nuggets, flakes or dust as currency and not surprisingly, the more gold one had, the more wealth one possessed. During the early years of the territory, there was no secure way to transport wealth out of the region. The only means of transporting wealth out of the Alder Gulch gold fields was via horseback or slow moving wagons and stagecoaches on a limited number of trails and primitive roads leading south and west to Salt Lake City and San Francisco or east to Minnesota. Roads and trails leading to Alder Gulch included the Bozeman and Bridger Trails connecting to the Oregon Trail from the east, the Mullan Road from points west and from Fort Benton, Montana the head of navigation on the Missouri River and the Corinne Road from Corinne, Utah and points south. Additionally, there was a single track, stage road that connected Alder Gulch with Bannack. Several commercial freight and two passenger stage companies--Peabody and Caldwell's and A.J. Oliver's--operated on this route. Stagecoaches had to stop at several different ranches during the trip to water and change horses, feed passengers and provide overnight lodging. One of these ranches, the Rattlesnake Ranch, was owned by Bill Bunton and Frank Parish, who were later hanged by the vigilantes as road agents and members of the Plummer gang. = Road agents and the Plummer gang = 1907 Painting by John W. Norton of Henry Plummer's gang holding up and robbing a stagecoachfrom In a region where valuable gold was plentiful, transportation was insecure and effective law and order was lacking, travelers became easy prey for robbers. By late 1863, thefts and murders along the routes in and around Alder Gulch had become common. In their writings about the vigilantes, Thomas Dimsdale and Nathaniel P. Langford estimated that at least 102 travelers were killed by robbers in the fall of 1863. Many more travelers left the region and were never heard from again. As this became a more frequent occurrence locals began suspecting that these crimes were being carried out by a single group of outlaws, known as \\"road agents\\", under the control of Bannack sheriff Henry Plummer. The gang became known as the Innocents because of their passwords, I am innocent. Notorious robberies, attempted robberies and murders in 1863 * On October 13, 1863, Lloyd Magruder was killed by road agent Chris Lowrie. Magruder was an Idaho merchant leaving Virginia City with $12,000 in gold dust from goods he had sold there. Several of the men he hired to accompany him back to Lewiston, Idaho were in fact criminals. Four other men in the party were also murdered in camp--Charlie Allen, Robert Chalmers, Horace Chalmers and William Phillips--by Lowrie, Doc Howard, Jem Romaine and William Page. * On October 26, 1863, the Peabody and Caldwell's stage was robbed between the Rattlesnake Ranch and Bannack by two road agents believed to be Frank Parish and George Ives. Bill Bunton, the owner of the Rattlesnake Ranch who joined the stage at the ranch was also complicit in the robbery. The road agents netted $2,800 in gold from the passengers and threatened them all with death if they talked about the robbery. * On November 13, 1863, a teenage Henry Tilden was in the employ of Wilbur Sanders and Sidney Edgerton to locate and corral some horses owned by Sanders and Edgerton. Near Horse Prairie, Tilden was confronted by three armed road agents. He was carrying very little money and was allowed to depart unmolested, but with the warning that if he talked, he would be killed. He did not heed the warning and told Sanders' wife, Hattie and Sidney Edgerton that he had recognized one of the road agents as sheriff Henry Plummer. Although Tilden's report was discounted because Plummer was respected, this incident led to increased suspicion in the region that Plummer was the leader of a gang of road agents. Henry Plummer * On November 22, 1863, the A.J. Oliver stage was robbed on its way to Bannack from Virginia City by road agents George Ives, \\"Whiskey Bill\\" Graves and Bob Zachary. The robbery netted less than $1000 in gold and treasury notes. One of the victims, Leroy Southmayd made the mistake of reporting the robbery and identifying the road agents to Bannack Sheriff, Henry Plummer. Members of Plummer's gang confronted Southmayd on his return trip to Virginia City, but Southmayd was cunning enough to avoid injury or death. * In November 1863, Conrad Kohrs traveled to Bannack from Deer Lodge, Montana with $5000 in gold dust to buy cattle. A conversation with Sheriff Plummer in Bannack led Kohrs to believe he might be robbed while on the trail back to Deer Lodge. While in an overnight camp his associates located road agents George Ives and \\"Dutch John\\" Wagner surveying the camp, armed with shotguns. A day or two later, Kohrs was on horseback returning to Deer Lodge when Ives and Wagner gave chase. Kohrs' horse proved the faster and he evaded confrontation before reaching the safety of Deer Lodge. * In early December 1863, a three wagon freight outfit organized by Milton S. Moody was going to Salt Lake City from Virginia City. Among the seven passengers was John Bozeman. The freight wagons were carrying $80,000 in gold dust and $1500 in treasury notes. While camped on Blacktail Deer Creek, road agents \\"Dutch John\\" Wagner and Steve Marshland entered the camp, armed and ready to rob the train. Members of the camp had armed themselves well and Wagner and Marshland were able to escape, claiming they were just looking for lost horses. Two days later, Wagner and Marshland were both wounded in an unsuccessful attempt to rob the wagon train as it crossed the Continental Divide at Rock Creek. * On December 8, 1863, Anton Holter (who later became a Montana Power Company executive and had Holter Dam named for him), who was taking oxen to sell in Virginia City, survived an attempted robbery and murder. When road agents George Ives and Aleck Carter, whom Holter recognized, discovered Holter was not carrying any significant wealth, they tried to shoot him. He was able to avoid being shot and escaped into the brush. = The failure of miners' courts= Prior to the creation of the Montana Territory on May 26, 1864, and the arrival of the territorial courts, the only court system available for the residents of Bannack and Virginia City were the informal miners' courts. The miners' courts were a vehicle of the organized mining districts to resolve mining claims and disputes between miners in the district. When confronted with a major crime such as murder, they usually proved ineffective at resolving the crime to the satisfaction of the community. While there are not many accounts of early courts in Alder Gulch, probably due to their informality and short existence, John X. Beidler recalled a murder trial in the Virginia City miners' court in his memoirs. The trial recalled by Beidler occurred in the fall of 1863. It concerned the matter of the murder of J.W. Dillingham. The trial was held outside, due to the fact that every resident took part. In the end all three defendants were set free. The first, Charley Forbes, was freed after he gave an eloquent and sentimental speech about his mother. The other two, Buck Stinson and Haze Lyons, were convicted and set to be the first men executed in what would become the state of Montana. However, at what would be a very public hanging friends and sympathizers of Stinson and Lyons convinced the crowd to vote again on the execution. Two attempts at counting the vote were made according to Beidler. The first people voting 'hang' were to walk up-hill while those voting 'no hang' were to walk down- hill. This vote was rejected and the next attempt had four men form two gates and people would cast their vote by walking through the 'hang' gate or the 'no hang' gate. Beidler claims that friends of the condemned men simply walked through the 'no hang' gate multiple times casting multiple fraudulent votes that possibly allowed two murderers to walk free. On December 19–21, 1863, a public trial was held for George Ives, the suspected murderer of a young Dutch immigrant Nicholas Tiebolt. Hundreds of miners from around the area attended the 3-day, outdoor trial. George Ives was prosecuted by Wilbur F. Sanders and Ives was convicted and hanged on December 21, 1863. Sanders played a prominent role in Montana history and eventually became the first U.S. Senator from Montana when the territory gained statehood in 1889. While the Ives trial resulted in an execution many residents were frustrated by a cumbersome process that could easily be manipulated. This sentiment is illustrated by a quote from Thomas Dimsdale who wrote the first published account of the Montana Vigilantes, originally written in 1865 as a series of articles for the Montana Post and later compiled into a book. = Formation of the Vigilance Committee = On December 23, 1863, two days after the Ives trial, a group of five Virginia City residents, led by Wilbur F. Sanders, and including Major Alvin W. Brockie, John Nye, Captain Nick D. Wall and Paris Pfouts organized the Vigilance Committee of Alder Gulch. The committee was organized similar to the earlier San Francisco Committee of Vigilance (1851–56) in California of which some of the Alder Gulch organizers were familiar with. The original committee oath signed by its earliest members was: Paris Pfouts was elected as the president of the committee which drafted and adopted a comprehensive set of by-laws establishing a formal structure and process. The by-laws established the position of president, an executive officer, an executive committee, a secretary, treasurer and positions of captains and lieutenants of companies. The most relevant process contained in the by-laws was: =Prominent members= John Bozeman Although the vigilance committee started as a small secret institution in Virginia City, knowledge of it soon spread in the territory and membership grew. As a secret organization, exact accounts of membership vary, but many members became prominent in the history of the territory and state. Among those who were members include Wilbur Sanders (1st U.S. Senator from Montana (1890)), Sidney Edgerton (first Governor of Montana Territory (1864)), Nelson Story (famous for his 1866 cattle drive from Texas to Bozeman and prominent Bozeman merchant), John Bozeman (founder of Bozeman, Montana (1864) and the Bozeman Trail), Nathaniel P. Langford (first Yellowstone National Park superintendent (1872–1877)), James Stuart (brother of Granville Stuart, who would form the Stuarts' Stranglers in 1884), Tom Cover (one of the Alder Gulch prospectors who discovered the first gold there and alleged murderer of John Bozeman (1867)) and Thomas Dimsdale (editor of Montana's first newspaper, the Montana Post and author of The Vigilantes of Montana (1866)). Due to the secret nature of the organization it is difficult to be sure when an execution was carried out by the vigilance committee or another group of motivated citizens. In the months following the Ives trial many suspected road agents were hanged. Notable among those hanged was Henry Plummer, the sheriff of Bannack, who was suspected by many of being the ringleader of the road agents. The Montana Vigilantes hanged men using the testimony of other men who faced their imminent executions as the sole evidence. Of the few accounts of the early actions of the Alder Gulch Vigilantes, Beidler and Dimsdale are the most complete, although they give little information about the secret trials conducted by the vigilantes. Estimates vary, but noted vigilante historian Frederick Allen believes that between the years 1863 and 1865 somewhere from 15 to 35 people were killed due to the actions of the Alder Gulch vigilantes. =Vigilante justice= Over a course of approximately six weeks between December 1863 and February 1864, vigilante companies located, arrested and executed suspected members of the Plummer road agent gang in Bannack, Virginia City and Hellgate, Montana. Bannack Shortly after its formation, the Vigilance Committee dispatched a posse of men to search for Aleck Carter, \\"Whiskey Bill\\" Graves and Bill Bunton, known associates of George Ives. The posse was led by vigilante Captain James Williams, the man who had investigated the Nicolas Tiebolt murder by George Ives. Near the Rattlesnake Ranch on the Ruby River, the posse located \\"Erastus Red\\" Yeager and George Brown, both suspected road agents. While traveling back to Virginia City, Yeager made a complete confession, naming the majority of the road agents in Plummer's gang, including Henry Plummer. After obtaining the confession, Yeager and Brown were found guilty by the posse and summarily hanged from a cottonwood tree on the Lorrain's Ranch on the Ruby River. On January 6, 1864, \\"Dutch John\\" Wagner, a road agent wounded in the Moody robbery was captured by vigilante Captain Nick Wall and Ben Peabody on the Salt Lake City trail. The vigilantes transported Wagner to Bannack where he was hanged on January 11, 1864. By this time, Yeager's confession had mobilized vigilantes against Plummer and his key associates, deputies Buck Stinson and Ned Ray. Plummer, Stinson and Ray were arrested on the morning of January 10, 1864 and summarily hanged. On January 11, 1864, \\"Greaser Joe\\" Pizanthia, a road agent on Yeager's list, was located in his cabin just outside Bannack. A gunfight ensued that took the life of one vigilante, George Copley. Pizanthia's cabin was bombarded with three shells from a mountain howitzer belonging to Sidney Edgerton. The bombardment severely wounded Pizanthia and he was shot and killed as he was removed from the wreckage of the cabin. Virginia City After Wagner's execution on January 11, 1864, the vigilantes who were mostly men from Virginia City, returned there to deal with the remaining road agents in the Plummer gang. On the evening of January 13, 1864, the Vigilance Committee voted to arrest and hang six road agents believed to be living in Virginia City--Frank Parish, Boone Helm, Hayes Lyons, Jack Gallagher, George \\"Clubfoot\\" Lane and Bill Hunter. On the morning of January 14, 1864, five of the six road agents were located in town and arrested. They were all summarily hanged from a beam in a building under construction on Wallace Street. Bill Hunter escaped capture in Virginia City, but was later arrested at a cabin on the Gallatin River and was hanged from a Cottonwood tree on February 3, 1864. After the January 14, 1864 hangings, the vigilante companies left Virginia City in search of the remaining road agents on Yeager's list. The first to be located was Steve Marshland holed up in a cabin on the Big Hole River and was hanged on January 16, 1864. A posse led by Captain Williams found Bill Bunton at his Cottonwood Ranch on the Ruby River and hanged him on January 18, 1864. Hell Gate After the Bunton execution, the vigilante companies regrouped and made a ride to Hell Gate, Montana where they believed more road agents were hiding. In Hell Gate, Captain William's vigilante company located and arrested Cyrus Skinner, Aleck Carter, and John Cooper. A vigilante trial of Skinner and Carter was held in the Worden and Higgins dry goods store on January 24, 1864. Both men were found guilty and hanged outside the store. Later that same day, Cooper was tried, convicted and hanged. On January 25, 1864, the vigilantes located Bob Zachary in a cabin outside of Hell Gate and George Shears in another cabin in the Bitterroot Valley. Zachary was brought to Hell Gate and hanged. Shears was hanged outside the cabin he was captured in. As the vigilante companies were leaving Hell Gate to return to Virginia City, they received word that \\"Whiskey Bill\\" Graves was at Fort Owen, Montana. Three vigilantes located and arrested him on January 26, 1864. He was hanged the same day. =Known road agents executed by the Vigilance Committee of Alder Gulch= * Henry Plummer, sheriff of Bannack, executed in Bannack on January 10, 1864 * Erastus \\"Red\\" Yeager, road agent and messenger, executed along the Ruby River, January 4, 1864 * George Brown, road agent and gang secretary, executed along the Ruby River, January 4, 1864 * \\"Dutch John\\" Wagner, road agent, executed in Bannack, January 11, 1864 * Ned Ray, executed in Bannack, January 10, 1864 * Buck Stinson, executed in Bannack, January 10, 1864 * \\"Greaser Joe\\" Pizanthia, road agent, shot and killed in Bannack, January 11, 1864 * Frank Parish, road agent, executed in Virginia City, January 14, 1864 * Boone Helm, road agent, executed in Virginia City, January 14, 1864 * Jack Gallagher, road agent, executed in Virginia City, January 14, 1864 * George \\"Clubfoot\\" Lane, road agent, executed in Virginia City, January 14, 1864 * Hayes Lyon, road agent, executed in Virginia City, January 14, 1864 * Steve Marshland, road agent, executed near the Big Hole River, January 16, 1864 * Bill Bunton, road agent, executed at Cottonwood Ranch on the Clark ForkVigilante Days And Ways by N.P.

He was hanged on September 5, 1864, along the Snake River in Idaho Territory. * On September 17, 1864, vigilantes hanged John \\"The Hat\\" Dolan in Virginia City for stealing $700 from a roommate. * On October 31, 1864, vigilantes captured and hanged J.C. Rawley in Bannack for his alleged spying on behalf of the road agent gang in 1863. This was the last execution performed by the Vigilance Committee of Alder Gulch. =Banishments and escapes= Another tactic employed by the vigilantes was banishment from the territory. It is unknown how many men were given the warning to leave the territory or suffer execution for their misdeeds. Alexander Toponce, a merchant in Bannack at the time believed the number of banishments was high but wrote this in his autobiography: Reminiscences of Alexander Toponce (1923): Some of the road agents in Plummer's gang or on Yeager's list were able to escape vigilante justice by fleeing the territory. Notable among these men were Augustus \\"Gad\\" Moore, Billy Terwilliger, William Mitchell, Harvey Meade, \\"Rattlesnake Dick\\", \\"Cherokee Bob\\", Tex Caldwell, Jeff Perkins, Samuel Bunton, \\"Irwin of the Big Hole\\", William Moore and Charles Reeves. =Establishment of Territorial Law= During the summer of 1864, Hezekiah L. Hosmer, a lawyer from Ohio, was working for the U.S. House of Representative Committee on Territories. After working on the formation of Montana Territory for the committee, he was formally appointed as the first Chief Justice of Montana Territory. He arrived in Montana in October 1864. Prior to the first session of the Territorial Legislature which convened on December 12, 1864, in Bannack, Hosmer announced that he was adopting Common Law as the primary criminal and civil law and Idaho's Territorial Law as a basis for criminal and civil procedure. On December 5, 1864, Hosmer boldly convened a public Grand Jury session in Virginia City and announced that the vigilantes had served their purpose and from this day forward, unilateral actions by the vigilantes would be considered criminal acts. Helena vigilantism, 1865–1870 Helena, Montana in 1870 On July 14, 1864, four prospectors--John S. Cowan, John Crab, Bob Staley and Daniel Jackson--found gold in a small creek they named \\"Last Chance Gulch\\". As word of the strike spread throughout the area, prospectors and fortune seekers, including many from Alder Gulch and Bannack, migrated to Last Chance Gulch and the town of Helena, Montana was founded. By the middle of 1865, many prominent vigilantes of Alder Gulch, including Wilbur Sanders, John X. Beidler, and Anton Holter, had moved to Helena. When the territory was formed, three judicial districts were established. The First District belonged to Judge Hosmer and included the towns of Bannack, Virginia City, Nevada City and Deer Lodge. The Third District encompassed the towns around Helena. From July 1864, until August 1865, the only justice system was the miners' court; the Third District did not get its first chief judge until August 1865, when Judge Lyman Munson arrived from the east. On June 8, 1865, John Keene and Harry Slater, two men who had an unresolved quarrel from their days in Salt Lake City, spotted each other in Sam Greer's saloon on Helena's Bridge Street. Keene shot Slater in the head, killing him instantly. Keene surrendered himself to Helena sheriff George Wood and freely admitted his guilt in the shooting. A two-day trial ensued where some members of the jury were known vigilantes from Alder Gulch. Since there was no official trial judge, Stephan Reynolds, a respected member of the Helena community, presided. At the end of the trial, the jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict and Keene was hanged from the lone pine tree just outside town. The large tree, one of few that remained in proximity to Helena because most had been cut down for lumber, became known as the \\"Old Hangman's Tree\\". Although Keene's trial and execution was not considered vigilantism, the Helena community, similar to the Alder Gulch community in 1863, felt the need to establish a more reliable means of law and order. =Committee of Safety= Diamond City in Confederate Gulch, 1870 Vigilante justice in Helena followed a pattern similar to that of Alder Gulch. Immediately after Keene's hanging, leading members of the Helena community established the Helena Committee of Safety, akin to the Vigilance Committee of Alder Gulch. Although no records of the committee's membership or bylaws exist, Nathaniel Langford, who had been asked to lead the organization but declined (he did serve on its executive committee), reflected in his book Vigilante Days and Ways that crimes of horse stealing, murder, and highway robbery would be punishable by death. In July 1865, the Helena vigilantes captured Jack Silvie in Diamond City, Montana, and charged him with various crimes of robbery. Prior to his execution by hanging from Helena's \\"Hangman's Tree\\", Silvie confessed to being a member of the Virginia City road agents and to at least a dozen murders in the territory. Shortly after Judge Lyman Munson's arrival in Helena, he convened a grand jury on August 12, 1865. However, unlike Judge Hosmer in Alder Gulch, Munson made no remarks about vigilantism nor did he threaten vigilantes with prosecution if they continued their activities. The vigilantes showed little respect for Munson's court and proceeded to carry out at least 14 extrajudicial executions. Among them was that in January 1870 of Chinese worker Ah Chow, who had shot and killed white miner John R. Blitzer after he found Blitzer attempting to rape his wife.https://academic.oup.com/maghis/article/26/3/25/983245 No member of Helena's vigilantes was ever indicted by Munson's grand jury for executions carried out by the Helena Committee of Safety. The last execution by the Helena vigilantes occurred on April 27, 1870, when Joseph Wilson and Arthur Compton were hanged from the \\"Old Hangman's Tree\\" for the robbery and attempted murder of George Leonard. The double hanging is significant because it was photographed at the time and the image, widely circulated, had the effect of damping public sentiment for vigilantism.  Pax Vigilanticus  By the 1870s Montana as a whole was experiencing what Montana historian Frederic Allen described as a \\"sort of pax vigilanticus\\" Allen claims this was due to the reputation for summary executions but also linked to the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory. This drew many of the prospectors and camp followers out of Montana, reducing the sector of the population more closely associated with crime. Stockmen's associations Ponderosa pine alleged to be a \\"hanging tree\\" in Jefferson County, Montana, near Clancy, though there is insufficient documentary evidence to prove or disprove this legend. By the 1870s, cattle ranching and related livestock raising was a large and prosperous business in Montana. Cattle and horses were valuable commodities and always subject to rustling by thieves. After 1879, with the threat from the Indian wars diminished on the plains of Montana, stock ranches and open range cattle ranching moved east into Central and Eastern Montana. The DHS ranch, owned by Samuel Hauser, Andrew Davis and Granville Stuart was established in 1879 in the Musselshell region of Central Montana and became one of the largest open range ranches in Montana. The first stockmen's association in Montana was formed in Virginia City in 1873. The association was established to discuss branding standards, how to deal with rustling and how to influence the territorial legislature to pass laws favorable to the cattle industry. This association did not survive, but led to the creation of other organizations in subsequent years. In 1878, the Montana Stock Association of Lewis and Clark County was organized. One of its prominent members, Ross Deegan, editorialized about the need for extralegal action if the territorial legislature did not enact laws to protect the cattle industry: In July, 1879, a Territorial Stock Association was formed that ultimately spawned a number of small county or district based associations throughout Montana. By 1883, the value of cattle in Montana was estimated at greater than $25 million and annual losses from rustling exceeded three percent. By the summer of 1884, cattle men resorted to vigilantism to deal with rustlers and the first recorded hanging occurred at Fort Maginnis on July 3, 1884, when Reese Anderson, a DHS ranch foreman, and several other ranch hands hanged Sam McKenzie for horse thievery. =Stuart's Stranglers= Granville Stuart in 1900 The hanging of Sam McKenzie and other citizen justice in early July 1884 prompted many thieves and rustlers to leave the territory. However, a large band of horse thieves still operated in the Musselshell region. With the tacit approval of the stockgrowers' associations, Granville Stuart organized a small intelligence network and mobilized forces to go after the thieves. The group included many of Stuart's ranch hands and stock detectives employed by various stock associations. Known as \\"Stuart's Stranglers\\", the vigilantes were responsible for the recovery of dozens of stolen horses and the deaths of at least 20 thieves in July 1884, by hanging, shootings or fire. The last hanging occurred on August 1, 1884. In July 1884, Theodore Roosevelt who later became the 26th President of the United States, was operating a cattle ranch in Medora, North Dakota along the Little Missouri River in cooperation with cattle merchant Marquis de Mores. His ranch was suffering from rustling as well. Both Mores and Roosevelt offered their services to the Stranglers, but Stuart declined the offer to avoid the undue notoriety they would bring. From that point forward, stock detectives, employed by the various stock associations, took responsibility for enforcing stock laws and deterring rustling. Although there was minor public outrage about the killings, none of Stuart's Stranglers were ever brought to trial for their actions and editorials in regional newspapers praised their efforts. General acclamation of Granville Stuart's actions was reflected by his election as the first president of the Montana Stockgrower's Association in late July 1884. 3-7-77 The numerical symbol 3-7-77 has long been associated with Montana vigilantes. Its meaning is unclear though many theories have been put forward trying to explain what it symbolized, none conclusive, including references to the dimensions of a grave, the amount of time a miscreant had to leave town, assorted Masonic symbolism, details of membership structure, and a simple copying of the symbol from organizations in Colorado and California. Although it has been associated with vigilantes in Alder Gulch, this is not supported by historical evidence. The first documented evidence of use of the symbol in a vigilante scenario occurred in November 1879 in Helena when it was mentioned in a newspaper article. A 1914 dissertation noted that it was simply used as part of a meeting notice. It was incorporated into the uniform patch of the Montana Highway Patrol (MHP) in 1956. MHP administrator Alex Stephenson designed the insignia and explained, \\"we chose the symbol to keep alive the memory of this first people's police force.\\" Historiography The first written account of the vigilantes was Thomas Dimsdale's Vigilantes of Montana which first appeared as a series of articles in 1865 editions of the Montana Post, Virginia City's and Montana's first newspaper. Dimsdale was a member of the Alder Gulch Vigilance Committee and editor of the Montana Post. His early accounts of the Alder Gulch vigilante events are widely cited and the book version of his articles, the first book published in Montana Territory in 1866, has been extensively reprinted since its first edition. Nathaniel P. Langford in 1870 John X. Beidler, one of the Alder Gulch and Helena vigilante enforcers wrote about his vigilante activities in his personal journals. They weren't available until well after his death when Helen F. Sanders, the daughter-in-law of Wilbur Sanders finally got them published in 1957. Nathaniel Langford, also a member of the vigilantes, explorer of the upper Yellowstone (1870), first superintendent of Yellowstone National Park (1872–1877), territorial tax collector (1864–1869) and author published Vigilante Days and Ways-Pioneers of the Rockies in 1893 after he returned to his home in Minnesota. In a 1912 speech to the Montana Historical Society, western historian, Olin Wheeler provided positive commentary on the Alder Gulch vigilantes in a tribute to the life of Nathaniel Langford. Another account, not published until 1982, is that of former Montana Supreme Court Justice (1922–1935) Lew L. Callaway. Edited by his son Lew Callaway Jr., Montana's Righteous Hangmen:The Vigilantes in Action stems from Callaway's association with vigilante Captain James William in the late 1800s. Lew Callaway wrote extensively about the vigilantes and his stories which add more intimate details about how the vigilantes operated are captured in this volume. Although some vigilante activities during this period were criticized by citizens and civic leaders, there was a general affirmation of their purpose and contribution to law and order in a growing territory. Mark C. Dillon's Montana Vigilantes 1863–1870 Gold, Guns and Gallows (2013) concludes that given the lawless environment and criminal activity in Alder Gulch and Helena at the time, the lack of any functioning justice system and the understanding of due process at the time, the vigilantes acted in a way they thought was best for their communities. He contends that judging the vigilantes by today's understanding and standards of due process is problematic. In 2004, Frederick Allen, a journalist and historian, published A Decent and Orderly Lynching:The Montana Vigilantes reviewed as an up-to-day balanced account of Montana's vigilante history (1864–1870). Allen's book reinforces the motivations and methods of the earliest vigilantes in Alder Gulch while commenting on the growing disdain for vigilantism in the late 1860s. More generalist works on Montana history such as Merrill G. Burlingame's The Montana Frontier (1942) and Michael P. Malone's Montana-A History of Two Centuries (1991) adequately summarize the vigilante period largely based on earlier accounts by Dimsdale, Langford and Beidler. Additionally, many topical histories of Montana, such as novelist and Montana historian Dan Cushman's Montana: The Gold Frontier (1973) cover the vigilante period. Some works published in the late 20th century about vigilante activity in Alder Gulch portray the vigilantes and their leaders as conspirators with political motives rather than restoring law and order, making an argument that victims were not afforded due process prior to their execution and evidence was insufficient to prove their guilt or innocence. Two works, of Ruth E. Mather and F. E. Boswell, Hanging the Sheriff-A Biography of Henry Plummer (1987, 1999) and Vigilante Victims: Montana's 1864 Hanging Spree (1991) have been criticized as revisionist, and received poor reviews by Montana historians such as Michael P. Malone and Richard B. Roeder. Additional criticism came from later authors such as Mark C. Dillon and Carol Buchanan. Another account from John C. Fazio, who writes for the Cleveland Civil War Roundtable, contends that the Vigilance Committee of Alder Gulch had more to do with national politics than with dealing with criminals. He contends that Sidney Edgerton and Wilbur Sanders were pawns of Abraham Lincoln and other unionists who sought ways to rid Montana gold fields of southerners and confederate sympathizers. His views have been rebutted by novelist Carol Buchanan. =Mock trial of Henry Plummer and Plummer's pardon request= On May 7, 1993, the Twin Bridges, Montana public schools organized a mock trial of Henry Plummer at the Madison County courthouse in Virginia City. The trial received national media attention. Adults and students role played events using the accounts of Dimsdale, X. Beidler and Langford. After a six hour trial, the jury of four men and eight women was in deadlock, 6-6. The student playing the role of Henry Plummer was told he was \\"free\\". Based in part on the notoriety of the mock trial, academics sympathetic to the view that Plummer was innocent, petitioned the Montana Board of Pardons and Parole to grant Plummer a pardon. Although supported by a number of prominent historians and scholars, the pardon was denied by the board as Plummer had never actually been convicted of a crime in Montana and therefore the board was without jurisdiction to act.

He previously played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Detroit Tigers. Prior to beginning his professional career, he played college baseball at Oklahoma State University. He has also competed for the United States national baseball team in international competition. Mercer bats and throws right-handed. Amateur career Mercer attended Taloga High School in Taloga, Oklahoma. Mercer earned All-State honors in high school and played three seasons starting at shortstop for the Elk City Travelers of Oklahoma amateur baseball organization. Out of high school, the Los Angeles Dodgers drafted Mercer in the 26th round (796th overall) of the 2005 MLB draft. Mercer did not sign, as he did not feel ready for professional baseball. Mercer attended Oklahoma State University–Stillwater, where he played baseball for the Oklahoma State Cowboys baseball team in the Big 12 Conference. At Oklahoma State, Mercer was a shortstop and pitcher, serving as the team's closer. He was named to the Big 12 All-Star Team as a utility player in 2006 and 2008. He set the Oklahoma State record for saves. In the summer of 2007, following his sophomore year at Oklahoma State, Mercer joined the U.S. national baseball team. He competed in the 2007 Pan American Games, winning silver, and 2007 World Port Tournament, winning silver. Mercer competed for the U.S. team in the 2011 Pan American Games, winning silver. He also competed for the U.S. in the 2011 Baseball World Cup. Professional career =Pittsburgh Pirates= The Pirates drafted Mercer in the third round, with the 79th overall selection, of the 2008 MLB draft, choosing him as a shortstop. He began his professional career that season with the State College Spikes of the Class-A Short Season New York–Penn League, before he was promoted to the Hickory Crawdads of the Class-A South Atlantic League. In 2009, Mercer played for the Lynchburg Hillcats of the Class-A Advanced Carolina League, finishing fifth in the Carolina League and second in the Pirates' farm system with 83 runs batted in (RBI). He was promoted to the Altoona Curve of the Double-A Eastern League in 2010.

Joe Hale gained the nickname Poker Joe through his obsession with gambling and poker.https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/npnht/learningcenter/history- culture/?cid=fsbdev3_055793 Initial involvement in the Nez Perce War Poker Joe lived in Missoula, Montana before his involvement with the Nez Perce WarBrown, Mark H. “Yellowstone Tourists and the Nez Perce.” Montana: The Magazine of Western History, vol. 16, no. 3, 1966, pp. 30–43. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4517068.. Under the guidance of Chief Joseph, the Nez Perce avoided a run-in with soldiers and local militia in Missoula, and ended up in Yellowstone National Park--unchartered territory for the group. In need of a navigator, they commandeered the services of a prospector named John Shivley, whom they found camping alone along the Firehole River. A small man with a big voice, Poker Joe acted as Shivley's interpreter for the thirteen days he was held captive. According to Shivley's testimony (he escaped near the Absaroka Range on September 5, 1877), the Nez Perce had no definitive leader in place, with the rather pleasant and casual Chief Joseph wearing one feather on his headpiece, while Poker Joe wore two. Chief Joseph was heavily involved in diplomatic duties in the days leading up to the war, which is why he is viewed as the Nez Perces leader. However, it was Poker Joe who carried out negotiations for much-needed supplies and was responsible for the interrogation and release of tourists detained by his tribe during the war. Lean Elk becomes head of Nez Perce Tribe With an intimate knowledge of Montana at his disposal, Poker Joe kept the Nez Perce in front of a quickly approaching U.S. Army for seven weeks. He pushed the Nez Perce at a hurried pace, trying to get them to safety in Canada. Lean Elk/Poker Joe took over leadership of the Nez Perce Tribe in 1877 from the Nez Perce Chief Looking Glass, after the Battle of the Big Hole left many Nez Perce injured or dead. Lean Elk had experience hunting in Montana and knew the routes the Nez Perce should take to reach the border to avoid another battle.https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/npnht/learningcenter/history- culture/?cid=fsbdev3_055793 Lean Elk's leadership style was fast-paced, pushing the Nez Perce caravan 500-700 miles from the Battle of the Big Hole to the Missouri River, and north towards the Canadian border. For a month-and-a- half after the tribe outmaneuvered Major Guido Ilges at Fort Benton (Big Hole), Poker Joe led his people on an arduous journey toward Canada. Though the group obtained provisions at Cow Island, they proved insufficient for the long journey. Food ran low, as did bullets. Wear and tear could be seen on the tribe members’ faces, as well as their hardware, which needed replacement in the onset of cold weather. Removal from Leadership Lean Elk's traveling style left the Nez Perce caravan tired and weak.Greene, Jerome A. Beyond Bear’s Paw: The Nez Perce Indians in Canada. University of Oklahoma Press, 2010. The mental and physical anguish brought on by his aggressive effort towards the North proved itself too dangerous for the group. On September 25, 1877, the council voted to bring Poker Joe’s leadership to an end, and Chief Looking Glass ultimately resumed his position as leader before the Nez Perce reached the Canadian border. Death of Poker Joe Mistaken for a Cheyenne scout, Poker Joe was accidentally killed by a fellow Nez Perce during the Battle of Bear Paw in 1877. The battle of Bear Paw took place about 40 miles from the Canadian border where the Nez Percè battled Colonel Nelson Miles and his troops.

Transhuman 2.0 saw its release via WTII Records and BitRiot Records in association with The band's second full-length album, The Medication Generation saw release in summer 2010. Musically, the band continued to mature, and the partnership for co-producing with Acumen Nation's Jamie Duffy saw the band's song-writing and production improve.

The band continued to rotate a live and studio secondary role during this time. Cyanotic performed live at The Cold Waves music festival in 2012, in honor of Jamie Duffy and has since reappeared twice (2014, 2017). Worst Case Scenario, vol. 1 was met with positive reviews for its continued path through various industrial influences. In 2016, Cyanotic and guitarist Chris H separated, but a live act of Jordan Davis (Relic) on synthesizers, Dan Dickerscheid (Relic) on drums and Kevin Barron transitioning from live and studio synthesizer player to bass continued to perform live without guitars. The band completed a North American tour with iVardensphere, and performances with Tim Skold (KMFDM, Marilyn Manson) as a four piece. This heavily influenced the fourth studio album, Tech Noir. Audiences found immediate differences in Tech Noir for its almost complete lack of guitars, but the album received critical praise for its ability to communicate aggression without requiring guitars to do so.

Background Coakley was born in Beloit on January 9, 1906. He earned a B.A. degree from Beloit College in 1926, and graduated in 1930 from the University of Wisconsin Law School, taking up the practice of law in his home town.

From 1931-32 he was an instructor in political science at Beloit College, and in 1932 he was admitted to the bar of the Territory of Hawaii. Public office In 1934 Coakley won a plurality in a five-way Republican primary contest for the Senate seat won the year before by Democrat Alexander Paul. In the general election he was successful in unseating Paul, with 8847 votes to 8076 for Paul and 6168 for Progressive George Geffs.

In the early 2000s, Ramírez Treviño was a close associate of Jaime González Durán (El Hummer), a founder and top leader of Los Zetas drug cartel. In 2008, González Durán was arrested and sentenced to 35 years in prison; by 2010, Los Zetas, who were working as the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel, separated from the organization to operate independently. Both criminal organizations went to war with each other, but Ramírez Treviño remained in the Gulf Cartel. Under the tutelage of Samuel Flores Borrego (El Metro 3), he worked as the second-in- command for the criminal organization in Reynosa, Tamaulipas. In an apparent power struggle within the Gulf Cartel, however, El Metro 3 was killed, and he became the regional kingpin in September 2011. With the death of El Metro 3, several groups within the Gulf Cartel went to war with each other, but Ramírez Treviño remained loyal to his faction, Los Metros. In late 2012, the Gulf Cartel leaders Mario Cárdenas Guillén and Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez were arrested by the Mexican Armed Forces, forcing him to take the lead of the criminal organization. To keep the Gulf Cartel under his control and in a single command structure, Ramírez Treviño resorted to kill El Metro 4, Miguel \\"El Gringo\\" Villarreal, and other cartel leaders who stood in his way. He was arrested by the Mexican Army and Navy on 17 August 2013 in Reynosa. Early life and career Mario Armando Ramírez Treviño was born in Mexico on 5 March 1962. For many years, he worked under the radar as he ascended in the ranks of the Gulf Cartel. In the early 2000s, he worked with Jaime González Durán (El Hummer), one of the leaders and founders of Los Zetas, an organization that served as the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. El Hummer was eventually arrested in November 2008 and sentenced to 35 years in prison; Los Zetas later separated from the Gulf Cartel in early 2010 and went to war with them. But when the two organizations separated, Ramírez Treviño remained loyal to the Gulf Cartel and became the second-in-command in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, an area formerly controlled by the deceased Samuel Flores Borrego (El Metro 3). He was Flores Borrego's right-hand man in Reynosa. On 2 September 2011, however, the Mexican authorities discovered the bullet-ridden corpse of Flores Borrego inside a Ford Lobo truck on a highway that connects Reynosa with Monterrey. Although the information has not been confirmed, the Mexican Army alleges that Ramírez Treviño's boss was killed by \\"members of his own cartel,\\" presumably on orders from the Gulf Cartel leaders Juan Mejía González (El R-1) and Rafael Cárdenas Vela (El Junior). Within a few hours after his death, Ramírez Treviño, who had been working as the regional boss of Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, succeeded him as the kingpin of Reynosa. The top echelons of the Gulf Cartel gave him \\"explicit orders to make the [drug market] profitable again.\\" The death of Ramírez Treviño's boss triggered a war within the Gulf Cartel, resulting in the deaths and arrests of several high-ranking drug traffickers from 2011 to 2013. When the Gulf Cartel's top leaders Mario Cárdenas Guillén and Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez were arrested in early September 2012, Ramírez Treviño decided to step up for the job and become the undisputed leader of the cartel. In efforts to keep the Gulf Cartel under a single command structure, he ordered the assassination of high-ranking drug trafficker El Metro 4 on 15 January 2013 in Reynosa. His death, however, sparked a turf war. Reynosa turf wars =Battle with Miguel \\"El Gringo\\" Villarreal= On the night of 10 March 2013, rival factions within the Gulf Cartel clashed when gunmen loyal to Ramírez Treviño and henchmen of Miguel \\"El Gringo\\" Villarreal, another high-ranking drug trafficker, battled in a three- hour gunfight in Reynosa, paralyzing the avenues and streets of the city while the Mexican Armed Forces missed most of the fighting. When the melee ended, the Mexican government initially confirmed two civilian deaths, but unofficial reports suggested that around 40 Gulf Cartel gunmen were reportedly killed; the number may possibly be higher, considering that the cartel members were reported to have carried away the corpse of their fallen comrades in their vehicles. In the shootout, unofficial reports claimed that El Gringo's ally, Jesús García Román (El Puma), was killed. And that high-ranking Gulf Cartel leader Sergio Ortegón Silva (Comandante Cortez), who heads the faction known as Los Ceros (The Zeros), confronted El Gringo and his forces. Ramírez Treviño and El Gringo vied for the control of the drug trade operations in Reynosa, but the former had taken the overall command of the Gulf Cartel and had committed himself to kill anyone that he considered his enemy, which included El Gringo. In order to put him down, Ramírez Treviño ordered his men to \\"erase everything and [kill] everyone that had ties El Gringo\\", thereby creating a single structure among the cartel's commanders. With the help of the Sinaloa Cartel, Ramírez Treviño was planning to oust El Gringo for reportedly failing to stay low-profile in Reynosa, and for considering him a \\"bloodthirsty\\" leader. In addition, he distrusted El Gringo because he had ties with his rival Juan Mejía González (El R1). Stratfor indicates that the infighting between both men might have triggered after El Gringo allegedly betrayed the Gulf Cartel and started working with Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano (El Lazca), the deceased leader of the rival Los Zetas cartel. Intelligence reports indicate that the infighting between Ramírez Treviño and El Gringo left at least 60 dead throughout the state of Tamaulipas in March 2013, particularly in Miguel Alemán and Camargo, Tamaulipas. After several prolonged battles for the control of Reynosa, Ramírez Treviño became the top leader of the Gulf Cartel in 2013, a position he had been vying since the drug lords Costilla Sánchez and Cárdenas Guillén were arrested in late 2012. Although the information has not been officially confirmed, Stratfor intelligence agency suggests that El Gringo and several of his top associates were killed in the infighting on 10 March 2013. Bounty and status According to the United States Department of State, Ramírez Treviño is tall, and weighs approximately 90.1 kilograms (200 lbs). He has black-colored hair and brown eyes, and his aliases are X-20, Comandante X-20 (\\"Commander X-20\\"), Pelón (\\"Baldy\\"), and/or Mario Pelón. Ramírez Treviño was an active participant and coordinator of cocaine and marijuana shipments heading to the United States from Mexico. He is also involved in moving large sums of money from drug sales heading back to Mexico from the U.S. through the Reynosa corridor. He was also the leader of Los Metros, a Gulf Cartel subgroup. In 2008, he was charged with a federal indictment in the District of Columbia for violations of Title 21 USC Sections 959, 960, 963, and Title 18 USC Section 2. The United States Department of State was offering up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction. Mexico, however, did not have him on its most-wanted list and was not offering any financial reward for information leading to his arrest. His criminal profile portrays Ramírez Treviño as a violent, cold- blooded, and intelligent criminal. Assassins who have worked for him say that the drug lord enjoyed spending time alone, gambling, and drinking; they also say that he was an introvert and was easily frustrated. To instill fear among his enemies and respect among his men, Ramírez Treviño reportedly tortured his victims. He was considered \\"at least as violent\\" as former Zetas leader Miguel Treviño Morales. =Kingpin Act sanction= On 24 March 2010, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Ramírez Treviño under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with fifty-three other international criminals and ten foreign entities. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. Months prior to arrest After Los Zetas leader Miguel Treviño Morales (alias Z40) was arrested in July 2013, the authorities speculated that Ramírez Treviño was planning to lead the Gulf Cartel into new grounds by retaking the turfs controlled by Los Zetas, their former allies, in northeastern Mexico. With a new armed squad known as Los Deltas (a parallel version of what Los Zetas was for the Gulf Cartel prior to their separation), the drug lord was planning to fight off Los Zetas at a border area known as \\"La Frontera Chica,\\" which encompasses Miguel Alemán, Camargo and Ciudad Mier – directly across the U.S-Mexico border from Starr County, Texas. Other crime specialists believed that Ramírez Treviño stood a chance of reunifying the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas as they were in early 2010. =Capture= Ramírez Treviño was arrested during a joint operation between the Mexican Army and Navy in Reynosa, Tamaulipas on the morning of 17 August 2013. In the operative the federal agents confiscated three assault rifles, nine communication equipment, and more than US$38,000 and $25,000 pesos (about US$2,000). They also arrested the drug lord with two of his bodyguards. The Mexican federal government first confirmed the arrest of the drug lord via Twitter and then issued a short statement of the operative, but did not offer major details until the following day during a formal press conference. That same day, he was flown from the General Lucio Blanco International Airport in Reynosa to Mexico City under tight security and kept at the SEIDO installations, Mexico's organized crime investigatory agency. The government responded to the arrest by strengthening security and increasing the presence of federal troops in northeastern Mexico in order to neutralize any incursion from rival criminal organizations like Los Zetas in the region. On 21 August 2013, he was transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 maximum security prison in Almoloya de Juárez, State of Mexico by the Mexican Army. The Mexican government has not officially confirmed the existence of a successor to Ramírez Treviño's reign. However, the most rumored name is Homero Cárdenas Guillén (El Majadero), the brother of the former leaders Osiel and Antonio. According to U.S. sources, there are three other possible leaders for the Gulf Cartel: Luis Alberto Trinidad Cerón (El Guicho); Juan Francisco Carrizales (El 98); and Alberto de la Cruz Álvarez (El Juanillo).

Throughout the plants history it has been associated with metal mechanical engineering, and manufacture of components for large-scale transportation equipment such as bogies for rail vehicles, tank tracks or tractor parts. In 1963 the Centrolit (Центролит) casting plant was founded, further developments in the 1960s included a subsidiary supply factory of the Kirov factory; both concerns were merged as a subsidiary of the Kirov plant in the 1970s. The company was privatised as JSC Transmash in 1993; after financial difficulties and severe jobs losses in the post-Soviet era, the whole site was acquired by the ICT Group in 2001, renamed Titran and redeveloped. Poor demand led to an end to tractor production in 2003. The plant is collocated on the same industrial site as the Tikhvin Ferroalloy Plant (operational 2007) and the Tikhvin Freight Car Building Plant (opened 2012). History =1963–2000= An industrial plant was constructed in Tikhvin in the 1960s, an example of large-scale soviet projects of the time. Construction led to a substantial expansion of the town, with an influx of workers requiring the construction of new housing estates. The population of Tikhvin was expected to rise from about 20000 to ~50000 by 1970 according to the architects of the development. In 1967 the first casting was made, starting production at the site which continued for another 30 years; in 1968 another factory was constructed at the site as a branch of the St. Petersburg Kirov Plant (Putilov factory) producing parts. In 1973 'Centrolit', the Kirov subsidiary, and Litprom were merged, becoming the Tikhvin branch of the Kirov works. In 1974 production of parts for the К-700Т tractor began. In 1993 the entity was privatised as a closed corporation as the Transmash plant, and began production of railway parts; the Tikhvin plant produced ferrous and ferrous alloy castings, machinery, and rail transportation equipment and spare parts. In 1995 the complex employed over 22,000, a third of the Tkhvin population. In the mid-1990s the plant was involved in the production of the prototypes of the indigenous Russian high- speed trainset \\"Sokol\\" (VSM-250),* and was expected to manufacture the main series. Funding for the project was withdrawn in 2002. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the plant was negatively affected, Reduced federal budgets and the inability to quickly change production to new products were both factors in the plants economic crisis. From 1998 to 1999 production fell by 25%; only production of rail vehicle parts was increased, jobs losses of 2000 had reduced the number of employees to 6000 in 1999; a plan to reorganise the entity's structure was not initially successful, and bankruptcy proceedings began in 2000. =Titran (2002-)= New housing development by ICT Group in Tikhvin for workers (2010).

The Titran entity consisted of five subsidiary companies: JSC Titran-Centrolit (ЗАО Титран-Центролит), JSC Titran-Express, JSC Titran-Medokon, (ЗАО Титран-Медекон) and JSC Titran-Hammer (ЗАО Титран- Молот) and the 'Titran Tractor Works' (ЗАО «Тихвинский тракторный завод «Титран – Вепс» or ЗАО «ТЗТМ «Титран»). Combined facilities included manufacture of rail vehicle parts, caterpillar tracks, and tractor and tractor parts, as well as casting, forging, and other metal engineering. Before privatisation the plant had supplied 60% of its output to the Kirov Plant in Leningrad.* In 2002 Титран – Вепс began production of tractors type К-700Т. Although investment was made into the enterprise, the plants economic problems continued in 2003 - turnover was only $20million compared to $750million in the soviet period - with only 30% of the plant area actively utilised, job losses of over 800 were made from January to September; the enterprise made a significant loss in 2003 and a lack of demand for agricultural tractors caused the company to refocus on railway vehicle equipment as part of a three-year restructuring and modernisation plan - tractor production ceased in 2003. 2000 workers were laid off in June 2004, by 2005 the number of full-time employees remaining was reduced to 1000. The Titran-Express (Титран-Экспресс) factory was restructured and modernised between 2007 and 2008, with manufacturing re- focused on rail vehicle components and caterpillar tracks. As of 2012 the factory produces tank tracks, bogies for electric trains and freight wagons, other railway vehicle components, and welded structures., also see section For Our Clients In 2016 United Wagon Company (ICT Group subsidiary) became the sole owner of Titran-Express.

Gustavus was the first grey horse to win the Epsom Derby. He raced until he was four years old and was retired to stud in 1823. Gustavus was exported to Prussia in 1836, at the age of 18. Gustavus was not a successful sire. Background Gustavus was foaled in 1818 at the Hampton Court Stud. Gustavus was bred by the Prince Regent and was sired by the 1807 Derby winner Election. Election was a successful racehorse that was bred by the Earl of Egremont and was bought by the Prince of Wales after his racing career to stand at Hampton Court. His dam, Lady Grey, was bred by Colonel Childers at Cantley House in Yorkshire and was one of the Prince's famous \\"half-dozen grey mares\\" that were housed at Hampton-Court. Lady Grey's sire, Stamford, was a full-brother to the Epsom Derby winners Paris and Archduke. In addition to breeding racehorses, the Prince also bred grey Thoroughbreds that would be \\"sufficiently powerful for his own riding,\\" with Lady Grey purchased specifically for this purpose. Gustavus was a small yearling and the Prince did not think he would be a suitable riding horse. Gustavus was sold to Mr. Hunter for 25 guineas as a yearling. Hunter was reportedly unsatisfied with his purchase and attempted to sell the \\"shabby little gray\\" at a loss for 15 guineas, but he could not find a buyer for the colt. Gustavus was retained by Hunter and raced in his name for his entire racing career. Racing career Gustavus was trained at Six-Mile Bottom in Newmarket by Crouch. Gustavus first raced as a two-year-old for the July Stakes. The Derby was his most significant win and he raced until he was four years-old, winning seven races in 14 starts. He was retired to stud in 1823. =1820: two-year-old season= Gustavus's first career start occurred on 10 July at the July Meeting in Newmarket for the July Stakes. Gustavus won the race by half a length from an unnamed colt by Soothsayer and seven other horses, winning 1,950 guineas. The run for the July Stakes was Gustavus' only start as a two-year-old. =1821: three-year-old season= Gustavus (third from left) behind the frontrunner Reginald in the 1821 Epsom Derby in a painting by Théodore Géricault. At the First Spring Meeting at Newmarket in May, Gustavus won the Newmarket Stakes, beating the colts Tressilian and Fleur de Lis. In his second start of the season, Gustavus ran in the Derby Stakes at Epsom against a field of twelve other horses. Gustavus was the betting favorite for the running, starting the race with 2 to 1 or 7.5 to 4 odds depending on the bookmaking operation. The Duke of Grafton's colt Reginald (the winner of the 2,000 Guineas Stakes) initially took the lead and \\"made the running\\" with Gustavus initiating \\"some play\\" with Reginald at Tattenham Corner and the two horses \\"worked together from end to end in the Derby, as if it was run a match.\\" Gustavus was ridden by Sam Day and Reginald's jockey was Francis Buckle. Buckle's \\"nerve rather went\\" while Day \\"kept close to his girths,\\" allowing Gustavus to overtake Reginald in the final stretch to win the race by half a length. Reginald finished second and the colt Sir Huldibrand third. Day described the finish graphically: \\"We wound in and out, for all the world like a dog at a fair.\\" Gustavus was the first grey horse to win the Derby and one of only four grey horses to win the event. Hunter reportedly won \\"a very considerable sum\\" by betting on Gustavus in the Derby, while two brothers reportedly \\"lost twenty- six thousand pounds\\" between them but \\"handsomely paid the debt\\" when it was due. The 1821 Derby was portrayed in a painting (right) by French artist Théodore Géricault. The depicted, dramatized scene occurred shortly before the race finish, with Gustavus in third place following closely behind the frontrunner Reginald. Gustavus was unplaced in the St. Leger Stakes run on 17 September at Doncaster, which was won by the colt Jack Spiggot. A few days later, Gustavus finished second to the filly My Lady in the 1000-guinea Gascoigne Stakes run over the St. Leger course. The third runner and the betting favorite in the race, a colt named Sandbeck, was disqualified after running into a post and falling. At the Houghton meeting on 29 October, Gustavus won a mile-long, 150-guinea match race against Mr. Fox's horse Pancha, and a few days later, Gustavus won 200 guineas after beating Lord Exeter's unnamed colt sired by Androssan in a match race. =1822: four-year- old season= At Newmarket-Craven meeting in April, Gustavus won the 1600-guinea Claret Stakes, beating the Duke of Grafton's colt Carbonaro. A few weeks later at the First Spring Meeting, Gustavus finished third in a 100-guinea sweepstakes race to the colts Godolphin and Centaur. Gustavus was beaten in a 6 May match race at Newmarket by Lord Foley's horse Sultan. At the First October Meeting at Newmarket on 30 September, Gustavus finished second to the Duke of Grafton's colt Guerilla in the Trial Stakes. Guerilla won the race by half a length and was an unanticipated winner, with one commenter in the Sporting Magazine stating, \\"The Trial Stakes, which should have set every body right, set every body wrong.\\" Later the same day, Gustavus beat Lord Egremont's colt Black-and-all-Black in a match race. At the Second October Meeting on 14 October, Gustavus was second in the 50-guinea Post Sweepstakes to the filly Augusta (the winner of the 1821 Epsom Oaks). Two days later in the final start of his racing career, Gustavus was unplaced in the first class of the Oatlands Stakes, the race being won by the filly Whizgig. Gustavus was retired to stud at the end of the racing season. Stud career Gustavus was retired to stud in 1823, first standing near Newmarket at the Six-mile Cottage for a fee of eight sovereigns per mare. His fee was increased to 10 guineas for the 1824 breeding season. Gustavus was exported to Prussia in March 1836 at the age of 18 years. Gustavus stood at Baron Maltzahn's stud farm in Kummerow, where Bloomsbury later stood beginning in 1842. Gustavus died in 1840. Gustavus was not a successful sire, with the colt Forester (a July and Newmarket Stakes winner) and the filly Chantilly being his only progeny of note. Pedigree * Gustavus was inbred 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 to Herod and 4 × 4 to Eclipse meaning that these horses appear four times and twice, respectively, in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

A referendum in 1997 in Tikhvin opposed the establishment of the plant; after acquisition by the ICT Group in 2001 of the unfinished project the company announced its intention to complete construction of the plant. Tikhvin Ferroalloy Plant began production in 2007. In April 2008 the plant's owner, Oriel Resources, was acquired by Mechel. A low world demand for ferrochromium delayed the factory's ramp up to full production with two furnaces started in 2007, and two in 2008, the company began production from concentrated chrome ore from the Mechel held Voskhod chrome processing plant (ГОКа \\"Восход-Хром\\".) in Kazakhstan in early 2009.

In 2010 it employed 720 people. The opening of the plant in contravention of the local populace's wishes remains contentious, and has been seen as an example of government colluding with big business.

The company creates text based artwork, entirely drawn by hand, also known as Micrography. By using entire movie scripts, complete song lyrics and manuscripts, Los Angeles Pop Art creates images out of the text that tell the story of that specific image. The portfolio of designs are used for the manufacture of a number of products, which include wall art, apparel, tote bags and aprons. These products are sold online in numerous stores as well as in traditional brick and mortar retailers. The portfolio is also licensed out to partner companies for the manufacture of a wide range of products that include everything from stickers to beach towels.\\"Los Angeles Pop Art\\" In 1994 founder Joseph Leibovic was living in Israel when he stumbled upon the Micrography style of art while watching street artists, in the mystical town of Tzvat. The idea of Americanizing this style of art, by creating posters of classic films out of entire scripts, and music icons out of their legendary lyrics, was matured over the following 9 years. It wasn’t until Joseph moved back to Los Angeles, in 2004, that the idea was finally brought to life and Los Angeles Pop Art was founded. Los Angeles Pop Art has worked with some of the biggest names in music and film creating pieces for The Bob Marley Estate, Godfather, Rocky, Nirvana and many more A+ properties. The work developed at Los Angeles Pop Art has been featured in top magazines such as Playboy, Rolling Stone, Maxim and Stuff, as well as in top rated TV and films like Breaking Bad, Weeds, The Sopranos, The Girls Next Door, Workaholics and Battle: Los Angeles.Stuff, December 2005\\"List of 100 ways to Rock the Holidays\\", Maxim, December 2006.http://www.powells.com/biblio?show=TRADE%20PAPER:USED:9780312330590:7.95&page;=excerpthttp://www.popartportfolio.com/maxim Some of Los Angeles Pop Art’s original art is also included in major art collections and exhibits, such as The Ronald Reagan Presidential Art CollectionHarrison, Donald. \\"Nostalgia: key ingredient at Reagan library\\", San Diego Jewish World, Volume 1 Number 234, 28 December 2007.

A Ronald Reagan design, recreating President Ronald Reagan’s face out of his famous \\"Tear down this wall!\\" speech, given at the Brandenburg Gate in Germany, was created by Los Angeles Pop Art in 2005. This piece of art was accepted by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library into the Official Presidential Art Collection. The artwork is currently on display in the Lobby of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. A partnership with Vivendi Games, in 2006, regarding the release of Scarface: The World Is Yours video game, led Los Angeles Pop Art to create an exclusive poster to be used as a pre-order gift by Vivendi Games, in order to assist in the pre-ordering of the game.

The game was developed by RedLynx and published by Microsoft Studios. It is a follow up to Trials HD of 2009 and successor to several preceding Trials games by the same developers. The Xbox 360 version was released via Xbox Live Arcade on April 18, 2012. In 2013 it was released for Windows as Trials Evolution: Gold Edition, including a bundled copy of Trials HD. On all game platforms Trials Evolution includes a course editor to allow users to create their own scenarios. Gameplay In Trials Evolution the player controls a rider trying to traverse an obstacle course on a bike heavily influenced by physics. In Trials Evolution, the player controls a rider on a physics-based motorcycle from the start of the level to the end while navigating a number of obstacles. The objective is to complete the course as fast as possible and with as few crashes, known in the game as faults, as possible. The game uses 3D graphics, but is played on a 2D plane, so the rider can only move forwards and backwards. Players can also control the bike's pitch on the ground or while in the air. Evolution allows up to four players to compete simultaneously on the same console or over Xbox LIVE. Specialized tracks allow for four players to ride alongside one another, similar to Nintendo's Excitebike, while in others players complete in-line, with a player's friends appearing as ghost bikes on the course. As players progress through the single player portion of the game they will earn money that can be used to customize their rider and motorcycle's appearance. Another new addition to the gameplay is the line of movement can now curve, the controls will remain the same but the map and driving line can swerve to make for more creative and challenging maps. 50 single player tracks are included with the game. Players are able to track several statistics such as medals earned, money earned, and other stats. These can then be compared with their Xbox Live friends. Leaderboards are also included. =Editor= Players can also design and share their own maps utilizing the in-game editor. As with its predecessor, Trials HD, players are given the same editor that the developer used to create the game's levels. This time players are given two variants of the editor. The Lite Editor is similar to Trials HD s in that players can create courses in a user-friendly manner. The game's Pro Editor provides full access to content creation; players can use not only the features of the Lite Editor, but can also use the game's visual programming language to create entirely different scenarios. Demonstrations of the Pro Editor showcased scenarios similar to popular games such as Angry Birds, 'Splosion Man, Marble Blast Ultra, Xevious and others. Additionally a first-person shooter and top- down perspective racing game were demonstrated. Weather and lighting conditions can be changed to allow for nighttime, dusk, foggy and other atmospheric settings. Tracks can now be shared via an in-game interface. With Evolutions predecessor tracks could only be shared via those on a player's friends list, however players will now be able to browse through multiple categories such as Most Popular tracks and can also create a custom search. Over 1,500 objects are available to players to create their custom scenarios. Leaderboards will also be tracked for user-created environments. In Trials HD gameplay was restricted to a warehouse setting. In Evolution the setting is a two-by-four kilometer outdoor environment. While the game is set outdoors, players will be able to re-create warehouse-based courses if they desire. Jason Bates, Director of Marketing and PR at RedLynx stated that \\"we (RedLynx) expect people to recreate some of the classic levels\\". Development and marketing With the game's predecessor, Trials HD, players expressed concerns with the rate at which the difficulty curve climbed. Developer RedLynx addressed this concern in Trials Evolution by placing tutorial levels in each of the game's difficulty tiers. Players are required to earn a certain number of medals before they can progress forward, ensuring that they will have the necessary skills to meet the challenge of future levels. The game engine was upgraded from the version used in Trials HD. Draw distance was increased, allowing for roughly 500 meters of visible area at any time. The game runs at a locked 60 frames per second. In Trials HD all in-game assets were loaded into system RAM at startup, but in Evolution designers chose to stream all content. This allowed for a much larger gameplay world, higher resolution textures, and more objects to be used in-game. A new visual scripting system was also implemented. This allowed both RedLynx and community to create entirely new skill games; in Trials HD the skill game code was part of the game's core. As with its predecessor, Trials Evolution uses an optimized version of the Bullet Physics Library to handle the game's physics. RedLynx's Sebastian Aaltonen stated that feedback from players and Trials HDs high sales allowed RedLynx to make the game they had aimed to create. The soundtrack was penned by Mike Reagan, who had previously worked on the God of War series. The voice work for the game was done by three Pennsylvanian voice actors: Art Webb, Rake Yohn and Brandon DiCamillo of Jackass fame. Trials Evolution was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2011. It was shown to the press and public at Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) Prime 2011 and Gamescom 2011. It was also shown at Game Developer's Conference (GDC) 2012 as well as to public at PAX East 2012. In March 2012, Microsoft announced that Xbox Live Arcade titles would soon have double the gamerscore, a new total of 400 points. Microsoft created a promotion known as Arcade Next to further publicize this change which would run from April 18, 2012 to May 9, 2012. Trials Evolution was selected to be the first release with a date of April 18, 2012 and was joined by Bloodforge, Fable Heroes and Minecraft in the promotion. Reception Trials Evolution received universal acclaim from critics. It holds an aggregate score of 91.58% at GameRankings, and fellow aggregate website Metacritic reports a score of 90/100. The game received five perfect scores: Joystiq's Ben Gilbert, Digital Spy's Liam Martin, Brad Shoemaker of Giant Bomb, Gameblog.fr's reviewer as well as Gamereactor Sweden's Jonas Elfving. The lowest score of an 80% approval rating came from three reviewers: Neil Davey of Guardian.co.uk, Ryan Rigney of Wired magazine, and a staff member from Official Xbox Magazine UK. The game sold an estimated 100,000 units in its first day. It was the highest selling day-one release on Xbox Live Arcade until the release of Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition three weeks later. Ryan McCaffrey of Official Xbox Magazine praised the game's overall appeal. He cited the game's visuals, core gameplay, multiplayer, track editor and replay factor all as high points. He stated that \\"Trials Evolution is as close to a perfect download as we’re ever likely to get.\\" He did note, however that the game's soundtrack may not appeal to all players, a statement to which Game Informers Dan Ryckert and IGN's Daemon Hatfield agreed. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer cited the fact that all the game's levels were created using the same editor currently in the game, a point to which he gave high marks. The reviewer from Official Xbox Magazine UK praised the inclusion of multiplayer, improved visuals and a better sense of progression. The reviewer cited the fact that license tests must be passed to unlock additional tracks helped player progression. The critic from Edge magazine called Trials Evolution \\"the deepest online experience in XBLA history.\\" The reviewer stated that it built upon the footing of its predecessor, Trials HD, citing the evolution in gameplay similar to Dark Soulss evolution of Demon's Souls. The critic felt that the new skill games weren't imaginative enough, but conceded that the editing tools are powerful enough to create more robust games.

On 30 December 1803, the King of Norway named Peder Olivarius Bugge the \\"Bishop of Trondheim and Romsdal\\" and also named Mathias Bonsach Krogh the \\"Bishop of Nordland and Finnmark\\", thus essentially splitting the diocese into two (but legally it was one diocese with two bishops). The new Bishop Krogh made Alstahaug Church the seat of his bishopric in the north, while Bishop Bugge stayed in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral. The new diocese in the north was formally established on 14 June 1844 as Tromsø stift and it was to be seated in the city of Tromsø. Work on a new cathedral was begun soon after. The new Tromsø Cathedral was completed in 1864. The name of the diocese was changed to Hålogaland bispedømme in 1918. In 1952, the Diocese of Hålogaland was split into two: the Diocese of Sør-Hålogaland (which covered Nordland county) and the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland (which included Troms and Finnmark county and Svalbard).

Origin The group has its origins in the ensemble brought together for the musical play Veronika, der Lenz ist da - Die Comedian Harmonists (Veronica, Spring Has Come - The Comedian Harmonists), which had its premiere on 19 December 1997 at the Komödie am Kurfürstendamm on the Kurfürstendamm in Berlin. This followed the screening of a film, Comedian Harmonists (1997), which like the musical was about a Berlin group, the \\"Comedian Harmonists\\", which flourished between 1927 and 1934, when it came to an end due to the rise of the National Socialists to power and their anti-Jewish measures. Most of the group's songs had been written by Jewish composers, and the group also had Jewish members who were prevented from performing. Following the success of the play which brought them together, the singers were several times asked to give gala performances and concerts outside the context of the original production, and a new musical group thus came into being.Guests for March 3, 2001 (Berlin) at prairiehome.publicradio.org, accessed 4 February 2012 The founding members were Olaf Drauschke and Guenter Barton (first and second baritones), Holger Off and Marco Woytowicz (first and second tenors), Tilmann F. Rönnebeck (bass), and Horst Maria Merz (pianist). History After the closing of Veronika, the Berlin Comedian Harmonists soon found themselves singing around Germany and abroad, with appearances in Australia, the United States, Latin America, Spain, Italy, France, and Switzerland. The group's repertory includes the well-known songs of the original pre-Second World War Comedian Harmonists, as well as other hit songs, their own arrangements, and original compositions including \\"Sabine\\", \\"Hummerschwanz\\" ('Lobster Tail'), and \\"Se Dici di Lasciarmi\\". The operetta Frau Luna was rewritten for the ensemble by Paul Lincke under the title of Die Comedian Harmonists besuchen Frau Luna ('The Comedian Harmonists Visit Frau Luna'), and this had its opening night at the Municipal Theatre, Hamelin, on 22 March 2006. The Berlin Comedian Harmonists have appeared at concerts of André Rieu. They sing four songs on his DVD album I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg (2009): Veronika der Lenz ist Da, Irgendwo auf der Welt, Die Liebe der Matrosen, and with Carla Maffioletti and Mirusia Louwerse Adieu, Mein Kleiner Gardeoffizier.Andre Rieu - I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg at skyarts.co.uk Over the years since 1997 the membership of the ensemble has changed, with Ralf Steinhagen replacing Marco Woytowicz as second tenor, Philipp Seibert taking over from Günter Barton as second baritone, and first Rolf Randolph and later Wolfgang Höltzel taking the place of Tilmann F. Rönnebeck as bass.Deutsches Bühnen-Jahrbuch (F. A.

He was a co-editor of the Burlington Magazine, but is perhaps best known for having been a friend and member of the inner circle of Oscar Wilde from the early 1890s until Wilde's death in 1900. As a defender of Wilde during his trial and imprisonment, Adey visited the fallen author in Reading Gaol, attempted to negotiate on behalf of the gaoled writer's interests as his de facto guardian, and oversaw a collection that was used to purchase necessities of life, including clothes, for him upon his release. Adey was also a partner of Lord Alfred Douglas in 1895, and a close friend of the poet from the 1890s until 1913. Douglas's biographer, Rupert Croft-Cooke, refers to Adey as \\"a homosexual of what, among his fellows, was and is, called the 'discreet' kind.\\" Adey also developed a professional relationship and 15-year life partnership with Wilde's other good friend, Robbie Ross. When Douglas and Ross faced each other in court in 1913 in the Arthur Ransome libel case, Adey testified in Ross's favor, which caused Douglas to sever his ties with his former friend. Adey became assistant editor of the Burlington Magazine in November 1910, and served as co-editor, in partnership with Roger Fry, from January 1914 until May 1919. Adey can thus be seen as a point of connection between the aesthetes of the London 1890s and the Bloomsbury circle that came to prominence a generation later. He is credited with over thirty bylined articles in the magazine, as well as numerous unsigned notes and reviews, and is credited with bringing a strong iconographic appreciation to the magazine. Ross's death in October 1918 was a blow to Adey, who wrote in a letter to a mutual friend five days after the bereavement that \\"no one can ever be to me what he has been\\". Ross made his former partner the principal beneficiary of his will, but at an unknown point in the 1920s Adey was overcome by mental challenges and had to be confined in a place of long-term care. Adey died under care in 1942; in a brief tribute to \\"Burlington Magazine's\\" early co-editor, Barbara Pezzini described him in May 2010 as follows: \\"More Adey has often been described as a shy and diffident man and his tragic death in a mental health institution in 1942, after having lost contact with even his closest friends, seemed to taint retrospectively his whole life.\\" References Category:1858 births Category:1942 deaths Category:English magazine editors Category:LGBT writers from England Category:Oscar Wilde Category:LGBT poets Category:Gay writers ","title":"More Adey"},{"id":"34596984","text":"James Peter Speid Jamieson (9 February 1880 - 18 January 1963) was a New Zealand doctor and political lobbyist.

It was known as the venue for the Yosemite Firefall spectacle. The hotel opened in 1918, and was taken over by the Yosemite Park & Curry Company in 1924. The building was severely damaged by snowfall in winter 1968-69, and was still empty when it was destroyed in a fire in July 1969. History Built 3,274 feet above the valley floor, the Glacier Point Hotel opened in 1918 and provided magnificent views of Half Dome and Yosemite Valley. Both housing units were constructed from 1916 to 1917 by The Desmond Park Service Company and Gutleben Brothers contracting firm. In 1924, the hotel's ownership was transferred to the Yosemite Park & Curry Company as it had proved a large financial burden for its previous owners. The hotel consisted of two housing units with a combined total of 80 available rooms. A dining room, lounge area, and other facilities were located within the main complex. Also situated within the back of this building was the well- known viewing porch. Here, visitors would often spend several hours reclining and admiring the landscape. Next to the hotel was James McCauley's old Mountain House. In the years following the opening of the hotel, the Mountain House was used for employee housing and put into service as a public cafeteria. Although the Glacier Point Hotel was in an excellent location, it still struggled as a business. High room costs would continually leave several rooms vacant, but this would slowly change as the hotel gained favor with the increasing numbers of tourists. Water was always a problem at Glacier Point. Some summers the hotel was closed in August due to insufficient water. Winter was always a tough time for the establishment. Snow was very frequent in the area, and due to the light construction of the buildings, maintenance workers were often needed to live within the hotel, their primary job to keep snow off the roofs so they would not collapse under the weight. For many years, the guests of the Glacier Point Hotel would witness and participate in the Yosemite Firefall. What was once a summer event would gradually become daily routine. At 9:00 every night, hotel employees would push burning embers off Glacier Point to fall 3,000 feet down and mark the end of a performance at Camp Curry on the valley floor. As the coals fell in a set pattern, the resulting shower would closely resemble a burning waterfall. This tradition would continue on and off from 1872 until the last firefall on Thursday, January 25, 1968. = Calamities = During the winter of 1968 and 1969, the hotel, along with the McCauley Mountain House, were severely damaged by snowfall. Repairs were later needed and applied to the structures. In the meantime, no guest reservations were booked, and the employees used the Mountain House to sell snacks to Glacier Point visitors. On July 9, 1969, an electrical fire started on the bottom floor of the unoccupied hotel. Within minutes, the Glacier Point Hotel, along with the Mountain House and several trees, was destroyed. A nearby stockpile of Red Fir left over from the firefall helped feed the flames. After the incident, visitors were kept away from Glacier Point as demolition crews removed the remaining debris. YPCC considered rebuilding a hotel at Glacier Point, but the Park Service would not permit rebuilding at the same location; it would have to be placed further back from the precipice. = Aftermath = The next summer the Yosemite Park and Curry Company built a small snack shop to serve daytime visitors to Glacier Point. In later years, a granite amphitheater was built on the site of the hotel, and a new visitor center was completed nearby. These changes were part of a 1996-1997 modernization effort to transform the heavily traveled path. Even so, some evidence of the Glacier Point Hotel, such as some of the old foundations, are still evident. The iconic boulder behind the hotel has also remained in its original position.

He was the inaugural head of what is now Lincoln University. Early life Ivey was born in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia on 26 August 1838. He was the son of William Edward Ivey, a clerk and landowner, and Elizabeth Ivey (née Davis). He received his education in England and attended the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester. He managed a farm in England for a while before he came to New Zealand in 1867, where he took up land. Because of the ongoing New Zealand Wars, he almost immediately moved on to Australia. He spent four years at the Department of Agriculture in Victoria as a chemist before he became superintendent in charge of experimental fields. He gained a high standing as a chemist and became a fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, and a fellow of the Chemical Society. On 20 September 1873, Ivey married Sophia Minna Palmer (1845–1914) at Sydney. She was the granddaughter of George Thomas Palmer, after whom Palmerston in Canberra is named. They were to have two children. Life in New Zealand Ivey Hall in July 2011 Ivey was one of two Melbourne applicants for a position as director of a new school of agriculture, attached to Canterbury College. Samuel Dening Glyde, who had previously lived in Canterbury, but was now resident in Adelaide, travelled to Melbourne and interviewed both applicants. Both men were qualified, and the other applicant had \\"greater scientific attainment\\", but Glyde recommended Ivey for the position, who was appointed on 28 March 1878. Ivey and his wife arrived at Lincoln in April 1878; his starting salary was NZ£600. They lived in a small cottage while the main college building was under construction, which had a residential quarter for them. Ivey set to work, and he was fully aware of the pioneering role that he held. The school that became popularly known as Lincoln College was the first agricultural school in the Southern Hemisphere, and the third in the Commonwealth. He placed a focus on scientific education and was not interested in turning out agricultural labourers. His students were much more interested in learning practical skills, but Ivey gained their admiration and respect. The job was too much for a single person, though, and Ivey was overworked. His health suffered, and on 13 April 1892, he collapsed in the college's driveway and died. He was buried in Springston Cemetery; he was survived by his wife and his two children. In 1954, the main college building was renamed Ivey Hall in commemoration of the organisation's first director. On 1 September 1983, the building was registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category I heritage structure.

Her father Thomas Smith died in a shipping accident when she was six months old, and her mother Margaret (née Sproule) later remarried.  Education  Irvine-Smith attended Wellington Girls' College from 1892, and in 1897 began teaching at a private school in Thorndon. She continued her secondary school education however and completed her studies in 1898. In 1901 she entered Victoria University College, continuing to also teach in schools in Hawkes Bay and Taranaki, until finally graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1908. While a student, she was active in student clubs, and was co-founder and co-editor of the student magazine The Spike. She both wrote and drew sketches for the magazine for a number of years. In 1920 Irvine-Smith returned to Victoria and completed a Master of Arts degree in History.  Career  After completing her master's degree, Irvine-Smith moved from secondary school teaching to a lecturing position at Wellington Teachers College. She lectured in New Zealand history and Māori culture, subjects rarely taught in New Zealand institutions at the time. Irvine-Smith was also president of the Teachers' College dramatic society and encouraged many students to become involved in acting, both at the college and in Wellington's repertory theatres. After retiring from lecturing in 1932, Irvine-Smith began researching Wellington's history, writing a book The Streets of My City, in which she examined the city's development through the names of its streets and the people who lived there. The book was published just after Irvine-Smith died in 1948, and the first edition sold out in two weeks. The book is still used as a resource on Wellington history to this day. In 1947, Irvine-Smith successfully organised a petition to the Wellington City Council for a library to be established in the suburb of Khandallah.  Legacy  The Khandallah Library has a F.L. Irvine-Smith Memorial Collection, a collection of New Zealand works purchased with funds from the royalties of Irvine-Smith's book.

Born in Mosgiel, Inglis volunteered for service in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force during the First World War. He served on the Western Front and won the Military Cross for his actions during the Battle of Flers-Courcelette. He ended the war as a company commander and returned to New Zealand in 1919. In civilian life, he was a solicitor and barrister in Timaru but also served in the Territorial Force. He volunteered for service during the Second World War and commanded the 4th Infantry Brigade in the campaigns in Crete and North Africa. He had two periods in command of the 2nd New Zealand Division. After the war, he was appointed to a military court of the Allied Control Commission, which administered occupied Germany. He later served as chief judge of the Allied Control Commission's Supreme Court from 1947 to 1950. Early life Inglis was born in Mosgiel, Otago, New Zealand on 16 May 1894 to a banker and his wife. After completing his education at Waitaki Boys' High School in Oamaru, he commenced legal studies at the University of Otago in 1913. Military career In late April 1915, Inglis volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF). He had some military experience, having served as an officer in the Territorial Force with the 2nd (South Canterbury) Regiment. Posted to the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, he served in Egypt and on the Western Front. As a company commander in his battalion, he participated in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette during the Somme Offensive in September 1916. He was awarded the Military Cross for his part in the battle, after which he was the only surviving officer from his section of the front line. Inglis later transferred to the New Zealand Machine Gun Corps, in which he commanded a company for the remainder of the war. Present at the capture of Le Quesnoy in late 1918, he was discharged from the NZEF in April 1919 and returned to New Zealand. Interwar period Inglis resumed his legal studies, completing them in 1920. He also became married to his fiancée, Agnes, and the couple had two children. Now a solicitor, he moved his young family to Timaru and established a legal practice there. He remained involved with the Territorial Force, and in 1926 was commander of 1st Battalion, Canterbury Regiment, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Promoted to colonel in 1931, he commanded 3rd New Zealand Infantry Brigade before retiring from the Territorial Force in 1936. As a long serving member of the territorials, he was awarded the Efficiency Decoration. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Second World War Inglis enlisted in the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) following the outbreak of the Second World War. He needed to have treatment on his thyroid before he could go on active service. He commanded the 27th Machine-Gun Battalion, part of the first echelon of the 2NZEF which had been shipped to Egypt, from December 1939 to August 1940. In early 1941, Inglis was promoted to brigadier and given command of the 9th Infantry Brigade, composed largely of training battalions. =Crete= Having missed the Battle of Greece, Inglis was appointed commander of the 4th Infantry Brigade of 2nd New Zealand Division in May 1941. During the Battle of Crete, his brigade served as the reserve for the Allied forces, codenamed Creforce and commanded by Major General Bernard Freyberg, on Crete. The battle ended in the evacuation of Creforce to Egypt. Freyberg selected Inglis to travel to the War Office in London and provide a report on the battle. When he met with Winston Churchill the month after the evacuation from Crete, Inglis was critical of Freyberg's conduct of the battle and made a number of inaccurate and misleading statements. However, Inglis' own conduct in the battle had not been exemplary. At one stage, he disobeyed an order to take over a newly created reserve and remained at divisional headquarters, possibly with hopes of taking over command of the division. =North Africa= Despite this show of disloyalty to his commander, Inglis remained in command of 4th Brigade through much of the North African Campaign. He led his brigade in the capture of Belhamed, a hill adjacent to Sidi Rezegh, which resulted in the opening of a corridor to Tobruk during Operation Crusader, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Frederick Jones, Defence Minister of New Zealand, with Inglis in front of a Sherman tank during a visit to Maadi, 6 April 1943 After being reformed during the early part of 1942, 4th Brigade spent time in Syria with most of the 2nd New Zealand Division. In June, the New Zealanders were rushed back to Egypt after the Panzer Army Afrika attacked Gazala, near Tobruk, to begin an advance into Egypt in pursuit of the retreating Eighth Army. The division made a stand at Minqar Qaim and was surrounded by German forces on 27 June. As the Germans probed the perimeter of the New Zealand positions, Freyberg was wounded. Inglis assumed temporary command of the division and successfully led it in an outbreak from Minqar Qaim that night. He would remain as divisional commander for the next two months as Freyberg recovered, and was later awarded a bar to his DSO which acknowledged his leadership of the division during this period. However, during this time Inglis' relationship with his brigade commanders, particularly Brigadier Howard Kippenberger deteriorated. Kippenberger had become highly rated as a field commander during the war and Inglis may have become resentful. This was uncomfortable for Kippenberger, who had served under Inglis in the Territorial Force and considered him a mentor in the art of warfare. This was further exacerbated on 30 June when Inglis went to Cairo without informing his staff who, in his absence, subsequently asked Kippenberger to take temporary command of the division. Inglis returned on 1 July having become lost when returning from Cairo. Prior to the First Battle of Ruweisat Ridge, which commenced on 14–15 July, Inglis failed to adjust his artillery support following concerns raised by Kippenberger and Jim Burrows, the commanders of the brigades involved in the planned advance on the defended ridge. Instead, he chose to rely on assurances from his corps commander, Lieutenant General William Gott, that British armour would provide any necessary assistance. This proved to be a mistake; although the brigades manage to seize the ridge, they were unable to hold it in the face of stronger than expected counterattacks, and the expected armour support never fully eventuated. Afterwards, while Inglis was critical of the conduct of the brigades and laid primary blame for the failure on them and the lack of armour, he overlooked the influence of his own role as divisional commander on the outcome of the battle. An attack mounted a few days later by 6th Brigade was a further failure and highlighted Inglis' failings as a divisional commander by not ensuring adequate support from his corps commander. In September 1942, Inglis reverted to command of 4th Brigade, and it was decided that the brigade would be converted to an armoured formation. As an infantry brigade, it had suffered heavy losses at Ruweisat Ridge. Inglis oversaw 4th Brigade's transition to armour, a process which took a nearly a year. He was again acting divisional commander from June to July 1943 when Freyberg was occupied elsewhere. Afflicted with dysentery, Inglis was repatriated to New Zealand in November 1943 for treatment. =Italy= Inglis returned to 4th Brigade, now in Italy, in March 1944. For much of the Italian Campaign the brigade did not participate in large-scale operations; instead, his armoured regiments were deployed piecemeal in support of infantry operations. In the absence of Inglis while he recovered from his illness the previous three months, Kippenberger had become the preferred acting divisional commander. Kippenberger, commanding the division while Freyberg commanded the New Zealand Corps, was wounded shortly after Inglis arrived in Italy. Command of the division passed to another brigade commander, despite Inglis' seniority. Again overlooked as temporary divisional commander in September, Inglis requested to be relieved of his command and he was promptly sent home to New Zealand. For his wartime services, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Later life After the end of the war in Europe, Inglis was one of New Zealand's delegates for the Allied Control Commission for Germany, which administered the now occupied country. He was appointed president of a military court in the British-controlled area of Germany dealing with crimes committed by the occupying forces. After six months in this role, in February 1947 he was promoted to major general and made chief judge of the Allied Control Commission's Supreme Court. The following year he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. In 1950, Inglis ended his appointment as chief judge and returned to New Zealand. He became a magistrate in Hamilton in 1953, and retired in 1965. He died in Hamilton the following year. His collection of military history books was donated to the Kippenberger Research Library in the QEII Army Memorial Museum at Waiouru.

He co-wrote the 1999 film Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo with Rob Schneider and the 2002 film The Master of Disguise with Dana Carvey. In 2007, Goldberg wrote and directed the film Numb, inspired by his own experiences battling a dissociative disorder.  Early life  Goldberg was born in Hamilton, Ontario. He studied at McMaster University and received a B.A. degree in English. While attending McMaster, Goldberg started to write, create films, and host and perform radio shows, stand-up comedy at clubs around Toronto, and play in his rock band called Oliver Twist. A Clash-like foursome known for their on-stage personal tension, during one memorable New Year's Eve gig, at the reputedly mob-owned Jockey Club, Goldberg smashed his entire drum kit and broke his arm. Goldberg's first passion was tennis. He reached a Canadian National Junior Tennis ranking of number two. After taking a year off to pursue the Satellite tennis circuit, he came to the conclusion that tennis would not be his life's work. Goldberg was frequently quoted as saying that, \\"he had strokes, but not the head.\\"  Film career  Goldberg returned to writing. His older brother, Daniel Goldberg, had attained success writing and producing films, including Stripes and Meatballs, both starring Bill Murray. Goldberg moved to Los Angeles, where he sold his first screenplay within a week. He signed with the William Morris Agency, and soon secured his first job writing for Matty Simmons, owner of National Lampoon and producer of Animal House. A multi-picture deal at Disney followed, including: I'll Be Home for Christmas starring Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Jessica Biel; a sequel to The Mighty Ducks; and the award-winning Hallmark film, A Step Toward Tomorrow, a story about two young brothers, one bound to a wheelchair after an accident. Premiering to rave reviews during CBS Sweeps Week in the winter of 1996, the film was also noted for a touching and memorable performance by Christopher Reeve, in his first acting role after his tragic horseback riding accident. In 2003, Goldberg directed the short film, Where's Angelo?, a Get Shorty-style production, which starred Robert Forster, Michael Madsen, Beverly D'Angelo, and Wolfgang Bodison and was honored at the Hollywood Film Festival. =Deuce Bigalow= Goldberg became friends with SNL alum Rob Schneider, and together they gave a series of stand-up comedy performances, including co-hosting the Montreal Comedy Festival and a memorable appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, where the duo performed as the satirical Blue Man Ass Group. Goldberg subsequently accompanied Schneider to Chicago, where Schneider was to be master of ceremonies at a fundraiser for President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. An hour before the event, Goldberg was asked to fill in by Clinton himself, after the Secret Service expressed concerns that Schneider's public image - he was then starring in Men Behaving Badly - might reflect unfavorably on the President. Goldberg later described the experience as the most surreal of his life. Goldberg went on to write and co-produce Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo under Adam Sandler's Happy Madison shingle. Touchstone acquired the project after a bidding war with New Line. Modestly budgeted at $16.5 million, the film was a box office success, grossing $68 million domestically and over $100 million internationally. Goldberg next partnered with Dana Carvey, writing and co-producing The Master of Disguise for Sony Pictures, which grossed a profitable $40 million domestically. Without a Paddle followed, starring Seth Green, Matthew Lillard, Dax Sheppard and Burt Reynolds which grossed $58 million for Paramount Pictures. =Anxiety and Numb= Goldberg crossed over to television writing during this period, selling pilots to HBO, CBS, NBC, ABC, TNT and USA. It was during this time that Goldberg began suffering from depersonalization disorder, an anxiety and stress reaction he calls the most hideous and frightening time of his life. He would go on to say that he did not know if he would make it from one day to the next. After recovering, Goldberg wrote the screenplay Numb about the experience. Actor Matthew Perry attached himself to the project, and soon afterward Goldberg landed his feature film directorial debut with a cast that included Mary Steenburgen, Kevin Pollak, and Lynn Collins. The film won many festival awards, including Best Feature at Chicago's GenArt Film Festival and the Ojai International Film Festival. Goldberg has stated that the film was not only cathartic personally, but that it also proved helpful to many sufferers and drew attention to the disorder from the medical community. In May 2013, Goldberg started his second directorial effort on Alex & the List. Shooting was completed in Los Angeles, and Patrick Fugit stars with Jennifer Morrison, Karen Gillan, Aaron Staton, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Giles Martini, JoBeth Williams and Victoria Tennant. The film was released on May 4, 2018, by Gravitas Ventures. =Teaching= Between projects, Goldberg began teaching film at UCLA with an emphasis on the practicalities of surviving the business. He subsequently became a Professor of Film & Television at McMaster University in Ontario Canada. He also regularly contributes OP-EDS on personal experiences in the entertainment industry for The Hamilton Spectator, his hometown newspaper. =Upcoming= He will be writing and directing Quick Draw, announced in 2017, starring Academy Award winner Common.

Later that year Samuli Lehtonen found Hemidictyum to be a sister to Aspleniaceae, so Hemidictyum was placed in its own family, Hemidictyaceae. Christenhusz and Mark W.

In command of the 11th Battery from February 1918, he was recommended and awarded the Distinguished Service Order as well as a mention in despatches for his efforts in controlling artillery support during operations on the Somme and the Battle of Amiens. =Interwar period= Milford opted to undertake training in ordnance in England after the war, and also became married at this time. He held a number of ordnance related postings in both England and Australia, and attended the British Army Staff College at Camberley. He served for a time as chairman of the Resource Committee dedicated to \\"hardware, general stores and clothing\\" (there were seven such committees, each dedicated to a specific area of defence resources), which reported to the Defence Resources Board.Mellor, 1958, p. 28 At the time of the outbreak of the Second World War, he was director of artillery at Army headquarters in Melbourne, where he had been posted for four years. =Second World War= In March 1940, Milford was assigned to the newly formed 7th Division as commander of the division's artillery, one of a number of officers from the Staff Corps appointed to the division.Long, 1961, p. 83 He traveled to the Middle East in October but was destined to spend only a few weeks in his position before being recalled to Australia in January 1941 to take up the post of master-general of the ordnance. He was also promoted to temporary major general, the first Duntroon graduate to reach the rank of general. In his new appointment, he was tasked with co-ordination of private and government manufacturers and producers to provide logistic support for Australia's soldiers, both at home and overseas. He was also involved with a committee investigating the supply requirements of each of the services and the available resources,Butlin, 1955, p. 475 as well as the development of new weapons. When the Owen gun, an Australian designed and manufactured submachine gun, was brought to his attention, he initially favoured the use of the Sten, even though it proved to be less reliable than the Owen.Mellor, 1958, pp. 327–328 New Guinea campaign In 1942, Milford was commander of the 5th Division, then based in Queensland and intended for operations against the Japanese Empire. He landed with elements of his division at Milne Bay on the eastern tip of New Guinea on 14 January 1943 and began operations on nearby Goodenough Island. The island had recently been captured from the Japanese but only a small Australian garrison was present to guard against any attempt by the enemy to take it back. Dummy buildings and fortifications were built to give the Japanese the impression that the Australian presence on Goodenough was greater than it actually was, and may have deterred them from attempting to retake the island. By April the Japanese threat to Goodenough had receded and an air strip was under construction.McCarthy, 1959, pp. 588–589 In late August 1943, the 5th Division moved to the Morobe Province of New Guinea to replace the 3rd Division, which was then participating in the Salamaua–Lae campaign. Milford was tasked with continuing offensive operations against the Japanese around Salamaua to divert resources away from the nearby Japanese base in the town of Lae. Once the neighbouring 9th Division commenced their attack to capture Lae on 4 September by landing east of the town to begin an encircling movement, the 5th Division moved to take Salamaua, which eventually fell to the Australians on 11 September.Dexter, 1961, pp. 285–328 Salamaua was intended to become a large base for the Allied forces in the region, but when Lieutenant General Edmund Herring inspected the area immediately following its capture it was deemed not suitable. Instead, Herring directed Milford to establish the base at newly captured Lae. Milford supervised the construction of roads and supply depots of the \\"Lae Fortress\\" until 3 November, when he was made general staff officer of the New Guinea Force (NGF).Dexter, 1961, pp. 400–403 He would be recommended for an appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his leadership and service in Lae and with the NGF. Borneo campaign Milford (centre) inspecting Japanese strong point with the commander of the 25th Infantry Brigade, Brigadier Kenneth Eather (right), during Operation Oboe Two, 4 July 1945 In July 1944, he succeeded his friend (and fellow Duntroon classmate) Major General George Vasey as commander of the 7th Division. The division had been resting and refitting in Australia since its withdrawal in early 1944 from New Guinea following the Ramu Valley campaign, which had been conducted in the aftermath of the capture of Lae.Long, 1963, p. 504 In early 1945, planning was underway for Operation Oboe Two, an amphibious assault to capture Balikpapan, a seaport on Borneo. The 9th Division was originally designated for the operation, but in April it was decided to utilise the 7th Division instead, and it duly embarked from Cairns to Morotai, the staging post for the assault.Long, 1963, pp. 504–506 Operation Oboe Two would transpire to be the largest amphibious operation mounted by the Australian military.Long, 1963, p. 546 Despite opposition from the American naval commanders providing support for the operation, Milford decided to land his forces at Klandasan, a southern suburb of Balikpapan which although heavily defended, had suitable beaches for landing troops. By landing at Klandasan, Milford hoped to achieve tactical surprise and anticipated fire support from the United States Navy would help counter the coastal defences of the Japanese. The battle of Balikpapan began on 1 July with a naval barrage of the landing area, supported by bombers of the Royal Australian Air Force, with the division landing relatively unopposed by mid morning. By 1pm, the beachhead was secure and Milford, together with Generals Douglas MacArthur and Leslie Morshead made an inspection of the area.Long, 1963, pp. 511–520 At this late stage of the war it was clear that the war would soon end, and extensive use was made of divisional artillery (which Milford had raised during his earlier spell with the division in 1940) rather than needlessly risk soldiers' lives.Long, 1963, pp. 527–531 By 21 July, Balikpapan was secure and the Japanese were retreating into Borneo. Milford ordered a halt to further offensive action and instructed his outlying forces to hold their position,Long, 1963, p. 540 thus concluding a successful operation.Long, 1963, p. 546 The war was now rapidly drawing to a close and upon the surrender of the Japanese Empire in August, Milford was ordered to accept the surrender of the representative commander of the Japanese forces, which numbered around 8,500 troops, in Dutch-Borneo.Long, 1963, pp. 554–555 On 8 September, Milford observed the surrender of the Japanese military governor of the area, Vice Admiral Michiaki Kamada, in a ceremony held aboard HMAS Burdekin which was anchored off the coast of Dutch Borneo.Long, 1963, p. 566 Later life Milford remained the commander of the 7th Division, as well as the Morotai occupation force, until March 1946. He returned to Melbourne, replacing Major General John Chapman as Deputy Chief of General Staff on 11 March. An appointment as adjutant general followed in May. He retired on 23 April 1948 due to ill health but this was due to an incorrect diagnosis of prostate cancer. In 1946, he had been recommended for appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his leadership during Operation Oboe Two, and was duly presented with the Order in 1949. Milford died in Macleod, Melbourne on 10 June 1972, and was survived by his son (a 1944 graduate of the Royal Military College at Duntroon).

History  The fortress was built sometime between the years of 1807-1828, during the rule and with the assistance of Sardar Hosein Qoli Khan Qajar (Sardari Iravani), the last and best of the Persian Qajar governors of the Yerevan Khanate. It was constructed using stones taken from the ruins of the ancient city of Armavir, some of which still bear traces of Urartian cuneiform inscriptions. The fortress was used as an administrative center for the Sardarapat district and also as the summer residence of the Khan of Yerevan (Erevan). Sardari Berd was captured in 1828 by the Russians under General Ivan Paskevich during the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828), despite strong defense by Hasan Khan Sardari Iravani, brother to Sardar Hosein Qoli Khan. Speaking of Paskevich in a British War Office summary, the following passage reads: The region formally passed from Persian sovereignty to a Russian one after the Treaty of Turkmenchay in 1828. Armavir became the Serdarabad uyezd of the Armenian Oblast, which itself became the Erivan guberniya in 1840. This situation lasted until the February Revolution in 1917. Of the fortress almost nothing remains. Most of it was dismantled to build Soviet Armenia.

Now little more than the outline of a foundation, it occupied a site on the southern slope of Cockburn Law overlooking the Whiteadder Water.Laurence H. Cleat, \\"Castles of the Cockburns\\", History of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club, vol. 47, no. 2, 1997, pp. 152-159.Martin Coventry, The Castles of Scotland, 2nd ed., Goblinshead, Edinburgh, 1997, . The foundations of the Tower trace a roughly square outline measuring by , according to a survey conducted in 1980. The land surrounding Cockburn Tower belonged to the powerful Dunbar family in the early 15th century. In 1425 Sir David de Dunbar of Cockburn, brother of the ill-fated 11th and last Earl of Dunbar and March, bestowed this land to his daughter Marjorie/Margaret upon her marriage to Alexander Lindsay, 2nd Earl of Crawford. In about 1527, William Cockburn purchased the land from Alexander Lindsay, 4th Earl of Crawford. William Cockburn was the second son of Sir William Cockburn, Baron of Langton, who fell at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. From 1527 until 1698 Cockburn Tower was the seat of the Cockburns of that Ilk.It seems quite likely that members of the Cockburn family had occupied the land around Cockburn Law much earlier, likely as vassals of the Dunbars. Genetic evidence has shown that the Cockburns are descended from the same Anglo-Saxon clan as the Earls of Dunbar, and their predecessors, the 11th-century Earls of Northumbria. However, in 1696 the Tower and surrounding land were auctioned off to pay the debts of Sir James Cockburn of that Ilk, 1st Baronet. It seems that the Tower fell into disuse soon thereafter, and by 1820 it was already a roofless ruin, although significant portions of the walls remained standing. It seems likely that much of the stone of Cockburn Tower was used to build the farmhouse and outbuildings of nearby Cockburn Farm.

Painted in 1923 during Picasso's classical period, the painting depicts two statuesque men of mythological origins. Frequently acknowledged to be his cornerstone work during this era, the painting makes use of a large canvas and a classical color palette that are acutely reminiscent of the ancient world. The subjects which Picasso chooses to explore within this work– male Greek youth, musical pipes, as well as the Mediterranean setting– all hark back to classical ancient art.  Background  This work was painted at the crux of Picasso’s classical period from 1919 to 1929, in which he was greatly intrigued by classical art. At the time that he had painted The Pipes of Pan, Picasso was traveling extensively in Italy, and consequently drew inspiration for this painting in the Greco-Roman art he found there. His admiration for such is evident in the pensive and motionless way he portrays his subjects, as well as the tactile yet unembellished background. Additionally, the subjects themselves are Greek by nature– the pipes held by the figure on the right are a clear reference to the pipes of Pan, the personified Greek god of “life in the periphery”– who essentially functions as the embodiment of peripheral attitude (free-ranging, and lustful but frustrated) and pastoral life. The setting of the painting, too, is evidently Mediterranean by its sunny blue background.  Controversy  There has been known controversy in the past regarding the so-called “true nature” of the subject for this particular painting. At the era of this painting, Picasso, who was deep into his fascination with classical art, met Sara Murphy in 1921. She was a beautiful and wealthy American expatriate who became flirtatiously involved with Picasso, their relations leading all the way up to the conception of this painting. Infrared photographs of The Pipes of Pan taken in the 90s revealed an initial composition that included four total figures. Many art scholars believe that one figure was to be Venus, depicted as Sara, and that another figure was to be Mars, depicted as Picasso. However, a possible reason why this initial idea was scrapped was because Picasso’s infatuation came to a head– perhaps Sara rejected him, and so he erased her from the painting composition.

He was promoted to colonel of the regiment on September 2, 1861.Boatner, Mark Mayo, III. The Civil War Dictionary. New York: McKay, 1988. . First published New York, McKay, 1959. p. 930. In 1862, the regiment was stationed at points along the coasts of South Carolina and Georgia, including Tybee Island until the Confederates evacuated it and including Savannah. Wilson acted as a brigade commander during much of this time. Wilson became a brigade commander in Major General William H.T. Walker's division in June 1863. The division was variously assigned to the Department of the West in June 1863-July 1863; the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, July 1863-August 23, 1863; Acting Lieutenant General Daniel Harvey Hill's Corps, Army of Tennessee, August 25, 1863-September 1863; the Reserve Corps, Army of Tennessee, September 1863; Lieutenant General James Longstreet's Corps, Army of Tennessee, September 26, 1863-November 12, 1863; and Lieutenant General William J.

Wilson's brigade was attached to General Joseph E. Johnston's forces attempting to relieve the Siege of Vicksburg Mississippi in early 1863 and later in defending Jackson, Mississippi. After the fall of Vicksburg, Wilson's brigade went to Georgia where they were part of the reserve corps at the Battle of Chickamauga. Wilson's distinguished conduct at that battle in initiating a counterattack when Union Army troops had driven back Confederate cavalry under Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest early on the second day of the battle and in capturing several artillery pieces helped win the battle for the Confederates. That conduct resulted in recommendations that Wilson be promoted to the grade of brigadier general. Claudius C. Wilson was appointed brigadier general on November 16, 1863, but his promotion was not confirmed by the Confederate Senate and his commission had not been delivered to him before he died of \\"camp fever\\", now generally recognized as Typhus, on November 27, 1863 at Ringgold, Georgia.

It was constructed in 1967 (1346 in the Islamic calendar) by the Soviet Union and Afghanistan during the reign of Mohammed Zahir Shah prior to the Soviet–Afghan War. The dam provided irrigation water for more than 67,000 jeribs of land after completion. Currently only 2,000 jeribs of land is under cultivation. Maximum capacity of the reservoir is 259 million cubic meters of water, and the reservoir holds about 164 million gallons at present. The dam system contains an earth dam, intake, spillway, one main canal (which is divides into two branches (the 21.5-kilometer Right Canal with 6 sub-canals and the 30-kilometer Left Canal with 16 sub-canals) and administration buildings. The Sardeh Dam Reservoir is fed by the Jilga River which flows north–south from Paktika Province and Paktiya Province. The river is also labeled as the Gardez River north of the dam and the Sardeh River south of the dam (by the National Atlas of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, page 13-14). Context The dam is an indication of the presence of aid from the USSR in Afghanistan prior to the invasion and subsequent occupation from 1979 to 1989. According to C.J. Chivers of the New York Times: \\"Moscow built schools, roads, airports and dams, and sponsored ministries, too. Soviet officials recruited students and bureaucrats for all manner of training, and invited the country’s elite and its officer-, civil-service and intellectual classes to long periods of study in the Soviet Union. Education, development and modernization—like this dam, which still influences both flood control and irrigation downstream—played no small part in the Kremlin’s Afghan policy, which ultimately failed.\\"http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/reporters-notebook-in- afghanistan-glimpses-of-the-soviet-try/ The Band E Sardeh Dam was built during the same period as the High Dam in Aswan, Egypt, indicating a larger Soviet strategy for the development of third world nations it sought to bring under its sphere of influence. Large lettered Russian writing is still present on the down-stream face of the dam (visible from over 500 meters away) commemorating its completion in Russian and Pashto script. On the left it reads: \\"сарде 1967\\" and on the right: دسرده بند۱۳۴۶ Rehabilitation According to USAID's Ghazni Infrastructure Needs Assessment: September 14–18, 2003 The Deputy Governor and other provincial officials agreed that the top priority for irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation in Ghazni province is the Sardeh Band Dam. The Director of the dam, as well as the local farmers, is extremely disappointed in the progress of the donor community on the dam. The Director reported that 14 NGOs, both national and international, have been asked to conduct assessments on the dam and surveys for funding the rehabilitation of the dam. Of these 14 NGOs, only four have conducted the assessments, and none have received funding for work to date. The NGOs who have conducted assessments on the dam are: International Engineering Consultancy Company, ACLU, LERCC and ARA (local NGO). On 2 February 2010 members of Ghazni Provincial Reconstruction Team and Central Asia Development Group met with key leaders from Andar district to enlist support for a massive irrigation project concerning the repair of the irrigation canals fed by the Band E Sardeh Dam. \\"The Chardewal irrigation system was built to distribute water from the Bandee Sardi Dam throughout much of Andar, but due to neglect the canals have fallen into disrepair. Currently, water flows at only 50 percent capacity, limiting the ability of local farmers of the Kahnjoor farming zone to make a living. The reconstructed canal would be a one- kilometer cobblestone irrigation channel along the village with a curb separating the roadway from the canal. Chardewal, a village located in the middle of Andar, has suffered from drought and poor water management. With mentoring from the PRT, cooperation from the district sub-governor and village elders, the CADG will rebuild the village canal. It is the first stage of a long term cash-for-work program aimed at restoring the irrigation system and rehabilitating the Kahnjoor farming zone. Capacity building in this unstable district is considered the most critical mission for the development, reconstruction and stabilization efforts being made in Andar. 'Our problems are our water (supply) and our roads,' said Niaz Mohammad, an elder from Chardewal. 'We do not have enough water, wells or roads.' The project hopes to provide cash-for-work for deprived households in a Pashtun dominated area. The project could improve the agricultural potential for more than 2,000 people.\\" During the 7 August 2011 plenary session of the Meshrano Jirga (MJ) Senators invited the Emergency Response Committee to hear about their preparations for emergencies. When discussing current drought conditions, Alhaj Allah Dad (Ghazni Senator)said: \\"The Bandi Sardi dam is full of mud.

K. Lohithadas, starring Jayaram, Mukesh, Parvathy, Chithra, Murali, Innocent, Oduvil Unnikrishnan, Thilakan, Maniyan Pillai Raju and Suma Jayaram. Plot Rameshan (Jayaram) and Jose (Mukesh) are best friends coming from similar backgrounds. Both are educated well- groomed lads of more earthy parents. Rameshan's father Paramu Nair (Oduvil Unnikrishnan) is a tea shop owner while Jose's father Varkey (Thilakan) is a farmer. Both have sisters waiting to be married off, only being confined by the outrageous demands for dowry. Rameshan is also in love with Rema (Parvathi), daughter of a wealthy landlord Raman Vaidyar (Innocent), who is hell-bent on marrying off his daughter to a doctor. While local brokers try to fix up the ladies with suitable men by hook or crook, Rameshan and Jose grow increasingly anxious for jobs. Seeing the success achieved by the local brokers, they decide to get into the marriage broker business after convincing their parents that this would be a winning shot. However, their plan goes bust when the business flops driving them both to desperation again. Meanwhile, Rema gets married off to a doctor as Rameshan fails to find the courage to save her. Rameshan's sister also elopes with the local coconut picker Damodaran (Murali) after her father reluctantly arranges her marriage with Raman Vaidyar. Though initially enraged, Rameshan reconciles with his sister and Damodaran after realizing that his sister could not have found a better man. Damodaran advises Rameshan to get rid of his stigmas and join his father's tea shop. Both he and Jose join their fathers and are able to find better success than with any of their past ventures. Meanwhile, Varkey forms a plan to get Jose married off for a sum of dowry, with which he could marry off his daughter Rosaline (Chitra). They find suitable alliances and the marriage is fixed. However the happy occasion is clouded by the tragic news of Rema's death. Rema was deeply unhappy with her husband who constantly harassed her and her father for money, despite her father having paid a huge sum of dowry and almost neck up in debt. Rameshan is devastated and ridden by guilt that he could not save her from this terrible fate. Finally the day of the betrothal dawns and both Jose and Rosaline take their vows together. But the happiness is short-lived as Varkey discovers belatedly that the girl's family had not been able to gather the promised dowry. He is furious but even more fearful that this would severely affect Rosaline's marriage. On hearing that they would not receive the dowry promptly, Rosaline's betrothed and his family immediately break the betrothal. Varkey, mad with anger and grief commands Jose to break off with his betrothed too, which he gallantly refuses. Rameshan pleads desperately with the leaving parties as well as with the church priest and locals to stop and reconsider, as the cancellation of this marriage would devastate Rosaline. When no one offers support and hurl more abuses, Rameshan steps forward and asks Jose for Rosaline hand in marriage. Despite the difference in faith, Jose and his father are overjoyed at this. At the end Rameshan takes a grateful Rosaline's hand in his, while Varkey and Jose look on with joy.

History In 1971, Fred Prysquel, photographer and automobile journalist, sketched and cut out a swimsuit design from a paper tablecloth in a Saint Tropezian café. Inspired by the swimsuits of surfers at the time, he created a longer boxer short style much different than the shorter and fitted swimsuits of that period. Designed from spinnaker cloth, his l swimsuit was bright, original and designed to dry quickly in the sun. In 1991, fellow Tropezian and textile worker, Loïc Berthet, took over the brand and added new styles and models. To men's swim trunks, he added a back pocket secured with Velcro, eyelet holes made from a stainless alloy, Zamac, and a cotton lining. In 1994, Vilebrequin expanded its collection to include boys' garments. Between 1990 and 2000, the brand expanded worldwide and opened locations in London, Alassio, Paris, Geneva, New York, Hong Kong and Madrid. The brand also developed a network of distribution partners in over 50 countries. In 2012, Vilebrequin was acquired by the American company G-III Apparel Group, Ltd., which also licenses Calvin Klein, DKNY, and Karl Lagerfeld Paris. Roland Herlory, prior general director for Hermès Latin America and Caribbean, became the new CEO. In 2013, after more than 40 years in menswear, Vilebrequin launched their first ladies' line and extended their product offering to also include resort wear as well as luxury beach accessories for both men and women. In 2014, Vilebrequin opened stores with a particular focus on expansion throughout Asia with openings in South Korea, Thailand and Singapore.

Family New Zealand-born of Gloucestershire wool-growing stock Hunt was the only son and eldest child of John Hunt, a farmer and early settler at Oruru, Northland, and his wife Maria Frances,Maria Frances Duffus was a descendant of Josiah Paul Tippetts of Tetbury Gloucestershire. Josiah Paul Tippetts changed his surname to Paul (his mother's maiden name) becoming Josiah Paul Paul after inheriting Highgrove from his Uncle John Paul. Maria Frances's line of descent was Josiah Paul Paul (Tippetts) - son Robert Clark Paul (Tippetts) - daughter Maria Harriet Paul married John Duffus from Jamaica on 26 April 1830 in Tetbury daughter of Jamaica-born Etonian Rev John Duffus M A, vicar of St Andrew, Mangonui.The Community Archive accessed 20 August 2015 He was born on 2 December 1867 in Oruru, Northland, New Zealand. W D Hunt married twice. At Gore on 20 December 1894 he married Ismene Helena Stanley. Ismene had a daughter and a son before she died in May 1900. Two years later, 15 May 1902, Hunt married Jessie Belstead Edwards in Adelaide South Australia. There was just one child of the second marriage, a second son. Career ;Recruit William Hunt joined stock and station agency Wright Stephenson proper in 1891. His ability was recognised by Johnstone much earlier when he was employed by them for just two months at shearing time on Wright Stephenson-managed Blackstone Hill station in the Maniatoto. Though only 17 he was kept on at the station as a permanent shepherd and soon took over the bookkeeping of the station and then its management. When Blackstone Hill station was subdivided in 1891 23 year old Hunt organised the muster and auction of the tens of thousands of sheep on the property. He was also required to act as auctioneer in the absence of George Stephenson of Wright Stephenson. J A Johnstone who had personally clerked the sale was so impressed he offered Hunt a position on the staff of Wright Stephenson & Co.A Century's Challenge, J C Irving and L A T Bell, Hutcheson Bowman, Wellington, 1961 ;Gore The same year the partners in Wright Stephenson decided it was time to open their first branch. They chose Gore on the banks of the Mataura river and sent William Hunt to organise it though within three years times had become so hard it was deemed prudent to close Gore and confine operations to Otago. In spite of their difficulties Hunt's well chosen Gore customers all settled their accounts in full. In 1896 the government resumed borrowing overseas making advances to settlers on freeholds and long term leaseholds at moderate interest rates and the farming outlook improved. Gore was re-opened and another branch opened at Invercargill, Hunt being made responsible for all Southland province. Johnstone remained in Otago. ;Control of Wright Stephenson When the founding partners withdrew from the firm with the turn of the century Johnstone and Hunt acquired the major holdings of the shares in the firm. As the rabbit pest was brought under control their customers began to prosper once more and Wright Stephenson was incorporated as a public company in 1906. The initial directors were J A Johnstone (chairman) Hunt and P L Wright, Johnstone and Hunt were joint managing directors. In early 1907 Johnstone's health failed and he took 12 months leave to recuperate. Over that time W D Hunt acted as Chairman as well as sole managing director and when Johnstone returned to work he resumed the joint managing directorship but he acknowledged William Hunt's achievements and Hunt stayed Chairman of Directors. Hunt managed to visit every one of his firm's branches each year. ;Wellington Wright Stephenson's activities spread across New Zealand and into all farming areas. Rapidly becoming a major national business they merged with Wellington's W & G Turnbull and Co and W Gunson and Co in Auckland. It became clear a central location was necessary and in 1917 the Head office left Dunedin for Wellington. In 1920 the Abraham and Williams business covering Manawatu- Rangitikei and adjacent districts came under their expanding umbrella. The sale of new motor vehicles and their servicing was added as were the provision of all farm requirements including bulk groceries and home appliances. It seemed that everything might be supplied until staunch lifetime prohibitionist Hunt felt obliged to draw the line at the last commodity they might sell. Wright Stephenson stocked no alcohol of any kind. After the end of World War I a new stud department for all pedigree livestock soon extended to importing and exporting. An annual sale of thoroughbred yearlings was established in 1927 which brought buyers from all over the world. Activities away from Wright Stephenson ;Meat Board 1922 and Dairy Board 1923 W D Hunt was the Stock and Station Agency industry representative on both the New Zealand Meat Producers Board and the New Zealand Wool Board.

In 2016, the Government of Maharashra signed up for the Ministry of Civil Aviation's regional connectivity scheme (RCS) called UDAN that would fast- track the development of ten regional airports in the state including Jalgaon. Under UDAN, Air Deccan won the contract to start flights from Jalgaon to Mumbai. The airline flew the first ever scheduled commercial flight into Jalgaon airport on 23 December 2017. However the airline stopped the flights within months, citing technical issues. The Government cancelled the contract and the route was allotted to TruJet. TruJet started operating from Jalgaon from 1 September 2019. Structure Jalgaon airport is spread over 630 acres and has one runway oriented 09/27, 1,700 metres in length. Its new apron measuring 68 metres by 67 metres provides parking space for 2 ATR aircraft at a time. The runway has basic approach and runway edge lighting. Navigational and landing aids at this airport includes a DVOR /DME and a PAPI (Runway 27 only). The 700 square metre terminal building can accommodate 50 passengers.

Biography  Eshel was born in Jaffa. His father Yehezekel (Hezi) Eshel (originally Batat), was born in Iraq and immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1936. He fought in the Israeli War of Independence in the Givati Brigade.https://web.archive.org/web/20150923233744/http://www.idf.il/1133-22660-HE/Dover.aspx His mother Edna was a Holocaust survivor from Russia. Eshel was drafted into the IDF in 1977. After graduating from the IAF Flight Academy as a fighter pilot in 1979, Eshel flew the A-4 Skyhawk, first out of Etzion and then from Ramon. He also flew the Skyhawk during the 1982 Lebanon War. After serving with the flight academy as a combat instructor, Eshel went on to fly the F-16 out of Ramat David Airbase. Between 1993 and 1995 Eshel commanded 201 Squadron at Tel Nof. Flying the Kurnass 2000 variant of the F-4 Phantom II, Eshel led the squadron during Operation Grapes of Wrath. Between 1997 and 1999 Eshel headed the IAF's Operations Department. In 1999 Eshel was assigned command of Ramon Airbase. On December 16, 1999, while ferrying an AH-64 Apache from Ramon to northern Israel, Eshel carried out a routine weapons systems check on the supposedly unarmed helicopter, accidentally firing an AGM-114 Hellfire which narrowly missed a group of IAF reserve soldiers nearby. The incident, for which he fined himself, was written up in his record, but did not prevent further promotion. In 1999 Eshel was assigned command of Tel Nof. Eshel, the son of a Holocaust survivor, led a formation of three IAF F-15 Eagles on a fly-over of the Auschwitz concentration camp in September 2003. As it flew above the camp, Eshel broadcast a message to an IDF ceremony taking place below: Eshel later explained that \\"We're talking about a personal dream of 15 years ... This is the most significant expression of the rebirth of this nation. As the IAF, we are the most concrete expression of the might of the Jewish people and there's no one better than us to express it\\". He also admitted that he deliberately violated an agreement with the Polish government by flying at a very low altitude. He was quoted saying to other pilots: \\"We listened to the Polish for 800 years. Today, we don’t have to listen anymore\\".http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Analysis-Pilot-over-Auschwitz-maybe- Iran-too The spokesman of Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum criticized the fly-over stating that it was not consulted with the Museum and that \\"It's a cemetery, a place of silence and concentration\\" and that \\"Flying the F-15s is a demonstration of military might which is an entirely inappropriate way to commemorate the victimshttps://www.haaretz.com/1.5370524\\". The Israeli delegation had been in Poland on the occasion of the Polish Air Force's 85th anniversary and had participated in the Radom Air Show. In 2004 Eshel became head of the IAF's Air Group, commanding all operational assets and in January 2006 was appointed IAF Chief of Staff, a role he filled during the 2006 Lebanon War. Eshel was subsequently credited with the improvements to air- ground integration implemented after the war. On March 27, 2008, he was promoted to the rank of Major General and appointed head of the IDF's Planning Directorate. He replaced Ido Nehoshtan, which had just been appointed Commander in Chief of the IAF. On February 5, 2012, Eshel was announced as Nehoshtan's successor as Commander in Chief of the Israeli Air Force, when the latter completed his tenure in May 2012. The other candidates were the Military Secretary to the Prime Minister, Maj. Gen. Yochanan Locker, and IAF Chief of Staff, Brig. Gen. Nimrod Sheffer. Eshel completed his term as commander of the IAF on August 10, 2017. He was succeeded by Aluf Amikam Norkin. Eshel is married and a father of three. He holds a degree in economics from Auburn University at Montgomery, Alabama, and a degree in political science from the University of Haifa’s National Security Studies Center. He was one of the leaders of Pnima, a campaign to institute universal national service for all Israeli citizens reaching adulthood. He told the Times of Israel that \\"[t]he IDF isn’t really a people’s army. It’s a half-of-the- people’s army.\\" On August 31, 2020, Eshel became Director General of the Israeli Ministry of Defense after being appointed to this position by the Minister of Defense Benny Gantz.

It was built in 1995 as part of a development site originally known as Direct for Europe Doncaster. History At the end of the 19th century the site of the Doncaster railport was primarily in agricultural use; to the south the Great Northern Railway (GNR) main line that had been built during the 1850s, and to the west of the site a large engine shed (Doncaster Carr shed) was constructed for the GNR in the 1870s; a small engine shed was built at the north-western corner of the site in the later part of the 19th century (extant until the 1970s). During the 20th century the area was increasingly taken into railway use, mainly sidings (Decoy Sidings).Ordnance survey maps, 1854–1990, 1:2500, 1:10560 and 1:10000 scale In 1989 after the passing of the Channel Tunnel Act 1987 Doncaster was put forward as a site for a rail terminal for Channel Tunnel freight. The site was promoted by Neil Worthington (Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council) and backed by Mabon, subsidiary of Dutch company Hollandsche Beton Groep, and Kyle Stewart Properties. Initial expectations were for over 200,000 t of cargo per annum, and create 150 jobs directly. In June 1992 Kyle Stuart was awarded the contract to develop the terminal – in addition to the rail terminal up to of factory/warehousing space had been given planning permission. In 1994 construction began on the £5 million Direct for Europe project; the terminal was one of several built to serve expected international freight trains resulting from the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994.Others were the Hams Hall Channel Tunnel Freight Terminal, Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal, and Wakefield Europort The railport was opened in December 1995 by The Princess Royal; it was equipped with two reception sidings and four terminal sidings and capable of handling train lengths of ; and was built with car handling and storage facilities. the site was built close to extensive marshalling sidings. As a Channel Tunnel freight terminal it was built with additional security measures to comply with the Channel Tunnel Security Order of 1994. The rail site was operated by Applied Distribution Ltd.; in 1996/7 Tibbett and Britten acquired the rail terminal operation business. In the late 1990s the site was handling about 12,500 containers per year, including a plastic polymer flow from ICI Wilton (Teesside) to the DuPont fibre plant in Doncaster, and intermodal traffic via seaports, but with little Channel tunnel trade. Trains were operated by Freightliner and EWS. GB Railfreight began running a service from the Port of Felixstowe in 2006. In 2008 Freightliner took over running of the rail terminal from Tibbett & Britain successor DHL Supply Chain; by 2008 the terminal had increased its throughput to 37,000 containers per year.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. History Onon Bjornson Dahle was born in 1823 in Upper Telemark, Norway. After attending normal school in Hvideseid and teaching for six years, he emigrated to America in 1848. He taught school in Norwegian around Christiana for a winter, worked the harvest, and cut cordwood near St. Louis with his brother. In 1850 the brothers and three Scandinavian partners headed west across the plains with three yoke of oxen for the gold fields of California, a trip which Onon later described as \\"hungry horrors.\\" Eventually they had some success mining gold and returned to the Midwest in 1851. With In 1853, Onon and his freshly-immigrated brother Tarjie settled in the new Norwegian settlement in Perry. Onon bought forty acres on a ridge with good access to the Military Ridge Road - not the best farmland, but a good site for a trading center and town. He built a store and log cabin there, and set up a private service to bring the mail in seven miles from the post office at Blue Mounds once a week. He prospered, and married Betsy Nelson in 1854. In the same year, Onon was elected the first town clerk, town treasurer, justice of the peace, and superintendent of schools for the newly-formed Town of Perry. About the same time Onon was involved in organizing the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran congregation at Perry. In 1863 Onon built the house that is the subject of this article, with a T-shaped floor plan. The front of the house is the top of the T, a two-story main block with walls of coursed ashlar limestone blocks fixed with raised mortar joints. Windows are symmetric around the centered front door. At the top of the wall is a broad frieze board, and above that a hip roof. The overall style is Greek Revival, except for fine double brackets under the eaves, which are drawn from Italianate style. Behind the main block the stem of the T is a 1.5-story wing. On each side the roof extends to shelter a veranda. Inside, the house has varnished narrow-board floors and plaster walls and ceilings. Behind the house is a one-story bank barn which Dahle had built around 1870, with walls of vertical board and batten. Dahle lived in the house and ran his store until he retired in 1895. Then he moved to Mt. Horeb, where he and Betsy lived until 1905, when they both died. The community where he started his store and lived for many years is now called Daleyville, in his honor. The Henry L. and Sarah Dahle House and the Herman B. and Anne Marie Dahle House in Mount Horeb also belonged to members of the Dahle family and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Onon and Betsy's son, Herman, would become a member of the United States House of Representatives.

When he attended elementary school at Ibtidaiyah Madrasah, he practiced declamation, storytelling, and reading the Koran. He was also mentored by literary figures M. Saribi Arifin and Yusmanan. A voracious reader, in middle school he read works by Indonesian authors such as Hamka, HB Jassin, and Pramoedya Ananta Toer; he graduated in 1959. while attending high school in Surakarta, he read works of world literature by Charles Dickens and Anton Chekov. While in high school, he wrote short stories, plays, essays, and novels. He graduated from high school in 1962. During his college days at Gadjah Mada University, he founded the Lembaga Kebudayaan Seniman Islam (Islamic Artists Cultural Institution) and Studi Grup Mantika (together with Ikranagara, Arifin C. Noer, Dawam Rahardjo, Chaerul Umam, Amri Yahya, Sju'bah Asa and Abdul Hadi W. M.). In 1964, he published his first novel, Kereta Api yang Berangkat di Pagi Hari (The Train that Leaves Early in the Morning); it was picked up as a serial by the newspaper Djihad in 1966. The following year, in 1967, he published his first short story in the literary magazine Horison. In 1969, he graduated from UGM with a degree in history. Kuntowijoyo then continued his education in the United States. He obtained his Master of Arts in American History from Connecticut University (1974) and Ph.D in history from Columbia University (1980); his doctoral dissertation was titled \\"Social Change in an Agrarian Society: Madura 1850–1940\\". It was during his time in the United States that Kuntowijoyo began writing poetry, publishing two anthologies during this time: Suluk Awang-Uwung (1975) and Isyarat (Signs; 1976). Both dealt with his experiences while in the United States. On his return to Indonesia in 1980, he founded the Centre for Policy Research and Study with Amien Rais and Chairil Anwar. He was also active in various aspects of the Islamic organization Muhammadiyah, although he was critical of them; he wrote that they were a \\"cultural institution without culture\\". After suffering from meningoencephalitis in 1991, Kuntowijoyo lost some motor control and found difficulty speaking. He began to write at an increased pace. For three years in a row, from 1995 to 1997, his short stories were chosen as the best stories published by the newspaper Kompas; stories selected were \\"Lelaki yang Kawin dengan Peri\\" (\\"The Man who Married a Fairy\\"; 1995), \\"Pistol Perdamaian\\" (\\"Pistol of Peace\\"; 1996), and \\"Anjing-anjing Menyerbu Kuburan\\" (\\"Dogs Attack a Graveyard\\"; 1997).

In 2001, Kompas published his novel Mantra Penjinak Ular (Mantra of the Snake Charmer) as a serial. On 21 February 2005, Kuntowijoyo was taken to Sardjito Hospital complaining of diarrhea and difficulty breathing. He died the next day. He left behind two works after his death, Historical Experience (a handbook for students of history) and Sejarah Eropa Barat (History of West Europe); Sejarah Eropa Berat was published posthumously under the title Peran Bourjuasi dalam Transformasi Eropa (Role of the Bourgeois in the Transformation of Europe; 2005). That same year, another of his short stories was selected as the best published in Kompas. Style and creative process Kuntowijoyo's works, which include many aspects of Islam and Javanese culture, were influenced in part by his childhood. He said that many were based on his own experiences. According to the foreword of his 1999 short story collection Hampir Sebuah Subversi (Almost a Subversion), Kuntowijoyo wrote without previous planning. In 2005, towards his death, he wrote that his creative process involved \\"writing from the inside\\" (writing about a fictional world as its characters see it) and \\"writing from the bottom\\" (writing without using a particular literary theory, but focusing on consistent portrayals of the characters). Personal life Kuntowijoyo married Susilaningish in 1969. Together they had two children, Punang Amaripuja (in 2005 a lecturer at the Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta) and Alun Paradipta.

The species is known from Oligocene sediments exposed in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. It is one of a number of extinct species placed in the living genus Calocedrus. History and classification Calocedrus huashanensis is represented by a series of compression fossil specimens in lacustrine deposits belonging to the Oligocene aged Ningming Formation of western Ningming County. As of 2011 the formation had not been dated by radiometric methods, making a precise date difficult to obtain. The Ningming Formation overlies the Dazha Formation, which has been dated to the Eocene and palynological studies of the pollens preserved in the Ningming Formation have given a general age of Oligocene. The pollen studies are supported by both the fish and plant megafossils that are found in the formation, both of which support an Oligocene age. The flora preserved in the formation appears to have been a subtropical evergreen forest almost exclusively dominated by flowering plants. C. huashanensis is one of only three species of conifers found in the formation. The species is one of two members of the family Cupressaceae while the third conifer species, the plum- yew Cephalotaxus ningmingensis was described in 2010. The type specimens for C. huashanensis are located in two different repositories. The holotype specimen, number \\"NHMG-010420\\", is currently preserved in paleobotanical collections housed at the Natural History Museum of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The two paratype specimens, \\"PB21097\\" and \\"PB21098\\", are housed at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, a branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Nanjing. The specimens were studied by a group of three Chinese paleobotanists, led by Gongle Shi, all from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. Gongle Shi and team published their 2012 type description for C. huashanensis in the American Journal of Botany. The etymology of the chosen specific name huashanensis is in recognition of the Huashan Hills, near the type locality, which are noted for an ancient fresco on a cliff. Description While the foliage of C. huashanensis is similar in overall appearance to several Cupressaceae genera, the details of the cuticle structure and overall morphology indicate the species is part of the genus Calocedrus. C. huashanensis differs from the living C. formosana by having less obtuse-shaped facial leaves and side leaves that do not incurve. The living North American species C. decurrens differs from C. huashanensis in the slightly flattened morphology of the leafy shoots and the weakly dimorphic leaves. C. huashanensis and the modern C. macrolepis can be separated by the distribution of the stomal zones of the leaves on the undersides of shoots.

The UN Development Programme, the Afghanistan Emergency Trust Fund, and the Ministry of Energy and Water, took emergency action to address the threat. The co-operative effort saw a rapid response through immediate financing, planning and implementation of a 16-metre ancillary gate that could hold the water while the rusted gates were lifted and repaired. The repairs were successful at a reported cost of US$18,000 allowing evacuated residents to return to their homes in the valley. right See also *List of dams and reservoirs in Afghanistan *Water supply in Afghanistan References External links *Afghanistan: UNDP assists in flood prevention at Chak-e Wardak Dam *Afghanistan's Melting Snows Kill 14, Displace Thousands Category:Dams in Afghanistan Category:River regulation in Afghanistan Category:Water supply and sanitation in Afghanistan Category:Dams completed in 1938 Category:1938 establishments in Afghanistan ","title":"Chaki Wardak Dam"},{"id":"34598680","text":"Florence Ann Humphries (9 November 1915 - 12 January 1981) was a New Zealand housemaid, boarding-house manager, trade unionist and consumer advocate.

Born in Bluff, Southland, New Zealand, he served in the Boer War with the First Contingent of the New Zealand Volunteer Force to be sent to South Africa. During the war he was the first New Zealand recipient of the Distinguished Service Order. After the war he became a professional soldier and served in a number of staff positions in the New Zealand Military Forces. A member of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force during the early stages of the First World War, he commanded the Canterbury Battalion during the Gallipoli Campaign. He was eventually evacuated from Gallipoli late in the campaign for medical reasons. He retired from the military in 1917 due to poor health and died in 1954 at the age of 88. Early life John Gethin Hughes, the son of a seaman and his wife, was born in Campbelltown, which later became known as Bluff, in the south of New Zealand. After completing his schooling, he gained employment as a law clerk in the town of Timaru. He also served in the local artillery unit of the militia from 1884 to 1887. In 1888, he moved to the town of Napier in the North Island. He served in a local artillery unit there, eventually commanding a battery by 1897. South Africa When the Boer War began in 1899, Hughes volunteered for the First Contingent of New Zealanders to serve in the war. The contingent arrived in South Africa in November and Hughes, despite being only a private, was quickly recognised as having good leadership qualities and the following month was promoted to lieutenant. Awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his leadership during an engagement in January 1900 at Slingersfontein, where a British camp had come under attack by the Boers, he was the first New Zealander to be so recognised. The citation for his DSO, which was gazetted on 10 April 1901, read: \\"In recognition of services during the operations in South Africa.\\" A well regarded officer, he was mentioned in despatches before the contingent returned to New Zealand in January 1901. On his return to New Zealand, Hughes chose to become a professional soldier and was commissioned a captain in the New Zealand Militia. He served as a staff officer to the commandant of the Militia until 1902 when he again volunteered for service in South Africa, embarking with the 10th Contingent. While serving in Natal, he was promoted to major by General Westonhaugh. Service in New Zealand When his service in South Africa ended, Hughes resumed his staff duties in New Zealand with the rank of captain. He served in a series of staff positions for the next several years and in 1907, he was promoted to major. In 1910 he transferred to the New Zealand Staff Corps, having received training in England with the British Army. The previous year, he had married Marion De Vere O'Connor. First World War When the First World War broke out, Hughes enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) which was raised for military service abroad. He was appointed assistant military secretary to Major General Alexander Godley, the commander of the NZEF. He embarked for the Middle East with the main body of the NZEF in October 1914. In February, Hughes relinquished his secretarial duties to become NZEF Camp Commandant in Egypt. While in Egypt, the infantry brigade of the NZEF was combined with an Australian infantry brigade to form the New Zealand and Australian Division with Godley as its commander and intended for service in the Gallipoli Campaign. Hughes landed at Anzac Cove with Godley's headquarters on 25 April 1915. In June, he took command of the Canterbury Battalion when its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Henry Brown, was wounded. He led the battalion during the Battle of Chunuk Bair, which took heavy casualties when it was caught in the open by a Turkish artillery barrage. In October he was medically evacuated due to dysentery. He was recognised for his service at Gallipoli with appointment as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George as well as being mentioned in despatches. After a period of convalescence in England he returned in New Zealand where he was eventually discharged from the NZEF because of his health. He was placed on the retirement list in 1917 with the honorary rank of colonel. Later life Not long after his return to New Zealand, Hughes was asked to stand as the Member of Parliament for the Wellington North electorate. Following his retirement, he was prominent in the First New Zealand Mounted Rifles Association. He died in Wellington on 23 July 1954 and was survived by his wife and children.

Biography Fueled with the inspiration of music and the nostalgic memories of his turbulent teenage years, Tai has tried to utilize his self-taught techniques, cultivated from urban doctrines, in an effort to create art that evokes an honest & hopefully profound emotional experience. Growing up as a bi-racial child in Salt Lake City, Utah, in a predominantly white, suburban environment, Tai states that he inadequately fabricated a self-perception of pariahdom. Tormented with that angst and confusion at such a young age, Tai suggests that he was fortunate to discover that the arts were a means to expressing the frustrations of his cultural identity. Through his artistic explorations he realized his auto-didactic ability, which lead to experimentation with nearly every type of art-form, but none had captured and retained his affections as strongly as drawing with a ballpoint pen, so that has been his focus for the past 8 years. While Tai's art is seemingly filled with symbolic imagery, bearing social or political commentary, he claims he never consciously approaches a drawing with the intent of asserting his beliefs or opinions on viewers. He's spoke of his creative process spawning from an organic and authentic subconscious journey and that his creations manifest more by virtue of his own self-evaluation and less of propagating his ideology. With over 250k followers on Facebook & Instagram and thousands of his original artworks sold worldwide, he's recently taken his art “on the road”. While splitting his creation-time between his studio in Salt Lake City and his newest studio location in Hannibal, Missouri, he's been touring the U.S. with his wife and two children, demonstrating the versatility of the ballpoint pen through the trafficking of his art at galleries, museums and art fairs all across the nation. In the early 2000s Tai founded Weird Chief Pictures, a film and television production company in Salt Lake City, Utah. Tai had been producing film and television for roughly 10 years before eventually putting his filmmaking career aside to focus on his artwork. Between 2002 and 2008, under the moniker 'Weird Chief' Tai sold thousands of his original pop art paintings, which are paintings of pop icons, using stencils and spraypaint, of which it is estimated that he has sold over 5,000 original paintings across the globe, with at least one in each of the 50 U.S. states and countries such as Israel, Cyprus, Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Japan, Lithuania, the UK, Slovenia, Switzerland, Turkey, South Africa, and New Zealand. to collectors. In 2009, combining urban and surreal styles, he transitioned from his pop art work to a pop surrealism style, experimenting with a mix of ballpoint pen, photography, spray paint, stencils, acrylics, marker inks, and watercolors, applied on plywood. In 2010 Tai founded Submerged in Art, an annual charity event gathering of Art and Music to benefit The Road Home homeless shelter. In just its 3rd year, the 2012 Submerged in Art charity event received a \\"Best Of\\" award from Salt Lake City Weekly. Art =Early Art= Tai has told stories of being in elementary school and drawing pictures for his friends, selling them for a quarter or more. His earlier works have traces of his own rebellion and self-determination, which he credits to growing up in Utah's skate-punk era, that he has said has influenced his urban style. By 16 years old, Tai's artistic urban style extended to showcasing his creativity in public spaces not always in the most legal of circumstances., The Source Interview. As a juvenile, he was arrested for his graffiti and was encouraged by the arresting officer to compete in an anti-graffiti/anti-gang drawing competition, which he won and used part of his earnings from the competition to pay off the graffiti violation fines. =2005-2008= Tai started with many different art mediums including tattoo, graffiti, web design, graphic, illustration, sculpture, oils, acrylics, music and film. In 2004, Tai was asked to help paint a 30 ft x 50 ft mural with American Pop Artist Jann Haworth, who is best known as the co-creator of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover. The mural was an updated representation of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover and is titled SLC Pepper. This mural inspired Tai to seek new techniques, at which time he was introduced to stencil art. Tai spent the following years focused on his stencil work. In 2005 he painted a tryptic painting of Miles Davis, Erykah Badu and Billie Holiday, listed the piece on eBay, and in a short time the painting sold. Although still considered lowbrow, Pop art had become very popular in the early 2000s, especially with the younger generation, and from 2005-2008 Tai used eBay to sell his paintings to collectors across the world. =2008-2012= In 2008, Tai began showing his work at art festivals. His first festival was the 2008 Utah Arts Festival, where he sold nearly 300 original 20\\"x30\\" pop art paintings. For the most part of 2008 and 2009 Tai only sold his work in the western United States, but in late 2009 Tai took his work across the entire country . As of 2009, Tai has been traveling across the country for nearly 8 months out of a year, selling his work to collectors. =Pop Art= Tai's pop art paintings were created with the use of spraypaint, stencils and masonite. The images were designed in photoshop, turning digital photos into multilayered images. The layers were printed out onto mylar paper and then handcut with an Exacto knife, resulting in multi-layered stencils. Each stencil layer was sprayed with a temporary adhesive, mounted on the masonite, then sprayed with aerosol spraypaint. Multiple layers were applied, completing the image. The backgrounds were painted with additional stencil use, freehand aerosol techniques and sometimes acrylic application with a brush. =Pop Surrealism Art= Tai's recent artworks are surreal creations of ballpoint pen drawings on Mylar film including further highlights, details and background colors created with the use of pencils, charcoals and a drizzle of watercolors.

After dropping out of college he went on to produce his first feature- length film Luck & Rat Poisoning (1995), which was heavily influenced by Kevin Smith's Clerks. After Luck & Rat Poisoning's theatrical release at Utah's historic Tower Theatre, which serves as a venue for the Sundance Film Festival, Tai produced and directed his second feature-length movie,Hustlin' a Hustler (1996), which he shot on hi-8 video, on what could be considered as a \\"used car\\" budget. In 2001, Tai began production on his 3rd feature-length picture, but his first on celluloid (his earliest works were shot on video). Shot on Super 16mm, Twice Today, starring Don Shanks, was invited to the AngelCiti Film Festival in Los Angeles, California where it had its premier at Paramount Studios. In July 2002, Twice Today was also invited to the Real to Reel Film Festival in Shelby, North Carolina, where it won the award for Best Amateur Feature Film. After Twice Today, Tai transitioned into television. From 2003-2006 Tai was hired to edit the Ultimate Combat Experience, a weekly television series featuring tournaments of kickboxing and no holds barred fighting, credited as being the first MMA show of its kind on network television anywhere in the world. After editing several episodes of UCE, Tai was promoted to a producer, where he produced and edited 52 episodes over a 5-season period. In 2006, after leaving the Ultimate Combat Experience, Tai produced and edited commercials and promotional material for Ultimate Fighting Championship's two-time light heavy weight champion Randy Couture and Matt Lindland's training camp Team Quest and MMA event, Sportfight. From 2004–2006, Tai also worked on his weekly television series called 3.2 Percent, which highlighted the nightlife, music, sports, culture and lifestyle in Utah. In corroboration with early Spy Hop Production personnel, Tai produced an 11 episode season in 2006. Citing unsustainable financial conditions, Tai cancelled the 3.2 Percent television series, after just one season. In December 2005, Tai returned to filmmaking and was hired to produce and direct a short film for the 2006 Slamdance Film Festival, with specific guidelines. It had to be shot in 24 hours, with a budget of $99 and a running time of 3 minutes. The finished short was titled Waiting,Waiting (2006) - IMDb starring David H. StevensDavid Stevens - IMDb of Punch Drunk Love and after its premiere at the Slamdance Film Festival, it was invited to screen at the 2006 Real to Reel Film Festivalhttp://www.live- area.com/wings/reel_to_real_press_release.pdf and the 2006 Arizona International Film Festival. Following the Slamdance premiere of Waiting, Tai adapted the short story into a feature-length film. Two years later, Tai began production on Darkroom. Tai's fourth feature-length film, Darkroom,Darkroom (2008) - IMDb stars David Stevens, Darren Dalton and Todd Bridges.

The elder brother of director, sound producer, and politician Eros Djarot, Rahardjo has starred in dozens of films since his debut in 1971's Wadjah Seorang Laki-Laki. Since his directorial debut in 1979 with Rembulan dan Matahari, he has directed and/or written twelve films; one of which, Langitku, Rumahku, was Indonesia's submission to the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991. Biography Rahardjo was born in Serang, Banten, on 21 January 1949. He was the first of seven children born to Djarot Djojoprawiro, an air force officer, and Ennie Tanudiredja, a housewife interested in woodcarving. Rahardjo spent most of his childhood in Yogyakarta, where he dreamed of becoming a visual artist. However, after finishing high school at State Senior High School 2, he attended the National Indonesian Theatre Academy (, or ATNI). During his studies at ATNI, he befriended Teguh Karya. Together, the two founded the theatre group Teater Populer in 1968. Three years later, Teater Populer, working together with Sarinade Film, produced Wadjah Seorang Laki-Laki (The Face of a Boy). Rahardjo was immediately cast in the lead role, while Karya directed the film; singer Laila Sari was cast as his love interest. Two years later, Rahardjo starred in 1973's Cinta Pertama (First Love) alongside Christine Hakim; the two would later star as romantic leads in several other films, and in 2010 were selected as the second best Indonesian cinema couple by Tabloid Bintang. After the success of Cinta Pertama, Rahardjo went on to play in 1975's Ranjang Pengantin (Wedding Bed), 1976's Perkawinan Dalam Semusim (A Season's Marriage) and 1977's Badai Pasti Berlalu (The Storm Will Surely Pass). During this period, Rahardjo would only work for Karya; he reportedly left a dinner meeting immediately after another director asked him to act in a film, later telling Tempo that it was as if the director was borrowing a tape recorder, not considering how Rahardjo would feel. In 1979, Rahardjo made his directorial debut with Rembulan dan Matahari (The Moon and the Sun). That same year, he played in November 1828; he also served as one of the film's production designers. Two years later he directed Seputih Hatinya, Semerah Bibirnya (As White as the Heart, as Red as the Lips). In 1982, he starred alongside Hakim in Di Balik Kelambu (Behind the Mosquito Net); the two played newlyweds living at the bride's parents home. This was followed by several other directorial efforts, including Ponirah Terpidana (Ponirah is Convicted; 1984), Kembang Kertas (Paper Flowers; 1984), Kodrat (1985), and Kasmaran (Falling in Love; 1987). In 1988 Rahardjo played National Hero of Indonesia Teuku Umar, an Acehnese revolutionary hero, in Tjoet Nja' Dhien; the film was directed by his younger brother Eros Djarot. The following year, Rahardjo directed Langitku, Rumahku (My Sky, My Home). The film, nominated for 9 Citra Awards at the 1990 Indonesian Film Festival, went on to win the Three Continents Festival that same year. After Karya's death in 2001, Rahardjo took over as leader of Teater Populer. The following year, he released Marsinah, a biopic of the workers' rights activist of the same name who was killed in 1993. In 2007, Rahardjo took the role of Siska's father in Teddy Soeriaatmadja's remake of Badai Pasti Berlalu; he was the only cast member of the original film to act in the remake. In 2010 he played in Alangkah Lucunya (Negeri Ini) (How Funny (This Country Is)) as the father of a street child; that same year he played the primary antagonist in Hanung Bramantyo's biopic of Muhammadiyah founder Ahmad Dahlan. In 2011 he played Ki Kartareja in Ifa Isfansyah's Sang Penari (The Dancer), an adaptation of Ahmad Tohari's trilogy Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk. Awards and recognition Rahardjo has received two Citra Awards at the Indonesian Film Festival for his acting, the first in 1975 for Ranjang Pengantin and the second for Di Balik Kelambu. Although he has yet to receive a Citra Award for screenwriting, six of his films have been nominated: Rembulan dan Matahari, Di Balik Kelambu, Ponirah Terpidana, Kodrat, Kasmaran and Langitku, Rumahku. Langitku, Rumahku represented Indonesia at the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991 for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not nominated; this came the year after Eros's film Tjoet Nja' Dhien was submitted to the Academy. In 1996 Rahardjo received the Usmar Ismail Prize from the National Film Consideration Body.

History =Background= Arsenio Hall created The Party Machine as a televised afterparty to his own program, The Arsenio Hall Show, and to be a late-night alternative to Club MTV. Hall built the half-hour show around Nia Peeples, who previously hosted MTV's Friday night Street Party series and the short-lived US adaptation of Top of the Pops. The Party Machine set featured live music venues, multi-level dance floors, conversation pits, a VIP room, a non- alcoholic bar and a resident DJ. Music videos were introduced by Peeples, who also served as a dancer/choreographer. The show, sold to markets as a companion piece to Hall's talk show, aired weeknights in syndication beginning January 7, 1991 on approximately 150 stations. In addition to Club MTV, its format brought comparisons to Soul Train, Dance Party USA and American Bandstand. =Guests= Party Machine aimed to be a showcase for established and breaking urban dance acts. New Jack Swing singing group Troop was the show's first guest. Other music acts who performed on the show include The Boys, Tevin Campbell, Taylor Dayne, Sheena Easton, En Vogue, Guy, LeVert, MC Hammer, Alexander O'Neal, Maxi Priest, Will Smith, Ralph Tresvant and Vanilla Ice.

She was a Member of the Order of the British Empire and received the King George VI Coronation Medal for her services to literature. Family and education She was born in London, England, one of five children of Cecilia Brown and William Howes, a post office clerk and accountant. Her brother George became a noted entomologist. The family emigrated to New Zealand when she was very young. She attended Kaiapoi Borough School, where she later became a pupil teacher. Teaching career In 1893 she completed her training to become a teacher at Christchurch. She taught at several different schools including Ashburton, Wanganui, and Makarewa before becoming the infant mistress at Gore School in 1899. She eventually rose to be headmistress, remaining in that position from 1914 until 1917. In 1917 she moved to the Wellington Girls' College, where she was the head of the junior department. She stayed in this position until 1919, when she retired from teaching. Howe was an early advocate for the Montessori method and the philosophy behind kindergartens. She became known as an educational reformer, pushing for a less institutional learning environment featuring smaller class sizes and quieter, more comfortable classrooms. She was a feminist who believed strongly that higher education was critical for women to participate fully in civic life. Illustration for Howe's book Wonderwings by Alice Polson Writings A recording of \\"Wonderwings\\" Howe began writing children's books around 1910, believing that stories and songs helped children to learn. Although she worked in the genre of fairy tales, she saw that there was not enough written material on scientific subjects available to New Zealand schoolchildren, so she made a point of incorporating scientific information and natural phenomena into her books. For example, in The Cradle Ship (1922) she offered a true account of where babies come from, making the book a minor landmark in sex education for children. She wrote some 30 books altogether, the best-known of which are Fairy Rings (1911) and The Cradle Ship, which was translated into several other languages. Howe also wrote for adults, including books on education (Tales Out of School; The Great Experiment), plays, and an opera libretto. She was nominated by Professor Francis Prendeville Wilson for the 1928 Nobel Prize in Literature. Her play Rose Lane (1936) won a British Drama League prize. In 1935, she was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire and in 1937 was given the King George VI Coronation Medal for her services to literature. She moved to Dunedin in 1941 and lived there until her death. =Publications= * Fairy Rings (1911) * Where the Bell Birds Chime (1912) * Maoriland Fairy Tales (1913) * Stewart Island (1913) * The Sun's Babies (1913; illustrated by Frank Watkins) * Buttercups (1914) * Tales Out of School (1919) * The Singing Fish (1921) * Wonderwings and Other Fairy Stories (1921; illustrated by Alice Polson) * The Cradle Ship (1922; illustrated by Florence Mary Anderson) * The Rainbow (1922) * The Dream-Girl's Garden (1923; illustrated by Daisy Osborn) * Tales of Maori Magic (1928) * Silver Island (1928; illustrated by Kathleen Coales) * Safe Going (1931) * The Great Experiment (1932) * The Poppy Seed: And Other Nature Stories (1943) * Marlborough Sounds: The Waters of Restfulness * The Long Bright Land: Fairy Tales from Southern Seas References External links  * Category:1872 births Category:1954 deaths Category:English emigrants to New Zealand Category:New Zealand educators Category:New Zealand women writers Category:New Zealand writers ","title":"Edith Howes"},{"id":"34599046","text":"Craig Sandercock is an Australian rugby league coach who works as an assistant coach for the Cronulla Sharks in the NRL.

His artwork has been influenced by graffiti art and textual art and is often created in public space. In his artworks Jongeleen criticizes today’s over regulated society. Biography Jongeleen lives and works in Rotterdam and Paris. He studied at the AKI Academy for Art and Design in Enschede, where he graduated in 1994. In 1997 he moved to Rotterdam. Here he did one of his first interventions in public space. With a spray can he wrote the word ‘HOME’ on the outside wall of Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. He was arrested for this action, but it was the start of a close relationship with the museum. In 1999 he participated in the group exhibition Exorcism/Aesthetic Terrorism, 2000 in the Boijmans Van Beuningen.http://weblogs.nrc.nl/cultuurblog/2010/06/02/clandestien-exposeren- in-boijmans/ In 2003, Jongeleen moved to Paris where he stayed at Atelier Holboer. Here he expended his contact with the Paris pre-street art scene resulting into the Art of Urban Warfare. Jongeleen's street interventions carry the project name “influenza”, functioning as well as a semi-anonymous signature. The alias “Influenza” connotes his repeated attacks on the well- oiled social body, while qualifying the development of his artistic practice as a self-reflexive exercise engaged in feeding its own momentum.http://www.aptglobal.org/view/artist.asp?ID=4483 Works Jeroen Jongeleen's work generally evolves in public space. He leaves traces in the urban landscape which he documents with photographs and films. With his interventions he promotes the free use of urban public space and criticizes the way advertising, architectural structures and signs regulate public behavior. He chooses to counterattack by bringing subversive forms of creativity into publicity. In one of his projects Jongeleen created stickers of hands in different positions, which, when displayed in rapid succession, form a fluent motion. He spread the stickers in cities all around the world and made pictures of the places where he left them. In a documentary, showing the pictures in rapid succession, the individual interventions became a coherent whole. For another project Jongeleen collected plastic bags, which you can buy for 25 cents in every Dutch supermarket and mostly ending up as urban litter in the streets - collected them and replaced - but this time on a more glorious location: on the top of high buildings, flats and bridges in the city. With this project Jongeleen builds a bridge between art in public space and the side effects of the culture of mass consumption, questioning both. Jongeleen's work is clearly inspired by the ideas of the Situationist International (SI), a revolutionary group, founded in 1957, which reached its peak of influence in the general strike of May 1968 in France. During the Paris uprising the influential leader of this group was the writer and theorist Guy Debord (1931-1994). His influential and renowned work Society of the Spectacle is considered to be the cause for the uprising. Like the Situationists, Jongeleen turns against consumerism and over-regulated society by interrupting the public space. Utilizing means and visual forms associated with guerilla protest – graffiti, stickers and placard cut-outs – his interventions draw attention to a particular form of militant activism while questioning the nature, value and transformative potential of artistic production. In his exhibitions Jongeleen brings the street within the walls of the White Cube. His works are made of discarded hardboard on which short critical quotes are sprayed. Jongeleen finds these texts on websites such as Geen Stijl, Spitsnieuws and Retecool, which publicize sharp opinionated pieces focused on news, actual events and politics. On these websites Jongeleen selects opinions on contemporary art, spraying these quotes onto the surfaces of his artworks. By this Jongeleen tries to call attention to the public ideas on art. Next to his more textual work Jongeleen makes impressionist landscapes, which call to mind the spherical landscapes of Jacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael. Jongeleen however doesn't cover the white canvas with paint. He creates his landscapes with street dirt coming from shoe soles, bicycle tires and dirty fingerprints.

The title translates into English as The conversation of the two married women and the widow. History The poem dates to the late fifteenth or early sixteenth centuries and is written in the archaic form of alliterative verse rather than the rhyming verse more typical of Scots poetry of the time. It survives in The Chepman and Myllar Prints of 1508, held in the National Library of Scotland and, as a fragment, in the Maitland Manuscripts, held in the Pepys Library.W. Mackay Mackenzie (1932). The Poems of William Dunbar. It is also now available online archive of medieval texts in an annoted version (see External Links below). The poem describes an unnamed narrator's overhearing of a discussion between three women in a garden. The women speak frankly and at length of marriage and their experiences with their husbands. The discussion of sexuality is often in language which is earthy and uninhibited. The work ends with the narrator asking the reader, :Quhilk wald ye waill to your wif, gif ye suld wed one? or, in English, :Which would you choose for your wife, if you were to marry one? Synopsis =The Introduction= The narrator is walking alone in the country on a Midsummer night admiring the beauty of nature, :Apon the Midsummer evin, mirriest of nichtis, :I muvit furth allane in meid as midnicht wes past, :Besyd ane gudlie grein garth, full of gay flouris, :Hegeit of ane huge hicht with hawthorne treis, :Quhairon ane bird on ane bransche so birst out hir notis, :That never ane blythfullar bird was on the beuche hard. In a hedged garden he notices three women, :I saw thre gay ladeis sit in ane grein arbeir, :All grathit into garlandis of fresche gudlie flouris. :So glitterit as the gold wer thair glorius gilt tressis, :Quhill all the gressis did gleme of the glaid hewis, :Kemmit war thair cleir hair and curiouslie sched, :Attour thair schulderis doun schyre schyning full bricht, :With curches cassin thair abone of kirsp cleir and thin. He eavesdrops on their conversation, hoping for amusement. One of the women, a widow, asks her two younger, married companions about their opinion of marriage, :\\"Bewrie,\\" said the wedo, \\"ye woddit wemen ying, :Quhat mirth ye fand in maryage sen ye war menis wyffis. =The First Wife's speech= The first wife responds by telling the others about her unhappy marriage to an older, unattractive man. :I have ane wallidrag, ane worme, ane auld wobat carle, :A waistit wolroun, na worth bot wourdis to clatter, :Ane bumbart, ane dron bee, and bag full of flewme, :Ane skabbit skarth, ane scorpioun, ane scutarde behind, :To see him scart his awin skyn grit scunner I think, :Quhen kissis me that carybald, than kyndillis all my sorow. She adds that while he is a poor lover, he is also wealthy and generous. :And thoght his pené purly me payis in bed, :His purse pays richely in recompense efter, :For, or he clym on my corse, that carybald forlane, :I have conditioun of a curche of kersp allther fynest, :A goun of engranyt claith, right gaily furrit, :A ring with a ryall stane, or other riche jowell. =The Second Wife's speech= The second wife speaks next and tells the others that her husband is young but also lacking as a lover due to a lecherous past. :He is a young man ryght yaip, bot nought in youthis flouris, :For he is fadit full far and feblit of strenth. :He wes as flurising fresche within this few yeris, :Bot he is falyeid full far and fulyeid in labour, :He has bene lychour so lang quhill lost is his natur, :His lume is waxit larbar and lyis into swonne. He is vain and boasting. :He has a luke without lust and lif without curage, :He has a borme without force and fessous but vertu, :And fair wordis but effect, all fruster of dedis. She adds that she would like a new lover, :Ye speik of berdis on bewch, of blise may thai sing, :That, on Sanct Valentynis day, ar vacandis ilk yer, :Hed I that plesand prevelege to part quhen me likit, :To change, and ay to cheise agane, than, chastité, adew!, :Than suld I haif a fresch feir to fang in myn armes, :To hald a freke, quhill he faynt, may foly be calit. =The Widow's Speech= The widow speaks next. She begins by advising her friends to emulate her behaviour of adopting a gentle persona while remaining secretly ruthless. :I schaw yow, sisteris in schrift, I wes a schrew evir, :Bot I wes schene in my schrowd, and schew me innocent, :And thought I dour wes and dane, dispitous, and bald, :I wes dissymblit suttelly in a sanctis liknes, :I semyt sober, and sueit, and sempill without fraud, :Bot I couth sexty dissaif that suttilar wer haldin. She summarises this approach as, :Be dragonis baith and dowis, ay in double forme, :And quhen it nedis yow, onone, note baith ther strenthis, :Be amyable with humble face, as angellis apperand, :And with a terrebill tail be stangand as edderis. Her First Husband She reveals that she has been married twice. Her first husband, like that of the first wife, was an older man. :ane hair hogeart, that hostit out flewme, :I hatit him like a hund, thought I it hid prevé. She meanwhile had a younger lover, :I had a lufsummar leid my lust for to slokyn, :That couth be secrete and sure and ay saif my honour, :And sew bot at certayne tymes and in sicir placis, :Ay quhen the ald did me anger with akword wordis :Apon the galland for to goif it gladit me agane. She gave birth to a son, but confides that her husband was impotent by the time of his conception. She persuaded him to bequeath his property to the boy. :I wald him chuk, cheik and chyn, and cheris him so mekill, :That his chief chymys he had chevist to my sone, :Suppos the churll wes gane chaist or the child wes gottin. Her Second Husband Her second marriage was to a wealthy merchant, whom she considered to be socially inferior. :He maid me ryght hie reverens, fra he my rycht knew, :For, thocht I say it myself, the severance wes mekle :Betuix his bastard blude and my birth noble. She intimidated the man with constant reminders of his supposedly low birth. :I held ay grene into his mynd that I of grace tuk him, :And for he couth ken himself I curtasly him lerit, :He durst not sit anys my summondis, for or the secund charge, :He wes ay redy for to ryn, so rad he wes for blame. He is persuaded by her intimidation to will his property to her son. :Yit tuk I nevir the wosp clene out of my wyde throte, :Quhil I oucht wantit of my will or quhat I wald desir. :Bot quhen I severit had that syre of substance in erd, :And gottin his biggingis to my barne, and hie burrow landis, :Than with a stew stert out the stoppell of my hals, :That he all stunyst throu the stound, as of a stele wappin. She continued to dominate her husband, whom she refers to as 'wife', :I maid that wif carll to werk all womenis werkis, :And laid all manly materis and mensk in this eird. :Than said I to my cumaris in counsall about, :Se how I cabeld yone cout with a kene brydill! She obtained valuable possessions from him, :He grathit me in a gay silk and gudly arrayis, :In gownis of engranyt claith and gret goldin chenyeis, :In ringis ryally set with riche ruby stonis, She then promoted her own children while denigrating her husband's children. :I buskit up my barnis like baronis sonnis, :And maid bot fulis of the fry of his first wif. She didn't mourn his death. :Deid is now that dyvour and dollin in erd, :With him deit all my dule and my drery thoghtis, :Now done is my dolly nyght, my day is upsprungin, :Adew dolour, adew! my daynté now begynis, :Now am I a wedow, iwise, and weill am at ese. Her Widowhood Once widowed, she adopted traditional mourning customs, insincerely. :My mouth it makis murnyng, and my mynd lauchis, :My clokis thai ar caerfull in colour of sabill, :Bot courtly and ryght curyus my corse is ther undir. She took a secret lover. :I have ane secrete servand, rycht sobir of his toung, :That me supportis of sic nedis, quhen I a syne mak, :Thoght he be sympill to the sicht; he has a tong sickir. :Full mony semelyar sege wer service dois mak, :Thought I haif cair, under cloke, the cleir day quhill nyght, :Yit I have solace, under serk, quhill the sone ryse. She receives suitors, but does not take them seriously. :To every man in speciall I speik sum wordis, :So wisly and so womanly, quhill warmys ther hertis. :Thar is no liffand leid so law of degré, :That sall me luf unluffit, I am so loik hertit. :And gif his lust be so lent into my lyre quhit, :That he be lost or with me lig, his lif sall nocht danger. :I am so mercifull in mynd and menys all wichtis, :My sely saull sal be saif, quhen sabot all jugis. The widow ends her speech by encouraging her younger friends to learn from her experience. :Ladyis leir thir lessonis and be no lassis fundin, :This is the legeand of my lif, thought Latyne it be nane. =The Conclusion= The discussion ends with the married women acclaiming the widow as a good example for them: :Quhen endit had her ornat speche, this eloquent wedow, :Lowd thai lewch all the laif, and loffit hir mekle, :And said thai suld exampill tak of her soverane teching, :And wirk efter hir wordis, that woman wes so prudent. The narrator departs for his home and ends the poem with the question, :Of thir thre wantoun wiffis, that I haif writtin heir, :Quhilk wald ye waill to your wif, gif ye suld wed one?

He was the former Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Justice (1970–1977), Professor of Law at University of Hong Kong (1984–1997), Ariel F Sallows Professor of Human Rights at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada (1992–1993), and Executive Director of Transparency International (1997–2000). He is now an independent legal consultant, and has been the Coordinator of the UN-sponsored Judicial Integrity Group since 2000. Early life and education Nihal Jayawickrama was born to a family of lawyers. His father, Alfred Sudrikku Jayawickrama, was a solicitor in the southern city of Galle, and belonged to a family that included several solicitors, advocates, queen's counsel, judges, and a minister of justice. His mother's elder brother, T.C.P.Fernando, was a district judge, while her younger brother, Justice T.S.Fernando QC was Solicitor General, Attorney General, Judge of the Supreme Court and President of the Court of Final Appeal. Jayawickrama was educated at Richmond College, Galle and at the Royal College Colombo. Thereafter he entered the Law Faculty of the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, from where he graduated in 1961. While in the university, he was actively involved in two student strikes: one over poor staff-student relations, and the other that sought acceptance of the principle of a fair and just inquiry before a student was punished. He was called to the bar in 1962 after apprenticing in the chambers of A. H. C. de Silva, QC and C.Renganathan QC. Legal career He commenced his practice under Dr Colvin R. de Silva, and also worked in the chambers of Vernon Wijetunge QC, R.A.Kannangara, and S.Ambalavanar. He practised in both original and appellate courts, and appeared in several cases of political significance at the time involving constitutional, administrative, election and human rights law. In 1968, he was elected to the Bar Council to represent the junior bar, and in 1969 was elected its honorary secretary. In his annual report for that year, he described the judicial system of Ceylon at the time as “an antique labyrinth with tortuous passages and cavities through which the potential litigant must grope, often blindfolded, in his search for justice”. Jayawickrama was a founder member of the Ceylon Section of Amnesty International. Awarded a UNESCO Youth Leadership Grant in 1966, he studied the working of non-governmental organisations in western and eastern Europe, and was attached to the legal staff of the International Commission of Jurists, Geneva, then headed by secretary-general Sean MacBride. He was also the general secretary, and later president, of the UN Association of Ceylon, and vice-president of the World Federation of United Nations Associations, Geneva. =Government service= In 1970, at the age of 32, following the general election of that year, he was appointed Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Justice in the Government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. He held that office for the next seven years, except for a short period as Attorney General. During his tenure, extensive reforms were implemented in the court structure and to simplify civil, criminal and appellate procedures. A unified legal profession was established by the fusion of advocates and proctors (solicitors). Conciliation boards were established in every judicial district. He played a major role in the establishment of a Criminal Justice Commission for the trial of over 16,000 persons who were arrested, or had surrendered, in the wake of the 1971 JVP Insurrection, and was then responsible for overseeing their rehabilitation and return to society. He was vice-chairman of the Sri Lanka Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, a Member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, Member for Sri Lanka on the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee, and Vice-Chairman of the Fifth UN Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders. He was a member of the committee appointed to draft the 1972 Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka, a member of the Judicial Service Advisory Board appointed under that Constitution, and later served as legal adviser to the members of the Opposition in the Select Committee of the National State Assembly that drafted the 1978 Constitution. Jayawickrama's tenure in the ministry of justice was not free of controversy. The decision that all legal work of state corporations should be handled by a new division in the Attorney-General's Department was met with strong opposition from lawyers of the ruling party to whom such work had previously been distributed. The radical procedural reforms were resisted by powerful sections of the legal profession and the judiciary. His proposal to regulate legal fees evoked a strong protest from senior lawyers, and the expansion of conciliation procedures from which lawyers were excluded led to the reduction of court cases by almost 50 per cent, another extremely unpopular measure among the legal profession. His attempts to ensure that judges applied the rules relating to time limits for oral submissions in the appellate courts led to an open confrontation between him and the chief justice and an extended “cold war” between the supreme court and the ministry of justice. Following the change of government in 1977, Jayawickrama resigned his office and left for London where he was appointed a Research Fellow at King's College, University of London. In 1978, while on a visit to Sri Lanka, his passport was impounded and proceedings against him were commenced before the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed by the new government to investigate the alleged abuse and/or misuse of power by the previous government. Among the 45 charges laid against him were that he promoted the concept of \\"barefoot lawyers\\" (\\"thereby undermining the legal profession\\"), instituted an annual public dialogue between the executive and the judiciary in the form of a \\"judges' conference\\" (\\"thereby undermining the independence of the judiciary\\"), and refused to authorise solitary confinement for remand prisoners when requested to do so by the CID (\\"thereby interfering with criminal investigations\\"). After a seven-month inquiry at which he was defended by S.Nadesan, QC with J.C.T. Kotelawela and Faiz Mustapha, he was found guilty on most charges, and in 1980 after a two-day debate, Parliament imposed \\"civic disabilities\\" on him. Accordingly, he was prohibited from seeking election to parliament, holding public office or making political speeches for seven years. In the same year, after two other short inquiries, civic disabilities were similarly imposed on the Leader of the Opposition, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, and the leading opposition politician, Felix R. Dias Bandaranaike. In 1986, all three received unsolicited free pardons from the president. Academic career Venturing into academic life, Jayawickrama researched the international law of human rights under Professor James Fawcett, President of the European Commission of Human Rights. His research was incorporated in Paul Sieghart's pioneering work, The International Law of Human Rights, published by Oxford University Press in 1983. In the same year, he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the University of London (School of Oriental and African Studies) for his research on the application of international human rights law. In 1985, after a short spell as Associate Director of the Marga Institute in Colombo, Dr Jayawickrama joined the Faculty of Law of the University of Hong Kong, where he served as a Professor of Law until 1997. He taught constitutional and administrative law, and introduced a course on human rights law. He chaired the Hong Kong Section of the International Commission of Jurists and was the principal commentator on constitutional, judicial and human rights issues in that territory in the period preceding the transfer of sovereignty. He was intimately involved in the processes that led to the drafting and enactment of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights and the establishment of Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal. In 1989, he accompanied Beijing student leader Li Lu to brief the UN Human Rights Sub- Commission on the “Tiananmen Massacre” and, with other colleagues and non- governmental organisations, was successful in securing the adoption of a resolution that “expressed concern at recent events in China” and requested the secretary-general to submit a comprehensive report on the events that had occurred in Tiananmen Square. He regularly contributed a weekly column on current affairs to the Hong Kong Standard. In 1992–93, he occupied, on invitation, the Ariel F Sallows Chair of Human Rights at University of Saskatchewan, Canada, an award made for \\"distinguished contribution to research in or practice of human rights\\". In 1996, Dr Jayawickrama, whose contract was due to end on 30 June 1997, was invited by the vice-chancellor, Professor Wang Gungwu, to apply for an extension under a scheme that was designed to encourage expatriate academics to remain in Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty to China. However, in 1997 he was informed by the new vice-chancellor that his contract would not be renewed. A commentator describes the event thus: “Nihal Jayawickrama, an expert in constitutional law at the University of Hong Kong who taught a popular course in international human rights, was invited by the university to apply for an extension of his contract after it expired, coincidentally, on 30 June 1997. Then, following a series of trenchant newspaper articles in which he questioned the legality of the provisional legislature and moves to repeal sections of the Bill of Rights, he was told he no longer met the minimum criteria for reappointment. Students who expressed dismay were called in for ‘briefings’ by university administrators. One of the first acts of the vice-chancellor of the university, Professor Cheng Yiu-chung, appointed in early 1997, was to order democracy slogans, originally painted by students following the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, and regularly repainted since, to be obliterated.\\" Later work In October 1997, following his controversial and much publicised departure from the University of Hong Kong, Dr Jayawickrama was appointed Executive Director of Transparency International in Berlin. In 2000 he moved to the United Nations Centre for International Crime Prevention in London and worked as a Co-ordinator of the UN sponsored Judicial Integrity Group. He served as general counsel, and coordinated a programme on strengthening integrity systems in seven countries in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Since 2000 he has been an independent consultant on governance, judicial reform and anti-corruption strategies. His work, under UN or EU auspices, has involved collaboration with several governments, legislatures and judiciaries, including those of Libya, China, the Russian Federation, Lebanon, Nigeria, Kenya, the Seychelles, Turkey, Afghanistan, Iraq, Sierra Leone, Indonesia, the Pacific Island States, the Philippines, Armenia and Egypt. He coordinated a pilot survey of court users and stakeholders in Sri Lanka to identify the nature and extent of corruption in the judicial system, and prepared a judicial ethics curriculum and manual and conducted training sessions for judges in Nigeria. He has served on expert groups that developed a UN Technical Guide on Strengthening Judicial Integrity and Capacity; a UN anti- corruption tool-kit; a UN Technical Guide to Promote the Implementation of the UN Convention Against Corruption; and an ICJ framework for preventing and eliminating corruption in judicial systems. Nihal Jayawickrama is the Coordinator of the UN-sponsored Judicial Integrity Group which comprises 15 Chief Justices or Senior Justices representing the different legal systems of the world. The Group is mandated to formulate a concept of judicial accountability consistent with the principle of judicial accountability. Among its achievements so far are the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct (which was approved by the UN Commission on Human Rights in 2003 and endorsed by ECOSOC in 2007), the Commentary on the Bangalore Principles, and the Implementation Measures. He was the Rapporteur of the Round-Table Meeting of Chief Justices convened at the Peace Palace at The Hague that adopted the Bangalore Principles in 2002. Dr. Jayawickrama also works with the United Nations as a member of the Advisory Board of the Global Judicial Integrity Network at the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. He is a member of the Legal Advisory Board of the US-based Genetics Policy Institute, and was the Chair of the Trustees of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, London. He presented the keynote paper on the impact of corruption on human rights at the 2006 UN Conference on Good Governance and Human Rights in Warsaw, and was a member of the advisory group on the project on Corruption and Human Rights of the International Council on Human Rights Policy, Geneva. Dr Jayawickrama is the author of The Judicial Application of Human Rights Law: National, Regional and International Jurisprudence (Cambridge University Press, 2002). [2] He is also the author of the Human Rights Law and Constitutional Law Titles in Halsbury's Laws of Hong Kong (Butterworths, 1981). He has published widely in refereed books and journals, and made presentations in over 40 countries on a range of issues relating to human rights, constitutional law, judicial integrity and governance. In 1997, he was invited to give evidence before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade of the Australian Parliament on matters relating to the transfer of Sovereignty over Hong Kong, and in 2004 he gave expert evidence on the impact of judicial corruption on the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments before the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, Canada. Family He married Sarojini Amarasuriya, the daughter of Senator Thomas Amarasuriya, President of the Senate, in 1965. Sarojini is the author of 'Writing that Conquers – Re-reading Robert Knox, 'An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon' (Colombo, Social Scientists Association, 2004). They have two daughters. Their elder daughter, Nishana Jayawickrama, who is married to Antony Jackson, is Adviser and Head, Asia and Europe, in the Political Affairs Division of the Commonwealth Secretariat, London. Their younger daughter, Sharanya Jayawickrama, who was married to Barry Crosbie, was an Assistant Professor at Hong Kong Shue Yan University until her death in September, 2019.

In other words, it asks whether the inputs to a given Boolean circuit can be consistently set to 1 or 0 such that the circuit outputs 1. If that is the case, the circuit is called satisfiable. Otherwise, the circuit is called unsatisfiable. In the figure to the right, the left circuit can be satisfied by setting both inputs to be 1, but the right circuit is unsatisfiable. CircuitSAT is closely related to Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), and likewise, has been proven to be NP-complete. It is a prototypical NP-complete problem; the Cook–Levin theorem is sometimes proved on CircuitSAT instead of on the SAT and then reduced to the other satisfiability problems to prove their NP-completeness.See also, for example, the informal proof given in Scott Aaronson's lecture notes from his course Quantum Computing Since Democritus. The satisfiability of a circuit containing m arbitrary binary gates can be decided in time O(2^{0.4058m}). Proof of NP- Completeness Given a circuit and a satisfying set of inputs, one can compute the output of each gate in constant time. Hence, the output of the circuit is verifiable in polynomial time. Thus Circuit SAT belongs to complexity class NP. To show NP-hardness, it is possible to construct a reduction from 3SAT to Circuit SAT. Suppose the original 3SAT formula has variables x_1,x_2,\\\\dots,x_n, and operators (AND, OR, NOT) y_1,y_2,\\\\dots,y_k. Design a circuit such that it has an input corresponding to every variable and a gate corresponding to every operator. Connect the gates according to the 3SAT formula. For instance, if the 3SAT formula is (\\\\lnot x_1\\\\land x_2)\\\\lor x_3,the circuit will have 3 inputs, one AND, one OR, and one NOT gate. The input corresponding to x_1will be inverted before sending to an AND gate with x_2,and the output of the AND gate will be sent to an OR gate with x_3. Notice that the 3SAT formula is equivalent to the circuit designed above, hence their output is same for same input. Hence, If the 3SAT formula has a satisfying assignment, then the corresponding circuit will output 1, and vice versa. So, this is a valid reduction, and Circuit SAT is NP-hard. This completes the proof that Circuit SAT is NP-Complete.  Restricted Variants and Related Problems  = Planar Circuit SAT = Assume that we are given a planar Boolean circuit (i.e. a Boolean circuit whose underlying graph is planar) containing only NAND gates with exactly two inputs. Planar Circuit SAT is the decision problem of determining whether this circuit has an assignment of its inputs that makes the output true. This problem is NP-complete. In fact, if the restrictions are changed so that any gate in the circuit is a NOR gate, the resulting problem remains NP-complete. = Circuit UNSAT = Circuit UNSAT is the decision problem of determining whether a given Boolean circuit outputs false for all possible assignments of its inputs. This is the complement of the Circuit SAT problem, and is therefore Co-NP-complete. Reduction from CircuitSAT Reduction from CircuitSAT or its variants can be used to show NP- hardness of certain problems, and provides us with an alternative to dual-rail and binary logic reductions. The gadgets that such a reduction needs to construct are: * A wire gadget. This gadget simulates the wires in the circuit. * A split gadget. This gadget guarantees that all the output wires have the same value as the input wire. * Gadgets simulating the gates of the circuit. * A True terminator gadget. This gadget is used to force the output of the entire circuit to be True. * A turn gadget. This gadget allows us to redirect wires in the right direction as needed. * A crossover gadget. This gadget allows us to have two wires cross each other without interacting. = Minesweeper Inference Problem = This problem asks whether it is possible to locate all the bombs given a Minesweeper board. It has been proven to be CoNP- Complete via a reduction from Circuit UNSAT problem. The gadgets constructed for this reduction are: wire, split, AND and NOT gates and terminator. There are three crucial observations regarding these gadgets. First, the split gadget can also be used as the NOT gadget and the turn gadget. Second, constructing AND and NOT gadgets is sufficient, because together they can simulate the universal NAND gate. Finally, since we can simulate XOR with three NANDs, and since XOR is enough to build a crossover, this gives us the needed crossover gadget. The Tseytin transformation The Tseytin transformation is a straightforward reduction from Circuit-SAT to SAT. The transformation is easy to describe if the circuit is wholly constructed out of 2-input NAND gates (a functionally-complete set of Boolean operators): assign every net in the circuit a variable, then for each NAND gate, construct the conjunctive normal form clauses (v1 ∨ v3) ∧ (v2 ∨ v3) ∧ (¬v1 ∨ ¬v2 ∨ ¬v3), where v1 and v2 are the inputs to the NAND gate and v3 is the output. These clauses completely describe the relationship between the three variables. Conjoining the clauses from all the gates with an additional clause constraining the circuit's output variable to be true completes the reduction; an assignment of the variables satisfying all of the constraints exists if and only if the original circuit is satisfiable, and any solution is a solution to the original problem of finding inputs that make the circuit output 1. The converse—that SAT is reducible to Circuit-SAT—follows trivially by rewriting the Boolean formula as a circuit and solving it.

The independent film stars Jennifer Connelly, Greg Kinnear, Lily Collins, Nat Wolff, and Logan Lerman. It focuses on the complicated relationships between a successful novelist, played by Kinnear, his ex-wife (Connelly), their college daughter (Collins), and teenage son (Wolff). The film began a limited theatrical release in the United States on July 5, 2013. Plot Novelist and part-time teacher Bill Borgens has been floundering since his wife Erica left him for a younger man two years ago. Instead of working on a new book, he spies on Erica and her new husband Martin while pretending to be jogging. Bill's son Rusty is a high school student in love with a classmate named Kate but lacks the courage to talk to her. Bill's daughter Sam is a cynical college student who prefers one-night stands and hook-ups with people she knows are less intelligent than herself, in order to shield herself from love. On Thanksgiving, Bill has a reluctant Rusty set a place for Erica. At dinner, Sam announces that her first novel has been accepted for publication. Bill, having raised his children to be writers from birth, is thrilled, but becomes annoyed when she admits the book is not the one he had been helping her write. Rusty goes to have Thanksgiving with Erica and Martin, but Sam refuses, citing Erica's betrayal of Bill. While at a bar, Sam's classmate Lou tries to prevent her from initiating another hook-up. Despite being rebuffed, he continues to pursue her and eventually strong-arms her into a cup of coffee. While discussing their favorite books, Sam is unnerved by their similar tastes in literature and runs off, refusing to be roped into a relationship. When Lou stops coming to the writing seminar they both attend, Sam tracks him down to the house where he takes care of his mother, who is dying. Sam is humbled by this and agrees to go out with Lou. When they discuss Sam's novel she reveals that a scene in which the main character sees her mother having sex with a man on the beach was about Erica and Martin. When Martin worried if Bill might see them, Erica replied, \\"I don't care.\\" While listening to Lou's favorite song Sam begins to cry, afraid of being hurt. Lou tells her he won't hurt her, and they share a kiss. Rusty reads a poem in class about an angel. Bill reads Rusty's journal, which he has paid both Sam and Rusty to keep over the years. When Rusty catches him, Bill says that Rusty needs to really experience life in order to become a better writer. Rusty and his friend Jason bribe their way into a party held by Kate's boyfriend, Glen. Rusty inadvertently sees Kate and Glen doing cocaine in the bathroom, leaving him dispirited. He and Jason are about to leave when they witness Kate and Glen arguing; when Glen shoves Kate to the ground, Rusty punches him in the face and flees with Kate and Jason. Since Kate can't go home bruised and high, Rusty brings her to his house. While tucking her into bed, she asks Rusty if his angel poem was about her; he admits it was. They share a kiss and begin a relationship. On Christmas Day they have sex in his closet, which she believes neither of them will forget (as it is Rusty's first time). Rusty, inspired by Kate's cocaine use, gives her a copy of It, his favorite novel, and she gives him her favorite album. At the same time Kate struggles with her drug addiction; while visiting Erica's house, she rifles through a medicine cabinet and is on the verge of stealing prescription drugs when Erica walks in on her. Bill has regular sexual liaisons with his married neighbor, Tricia (Kristen Bell), with whom he occasionally jogs. However, he continues to mope over his failed marriage. While Christmas shopping he runs into Erica and they talk over coffee. He tells her that, if given a second chance, he would be a much better husband, leaving Erica visibly uneasy. Tricia urges him to move on and begin dating again, helping him dress better and creating an online dating profile. After going on a somewhat successful date, he stops by Erica's house and peeks in her window. Seeing her read a book, he leaves his wedding ring as a sign that he has moved on. However, he does a double take and realizes she is reading one of his own books. Heartened, he takes back his ring. Sam has a party for the launch of her book, where Bill makes a speech about the process of writing, quoting What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, his favorite book. Erica is invited by Lou, but is clearly uncomfortable and avoids conversation. Bill encourages her to talk to Sam, who pretends not to know her when signing Erica's copy of her novel. When Sam gives Kate champagne—unaware of Kate's addiction and ignoring the fact that she's underage—Kate goes back for more and eventually goes home with Gus, one of Sam's classmates. The Borgens track her down; Bill and Erica barge into Gus's apartment and find her asleep in his bedroom after a night of drinking and doing drugs. As Kate is loaded into the car, Rusty lifts the blanket covering her and realizes she had sex with Gus, which leaves him in tears. Heartbroken, Rusty turns to alcohol and comes home drunk almost every night. While at a convenience store with Jason he runs into Glen, who chases down and beats him. Kate writes Rusty a letter apologizing and telling him she's in rehab, having realized the only person who could truly fix her is herself. She hopes that one day she could be worthy of somebody like him. Bill, worried about Rusty, tells him to channel his pain into his writing. Rusty asks if he did the same when Erica left, prompting Bill to ground him. Rusty writes a story entitled \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\" (after the Beatles song of the same name, which he told Sam he hears when thinking of Kate) and finds it therapeutic. Later, he gets a call from Stephen King, his favorite author, who tells him that Sam sent his story to King, who had it published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Bill reveals to Sam that he walked out on Erica when Sam was a baby, and that when he came back six months later she accepted him, having waited the whole time. He promised that if she ever left him, he'd give her a second chance. When Lou's mother dies, Sam realizes how much her mother means to her and they tearfully reconcile. A year later, Bill shows he's moved on from Erica by not setting a place for her at the table for Thanksgiving. As the family sits down to eat, joined by Lou, Erica arrives and tearfully asks if there is a place for her. She joins them at the table and Rusty announces his story is being published. While the family celebrates, Bill again quotes from What We Talk About When We Talk About Love: \\"I could hear my heart beating. I could hear everyone's heart. I could hear the human noise we sat there making, not one of us moving, not even when the room went dark.\\" Cast * Greg Kinnear as Bill Borgens * Jennifer Connelly as Erica * Lily Collins as Samantha Borgens * Logan Lerman as Louis * Nat Wolff as Rusty Borgens * Kristen Bell as Tricia Walcott * Liana Liberato as Kate * Stephen King as himself (voice only) * Spencer Breslin as Jason * Patrick Schwarzenegger as Glen * Rusty Joiner as Martin Production Stuck in Love started shooting in Wilmington, North Carolina in March 2012, primarily in the Wrightsville Beach area.

The island's Māori name is Okaihe. History Green Island may be the 'Isle of Wight' where the Sydney sealer Brothers, chartered by Robert Campbell and sailing under Robert Mason, dropped eight men of a gang of eleven in November 1809. William Tucker, who later settled at Whareakeake (Murdering Beach) near Otago Heads, was in the gang. Alternatively the 'Isle of Wight' may be Taieri Island, a few kilometres to the south. It has also been suggested that, alternatively, Green Island may be the 'Ragged Rock' where the other three men of the Brothers gang were landed. Some of the men claimed to have stayed on these two islands from 9 November 1809 until 20 December 1810.Peter Entwisle, Taka: a Vignette Life of William Tucker 1784-1817, Dunedin, NZ: Port Daniel Press, 2005, p.54 & pp.110-115. Green Island used to be called St Michael's Mount, suggesting it had been named after the island of that name off the Cornish coast. It is more likely it was so named after Tommy Chaseland's mother ship the St Michael when he was sealing there in the 1820s. He told Edward Shortland he lost a boat and all its hands when it was dashed on the island while trying to land. He stayed alone overnight and was picked up by another boat the following day.Edward Shortland, The Southern Districts of New Zealand; a Journal, London, UK: Longman, Brown, Green & Longmans, 1851 reprinted by Capper Press, Christchurch, 1974, pp.153-4. In the 1880s the island was mined for guano, bird dung used as fertiliser. Important Bird Area The island is a nesting site of yellow-eyed penguins The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area, by BirdLife International because it is home to breeding colonies of yellow-eyed penguins and bronze shags.BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Gree Island (Okaihe). Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2012-02-04. Legacy The uncleared native forest on the island lends its name to similar \\"Green Island\\" native forest on the nearby mainland, on the Otago Peninsula. In turn, the name has been applied to Green Island, a community in the territorial authority called Dunedin City, on the peninsula.

She was originally powered by a 75 hp Penta P62 but is now powered by a 320 hp Volvo Penta motor. Estrella was confiscated by the Germans during the German occupation of Norway and was at the disposal of Reichkommisar Josef Terboven. King Haakon VII of Norway had been promised a Royal Yacht when he accepted the Norwegian throne in 1905, but this would not come through until 1947 when he was given the HNoMY Norge. In 1945 the Royal Court therefore acquired Estrella and named her Stjernen after the previous Stjernen I which had also been confiscated by the Germans but was returned as a wreck. The present Stjernen is still in use by the King and his family and, like Norge, Stjernen is manned by a crew from the Royal Norwegian Navy. The crew consist of three seamen and one junior officer who live aboard 14 days at a time. The names of the two Stjernens are somewhat complexe. From 1899 to 1940 the original Stjernen was named just Stjernen. In 1945 this boat was no longer operational and was no longer called Stjernen.

In 1549 John Albert I saw to it that the parliament of Mecklenburg carried through the Reformation for the entire Duchy. Life John Albert was born in Güstrow, the eldest son of the Duke Albrecht VII of Mecklenburg- Güstrow and his wife Anne of Brandenburg. Until the age of 13, he was educated by the \\"papist vicar\\" Johann Sperling. In 1539, his father sent him to the court of his uncle, the protestant Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg, where he was educated together with the Elector's son John George. From 1541 to 1544, they attended the newly founded University of Frankfurt an der Oder together. John Albert was a devout supporter of Protestantism when he returned to Mecklenburg. Nevertheless, he fought on the imperial side in the Schmalkaldic War, at his father's request. When his father died in 1547, John Albert and his brothers Ulrich III and George were jointly invested with the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Güstrow by Emperor Charles V. Initially, John Albert administered the Mecklenburg-Güstrow part of the Duchy alone, while Ulrich administered the Bishopric of Schwerin from 1550 as successor to his cousin Magnus III and George fought in the Schmalkaldic War and fell in 1552 before Frankfurt am Main. Reformation and Court Order' of 1568 by John Albert I As a convinced adherent of Protestantism John Albert I, unlike his father, decided to back the introduction the Reformation in his lands. In 1549 he presided over a meeting of the Estates in Sternberg, which prescribed the Lutheran faith for all parts of Mecklenburg. This can be seen as the official introduction of Lutheranism as the state religion in Mecklenburg. In February 1550, he concluded a defensive alliance with Margrave John of Brandenburg-Küstrin and Duke Albert of Prussia, to whose daughter, Anna Sophia, he was engaged and later married. On 22 May 1551, John Albert concluded the secret Treaty of Torgau with the other Protestant princes in northern Germany. This treaty formed the legal framework for the Princes' rebellion of 1552 against Emperor Charles V, in which John Albert I participated. His uncle Henry V, who ruled Mecklenburg-Schwerin, died in 1552 without a male heir. When John Albert's brother Ulrich then claimed the inheritance, the Emperor objected. A violent inheritance dispute erupted. Ulrich forced John Albert to consent to the Treaty of Wismar of 11 March 1555. The dispute was finally resolved in 1556 by the Edict of Ruppin by Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg. This edict made John Albert I regent of the western part of Mecklenburg, while Ulrich received the eastern part, the former Lordship of Werle, while maintaining a common state government. Ulrich chose Güstrow as his residence. Duke John Albert was considered a modern Renaissance prince and a patron of the arts and sciences, with an open mind for the scientific discoveries of his time. He committed himself to the Reformation and modernized the state. He possessed an extensive library, which eventually came into the possession of the University of Rostock. He was interested in scientific instruments and in astronomy and cartography. He employed Tilemann Stella as his court librarian and cartographer. They jointly visited the imperial court in Vienna, where they studied architecture and modern fortification techniques, which they subsequently applied in Mecklenburg. The Ducal Court in Wismar and the expansion of various ducal castles and modern fortifications date back to John Albert's intentions, although he did not always have sufficient resources to finance his efforts. Among his major achievements are the creation of several high schools: in Güstrow in 1552, in Schwerin in 1553 and in Parchim in 1554. He died in Schwerin. Marriage and issue Princess Anna Sophia of Brandenburg On 24 February 1555 he married Anna Sophia of Prussia (11 June 1527 - 6 February 1591), the daughter of Duke Albert of Prussia.

By the end of the 15th century they were highly assimilated with the Slavs and lost their language or were at least bilingual, while some communities managed to preserve and continue to speak their language (Istro-Romanians). Later in the 16th and 17th century with the Ottoman conquest and mass migrations, the term was primarily used for a socio-cultural and professional segment of the population rather than to an ethnicity, and referred to the mostly Slavic- speaking emigrants and refugees from Ottoman-held territories to the Habsburg Empire (such as Croatia) and Republic of Venice (Dalmatia), mostly of Eastern Orthodox faith, lesser Catholic. With the nation-building in the 19th century this population played a significant part in the national ideologies in Croatia and Serbia, and according to religious confession espoused either Croat or Serb ethnicity. In Croatia today, \\"Vlachs\\" is a recognized national minority (along with 22 other ethnic groups), with 29 individuals declared as Vlachs in the 2011 Croatian census, making them the smallest recognized minority in Croatia. Other Eastern Romance-speaking ethnic groups, that were also traditionally referred to as Vlachs in Croatia, now identify by their respective ethnic names – namely Romanians, Aromanians and Istro-Romanians (which are native to modern Croatia's Istria County). Appellation The meaning of the term \\"Vlach\\" within the territory of present-day Croatia (like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia) differed over time and had multiple meanings. In the Middle Ages it was primarily an exonym that referred to Romance-speaking pastoralist communities in the mountains, or rarely other Romance-speaking people like Italians. Due to their specific lifestyle, the term acquired a social-professional (shepherds) connotation. In the 13th and 14th centuries the shepherds of the Balkans were called Vlachs (Vlasi), including Slavic-speakers. Initially it was used for shepherds and transporters in the hinterland regardless of ethnicity and religion (though often Romance-speaking), strangers and newcomers as opposed to natives (in Istria, for speakers with Shtokavian traits), for hinterlanders by Dalmatian island inhabitants, for rugged villagers by the townspeople, and later for Orthodox Christians (with time mostly identified with Serbs). From the 16th century, with the Ottoman conquest and mass migrations of Slavic-speaking people, the term \\"Vlach\\" was primarily used for a socio-cultural and professional segment of the population, rather than to an ethnicity. The Vlachs were distinguished by their semi-nomadic pastoral way of life as economically transhumant shepherds, mainly of sheep, goats and horses. Such a lifestyle allowed specific socio-cultural traits, like learning about the area, orientation during multi-day movement, organization and wartime skills, which was recognized and used already by the Late Medieval nobility and kings. They lived in extended families (as per the Western Balkan type), and were organised into local communities (knežine), and were bearers of a strongly patriarchal culture associated with the Dinaric Alps. Among characteristic cultural traits were wearing dark clothes, use of the gusle musical instrument (that accompanied epic singing), Ojkanje singing, While the Slavic communities managed to form national identities founding regional provinces and kingdoms, Romance-speaking Vlachs didn't manage to form a national identity and were prone to assimilation. However, even if they were prone to national, linguistical and cultural assimilation with the Slavs, they did contribute to their respective communities. The problems the Vlachs faced with the creation of the national identity did not differ very much from what other rural communities face. Rural people comprised the majority of the population in the Middle Ages, and the centuries of war, conquest, regional boundaries, migrations, religious conversions, cultural blending and socio-economic problems affected the belonging of a population to a specific South Slavic national group. The regions of Lika (which mostly involved the Croatian Military Frontier) and Dalmatia were the border area between Habsburg, Ottoman and Venetian empires, a place of mass migrations and mixing of communities. In the area, the confessional, socio-cultural and geo-regional characteristics had a crucial impact on the creation of an ethnic identity. The equalization between religious confession and ethnicity began in the middle of the 16th century when the Serbian Orthodox Church (Patriarchate of Peć), which had a significant religious and political influence on Serbs, started since 1557 to identify Orthodoxy with Serbdom. Gradually in the 17th century, as Croatian culture was preserved by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Senj-Modruš in Croatia, and the Franciscan Province of Bosna Srebrena in Ottoman Bosnia, the Roman Catholicism was identified with the Croatian national name. The socio-cultural difference was a lifestyle distinction between the natives (Catholic, peasant, smaller families) and the newer migrants (Orthodox, pastoralist, larger families) from Ottoman and Venetian territory who were referred to as Vlachs in the social sense, and their \\"Vlach\\" identity was mainly in the context of claiming the traditional legal rights and privileges of their social class by the state. =Medieval usage= The Vlachs mentioned in medieval documents up until the 16th century, before the Ottoman invasion and migrations, were the progeny of Romanized Illyrians and Thraco-Romans, other pre-Slavic Romance- speaking people, and after arrival in the 6th-8th centuries also of Slavic people. Some Romance-speaking groups were autochthonous in Croatia and assimilated with Slavs, some were assimilated but preserved their identity and name, while some other groups migrated from Herzegovina to Dalmatia in very late 14th century. With the arrival of Slavs, Vlachs began to assimilate with them, and being exposed to the Slavic language they gradually began to adopt it as their own. Raymond D'Aguilers and William of Tyre during the passage of the Crusaders in the 11th century pointed at the difference between the people who live in hilly hinterland, speak Slavic and deal with grooming of the cattle, from those in the coast who still speak Latin language (probably extinct Dalmatian language) and have different customs. In documents from Lika (1433), Cetina (1436), and Zrmanja (1486–87), a century after their first mention in Croatian historical documents, the Vlachs had mostly non-Christian, traditional South Slavic names and surnames. On that note, the Vlachs mostly differed from the Croats who usually had Christian names. The Vlachs were called as \\"Vlasi na Hrvateh\\", \\"good Vlachs\\" (dobri Vlasi), \\"good men from katuns\\" (dobri muži katunari), or \\"royal Vlachs\\" (Olahi domini nostri regis, Wolachi banatus regni Croatie). However, despite this cross-pollination of language some groups of Vlachs may have remained distinct from the Slavs; historical sources from the 14th-15th century differ Slavs and Vlachs in the area of Kotor, Dubrovnik, Bosnia and Croatia (Slavi et Vlachy, Vlachy et Bosgniani, Serbi et Vlachi). In 1345, in Cetina Croati et Olachy are differed, while in a 1436 document, Catholic Vlachs of the county of Cetina (around the town of Sinj) were represented as distinct from both the Croats and the Serbs inhabiting the county. In 1450, in the area of Šibenik were differed Morlachi ac Hervati. In a book by Ragusan historian Ludovik Crijević (1459-1527), Writings on the Present Age, Vlachs (Valachos) were distinguished from other people, and were mentioned as \\"nomadic Illyrians who in the common language are called Vlachs\\" and there is also the mention of the present-day surname Kožul/lj in \\"Cossuli, a kind of Illyrian people considered Romans\\". During the Orthodox migration to Žumberak in 1538, general commander Nikola Jurišić mentioned the Vlachs who \\"in our parts are called as Old Romans\\" separate from the Serbs and Rascians. During the 14th century, Vlach settlements existed throughout much of today's Croatia, but centres of population were focused around the Velebit and Dinara mountains and along the Krka and Cetina rivers. The Vlachs were divided into common Vlachs from Cetina and royal Vlachs from Lika. The Vlach population lived on the territory of noble families; of Nelipić (Cetina–Knin), Šubić (Pokrčje), Gusić (Pozrmanje), and Frankopan (Lika). Between 1400 and 1600 many Vlach families had settled Istria and island of Krk. The Frankopans settled Vlachs on the island of Krk (Dubašnica, Poljica) in the 15th century, and later around Učka. The Venetian colonization of Istria started not later than the early 1520s, and there were several cases when they returned to Dalmatia. Drawing of a Ćić, an Istrian Vlach from 1891. They and other Vlachs in northern Istria were called Ćići. The mountain Ćićarija consequently got named after its inhabitants. The Vlach people distinctively lived a nomadic life as shepherds and as traveling merchants on trading routes. They lived in villages, and hamlets called katun (ro. cătun), smaller village-like places in the mountains and lower areas where they dwelled during the transhumant period. The 1436 document (Vlach law) confirmed in Klis by ban Ivan Frankopan beside clear ethnic diversity in the Cetina county showed that there were two social groups of Vlachs, those with villages who pay tax, and those without villages who are nomads and thus obligated to serve in the army as horsemen. According to Stjepan Pavičić (1931), the Romance Vlachs or Morlachs of the Dinara and Velebit lost their Romance language by the 14th or 15th century, or were at least bilingual at that time. The so-called Istro-Romanians, called by themselves Rumeri or Vlasi, continued to speak their language on the island of Krk (extinct in the 20th century; recorded Pater Noster) and villages around the Čepić lake in Istria, while other communities in the mountains (Ćićarija) above the lake preserved the Shtokavian-Chakavian dialect with Ikavian accent from the southern Velebit and area of Zadar. The documents about Vlachs from Cetina county indicate Chakavian dialect with Ikavian accent. The evidence of their Romance language are toponyms throughout the Dinaric Alps, and many anthroponyms (surnames) with specific Romance or Slavic word roots, and Romanian ending suffixes found among South Slavic people. The \\"Vlach\\" or \\"Romanian\\" traditional system of counting sheep in pairs do (two), pato (four), šasto (six), šopći (eight), zeći (ten) has been preserved in Velebit, Bukovica, Dalmatian Zagora, and Ćićarija until today. =Early modern usage= Socioculturally, there were two main ethnic divisions in the Croatian Military Frontier, those of the \\"native\\" Croats and \\"immigrant\\" Vlachs. The Croats were Catholics, Habsburg subjects, made up of an agrarian population concentrated around frontier towns, of nuclear families, and linguistically predominantly Chakavian-speaking (or Chakavian-based speech). The Vlachs, regardless of their religious affiliation, were refugees from Ottoman and Venetian territories, holders of patriarchal-pastoral culture of the Dinaric, of extended families, and linguistically Neo-Shtokavian speaking. The holders of Balkan Patriarchate were mostly three socio-ethnic groups: Albanian, Vlach and Slavic.Karl Kaser, 2003, POPIS Like i Krbave 1712. godine, http://www.skdprosvjeta.com/pdf/9.pdf #page=30 The Vlachs from Lika were predominantly Orthodox Christian by religion, and also, the traditional social grouping of Vlachs was the Orthodox group itself. The Orthodox Vlachs from Lika area spoke the Eastern Herzegovinian ijekavian dialect while the Catholic Vlachs (the Bunjevci), spoke the Western Herzegovinian ikavian dialect. The Vlachs were also called on some occasions as Rasciani sive Serviani and Valachicae seu Rascianae gentis, which was an exonym for the Serbs or Orthodox Christians. In the 1500–1800 period in Europe, the religious difference was one of the main cultural differences in ethnic groups. The state triangle at Lika in what is today Croatia was an area in which Roman Catholicism, Serbian Orthodoxy, and Islam met. Orthodox Vlachs from the middle of the 16th century gradually became part of the Serbian ethno-confessional identity, but this identity was fully consolidated only after 1695. Croatian historian Marko Šarić notes that the Lika-Krbava Vlachs can be seen as one of the sub-ethnies of the pre-modern Serb ethnic group. The Serb–Rascian attributes points on the attachment of Vlach Orthodox communities to the wider pre-modern Serb ethnocultural corps. However, although in some documents from the 16th and 17th centuries the Habsburg Imperial Court used the terms Vlachs, Rascians and Serbs as synonyms (indicating their Orthodox confession), the socio-cultural and ethnological evidence on the ground doesn't support such a simplified interpretation of the ethnic identity of Orthodox Vlachs.According to Mirko Markovic Vlach population from Slavonia needs well distinguished from ethnic Serbs who come to Srijem, Banat, Backa and eastern Slavonia in the late 17th and early 18th centuries as fugitives from southern Serbia.Mirko Marković, 2002, Slavonia, settlement history and origin of population, https://www.scribd.com/document/44987478/Mirko-Markovic-Slavonija-Povijest- Naselja-i-Podrijetlo-Stanovnistva #page= 559-560 J. W. Valvasor in his 1689 work which described the Carniolan–Croatian area of the Croatian Military Frontier and the Maritime Frontier, differed between Croats and Vlachs (whom he also called Uskoks and Morlachs), and called the latter's Shtokavian language \\"Vlach\\" (Walachische) which he said was close to the \\"Dalmatian\\" (Dalmatische) and \\"Slavonian\\" (Schlavonische) languages. In Venetian usage for Dalmatia, the Slavic language was called Illyrian (Illirico) or Serbian (Serviano). At the time of the Morean War (1684–89) Vlachs fled Ottoman-held Lika and temporarily settled as 1,700 families in Venetian Dalmatia, and 530 families in the Karlovac Generalate (Croatian Military Frontier). Since 1690, they, and some Vlach families from Dalmatia and Bosnia, began to return to their original provinces in Lika and Krbava. With them in 1694 arrived Serbian Orthodox metropolitan who established the Lika–Krbava (Ličko-Krbavska) and Zrinopolje (Zrinopoljska) eparchies. =Anthroponymy= The data on Lika and Krbava in 1712–14 censuses was studied by Croatian historian Marko Šarić who also divided pre-modern ethnic groups (etnije) into Orthodox Vlachs (Serbian Orthodox) listed in the census as Schismatics (Schismatische Wallachen, Walachi, Wolochi), Catholic Vlachs (Bunjevci), Carniolans (Kranjci), Croats and Turks (Catholicizated former Muslims), based on Zagreb bishop Martin Brajković's earlier groupings.Marko Šarić, 2009, Predmoderne etnije u Lici i Krbavi prema popisu iz 1712./14.{In census 1712./14. population was divided into Catholics (Chatolici, Catholiken, Römisch Catholischen) and Orthodox (Schismatische Wallachen, Walachi, Woloch). Walachi, Wolochi, Wallachen is a synonym for schismatics, i.e. Orthodox Christian.}https://www.pilar.hr/wpcontent/images/stories/dokumenti/lika/lika_1_mail_r_325.pdf#page=360 The statistical categories were minimal to socio-religious and military and economic aspects of the population, but including a list of 713 surnames it is an important source for onomastics, and to comprehend the ethnic identity of the population. The majority of nobility in Lika consisted of Catholic Croats, while the vast majority of population were Vlachs (Serbian Orthodox). By confessional affiliation the Serbian Orthodox (Vlachs) numbered 71% of the total population in Lika and Krbava while Catholics overall 29%. According to ethnic structure by dual model, 87% of Lika-Krbava population belonged to the Vlachs of social and cultural history. According to ethnic structure by model of five nations Orthodox Vlachs numbered 71%, Bunjevci (Catholic Vlachs) 16%, Carniolans 6%, Croats 4% and Turks (Muslims converted to Catholicism) 2%. The future studies have found that at the beginning of the 20th century only 60–64% of the surnames were preserved, with mostly Carniolian surnames vanished. The \\"Turk\\" surnames indicate an Islamic-\\"Oriental\\" influence, and most are Muslim-patronymic. The \\"Carniolian\\" surnames indicate a Kajkavian cultural and regional sphere, and are characteristically mostly occupational, many linguistically Germanic, some permeate with other dialects, and they have the smallest share of the ending suffix \\"-ić\\". The \\"Croat\\" show an arhaic age, many are mentioned in the Middle Age and the 15th and 16th centuries, before the Council of Trent, while some are from the second half of 16th and 17th centuries of Dinaric origin. The anthroponymic structure in surnames of Orthodox Vlachs and Catholic Bunjevci was very similar, while the pastoral (Dinaric) culture, Neo-Shtokavian speech, and social and military role in the frontiers created uniform anthroponymic forms. The religious confession wasn't crucial to the pattern of surnames as patronymic surnames of Catholic or Orthodox character were also found in the opposite confessional group of the mentioned. A very large number of surnames were derived from Slavic word roots \\"-vuk\\", \\"-rad\\", \\"-mil\\", and it was also noted that matronymic surnames and nicknames were more present in the Vlach group than in the others. Some 20% were of \\"Old Balkanic\\" origin, of Romance root words (and Slavic suffixes \\"-ić\\", \\"-ac\\", \\"-an\\", \\"-en\\", \\"-elj\\") or Romance suffixes (\\"-ul\\", \\"-as\\", \\"-at\\", \\"-ta\\", \\"-er\\", \\"-et\\", \\"-man\\"), and also some found derived from Illyrian–Thracian root words or with Albanian suffixes (\\"-aj\\" and \\"-eza\\"). Despite the fact that Velebit Vlachs (Morlacs) were mostly Croats and Catholics, among them exist and real Romanians, we see this from their surnames such as \\"Bučul, Čutul, Prendivoj, Hamet, Kapo, Sebikoč, Cako, Delebrajde, Čepulado.\\" Spicijarić Paškvan, Nina; (2014) Vlasi i krčki Vlasi u literaturi i povijesnim izvorima (Vlachs from the Island Krk in the Primary Historical and Literature Sources) p. 351; Studii şi cercetări – Actele Simpozionului Banat – istorie şi multiculturalitate, =Religion= Pope Gregory IX in letter from 14 November 1234 for king Béla IV of Hungary noted that the \\"Vlachs, although by name are considered Christians... have rituals which are hostile to the Christian name\\". Pope Gregory XI in letter from 1372 for Franciscans in Bosnia ordered to convert Vlachs who live in tents and pastures (Wlachorum... quorum nonnulli in pascuis et tentoriis habitant), also relating to the activity of the Bosnian Church (also see Stećaks). Scholar Bogumil Hrabak emphasized that there's no need to insist on the religious affiliation of the pastoralist communities in the Balkan, especially the Vlachs. Living in closed transhumance communities they changed religious affiliation according to the regional religion (Roman Catholic or Orthodox) where lived for a prolonged time, and if weren't followed by the specific priest. Their ignorance and lack of Christian Church commitment are seen in the case of Vlachs who were settled in Žumberak (the 1530s), who begged commander Johann Katzianer to be Christianized. Orthodoxy as such was also more akin to them rather than feudal Roman Catholicism which dogma did not allow to embrace as many pagan beliefs like in Orthodox Church. History =Middle Ages= Reference to the existence of Vlachs or Romance-speaking people in Medieval Croatia dates from the early Middle Age; One of the first mention of Vlachs is the 1071 charter by the Croatian King Krešimir IV about the Rab diocese, when on the island of Pag the village Wlasici (today village Vlašići) was mentioned, but is considered a forgery from the late 12th and early 13th century. In the Libellus Policorion, church cartular dated in the mid 14th century that includes transcriptions of older collected documents about estates of now extinct Benedictine Abbey of St John the Evangelist in Biograd and Saints Cosmas and Damian on the island of Pašman, is mentioned one Kutun (Katun) district. Vlachs can be traced by personal names and peculiarly by ending suffix \\"-ul\\" in Dalmatian cities documents since the 10th century. The sudden appearance of the Vlachian name in the historical documents is due to the official introduction of specific rights in the notary books for taxation and trade only from 1307. Morlach region in the 17th century. The first collective reference of Vlachs, or Morlachs in some Latin and mostly Venetian and Italian documents, dates from the early 1320s (almost 900 years after Slavic migration); in 1321, a local priest from Dobrinj on the island of Krk granted land to the church (\\"to the lands of Kneže, which are called Vlachian\\"), while in 1322 they and people of Poljica were allied to Ban of Croatia, Mladen Šubić, who fought against Croatian pretenders at the Battle of Bliska in the hinterland of Trogir. In 1344 are mentioned Morolacorum in lands around Knin and Krbava, within the conflict of counts from Kurjaković and Nelipić families, and that they can shelter their livestock on islands of Rab, Hvar, and Brač. In 1345 are mentioned in the charter by king Louis I of Hungary to Nelipićs, to whom was confiscated Knin in exchange for Sinj and other forst in Cetina county with all \\"with their inhabitants, Croats and Vlachs\\". In 1352, in the agreement in which Zadar sold salt to the Republic of Venice, in which Zadar retained part of the salt that Morlachi and others exported by land. In the 1357 charter of Šibenik was imposed a provision that Vlachs mustn't use without authority the city lands for pasture. In 1362, the Morlachorum, unauthorized, settled on lands of Trogir but were allowed to use it for pasture for a few months. In 1383, Vlachs around Šibenik, which partially belonged to the Queen Elizabeth and noble Ivan III Nelipić, were causing problems, and citizens wrote to the Queen asking for help. The Queen warned the Ban of Croatia, Emerik, and ordered him to send Vlachs away from the city lands and take fines from them, from which a part to be given to the citizens. In 1387, when nobles from the family Budislavić from Krbava confirmed with a charter the privileges of the citizens of city Pag, was determined that Vlachs musn't use the city lands for pasture. In the Statute of Senj dating to 1388, the Frankopans mentioned Morowlachi and defined the amount of time they had for pasture around river Gacka when they descended from the mountains. Example of Vlach/Morlach medieval tombstone Some scholars consider that to the alleged Vlachian migration in the 14th century to the Dalmatian Zagora preceded black death which enabled permanent Vlachian colonization and pasture of animals on desolated land. This migration would be followed with the sudden appearance of stećak tombstones in the Cetina county, showing the cultural specificity of the newly arrived communities. The particular appearance of the stećaks indicate separate socio-cultural identity, to whom afterlife was important, as well socio-professional prosperity for such valuable burials. In the 1376 and 1454 documents by Republic of Dubrovnik about trade with Bosnian lands are distinguished Vlachi et Bosgnani. In Bosnian documents are first mentioned in c. 1234 by ban Matej Ninoslav, and from 1361 up to 1417 were mentioned royal Vlachs of Bosnian bans and kings. On 13 April 1411, Bosnian Duke Sandalj Hranić sold the Croatian town Ostrovica, which was a gift from King Ladislaus of Naples to the Republic of Venice. A year later on 10 April 1412, the Murlachos (probably in service of King Sigismund) captured the Ostrovica Fortress from Venice. In August 1417, Venetian authorities were concerned with the \\"Morlachs and other Slavs\\" from the hinterland, that were a threat to security in Šibenik. In 1405 and 1421, morolakis seu olakonibus and wolachos sugari lived on the lands of Ostrovica Lička, today near Gospić in Lika. During the 15th century, the Vlach population in Croatia expanded so significantly that they were sometimes mentioned as a distinct entity along the Croatians. In 1412 King Sigismund bestowed the Sinj county and Travnik fortress to Ivan III Nelipić, and mentioned that Croats and Vlachs were at his disposal (cum universis Croatis et Vlahis). In the so-called Pašman Breviary (1431) were distinguished Croats and Vlachs enslaved by the Turks. On 6 August 1432, the Ragusians reported to King Sigismund that the Turks had invaded into the Croatian lands, and captured many Croats and Vlachs. In 1432, on the order of King Sigismund, Morlachs were required for military service and to gather at the Ban's camp where they were joined by the \\"whole of the Croatian Kingdom and co-existing forces of the Vlachs\\". In 1433 was released document which defined relation between \\"good Vlachs\\" and Church of St. Ivan on the Hill in Lika, mentioning Vlach judicial court, and that \\"not one Vlach among us brother Croat Vlachs will carry out any evil on the said property\\". The sale of Dalmatia on 7 April 1433 by King Sigismund to the Republic of Venice earned him the enmity of Ivan Frankopan. With death of last Nelipić in 1435, Frankopan convinced the Vlachs to side with him by promising them the resurrection of old \\"Vlach Laws\\" (previously given by Nelipić's). Law for parish of Cetina given by Ivan Frankopan on 18 March 1436 distinguishes Vlachs from Croats and Serbs and determines that the Vlachs have their own knez. These laws dated from the middle of the 14th century and included many personal rights for the Vlachs. According to the \\"Vlach Laws\\", Vlachs that chose to follow Frankopan received various privileges, such as serving under Vlach commanders instead of Croatian ones, crimes committed in the town of Sinj would be judged by a Vlach magistrate rather than a Croatian one, the Croatian prince of Cetina would not be permitted to appoint a voivode (prince) over them and Croats were restricted to having only one Vlach as their shepherd. Encouraged by these promises, the Vlachs attacked nearby littoral towns under Venetian control, but in 1436 on behalf of king Sigismund, Ban of Croatia Matko Talovac waged war against Ivan Frankopan who didn't manage to survive. As they previously supported Frankopan, Vlachs from Cetina now were persecuted, resulting on 2 July 1436 informing the Vlachs of a peace treaty between Talovac and Venice that had been signed that forbade further attacks on Venetian towns, but it wasn't always respected. The persecution was also in part due to the new conflict between Talovac and herzog Stjepan Vukčić Kosača who at the time had capital in Imotski. Kosača managed to conquer in 1440 Omiš and Poljica, but lost them to Venice in 1444. From this time are dated stećaks from Bisko. In 1444 conflicts between Talovac and Vlachs again re-emerge, with estates of Vlachs Mikul Dudanović, Radoj Gerdanić and their siblings being given to the widow of Šimun Keglević. This resulted with the migration of Morlachs from the Talovac estates in Cetina to Poljica under Venice control in 1446. The Vlachs of Lika were ruled by Croatian princes and bishops, while Vlachs who lived along the Cetina river were more autonomous and were governed by Vlach princes, dukes and judges. They also paid more favorable taxes and were free from paying for pasture for their cattle. However, they were not completely free citizens and faced restrictions such as prohibitions on becoming court witnesses, jurors and officers. Their rights were contained in the \\"Vlach Paper\\" from 1476, which itself is an extension of the \\"Vlach Laws\\" from 1436. Both of these were written in Cyrillic and kept in the Franciscan monastery in Trsat. Also, during this period, large numbers of Vlachs were traded or used as gifts between Croatian nobles, and local churches. In the summer of 1448 during warfare around Šibenik city's authority complained in Venice about Morlachs and Croats who subordinate with Ban of Croatia. In 1463, in the župa of Vrlika were mentioned Vlachs from the de genere Thwlich (Tulić), gifted by the King Matthias Corvinus to the local Croatian nobel Ivan Čubretić. In 1481, by the king some Vlachs were settled in Lika. In 1486-87 were mentioned at the Zrmanja river region, around the Kegalj-grad, because of land disputes with nobles Keglević. In the late 1480s are mentioned in Dubašica and Poljica on island Krk, \\"corvati et morlacchi\\". In 1504 document from Krk mentions \\"...every Christian, nobleman and peasnt, Vlach or Croat\\". In the 1504 document about war tributes, besides from Vrlika, were also mentioned Vlachs from Knin (Tinninienses), Obrovac (Obrowacz) and Nutjak. Another group or Vlachian term besides Morlachs was Ćići (ger. Tschitsche). In the early 15th century was mentioned as a surname in Istria, while in 1463 by priest Fraščić as a group who under Ivan Frankopan plunder Istrian territory beneath mountain Učka. In 1499, the Carinthian parish priest Jakob Urnest mentioned a territory Czyschnlandt between Croatian and Bosnian kingdoms, which some consider to be the Cetina river region in southern Croatia. In penal records of Trieste from the year 1500 contain an inscription of an accused who, when asked of his home country, replied Ciccio da Segna (Senj), while another man declared himself as Ciccio da S. Michele di Leme (Lim valley in Istria). In 1523 and 1527, in the estate of Lupoglav were settled Tschizen aus Krabatten. In 1528, Tschitschen were mentioned in regard of possible settling in Modruš and other lands as a resistance against Martolosi. In 1530, they were prohibited to purchase grain in Novo Mesto and Metlika in Lower Carniola. In 1539, royal commissioner Erasmo von Thurn submitted a request by Ćići to King Ferdinand if they could be given some deserted land on karst and Istria. Also, previously in 1530 general commander Nikola Jurišić mentioned Vlachs who were commonly called Ćići (Valachi, quos vulgo Zytschn vocant), while Slovenian diplomat Benedikt Kuripešič in his travel through Bosnia mentioned his use of Zitzen and Zigen as exonym, along Vlach and Martolosi, for the Serbs and Orthodox immigrants in Bosnia which came from Smederevo and Greek Belgrade (Smedraw and griechisch Weussenburg). In October 1538, captain of Bihać Erazmo Thurn wrote to King Ferdinand I that Ćići from Istria (die issterreichischen Zittschen), who were around Ottoman occupied Obrovac, moved to king's land with many men and 40,000 cattles. =Ottoman conquest and Austrian Empire= Vlach migrations to the Austrian Empire from the Ottoman Empire, and vice versa, were generally caused by the loss of financial status or privileges of Vlach laws, rather than from any form of ethnic or religious persecution. Usually the migrations were caused or performed in periods after turbulent events, like Battle of Mohács (1526), the conquest of Dalmatia (1522), Lika and Krbava (1527-28), and subsequent battles. Many Vlachs served in Ottoman armies during their conquests. As part of the military, they often served either as light cavalry or infantrymen, or irregular soldiers (martolosi). However, since the movements of large Ottoman armies towards Inner Austria were rarely routed through Croatia-Slavonia, and military actions were focused on the vicinity of Jajce and Bihać, the role of the Uskok-Vlachs spying on the Ottomans was particularly important. In the 15th century after the fall of the Bulgarian Empire under the Sultan's rule much of the Vlachs arrived in the area between Drava and Sava (Slavonia of that time) and a part of them continued their journey across the Drava to Hungary.Ladislav Heka, 2019, The Vlach law and its comparison to the privileges of Hungarian brigands, https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id;_clanak_jezik=325892 #page=31 Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries Christians on the Balkan Peninsula fled from the Ottomans to Austrian, Hungarian and Venetian territories, Orthodox Slavs and Vlachs fled into Bosnia and Herzegovina and Dalmatia or they fled across the Danube.Marie-Janine Calic; (2019) The Great Cauldron, History of Southeastern Europe p. 79; Harvard University Press, Ottoman Vlachs who colonized Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, western parts of Bosnia and Hungary in some extent were Catholic, it can be seen in Venetian and Habsburg sources (Morlachi Catholici in Dalmatia and Rasciani catolici, Katolische Ratzen, Meerkroaten, Illiri, Horvati etc. in Croatia and Hungary).Vjeran Kursar; (2013) Being an Ottoman Vlach: On Vlach Identity (Ies), Role and Status in Western Parts of the Ottoman Balkans (15th-18th Centuries) p. 129; Journal of the Center for Ottoman Studies - Ankara University, 24, 34; 115-161 The Serb, Vlach and Uskok colonization of Žumberak started between 1526 and 1538,Arnold Suppan, Maximilian Graf; (2010) From the Austrian Empire to Communist East Central Europe p. 58-59; LIT Verlag, at the same time when in Ottoman-conquered lands Vlachs laws were canceled until 1550, partially or altogether, causing migration because of social and financial status. In June 1531, around 1,000 Vlachs, advised by Ivan Katzianer, settled in Kostel and Polajna, along the Kupa River near Žumberak, of which 700 were fit for military service. King Ferdinand I in September 1538 responded to general commander Nikola Jurišić, who informed him about some Servian or Rascian captains and dukes who are willing to come with their people to serve in military service, that they were given privileges. In October of the same year, Jurišić informed the King that the Ban Petar Keglević and other nobles came from Ottoman-conquered territory around the river Cetina with many Sirfen (Serbs). In the same letter, Jurišić informed the king about the Vlachs who \\"in our (Croatian) parts are called as Old Romans\\" (alt Römer genennt), and that came with others from Turkish parts (river Zrmanja), to be given the same promises and privileges which were given to the Serbs. In November, Ferdinand wrote to Keglević about \\"captains and dukes of the Rasians or the Serbs, and the Vlachs who are commonly called the Zytschy (Ćići)\\". Serbs from Cetina part of the 1538 migration were taken care of by captain of Bihać Erazmo Thurn and his men, Croatian Ban Petar Keglević, and counts of Slunj, Zrinski, and Blagaj. Military service becomes the main occupation of the new population. Croatian Military Frontier in 1868. In 1530, Vlachs from Lika and Srb, Unac and Glamoč came under Turkish rule. Catholic Vlachs in Prilišće and Rosopajnik settled in 1538, while in 1544 came under the protection of Nikola Šubić Zrinski. Around 1530, in lands of Stjepan Frankopan from Ozalj, in Otok and Hreljin, were settled some Vlachs who in 1540 were mentioned for rewarding by King Ferdinand because of successful spying on Turks. With the growing number of the Ottoman Vlachs passing over the Christian side, the Vlach leader from Glamoč, Ladislav Stipković, traveled to Ljubljana to offer his service, and those of his forces, to the Austrians. In a later battle, the combined forces of the army from Bihać and the Vlachs defeated an Ottoman army at Bihać. In 1551, general Ivan Lenković reported to Ferdinand how Turks settled thousands of Morlachs and Vlachs around Srb, and Kosovo field near the town of Knin. In 1560, the towns of Lišnica and Novigrad along with large parts of the Una valley, Bušević and the Krupa river, were captuered, and settled with newcomers from Bosnia. In 1560, some Vlachs were settled around Ivanić-Grad, Križevci and Koprivnica. Orthodox Vlachs were also directed to settle in Lika when Arnaud Memi-Bey became commander of Lika Sanjak. The Beylerbey of Bosnia, Hasan-Pasha Predojević, himself an Islamized Orthodox \\"Vlach\\" from Herzegovina, received the support of these Orthodox Vlachs and many served in his armies. At Predojević's order, Vlachs, as well as some Turkish nobility, settled near the towns Brekovica, Ripča, Ostrvice and Vrla Draga near Sokolac in such numbers that they formed a significant population of this region. In 1579, Vlachs in Turkish service wanted to transfer the towns of Cazin and Ostrožac to Christian, that is Croatian, ownership. In 1599, many Vlachs emigrated from Korenica and Bihać area to Gomirje. In 1585, the general from Karlovac, Josip Turn, proposed Vlach settlement in Moravice, and later in 1597 general Lenković led Vlachs from Lika to Gorski Kotar and lands owned by Frankopan family. In Frankopan estate arrived yet again in 1609, and 1632. In 1605, General Vid Kisel brought Vlachs from Ostrožac to Ogulin and Bosiljevac, and some time later, Vlachs from Uzorac and Turje settled in Karlovac. In 1609, two burgs, Brlog and Gusić- Grad, were given by Senj captain and Croatian nobleman Sigismund Gusić to accommodate newly arrived Vlachs in exchange for their military service. In 1639, Nikola Frankopan of Tržac accused Senj captain Albrecht Herberstein of settling Catholic Vlachs (Bunjevci) at his deserted estates in Jablanac, Starigrad, and Orthodox Vlachs in Brinje and Brlog, without his permission. The same happened with Zrinski in Ledenice. Under Ottomans during the bishopric of Marcijan Lišnjić (1661–86) around Blato and Broćno/Brotnjo in Herzegovina were mentioned \\"Croatian Vlachs\\". Spalato, Théodore Valerio, 1864. After the Ottomans were defeated in Vienna in 1683, the Vlachs scattered throughout the Croatian Military Frontier. Concerned about this, Turks decided to settle them on the south side of the Una river, but were unable to execute this plan. During this period, Ottomans were vulnerable to Vlach raids from Banija and Karlovac. Vlachs, under the protection of the Ban of Croatia Miklós Erdődy and General Ivan Josip Herberstein, were also settled around Petrinja, Glina, Skradin, Vojnić, Krstinje and Budačko. After the magnate conspiracy (1670), executions and confiscation of Frankopan and Zrinski families estate, Vlachs were settled under permission of Frontier generals. The abandoned village of Plaški was settled in 1666, while 120 families settled below the Budački fortress, in 200 houses between Skrad, Slunj, Veljun, and Blagaj in 1686. With the liberation of Lika and Krbava in 1689, Vlachs from Kupres, Grahovo and Plavno near Knin returned to the region. Thirty individuals from Plaški were transferred to Jasenice in 1705, and 158 families were settled in the vicinity of Budački in 1711. In 1791, after the Treaty of Sistova, Orthodox Vlachs settled in new territory from Maljevac to Srb and the triangle border of Lika regiment, noted as the last of such migrations. In the Ban's Croatia Vlachs mostly settled in the 17th century. In 1680 around 120 families were settled. In 1688 Vlachs settled in Bović, Kirin, and Gradišće. In 1718, noblewoman Marija Magdalena Drašković settled some Vlachs on her estate between the Tršca stream and village of Utinja. In 1750, an Orthodox priest and witnesses confirmed Vlachs didn't exist before around Kupa, Steničnjak, Petrova Gora and Slavsko Polje, but only around Hrvatska Kostajnica. They numbered around 4000 people. In Slavonia, Friedrich Wilhelm von Taube wrote in the 18th century that there many Vlachs mixed with \\"Illyrians\\" (Croats and Serbs) and that have adopted their \\"Illyrian\\" (Slavic) language. In Dalmatia the Morlachs were immigrants who settled in the Venetian-Ottoman border, in the hinterlands of coastal cities, and entered Venetian military service, in the late 16th and early 17th century. In 1593, provveditore generale Cristoforo Valier mentioned three nations constituting the Uskoks, the \\"natives of Senj, Croatians, and Morlachs from the Turkish parts\\". At the time of the Cretan War (1645–69) and Morean War (1684-99), a large number of Morlachs settled inland of the Dalmatian towns, and Ravni Kotari of Zadar. According to Venetian censuses, in 1761, Orthodox Christians were 31,211 of the total population numbering 220,287; in 1771, 38,652 out of 223,765; in 1781, 51,996 out of 236,997. The settlement of the Vlachs in Croatia was beneficial to the Austrian Empire as the Emperor was reluctant to return the Military Frontier to Croatia. Further settlement of Vlachs was encouraged by the Austrian Government, but this antagonised the Sabor (the Croatian Parliament) and resulted in the passing of various laws, on 21 February 1629, guaranteeing certain privileges to the Vlachs. For example, any Vlach willingly becoming a subject of the Kingdom of Croatia was exempt from becoming a serf, rendering Vlachs almost equal with native Croatians. The laws enacted by the Emperor of the Austrian Empire and Sabor are collectively known as Statuta Valachorum. The exemption of the Vlachs from serfdom can be compared to the same exemption for native Croats, which was not applied until 1848 during the rule of Josip Jelačić. To ensure cooperation from the Vlachs, Austrian generals conducted a propaganda campaign focusing on Vlach serfdom under Croatian rule. This activity prevented the Croatian envoy to the Austrian court, Benedikt Vinković, who was there to consult on the \\"Vlach question\\", from pursuing a union of the Vlach-settled Military Frontier with Croatia. Legacy Many scholars consider that the \\"Vlachs\\" since the 16th century referred to pastoralists (social status) being a common name for Serbs and other Slavs in the Ottoman Empire and later. Tihomir Đorđević considered that the Vlach didn't only refer to genuine Vlachs or Serbs but also to cattle breeders in general. Bogumil Hrabak emphasized that not all cattle breeders and shepherds in the Balkans were called Vlachs, an example being the Arbanasi. According to Zef Mirdita, there's a clear distinction between the Serb ethnic community and the Vlachs as seen in Serbian medieval documents mentioning \\"Vlachs\\" separately from \\"Serbs\\", and for example the prohibition of intermarriage between Serbs and Vlachs by Emperor Stefan Dušan (in Dušan's Code). However, as argued by John V. A. Fine Jr., \\"a more detailed examination of the code shows that it was in fact occupational\\". Mirdita noted that the Vlachs were always mentioned as an ethnic group and were in the process of Slavicization which wasn't completed in the 15th century. On the basis of documents from the 13th to the 15th century it is evident that the Vlachs were considered by the Serbs as \\"others\\" i.e. different from themselves. Orthodox Vlach groups whose migrations were not accompanied by an ecclesiastical infrastructure were Catholicised and assimilated. According to Marko Šarić, the Serb identity was finalized among the Orthodox Vlachs in Lika and Krbava after the establishment of the Serbian Orthodox eparchies of Zrinopolje and Lika-Krbava in 1695, which would be later unified into the Eparchy of upper Karlovac. He noted that the Catholic Vlachs (i.e. Bunjevci) were integrated into the Croatian nation. In a study about Western Balkans household and families, Austrian historian of historical anthropology Karl Kaser argued a Catholic Vlach origin of Bunjevci who became absorbed in Croat community while Orthodox Vlach was absorbed in Serbian community. The exact ethnic identity of the Frontier Vlachs (and ancestors of the Krajina Serbs) is complex and until now unexplained without at least some national ideologies and mythologization which emerged in the 19th century. Some older sources like, Belsazar Hacquet (1739–1815) noted that although some call the Vlachs as Serbs, the Croats are their actual descendants. In the work About the Vlachs from 1806, Metropolitan Stevan Stratimirović stated that Roman Catholics from Croatia and Slavonia scornfully used the name Vlach for \\"the Slovenians (Slavs) and Serbs, who are of our, Eastern confession (Orthodoxy)\\", and that \\"the Turks in Bosnia and Serbia also call every Bosnian or Serbian Christian a Vlach\\". Scholars like Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, Ferdo Šišić, Vjekoslav Klaić, Petar Skok, vaguely argued according to the ideologies of the time, that the Vlachs lacked national consciousness, belonged to Serbs or Croats, that Orthodoxy made them Serbs, or that due to them being mainly Orthodox the Roman Catholic priests started to identify them with the Serbs/Rascians which eventually got adopted. Hrabak emphasized that South Slavic scholarship and Serbian nationalists tried to neglect or minimize the contribution of Vlachs in their ethnogenesis and history because the old-Balkan element insulted their idea of pure Slavs. Jaroslav Šidak noted that due to receiving derogatory connotation in Historija naroda Jugoslavije II (1959) the issue was avoided by writing a lowercase \\"vlachs\\" in the meaning of a social term. Some international scholars like Noel Malcolm consider that Bosnian Serbs have a large element of non-Slavic ancestry (Vlachian) and that national concept of Croats and Serbs are 19th- and 20th-century constructs. Similar view has Ilona Czamańska, who also considers that Serbisation of the Vlachs is connected with the system of the Ottoman state through military duty which was indirectly supported by the Ottoman rule because the Vlachs belonged under the civil authority of Serbian Orthodox Patriarch. The dispersion of Orthodox Vlachs and Serbs in the present-day territory of Croatia, who mostly inhabited the historical borderland Military Frontier (Krajina), were a cultural, linguistical, and political factor used by extreme ideologies from both Serbia and Croatia. Drago Roksandić and Marko Šarić noted that the modern South Slavic national revival and historiography since the 19th century tried to see and interpret its own national history through the present-day situation, like an \\"ethnocentric mirror that shows the present\\". The picture they tried to give about the Vlachs was most commonly simplified, uncritical, and acted constructed, resulting with historiographic disputes. Croatian nationalist historiography claim that the Vlach Orthodox settlers in the Military Frontier were not all ethnic Serbs. Extreme Croatian historiography (including Ustashe propaganda) tries to completely neglect Serb component, contribution or origin of Vlachs. According to Ivo Banac Orthodox Slavicized Vlachs gradually acquired Serb national consciousness because most of South Slavic Orthodox Christians belonged to Serbian Patriarchate of Peć with whom these Vlachs assimilated through their church organization. Others like Mirko Valentić claim that the Vlachs were Serbianized only in the 19th century. The Vlach origin of the Roman Catholic Bunjevci because of well integration in the Croatian corpus was ignored. Meanwhile, in Serbian historiography all Dinaric and Shtokavian cultural-linguistic attributes were without exception proclaimed as being Serbian, and also often stressed the ethnic-demographic discontinuity wanting to prove that the Croatian Military Frontier lost its original Croat population and received a new and ethnically Serb majority population, and also downplayed Croat and overemphasized the importance of the Serbs in the history of the Military Frontier. Serbian historiography strongly considered that the term Vlach indicated status and not ethnos, and that they didn't exist in later centuries as an ethnic group, yet were true Serbs. Sima Ćirković noted that the name was maintained due to different crafts, way of life and distinct form of social organization, until the differences lost their meaning, with Slavicization process lasting for centuries; he considered that Serbs absorbed many Vlachs and other ethnic groups. Many Serbian scholars, including foreign, claim that the settlers in the Military Frontier were Serbs or mainly Serbs. According to Zlatko Kudelić, term \\"Vlach\\" has a broader meaning and denotes entire Krajina population but also is and confessional label for orthodox Grencers who are called in Serbian historiography as Serbs regardless of their different origin.Zlatko Kudelić; (2017) “Statuta Confiniariorum Varasdinensium” iz 1732. godine: latinski i kajkavski tekst(in Croatian) p. 30; Povijesni prilozi, In recent decades, the extent in which Orthodox Vlachs and Serbs lived in previous centuries (Military Frontier, Srijem, Baranja etc.) by Serb separatists was seen as a borderline between Croatia and self-proclaimed autonomous regions within Croatian territory, the SAO Krajina, SAO Western Slavonia and SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia, and eventual Republic of Serbian Krajina (1991-1995), during the Croatian international recognition and War in Croatia which lasted from 1991 until 1995. Croatian historian Drago Roksandić claimed in 1991, before the war escalated, that until today, the \\"Vlach question\\" (Vlaško pitanje) had caused and still caused many disagreements between experts and non-experts in ex-Yugoslavian countries, as well as in the other Balkan countries with Vlach communities. The Vlach heritage has had a remarkable impact on modern Serbs, Croats and Bosnians.

In 2010, the International Press Institute named him a World Press Freedom Hero for his work. Work with The Point On 16 December 1991, Pap Saine co-founded The Point along with Deyda Hydara and Babucarr Gaye; Hydara and Saine had been friends since childhood. Gaye resigned four months later, and Hydara and Saine ran the paper together for the next decade. Saine also worked as a Reuters correspondent for West Africa. On 14 December 2004, the Gambia passed two new media laws. One, the Criminal Code (Amendment) Bill 2004, allowed prison terms for defamation and sedition; the other, the Newspaper (Amendment) Bill 2004, required newspaper owners to purchase expensive operating licenses, registering their homes as security. Hydara announced his intent to challenge these laws, but on 16 December, was assassinated by an unknown gunman while driving home from work in Banjul. Hydara's murder was never solved. The following year, he was posthumously awarded the PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award. Following Hydara's death, Saine continued to edit The Point, making it a daily in 2006. The Point soon became the only independent newspaper in the Gambia. 2009 arrests On 2 February 2009, Saine and Point reporter Modou Sanyang were arrested by Gambian police for suspicion of \\"publishing and spreading false information\\". Sanyang was released with a warning, but Saine was formally charged. According to the Media Foundation of West Africa, the arrests had been prompted by a Point story titled \\"Arrested Gambian Diplomat Sent to Mile 2\\", in which the paper reported that Lamini Sabi Sanyang, an arrested official from Gambia's US Embassy, had been transferred to Mile 2 Prison; Saine had been detained for refusing to reveal his source. One week later, following another report on Gambia's US Embassy, Saine was arrested again, interrogated at length, and given a second charge of \\"publishing and spreading false information\\". On 24 February, authorities also accused Saine of being Senegalese and having obtained a Gambian birth certificate through \\"false statements\\". He faced separate trials for each set of charges, both on 12 March in Banjul. Reporters Without Borders described the investigation of Saine as \\"hounding\\" and called on Kamalesh Sharma, the Secretary General of the Commonwealth, to intervene. On 9 April, the charges of \\"publishing and spreading false information\\" were formally dropped. Hydara murder controversy and defamation trial In November 2008, the International Press Institute began a \\"Justice Denied\\" campaign pressing for investigations into violence against journalists in the Gambia, particularly the still-unsolved murder of Deyda Haydara. At a June 2009 press conference, Gambian President Yahya Jammeh disparaged questions about the Hydara investigation, saying \\"And up to now one of these stupid Web sites carries 'Who Killed Deyda Hydara'? Let them go and ask Deyda Hydara who killed him.\\" The Gambia Press Union then published a statement criticizing the lack of press freedom in Gambia, the stalled progress of the investigation, and the president's remarks, which the union called \\"inappropriate\\". The statement ran in The Point and a weekly newspaper, Foroyaa, on 11 June. The Gambian government responded by arresting six journalists: Pap Saine, News Editor Ebrima Sawaneh, and reporters Sarata Jabbi-Dibba and Pa Modou Faal of The Point; and editor Sam Saar and reporters Emil Touray of Foroyaa. The six were charged with sedition and criminal defamation of the president. Jabbi- Dibba (the only woman) was held in Mile 2 prison, while Saine, Sawaneh, Faal, Saar, and Touray were held in Old Jeshwang prison. On 8 August, Jabbi-Dibba's seven-month-old baby was taken away. Numerous human rights NGOs protested the arrests and called the charges against the journalists to be dropped. Amnesty International designated the six as prisoners of conscience and demanded their immediate release. The Committee to Protect Journalists also campaigned for Saine's release, as did the World Organization Against Torture, the International Federation for Human Rights, International PEN, the PEN American Center, and Front Line Defenders. Jammeh continued to denounce the journalists, however, making a state television appearance to say \\"So they think they can hide behind so-called press freedom and violate the law and get away with it? They got it wrong this time ... We are going to prosecute them to the letter.\\" On 7 August 2009, the six were convicted and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in Mile 2 Prison, as well as a fine of 250,000 dalasi (£5,780) apiece. However, Jammeh pardoned them in September, following a campaign of \\"domestic and international pressure\\". The pardons were issued to coincide with Ramadan. Awards and recognition Saine was awarded the Johann Philipp Palm Award in 2006. The award is named for a bookseller executed by Napoleon, and recognizes individuals who are \\"of outstanding prominence in the promotion of freedom of opinion and the press\\". In 2010, Saine was named a World Press Freedom Hero by the International Press Institute. He is the third West African to have won the title, following Kenneth Best (Liberia) and Freedom Neruda (Côte d'Ivoire). Saine described the award as a morale-booster and \\"an inspiration for journalists who are fighting for freedom of the press and the interests of justice, democracy and human rights not only in the Gambia but in all of Africa\\".

(1878–1965) was a British painter best remembered for his work as a matte artist and special effects technician in the film industry. Professional names include W. Percy Day; Percy Day; “Pop” or “Poppa” Day, owing to his collaboration with sons Arthur George Day (1909–1952) draughtsman, Thomas Sydney Day (1912–1985), stills photographer and cameraman, and stepson, Peter Ellenshaw, who also worked in this field. Early life Walter Percy Day was born in Luton (Bedfordshire) to Eli Day and Lucy Day, née Crawley, the second of three children. From 1908 to 1912, he resided in Tunisia, at Sidi Bou Saïd and Tunis, where he pursued a career as a painter of portraits and Orientalist scenes. The dramatic consequences of the “affaire du Jellaz” uprising obliged the family to return to Britain early in 1912. The silent film era In 1919, at Ideal Films Studios in Borehamwood, near Elstree Day mastered the art of illusionist techniques. Special effects such as those produced by Day enabled directors to enlarge their repertoire and to tackle subjects which might otherwise have been too costly to produce. In 1922, he relocated to France to its more vibrant cinema. There he introduced the use of the glass shot into French cinema. Used for the first time in Henry Roussel's Les Opprimés, released in 1923, the process was hailed by a critic as a revolution in cinematography.Georges Baye, A propos du film Les Opprimés. Une Révolution dans le décor cinématographique. Ciné Miroir, 15 March 1923. Among the directors with whom Day collaborated during the twenties were Jean Renoir, Raymond Bernard, Julien Duvivier, and Abel Gance. In addition to creating visual effects for Napoléon (1927), Day also played the role of the British Admiral Hood in the film. From 1928, Day's studio became a team, when sons Arthur George Day (1909–1912) and Thomas Sydney Day (1912–1985) began to work for their father, the former as draughtsman and the latter as cameraman and stills photographer, starting with Léon Poirier's Verdun: Visions of History (1928). In the late 1920s, he learned a new technique while working at the Elstree studio on Alfred Hitchcock's The Ring, that used mirrors and angling to superimpose a miniature over a scene. The inventor, Eugen Schüfftan, whose office was opposite the studios, taught him the process directly. When shooting the façade of the department store in Julien Duvivier's film Au Bonheur des Dames (1929) proved to be an insurmountable difficulty, Day utilised the stationary matte, a process similar to that patented by Norman Dawn on 11 June 1918. In the British film industry A meeting with Alexander Korda opened up new perspectives for the Day studio. Day worked with Korda on The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933) a film starring Charles Laughton. Day accordingly established a studio in Iver (Buckinghamshire) and from 1936, directed the matte department at Denham Studios. The artist painted mattes and created trick shots for numerous films by Korda and his stable of directors, who included his brother Zoltan Korda, Anthony Asquith, William Cameron Menzies (Things to Come, 1936), Michael Powell, Lothar Mendes and David Lean. In 1946 Day joined the Korda group as Director of Special Effects at Korda's new premises at Shepperton Studios where he remained until his retirement in 1954. Poppa Day's team disbanded once World War II began as all three sons enlisted. Pop Day trained some promising young matte painters, including Wally Veevers, who took over the matte department at Shepperton Studios when Pop Day retired in 1952. During the war, the film studios made a series of heroic war films, aimed at boosting the morale of the beleaguered British, including Powell and Pressburger's 49th Parallel (US: The Invaders, 1941), Noël Coward and David Lean's In Which We Serve (1942) and Leslie Howard's The First of the Few (US: Spitfire, also 1942]. In addition to designing special effects for these films, Day created trick photography for many other British classics released during the forties, including The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943), A Matter of Life and Death [US: Stairway to Heaven, 1946], Anna Karenina (1948), and The Third Man (1949). In Laurence Olivier's production of Henry V (1944), many of the Agincourt battle scenes were painted on glass by Day, who contrived to make the horses' heads move, the pennants flutter and whirring motion of a flight of arrows in the completed shots. The Powell and Pressburger production of I Know Where I'm Going! (1945) contains a sequence in which the hero and heroine's boat gets sucked into the Corryvreckan whirlpool. Black Narcissus (1947) was shot entirely on the Pinewood Studios back lot with matte of the Himalayan mountain range painted by Day and his assistants. In 1948, Day was awarded the O.B.E. for his services to British cinema. Cameraman Christopher Challis, has rendered homage to Percy Day's achievements: \\"Being able to marry painted backgrounds on glass to real action foregrounds opened up a new world to film makers… To appreciate the magnitude of his achievement, one has to understand the complexity of the work. Hours of painstaking labour with many retakes to obtain perfection. Now it is all too easy with computers and electronics and few people remain who can understand just how complicated it was. [Day’s] name should certainly be numbered among the great film pioneers, alongside Gaumont, Lumière, etc\\".Quoted from a letter to Susan Day dated 14 January 1999 Michael Powell, for his part, hailed Percy Day as \\"the greatest trick-man and film wizard that I have ever known…\\"Michael Powell, A Life in Movies: an autobiography. London: Mandarin (pbk), 1986, p. 311, 239 Percy Day’s legacy was ranked by the British daily The Independent in 2008 as on a par with the great French special effects pioneer Georges Méliès.Geoffrey MacNab, \\"He Made Monsters\\", The Independent, 20 June 2008 Death Day died in Los Angeles.

Founded in 1978 as a mail order company, Dragon Lady Comics was opened as a store the following year. Dragon Lady closed on 3 February 2012. The comics business reopened nearby on 8 February 2012 as the Comic Book Lounge and Gallery. Overview Dragon Lady Comics is named after the Dragon Lady character that appeared in Milton Caniff's Terry and the Pirates comic strip. The store opened in 1978 as a mail order memorabilia business.\\"Dragon lady's last flame\\" - National Post, 4 February 2012 However, in 1979 a retail outlet was opened on Queen Street West, tapping into the new direct market aimed at comic collectors. In 1979, owner John Biernat was interviewed by local CBC Television station CBLT for a news segment on \\"the comics craze\\" (airdate 23 June 1979).\\"Surveying the comics craze\\" - CBLT news segment, original airdate 23 June 1979. From 1985–1988, Dragon Lady Comics operated a publishing wing, Dragon Lady Press, devoted to reprints of class newspaper comic strips. In 1996 as Queen Street was being transformed into a more upscale retail district and rents increased, Dragon Lady Comics moved to larger premises at 609 College Street. Merchandise expanded to include movie memorabilia and magazines, and a small selection of secondhand books. This change was reflected in the new (albeit rarely used) name for the store, \\"Dragon Lady Comics and Paper Nostalgia\\".

He is a founding member of record label/publishing company Ata Tak and has worked and still works in several bands. Dahlke is also known as Pyrolator. Several times he has been commissioned by the Goethe-Institut for workshops or concerts. On stage, Dahlke operates his computer/synthesizer hardware by the movement or the pressure of the hands, with Thunder and Lightning, two controllers built by Don Buchla. Career In 1978, Dahlke was a founding member of D.A.F, but left the band in 1979, when he became a member of Der Plan (until 1992), and Fehlfarben (until 1980 and again since 2002). From the same year on he labeled his solo work as Pyrolator. Dahlke collaborated on several films of director Rainer Kirberg, with Der Plan in Die letzte Rache (1983) and Grottenolm (1985) and in 2011 as sound designer in Das schlafende Mädchen. In 1996 he worked with his Der Plan partner Frank Fenstermacher as A certain Frank, in 2005 he started a collaboration with painter Jörn Stoya as Bombay 1. Until today he's been involved as musician, engineer or producer in more than 400 releases. = Pyrolator = In 1979 he released Inland, his first album as Pyrolator. The cover stated: Pyrolator Synthesizer Inland, the music is quite experimental, close to industrial music, incorporating field recordings and harsh electronica. On the follow-up Ausland (1981) he worked with a list of Ata Tak associated guests including his Der Plan colleagues and Holger Hiller. The songs range from experimental electronica to synth-pop, where Wunderland (1984) became his most playful, melodic and popular effort with references to world music. In 1985 Dahlke collaborated with Arnd Kai Klosowski for the album Hometaping Is Killing Music an early effort in popular music based entirely on sampling. 1987's Pyrolator's Traumland with Susan Brackeen on vocals and a whole range of guest musicians became his most commercial and less experimental album. He then teamed up with Linda Sharrock and Frank Samba for Every 2nd, an album commissioned for the German Olympic pavilion at the 1988 Seoul Games. With the singles Ficcion Disco and City Space from 1992/1993 he moved towards Techno, which led to his productions for Antonelli Electr. the techno project of Stefan Schwander – another Ata Tak artist (with The I-Burnettes, 1990, and The Bad Examples, from 1996 on). Neuland from 2011 is the first Pyrolator album not released on Ata Tak but Bureau-B. It received a four star rating on Allmusic. =Ata Tak= Dahlke is a founding member of the independent record label and publishing company Ata Tak, as well as associated label Das Büro, from 1979 on, and with over 150 releases still in operation. The two labels have been a fulcrum of the German Post-punk/ Neue Deutsche Welle scene, with releases of artists like Der Plan, Lost Gringos, DAF, Die Zimmermänner, Holger Hiller, Andreas Dorau, S.Y.P.H., Die Tödliche Doris, or Minus Delta T. Later on Ata Tak e.g. released The Bad Examples, Element of Crime or 1993 the first album of Oval.

The Royal Navy took her into service but the Admiralty sold her for breaking up in 1809. Dutch career Early in 1802, Kenau Hasselar, under the command of Captain Cornelius (or Cornelis) Hubertus Buschman, was assigned to the East Indies and Cape of Good Hope division of the Navy. After the end of the French Revolutionary Wars, the British ceded the Dutch colonies they had captured in the West Indies to the Batavian Republic. In August 1802, Buschman and Kenau Hasselar took a small squadron that also included the frigate Proserpina, the corvette , the cutter Rose, and the schooner Serpent, to take possession of Curaçao.For a map of Kenau Hasselars recorded positions on the voyage see: Map of recorded positions. Kenau Hasellar and Rose arrived at St Anna Bay on 22 December. The other vessels in the squadron sailed to other destinations.For instance, in the summer of 1803 Hippomenes was acting as a guard ship at Fort Stabroek, Georgetown, Demerara, where the British captured her and took her into service under her existing name. Serpent sailed to Berbice, where the British captured her in 1803 and took her into service as HMS Berbice. In 1804 the British captured Proserpine at Suriname and took her into service as HMS Amsterdam. Shortly after Kenau Hasellar arrived at Curaçao, an outbreak of yellow fever swept through her that killed Buschman in February 1803, and many of her crew. On 24 April 1805, HMS Franchise was off Curaçao when she sighted a schooner that anchored under the guns of the fort of Port Maria. Franchise sailed in and fired on the fort and on the schooner for an hour before Franchise could cut the schooner out. The schooner turned out to be a tender to Kenau Hasselar. The schooner had a crew of a lieutenant and 35 men, but a number escaped ashore, leaving behind 24 of their wounded compatriots, as well as the surgeon and the lieutenant. Franchise had one man seriously wounded and two men slightly wounded. The schooner was carrying lumber and rice.

The Dutch naval forces, under the command of Commandant Cornelius J. Evertz of Kenau Hasselar, resisted. Aboard Kenau Hasselar five men were killed, including Evertz, and one man was wounded. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issue of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp “Curacoa 1 Jany. 1807” to any surviving claimants from the action; Sixty-five medals were issued. The British commissioned Kenau Hasselar as Halstarr at Jamaica under Captain John Parrish. She was broken up in 1809.

The AuroraMax provides a place to explore and discover the wonder and science behind phenomena such as sunspots, Earth's magnetic field, space weather and the magnificent Northern lights of Canada. Auroras are natural exhibition of lights in the sky that can be seen by the naked eyes. Auroras happen when protons and electrons or charged particles and gases in the Earth's atmosphere crash into each other, creating tiny flares of light that decorate the sky with colorful light. Billions of these tiny flares occur in sequence causing the lights to seem like they are dancing or moving. The lights in the Northern hemisphere are called Aurora Borealis or simply The Northern Lights while the lights in the Southern hemisphere are called Aurora Australis or simply The Southern Lights.  Objectives  The purpose of the project is to monitor the frequency and intensity of the Aurora Borealis (Northern lights) in the years that led up to the Solar Maximum that was scheduled to occur in 2013-14. Scientists have noticed that the sun's activity follows a regular cycle and the peak (Solar maximum) is reached every 11 years. The main purpose of this project is to observe the activities and their developments leading up to the occurrence of the solar maximum, so that the pattern can be established and understood. The AuroraMax, also, has a website where everyone and anyone can view, admire the lights and the other wonders explored in the project in real time, as well as follow up on solar activities.  The northern lights  Auroras are a product of the sun's activity; therefore the beautiful colorful lights seen at night are often caused by activities by the sun 150 million kilometers away. The sun sends out a constant flow of charged particles known as solar wind. When these winds or eruptions are pointed or directed at the Earth, they can spark up sun-induced auroras. The greater the activity of the sun, the brighter the auroras we see. The colors of the aurora are determined by three elements which are: the density of the atmosphere, the composition of gases in the Earth's atmosphere, the altitude where aurora occurs and the level of energy involved. The most common color seen is green, which is caused when the charged particles collide with oxygen at lower altitudes between 100-300 kilometers. Occasionally, the ends or tips of the aurora have a pink or crimson fringe, this is caused by the presence of nitrogen molecules. In the upper atmosphere between 300-400 kilometers, red instead of green is caused by the collision with atomic oxygen. It takes longer for the lights to be produced at higher altitudes because the atmosphere is less dense so it takes more energy and more time for the red lights to be produced. Blue and purple lights are also produced by the collision with hydrogen and helium but they are difficult for the eyes to see against the night sky.

In 1878 a new act of Parliament authorised the bishop to establish residentiary canonries; in 1882 an existing canonry was transferred to Truro from Exeter whose income enabled the provision of two canonries at Truro. In 1906 the office of sub-dean was endowed; the bishop was also the dean (at least until 1925).

It is situated in a beautiful place called Alakode (Meenmutty), 6 kilometres away from Thodupuzha town and close to Thodupuzha – Poomala main road. This is the only church in the Syro- Malabar Catholic Eparchy of Kothamangalam in the patronage of St. Thomas More, who took martyrdom for the protection of faith when he was the Chancellor of England.  Parish History  Karikkodu, Thodupuzha areas were big trade centers under the control of land lords. During that time of farmer’s movement, many Christian migrations happened here. They toiled hard, fought with the wild animals, faced hazardous illnesses and in spite of all these, reaped golden harvests. Many Christians have lived in Alakode, Meenmutty and Edavetty for many years. The faithful from this area had to depend on Kalayanthani Church for their spiritual needs. The Catholics from this area called a meeting. All those who attended that meeting expressed their desire to have a church here as it was difficult to go up to Kalayanthani church. They submitted an application to the then bishop of Kothamangalam diocese Mar Mathew Pothanamuzhy to grant permission to establish a church at Alakode (Meenmutty) area. The permission was granted soon. A person named Kuriakose from Thurackal Puthanpurayil family donated two acres of land for the construction of a church in 1963. That land was far away from the road that used for trade transportations in those days. The land on the both sides of the main road were part of Mar Thoma Estate owned by natives of Alappuzha. It was decided to call a meeting of the faithful to discuss about the construction of the church. Meanwhile, a ‘sign of cross’ was found on one of the stones, which were blasted for making walls in the estate. The whole faithful from this area gathered there in prayer and informed the owner of the estate about the same. By the grace of God, the then Managing Director of the estate Georgekutty Madathilakkal, a native of Alappuzha, donated one acre of land for the construction of the church, where the present church is constructed. Rev. Fr. George Nedungattu, who was the parish priest of Kalayanthani church during 1964, obtained the permission to erect a church at the above said place, erected a temporary shed with the support of the people and began to offer Holy Mass on Sundays. Following that Rev. Fr. Olickal, the then Asst. Parish Priest of Kalayanthani used to celebrate the Holy Mass here on Sundays. The church at Alakode was raised to a parish by fixing the new boundaries bifurcated from the parishes of Muthalakodam, Kallanickal and Kalayanthani in 1967. Rev. Fr. John Kallarackal, who was the librarian of Thodupuzha New Man College, took the charge as the new parish priest of Alakode on 16 May 1970. The construction work of the church was started soon after that. The work of the present beautiful church was completed and blessed in 1975. During the tenure of Rev. Fr. Mathew Karottu Kocharackal the church was more beautified by laying marble on the floor and ceiling on top in 2003. The works of steel flag-post, stone cross, the construction of a beautiful grotto of Mother Mary and the large presbytery etc. were done by Rev. Fr. Jose Pulparambil with the help of the parishners in 2009. This parish of Alakode has been led by 14 priests from the first parish priest Rev. Fr. George Nedungattu till the present parish priest Rev.

Based on one of his stage magic acts, and starring Méliès himself, the film presents a varied assortment of images and imaginings dreamed by the astronomer of the title, focusing on themes of astronomy and especially the Moon. Plot A surviving print of the film In an observatory, an astronomer is studying at his desk. Satan appears, then a woman appears and makes Satan vanish. Then she disappears. The astronomer draws a globe on a blackboard. The globe develops a sun-like head and limbs and starts to move on the blackboard. The astronomer looks through a small telescope. The Moon appears in a building as a large face. It has eaten the astronomer's telescope. Men tumble from its mouth. Then the Moon is in the sky. The astronomer, in a different dress, stands on a table, which disappears. He falls. The Moon becomes a crescent. The mythological goddess Phoebe (i.e. Selene) appears from it. The astronomer chases her, but she eludes him. Then another figure stands in the crescent of the Moon, before reclining into its C shape. The Moon appears as a large face again, and the astronomer jumps into its mouth. A woman and Satan appears. The astronomer appears again. Then, in the observatory, the astronomer is sitting asleep in his chair. Cast Georges Méliès : Astronomer Jehanne d'Alcy : Phoebe/Selene Production Méliès plays the astronomer in the film, which is based on a stage magic sketch he had presented in 1891 at his Paris magic venue, the Théâtre Robert-Houdin. The stage version, \\"Les Farces de la Lune ou les Mésaventures de Nostradamus\\", combined theatrical illusions with shadow puppetry. The film version uses a combination of stage machinery (including the giant puppet Moon face), pyrotechnics, and substitution splices for its illusions. Phoebe, goddess of the moon, was played by Jehanne d'Alcy, whom Méliès would marry some 30 years later. The Astronomer's Dream was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 160–162 in its catalogues. In the French catalogues, a subtitle divided the film into three scenes: La Lune à un mètre (1—l'observatoire; 2—la Lune; 3—Phœbé). The film was Méliès's his third, after The Haunted Castle (1896) and The Laboratory of Mephistopheles (1897), to be longer than 60 meters. When the film was imported to the United States by producer Sigmund Lubin in 1899, he retitled it A Trip to the Moon. However, it should not be confused with Méliès's 1902 film A Trip to the Moon.

Although the group had an overseas success (over 100,000 albums sold in Japan) they never had a major breakthrough coming back home. When vocalist Jennie Medin chose to focus on her academic career in 1998, the group was dissolved. A few years later, Medin played on the solo album The World Through My Eyes with songs by Jorgen Warnstrom, which was released in Japan and Sweden in the winter of 2003–2004. After that, it was decided to reunite the group, then as a trio. In 2004 came the album The Great Escape, followed by Movin 'on up, released only in Japan.

Before her tenure as Prime Minister, she served as Minister of Agriculture from 2011 to 2014. She was the first woman to serve as the head of government of the country. After her resignation on 7 December 2015 she announced her intention to resume a seat in the Saeima. Between October 2000 and 2006 Straujuma served as the Secretary of State of the Ministry for Agriculture. Between 2007 and 2010 she was the Secretary of State of the Ministry for Regional Development and Local Government. She was appointed as Minister of Agriculture on 25 October 2011. On 5 January 2014 the Unity Party nominated Straujuma as a candidate for the post of Prime Minister following the resignation of Valdis Dombrovskis. The nomination was supported by Unity's coalition partners, the Reform Party and the National Alliance as well as the opposition Union of Greens and Farmers. Following the 2014 Parliamentary Election, in which the Unity Party came in second, the President of Latvia Andris Bērziņš nominated Straujuma to lead the new government, which was approved by Saeima on 5 November 2014. Straujuma resigned on 7 December 2015. Resignation On 7 December 2015, Straujuma resigned after a period of increasing disputes within the ruling coalition. As the country’s first female prime minister, her term lasted nearly two years and her tenure focused on strengthening national defence in the wake of the Russian annexation of Crimea. Media reports claimed Straujuma struggled to maintain cohesion within the coalition in the months preceding her resignation over the overwhelming issues of the European migrant crisis, teacher strikes and disagreement over strategy for State assistance to the debt-laden national airline Air Baltic. Reallocation of funds to ensure the country moved closer to NATO's 2% GDP defence spending requirement in light of the security situation helped make the 2016 budget controversial. The chairwoman of the Unity Party Solvita Āboltiņa criticised Straujuma’s alleged lack of authority. Straujuma upon her resignation stated that there was a need in the government for “new ideas, a new contribution and a new energy”. She personally recommended incumbent Interior Minister Rihards Kozlovskis as a successor. He later declined the role in an interview with Radio Latvia.

Both locations opened as The Outer Limits: Flight of Fear on June 18, 1996, themed after the 1960s TV series of the same name. Built and designed by Premier Rides, they were the world's first launched roller coasters to feature linear induction motor (LIM) technology. The Paramount Pictures branding was removed in 2001, dropping \\"The Outer Limits\\" from the name.  History  Kings Dominion began teasing a new attraction in the summer of 1995 by cutting a \\"crop circle\\" in a nearby field which featured a UFO, the face of an alien and the letter \\"F\\" written in binary. In August 1995, Kings Island officially announced more details revealing that their new for 1996 attraction would be an indoor roller coaster named \\"The Outer Limits: Flight of Fear\\". Reaching a top speed of in only four seconds, it was originally described as utilizing a \\"laser-controlled catapult system\\" that would propel riders through a series of inversions in the dark. The experience would be \\"heightened by Hollywood-type special effects\\", according to Carolyn Boof who was the park's manager of marketing communications. Boof also confirmed it would cost significantly more than the $7 million that was cited in earlier reports, and that its alien theme would be based on the 1960s science-fiction TV series, The Outer Limits. Later, reports confirmed a site being renovated in Coney Mall on the back side of The Racer. Premier Rides and park engineers performed the first successful launch at the Kings Dominion location on the evening of April 11, 1996, proving that linear induction motors could produce enough force through the use of magnetic fields to quickly accelerate roller coasters. Each launch required 3 megawatts of electric power, which caused frequent voltage sags to neighboring utility customers. Square D by Schneider Electric was hired to develop a complex solid-state capacitor bank which solved the sagging issue by reducing the load on the local electric utilities. Flight of Fear at Kings Dominion Flight of Fear was originally scheduled to open in April 1996, but it was later delayed until June. Both park installations opened to the public on June 18, 1996, setting a world record among roller coasters for fastest acceleration. A media preview event was held the previous day. The attraction was awarded several top honors at the 1995 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions trade show. Due to a licensing agreement expiration, the park dropped \\"Outer Limits\\" from the ride's name at both locations in 2001, changing to simply Flight of Fear. The Kings Island installation was constructed in a small subsection of Coney Mall. After the addition of Firehawk in 2007, the area was named X-Base, themed to space and the paranormal. Following Kings Island's August 2019 announcement of Orion, a new roller coaster replacing Firehawk, it was revealed that X-Base would be overhauled and renamed Area 72. For the 2020 season, Flight of Fear's entrance at Kings Island was updated with an expanded outdoor line queue, which provides guests with view of Orion. Premier Rides built other LIM Catapult models from 1996 to 1999, including Joker's Jinx at Six Flags America, Poltergeist at Six Flags Fiesta Texas and Crazy Cobra at Discoveryland. The two Flight of Fear rides are the only indoor versions and share a similar layout with the same technical specifications.  Ride experience  = Layout = Riders are launched from the station, accelerating from in four seconds down a launch tunnel. The ride emerges into a \\"spaghetti bowl\\" of track inside of the tall ride building. Following the launch, the train immediately enters a cobra roll, which contains two of the ride's four inversions. The ride layout continues with a sidewinder and multiple turns. After passing through the mid-course brake run, riders spiral downward to the left, continuing to maneuver through the twisted ride structure. The train picks up speed as riders dive at the floor of the building, finally passing through a corkscrew before arriving at the final brake run. = Theme = The building housing the queue is designed as an Area 51-inspired military installation hangar. The outside is marked with the number 18, and riders enter the line through a \\"press area\\" located under an awning to the side of the building. Various announcements regarding the operation of the base and broadcasts from WERD (\\"weird\\"), a fictitious radio station, are played over speakers in the outside queue area. The queue line slightly descends down a short, narrow tunnel as guests enter the building, making a left into the interior of the hangar. It contains one-half of a full-sized mockup UFO flying saucer, which appears to be complete as the back wall of the building is entirely lined with mirrors to complete the illusion. A video is played over multiple screens to describe the ride's backstory, explaining how the spacecraft crash-landed not far from the park. While some base personnel are running tests on the vessel, others are convinced that it's a hoax and decided to allow the press in to view it. Hazmat suits and computer equipment with active monitors can be seen in various locations inside the hangar. Strobe and dimming lighting effects are utilized throughout the indoor portion of the queue, which are synchronized with the pre-recorded video during moments of power surges and power failures. At Kings Island, the line winds around the inside of the hangar before entering the underside of the UFO up a short flight of stairs. At Kings Dominion, the line turns directly up into the UFO, as a portion of the queue building's interior was later converted into a space for the Lockdown Halloween Haunt maze – although much of the UFO-related theming remains. The inside of the saucer features a display with alien markings and originally played various sound effects. Guests can hear each launch, which resonates throughout this portion of the queue. The walkway turns to the right, continues into another room, and turns left into the boarding area. The loading and unloading stations are in separate rooms, so riders in the loading area witness an empty train returning. The loading station features human-sized cryotube props containing mannequins wrapped in plastic, adding to the alien theme. While the train is loading and waiting to be dispatched, a sound effect imitating the warm-up of a jet engine can be heard, and another take-off sound is played as the train launches. The ride was originally themed to The Outer Limits TV series. However, Paramount's licensing for the show expired in 2001, causing all references to The Outer Limits to be removed. The attraction features an original soundtrack composed by Rob Pottorf, and its theming was co-designed by Bob Dennis and David Ferguson of Paramount Parks Design & Entertainment. = Trains = The trains on the ride originally featured over-the-shoulder restraints, but these were changed to individual lap bar restraints for the 2001 season along with the name change. Each train also originally featured six cars, but that was later reduced to five. Kings Dominion operates three trains, while Kings Island typically operates two trains despite owning four.  Incidents  = Kings Island = * At approximately 2:45 p.m. on June 2, 2014, emergency crews received a report of a fire at the ride. Smoke from an overheated electrical motor had filled the ride building. Two of the eighteen people exposed to the smoke were treated at the scene. Emergency crews cleared the building around 3:45 p.m. * Smoke coming from a panel outside of the ride building was reported at 10:35 a.m. on June 14, 2014. The panel was the only part of the building to suffer damage; the ride was unaffected, with no flames or injuries reported.

The firm she set up with her husband Ebbe designed both traditional and more modern Functionalist buildings. Often inspired by Japanese and American trends, their work includes Kildeskovshallen in Gentofte and LO-skolen in Helsingør. Early life Karen Clemmensen was born into an artistic family. Her father Holger Mundt (1887–1957) was an architect and her mother Harriet Fischer-Jørgensen (1889–1975) a painter. After completing her schooling at Sønderborg Statsskole in 1935, she attended the Danish Academy until 1942. From 1939 to 1941, she worked part-time for Kaj Gottlob, also a successful architect.Helle Bay, \\"Karen Clemmensen (1917-2001)\\", Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon. Retrieved 4 February 2012. Career While at the Academy, the pair met Eva and Nils Koppel and Tobias Faber who found work for them in a Stockholm studio during the war years. It was here they came in contact with Japanese architecture, including the Zui Ki Tei teahouse in the Ethnographic Museum, which influenced many of their later projects. After the birth of her first child in 1945, Eva Koppel worked for the city architect while setting up her own firm with her husband. For the first 10 years, there were no major projects. In 1947, together with Holger Mundt, they restored Kliplev Church in the south of Jutland. After Ebbe had been given a post at the Academy, the couple built a house for themselves in Gentofte in 1953 adopting a simple Functionalist style. From the mid-1950s, as a result of success in a number of competitions, they received several important commissions, their designs often inspired by Tetsurō Yoshida's Das japanische Wohnhaus or by the American architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Frank Lloyd Wright. Japanese influence can be seen in their use of timber overhangs and an atrium yard at Skive Seminarium (1959) while Blågård Seminarium and Enghavegård School both have a more international Cubist appearance with glazed facades and flat roofs. Subsequent educational institutions such as Højstrupgård and the LO-skole in Helsingør also had an atrium yard as their central feature as well as structures of various sizes to suit the needs of the courses to be taught. Care was also taken to provide a high level of interior decoration with the assistance of appropriate experts. The swimming facilities at Kildeskovhallen (1972) in Gentofte present an elegant blend of modern and traditional design with huge glazed facades looking out towards the forest. The couple also undertook church restoration work, arranged exhibitions of furniture, crafts and graphics and designed textiles. Karen produced some fine graphic works including Christmas wrapping designs. As a result of her graphic work, she was awarded the Knod V. Engelhardt Memorial Scholarship in 1948. Together with her husband, she received the Eckersberg Medal in 1961. Karen Clemmensen was also a member of several adjudicating panels for school projects, urban planning, and architecture awards.Hanne Marcussen, \\"Karen Clemmensen\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbachs kunstnerleksikon.

MarketFinance was the first company to allow businesses to borrow against individual outstanding invoices. As of March 2018, MarketFinance had provided over £2bn in invoice finance facilities to UK companies. In 2018 the company became the first FinTech company to partner with a major highstreet bank in the UK, Barclays bank.  History  MarketFinance, originally named MarketInvoice, was created in 2011 by Anil Stocker, Ilya Kondrashov, and Charles Delingpole in response to the low levels of lending to SMEs by traditional high street banks. Anil Stocker has served as CEO since the company began and Ilya Kondrashov as MD. Giles Andrews was appointed the first Chairman of the company in 2017. In 2011 MarketFinance raised £930,000 in seed funding and announced that the UK Government’s development bank, the British Business Bank, would begin to fund businesses through their platform. By the end of 2015 the company had opened an office in Manchester and raised a £6m series A funding round with venture capital firm Northzone and Paul Forster (founder of Indeed.com).

In 2018 MarketFinance launched a business loan product.  Partners & Investors  A number of different investors fund business through MarketFinance’s platform, ranging from institutional investors to regional funds and banks.

This deal was extended in September 2015 for a further 3 years, taking their total investment in MarketFinance's platform to £10m. In 2018 Portugal’s bank Banco BNI Eruopa and the German Varengold Bank announced that they would lend £90m and £45m respectively through MarketFinance’s platform.

It has been described by the BBC as \\"Liverpool's main charity for the blind\\" and is part of the 800 Group, a consortium of Merseyside health and care charities. Activities The organisation's main activities, as registered with the UK Charity Commission are: * providing assessment and rehabilitation services to blind and partially sighted people across Liverpool and Knowsley * holding the register of blind and partially sighted people on behalf of the local authority * providing a training and transcription service to outside agencies * providing health and social activities to service users Among the social activities provided to service users is a tandem riding club, featured in the BBC programme You and Yours. There is also an art group, running since 1997, which has held an exhibition at Liverpool Central Library, and an \\"online exhibition\\" in association with National Museums Liverpool. In 2012, Bradbury Fields and OnThisROC started running a climbing club for visually impaired teenagers, allowing them to take part in the National Indoor Climbing Achievement Scheme. History =Founding and early years= The first formal meeting of what became Bradbury Fields was held in 1857 by a committee of 14 women, headed by founder Mary Wainwright, under the name \\"The Society For Supplying Home Teachers And Books In Moon's Systems or Embossed Type to Enable the Blind to Read\\". In particular, the organisation aimed to teach blind people to read scripture and the Bible. In 1861 the Society merged with Liverpool Workshops for the Blind, then based in Liverpool's Bold Street, and was renamed the \\"Liverpool Society for Promoting the Welfare of the Blind\\". This saw a refocusing of the charity's aims to include providing employment and vocational training to blind people. =Liverpool Voluntary Society for the Blind= After going under a number of other names, including \\"Liverpool Home Teaching Society for the Blind\\", the organisation became \\"Liverpool Voluntary Society for the Blind\\" (LVSB) in 1970 in response to an increasingly large amount of the work of home teaching being carried out by Liverpool City Council. To avoid a number of local visual impairment organisations competing for the same funding from Liverpool City Council, in 1995 the Merseyside Forum for Local Providers was formed, consisting of Action for Blind People, [Christopher Grange Visual Rehabilitation Centre [Catholic Blind Institute], Guide Dogs, Henshaws Society for Blind People and LVSB itself. =Bradbury Fields= In 2003, LVSB purchased part of the property it shared with Guide Dogs thanks to funding from organisations including the Bradbury Trust and Blatchington Court Trust (an organisation which promotes the education needs of young visually impaired people). This saw the renaming of the building where LVSB is based (in the Dovecot area of Liverpool) to the Bradbury Centre. In 2006, the society itself was renamed to Bradbury Fields. As of 2012, Bradbury Fields continues to share the Bradbury Centre with Guide Dogs, as well as an artificial eye unit and a counselling service run by Action for Blind People. LVSB lost a quarter of its funding in 2006 after the Royal National Institute of Blind People said it was unable to provide the charity with its usual £250,000 yearly funding owing to stock market changes over the past year and a decrease in legacy funds. Bradbury Fields' Bradbury Centre has subsequently been used to hold events to help blind and partially sighted people into work, with participation from local colleges and universities as well as multi-national corporations such as Shell and BP. In the run-up to the UK's May 2010 general election, the Bradbury Centre was visited by local politicians keen to show their support for community organisations. Then prospective parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party, Luciana Berger (later MP for the area), wrote about her visit in February 2010, as did Conservative candidate Pamela Hall shortly afterwards. In 2012 the Centre was also visited by Labour MP for West Derby, Stephen Twigg.http://stephentwiggmp.co.uk/home/2012/04/05/stephen-visits-bradbury- fields/ Two days after UK Prime Minister David Cameron launched his \\"Big Society\\" initiative in Liverpool, Bradbury Fields was cited in the local press as an example of where Cameron's ideas are already in action and how groups of community-based volunteers have for many years provided \\"a better service than would be achieved through the public sector\\". In 2011, Bradbury Fields was cited as one of the reasons (along with Wavertree's Royal School for the Blind) for UK supermarket Sainsbury's choice to use a store in nearby Woolton for its trial of Braille signage.

His nickname was Jamgok (잠곡, 潛谷), Hoejeongdang (회정당, 晦靜堂), a courtesy name was Baekhu (백후, 伯厚), and his posthumous name was Munjeong (문정, 文貞). He came from the Cheongpung Kim clan (Hangul: 청풍 김씨, Hanja: 淸風金氏). Gim Yuk served as prime minister of the Joseon dynasty in 1651 and 1654 through 1658. He was Grandfather of Queen Myeongseong (명성왕후, 明聖王后)Wife of King Hyeonjong and Mother of King Sukjong and 6G-Great-Grandfather of Queen Hyoui (효의왕후, 孝懿王后).Wife of King Jeongjo  Biography  = Family history = Gim Yuk was born on July 14, 1580 at Mapo, Hanyang (modern Seoul), where his maternal grandparents lived. His Great-Great-Grandfather Gim Shik (김식, 金湜, 1482–1520), who had supported Jo Gwangjo at Seonggyungwan (National Confucian Academy) by criticizing then ministers in power, was sacrificed during the literati purge in the year of Gimyo (기묘사화, 己卯士禍, 1519). After the incident, his family including his father, Gim Heung-wu, were excluded from the central government. Thanks to his family background, however, Gim Yuk had an opportunity to be taught by famous scholars Seong Hon (성혼, 成渾) and Yi I (이이, 李珥), and had a close relationship with Kim Sang-yong (김상용, 金尙容) and Kim Sang-heon (김상헌, 金尙憲), who became the Neo-Confucian leaders and power elite after a couple of decades. In fact, Gim Yuk's mother was the granddaughter of a brother of the above-mentioned Jo Gwangjo. = Early life = From childhood, Gim Yuk was called a prodigy as he learned by heart the whole Thousand-Character Classic (천자문, 千字文) at the age of five. In 1588, his grandfather, Gim Bi (김비, 金棐) was appointed as head of Gangdong-gun, Pyeongan-do, his father moved to Gangdong with family members. There, Gim Yuk was fortunately educated by Cho Ho-ik (조호익/曺好益), who had studied under a great scholar, Yi Hwang (이황, 李滉) and currently in exile at Gangdong. At that time, Gim Yuk was a boy of literature. When he was 12 years old, he wrote some essays and biographies of famous pundits. While he was reading the Learning for Minors (소학, 小學). he was quite impressed by the words of Cheng Hao (程顥), \\"Whoever starts as a public official has an earnest mind to love the objects can help people.\\" He bore in mind that only a public official can help people to live well.Chung Seong-heeㆍChang Seon-hwan. Kim Yuk (김육, 金堉) - The Great Statesman of Joseon who devoted his life to Daedongbeop, Great Men in the Korean History, NAVER Encyclopedia. When he was 13 years old, Gim Yuk had to undergo the Imjin war. While he moved to the countryside to seek shelters, he did not stop reading books. During the war, his father passed away at the age of 31. At the deathbed, his father told him to enhance the family grade by studying hard, and to avoid any liquors. Gim Yuk kept his promise for life. His household deteriorated significantly, and his mother also died. He had to depend on his father's sister for living.Ibid. After Gim Yuk passed the jinsagwa (literary licentiate examination) in 1605, which allowed him to enter the Seonggyungwan as his great-great-grandfather did. In 1610 as a student of Seonggyungwan, he submitted the petition to King Gwanghae (광해군, 光海君, 1575 - 1641 r.1608 - 1623) three times to forgive and restore his resentful teacher Seong Hon and to reinstate Five Wise Men ousted in the previous literati purge. The next year, he initiated a campaign at Seonggyungwan to expel Jeong In-hong (정인홍, 鄭仁弘) in power from the Registry of Confucian Literati (청금록, 靑襟錄), who had criticized the great scholar Yi Hwang. On the contrary to his wish, he was expelled from the institution. He had to move to Jamgok-ri (잠곡리, 潛谷里), Gapeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do, and became a farmer to make a living. He studied harder than before in a self-exile. During that period from 1613 to 1623,Actually in 1612, King Gwanghae pardoned those Seonggyungwan students and withdrew the ban to their application for the civil service examination. Gim Yuk, denying King's pardoning, managed to get along, and experienced and witnessed the real peasant life in the countryside. = Royal and public service = In 1623, a military coup by the Westerners faction succeeded to dethrone King Gwanghae. And a new King Injo (인조, 仁祖. 1595 - 1649 r.1623 - 1649) was enthroned. In consequence, the public officials ousted by the previous government returned to the newly organized administration. Gim Yuk in seclusion was the first among them. He was appointed to a post in the royal law enforcement organ (의금부, 義禁府). But he was not satisfied with it. In 1624, Gim Yuk passed Gwageo, the literary civil service examination, receiving officially the highest marks. Now, he started his official career both at Hanyang and in the country. During the rebellion by Yi Gwal (이괄, 李适) in 1624, he escorted King Injo to Gongju. After the incident, Gim Yuk served at Eumseong-gun, Chungcheong province and various ministries in the capital city. When he left Eumseong, its inhabitants were thankful to his good governance and erected a commemorative monument. In January 1627 when Late Jin (later Qing dynasty) mounted up a military pressure (정묘호란, 丁卯胡亂) on the northern territory of Joseon, Gim Yuk asserted to put the first priority to alleviate the residents' burden by suspending the resident registration law. In 1632, Gim Yuk was in charge of the funeral service of Queen Mother Inmok (인목대비, 仁穆大妃). = Diplomatic missions = During his public career, Gim Yuk was assigned to the diplomatic mission to visit Beijing, capital city of the Ming dynasty three times. In the winter of 1636, he visited Beijing to pay a seasonal courtesy call (성절사, 聖節使). In Beijing, he heard of the outbreak of the Byeongja invasion of the Qing Army (병자호란, 丙子胡亂) and the humiliating surrender of King Injo. He was allegedly crying day and night in Beijing. Upon arrival from Beijing, he recorded the diplomatic envoy's diary called Jocheon Ilgi (조천일기, 朝天日記), in which he described the civilized foreign country as well as the corruption of the Ming bureaucrats and confusing atmosphere of the Ming society. In the winter of 1643 when Crown Prince Sohyeon was taken as a hostage to Shenyang (瀋陽), Gim Yuk was assigned to be held responsible for taking care of the crown prince (원손보양관, 元孫輔養官) at the Qing court. When he returned to Joseon, he tried to get rid of evil practices to care for the diplomatic missions in the northern territory.  Reformist policy-maker  In 1638, he was appointed as the governor of Chungcheong province. After he surveyed the fiscal base of the province and ongoing taxation results, Gim Yuk was convinced the necessity of implementing Daedongbeop (대동법, 大同法) in his jurisdiction. Daedongbeop, which had been enforced in Gyeonggi province since 1608, was purported to replace the taxation in kind like indigenous products to the unitary taxation of rice in a certain amount as explained below. His public career was represented by reform-oriented policy making. Right after the Jeongmyo invasion by the Late Jin (Qing) army in 1627, Gim Yuk was an advocate to support inhabitants of Pyeongan province and Hwanghae province, which were devastated by the war, to make a living. He proposed to separate the labor work levied on the inhabitants of Pyeongan province and Hwanghae province into ordinary farming and service in the army (병농분리, 兵農分離). He also asserted to cultivate military farms (둔전, 屯田) in the idle land to prepare for another war with enemy to the north. Nationwide implementation of the said Daedongbeop was Gim Yuk's consistent efforts throughout his career. Once he said, \\"Colleagues around me laugh at me because what I speak of is only Daedongbeop from the beginning to the end.\\" It was his firm belief based on the real world that Daedongbeop would stabilize the living of common people and ensure the fiscal soundness. Apart from Daedongbeop, Gim Yuk took it into consideration that: * the emerging Qing dynasty was mounting up its political and military pressure on Joseon; * the Qing officials were demanding more and more contributions to their dynasty; * the inhabitants in the northern territories and other part of the nation were burdened increasingly by tax and labor work in pursuit of Conquer-the-North policy (북벌정책, 北伐政策); * the whole nation was plagued by such natural disasters each year as drought, flood, storm, earthquake, etc. Accordingly, Gim Yuk thought it imperative to stabilize the living of common people by curtailing taxation, and to prevent the alienation of public sentiment. He forwarded his thoughts to other public officials as well as King Injo and King Hyojong (효종, 孝宗, 1619 - 1659 r.1619 - 1659).  Daedongbeop as unitary taxation  While he served in the administration, Gim Yuk advocated Daedongbeop to be implemented nationwide. As a matter of fact, Daedongbeop was test-implemented at the suggestion of Hahn Baek-gyeom (한백겸, 韓百謙) in the name of Daegong Sumibeop (대공수미법, 貸貢收米法)Literarily, it means the law or mechanism to lend indigenous products and collect rice instead. in Gyeonggi province. The policy proposal was endorsed by then Prime Minister Lee Won-ik (이원익, 李元翼) and came into force in September 1608 by setting up Seonhyecheong (선혜청, 宣惠廳)Literary meaning of Seonhye is to distribute benefits, while Daedong means almost same in than the conventional indigenous products are same as a certain quantity of rice or cotton cloth. at Hanyang. Judging from his personal experiences as a peasant at Jamgok-ri and a front-line public official at Eumseong, Chungcheong province, Gim Yuk had got a firm belief that Daedongbeop was the best solution to alleviate the burden of peasants and to prevent corruptive practices of local government officials and merchant-middlemen (방납인, 防納人). A half of fiscal revenues had to be supplemented by indigenous products (공물, 貢物) of the region. Its purport seemed to benefit common people in the country. The problem was the intentional exploitation by the local government officials and merchant-middlemen. Occasionally, they demanded in collusion regional products which were hardly available owing to flood, drought or harmful insects, or even refused the direct provision of farmers on account of defects or quality of goods. So Gim Yuk's countermeasures included the unitary taxation of 12 mal (말, 斗) per gyeol (결, 結). It may be interpreted as 5 mal by the modern measurement over eight thousand pyeong or 26,450 square meter. It's reasonable for a tax payer.From the viewpoint of economic history, the tax rate on farm land was comparatively low in the Joseon dynasty. In the early era of the dynasty, it was 10 percent of the products, which was lowered to 5 percent by King Sejong, who wished to practice the Confucian idealism. In consequence of Daedongbeop, the fiscal revenue increased by 20 percent for the central government. The tax burden including indigenous products was lowered by a half or, in some cases, one fifth of the previous taxation. Thereafter, the population and the gross domestic products grew up to three times than before. The economic growth rate was estimated to be 0.2 percent on average. It was not so bad in view of the world average before the industrial revolution. Kim Ki-cheol, Interview with Prof. Lee Heon-chang: Preference of Song Si-yeol to Kim Yuk caused Joseon to deteriorate, March 13, 2020. While he served as Governor of Chungcheong province, Gim Yuk realized that it was urgently necessary to replace the indigenous products contribution system (공납제, 貢納制) with Daedongbeop which called for proportionate sharing of rice produced at the farm land.Upon implementation of Daedongbeop, the peasants in the Chungcheong region were largely relieved of burdensome indigenous products. It was said that they were dancing at their farm land as they paid to the local government officials only a smaller amount of rice or cotton cloth. However, factional interests were divided on the issue of Daedongbeop. If Daedongbeop was implemented nationwide, it was largely to the benefit of farmers and common people. On the contrary, Confucian scholars and wealthy gentlemen in the country could find few benefits from the new system. Local government officials would lose the source of fringe benefits. That's why Daedongbeop failed to be continuously implemented beyond Gyeonggi province. Opponents argued that its nationwide implementation would cause the decrease of fiscal revenues. Gim Yuk tried to persuade King Hyojong to adopt Daedongbeop. At last in 1651, King Hyojong endorsed Daedongbeop in Chungcheong province. Unavoidably, Gim Yuk was departed from the mainstream bureaucrats represented by Kim Jip (김집, 金集) and Song Si-yeol (송시열, 宋時烈), and caused the separation of anti-Gim Sandang (산당, 山黨, meaning 'the Mountain Party') and pro- Gim Handang (한당, 漢黨, meaning 'the Han River Party').Lee Heon-chang, op. cit., pp. 231, 260. Gim Yuk was criticized as stubborn to the extreme. Even at his deathbed, he was wishing that Daedongbeop should be expanded to Jeolla province, which was finally completed in 1657 by his successor Seo Pil-won (서필원, 徐必遠), Governor of Jeolla province.  Other pragmatic policies  In addition to Daedongbeop, Gim Yuk stressed on the use of currency or coin. Until then, only rice and cotton cloth were traded in exchange for merchandise. He asserted the circulation of coins would be conducive not only to distribution of goods but also to securing fiscal revenues. In 1651, Sangpyeong Tongbo (상평통보, 常平通寶) was first circulated in the metropolitan area and the Northwestern territory. In this regard, he suggested the government to permit the private persons to develop silver mines across the country. Gim Yuk was eager to make his thoughts on economy and pragmatic ideas to be realized in real life, for example:Ibid., pp. 438ˆ439. * to use water wheels for irrigation in the farmland; * to employ big wheel carts for easy transportation; * to encourage and promote commerce and engineering contrary to conventional thoughts; * to adopt the Western-style calendar system (시헌력, 時憲曆)A Jesuit missionary to China, Adam Schall, introduced the Shixian calendar (Book of the Conformity of Time) in 1645. Quite impressed by this new calendar system, Gim Yuk imported it to Joseon. for the convenience in real life; * to print and distribute medical and disaster-survival reference books (구황벽온방, 救荒辟瘟方); * to develop printing business for publishing and distribution of good books,At his request, his sons and grandsons were engaged in printing and publishing the books written by Gim Yuk and other authors' books. and * to dredge rivers in Hanyang to prevent flood in a rainy season.  Assessment and legacy  Gim Yuk was the best reformist-statesman of the Joseon dynasty. Regardless of the mainstream Neo-Confucianism, he paid attention to how to stabilize the living of common people. It was possible because Gim Yuk had an advantage of the descendant of a famous Gimyo martyr, and he was open-minded to pragmatism rather than philosophically oriented. He knew the limitation of a human being.Lee Heong-chang, op.cit., p.544, pp.550-553. As a matter of fact, he was taught by Neo-Confucianist Seong Hon and belonged to the Westerners faction (서인, 西人). But he managed to make a transition bridge to the Silhak school (실학파, 實學派) in the next century. = Assessment = Sometimes, he was called a Wang Anshi (왕안석, 王安石) of Joseon by his critics and opponents. Truly, Gim Yuk was an unprecedented statesman of far-sighted view and action in that: * He saw the current situation after the invasion of foreign armies as a critical moment of the nation; * He warned the crisis might cause the alienation of common people; * He suggested the tax burden of common people should be alleviated; * He asserted the nationwide implementation of Daedongbeop and use of currency would help common people to survive such economic crises; * He proposed a simple thing like a water wheel, a big wheel cart, and the new calendar system based on the solar system would make the living of people more convenient. Gim Yuk's thoughts and policies are assessed to have a big influence on the Silhak movement in the 18th century.NAVER Encyclopedia, Kim Yuk 김육, 金堉, Doosan Baekgwa. = Legacy = Thanks to Gim Yuk's reform, the impoverished state revived and fiscal revenues increased. However, the power elite groups were indulged in factional strife-based disputes on the Confucian courtesy issues over royal funeral services. As the mainstream Neo-Confucianist Song Si-yeol took power, such pragmatic policy ideas as proposed by Ryu Seong-ryong and Gim Yuk were excluded in governing the nation. In the age of King Yeongjo and King Jeongjo, it seemed the Joseon dynasty and people enjoyed a renaissance. When King Jeongjo died abruptly in 1800, the maternal relatives of royal family meddled in the policy-making and administration continuously, the Joseon dynasty came near to demise. For the sake of policy-making like Daedongbeop, Gim Yuk sought cooperation from power elite groups regardless of their fractional belonging. Although he belonged to the Westerners faction, he was taught by Cho Ho-ik from the Southerners faction, and close relationship with other politicians like Kim Se-ryeom, Cho Gyeong, etc. from the Southerners faction. How can we find a Gim Yuk in this progressive/conservative camp logics-dominated society?Lee Heong-chang, op.cit., p.646. What if a conservative Song Si-yeol adopted a progressive Gim Yuk's policy? Is it possible now in Korea?See supra note 10 Chosun Ilbo interview.

The jib- and flying jib- booms carry the tacks of the jib and flying jib sails, respectively, and the stay for the fore topgallant mast and the royal stay.  Jib-boom  The jib- boom is—as the name suggests—the boom for the jib, extending its foot. On smaller, merchant, sailing ships, it is commonly attached to the bowsprit by a cap and a saddle, either lashed down or secured with a crupper chain. Alternatively, it can be attached by a boom iron and a cap, or even by two boom irons. The cap and saddle allow it to be withdrawn aft along the bowsprit as a ship enters harbour, reducing the opportunity for passing ships to glance against it and snap it off from the bowsprit. It is octagonal in cross-section at its heel end. If secured by a chain to the bowsprit, it is iron-scored at the heel. At its point it is also (partly) octagonal in cross-section, the same as is the boom iron that secures the flying jib-boom to it. The flying jib-boom lies against the upper starboard side of the octagon. The stay of the fore topgallant mast is attached to the jib-boom at the extremity of its point. The stay for the jib sail is attached to the shouldering at its heel. Just as the bowsprit has bobstays, in order to counteract the upward force from the jib and fore topgallant stays a martingale hangs down from the point of the jib-boom to a dolphin striker, pulling downwards on the jib-boom.  Flying jib-boom  The flying jib-boom is secured, at its heel end, to the jib-boom by a boom iron and lashing. At its point, it has a sheave for the royal stay.

Since June 2015, she has been Bishop of Gloucester, the first female diocesan bishop in the Church of England. From 2011 until 2015, she was the Archdeacon of Hackney in the Diocese of London. Early life and career Treweek was born Rachel Montgomery on 4 February 1963. She was educated at Broxbourne School, a state school in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire. She studied at the University of Reading and graduated in 1984 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in linguistics and language pathology. Treweek's first career was as a speech and language therapist. After six years as a paediatric speech therapist in the National Health Service, she left her job to begin training for ordination in the Church of England. Ordained ministry Treweek studied for ordained ministry at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, an Anglican theological college, and graduated with a Bachelor of Theology (BTh) degree in 1994. She was made a deacon at Petertide 1994 (3 July), by David Hope, Bishop of London, at St Paul's Cathedral, and ordained a priest the following Petertide (27 June 1995), by Martin Wharton, Bishop of Kingston, at her title church. From 1994 to 1997, she served a curacy at St George and All Saints Church, Tufnell Park, London. From 1997 to 1999, she remained at St George and All Saints Church as the associate vicar. In 1999, she was appointed vicar of St James-the-Less, Bethnal Green, London.\\"Archdeacons\\" , Diocese of London website. In addition to the incumbency, she was appointed the continuing ministerial education officer for the Diocese of London. In 2006, Treweek left parish ministry on her appointment as the Archdeacon of Northolt; this made her one of six archdeacons in the Diocese of London. She held the position for five years before becoming the Archdeacon of Hackney on 14 May 2011. She relinquished this appointment on confirmation of her appointment as Bishop of Gloucester on 15 June 2015. In September 2013, Treweek was elected as one of eight \\"participant observers\\" of the House of Bishops as the observer representing the South East of England. The observers are senior priests who are women and who will attend and participate in meetings of the House of Bishops until six women sit in the House by right as bishops. She attended her first meeting of the House of Bishops of the General Synod of the Church of England on 9 December 2013. =Episcopal ministry= On 26 March 2015, it was announced that Treweek was to become the next Bishop of Gloucester, the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Gloucester. Though there had been two women appointed bishops previously in the Church of England, she was the first woman to be appointed a diocesan bishop, rather than as a suffragan bishop. She was the first woman to become a bishop in the Province of Canterbury, jointly with Sarah Mullally, Bishop of Crediton. On 15 June 2015, her election was confirmed during a sitting of the Arches Court of Canterbury at St Mary-le- Bow, City of London.Archbishop of Canterbury — Diary: Bishop of Gloucester — Confirmation of Election (Accessed 27 May 2015) At this point, she legally became the Bishop of Gloucester.Working with the Spirit: Choosing Diocesan Bishops: a Review of the Operation of the Crown Appointments Commission and Related Matters page 81, section 5.24 (Accessed 27 May 2015) On 22 July 2015, she was consecrated a bishop by Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, during a ceremony at Canterbury Cathedral. She and Sarah Mullally (later Bishop of London) were the first women to be ordained as bishops at Canterbury Cathedral.First female diocesan bishop in C of E consecrated. Anglicannews.org. Retrieved on 23 July 2015. On 19 September, she was installed at Gloucester Cathedral as the 41st Bishop of Gloucester. Following the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015, she was to become the first woman to enter the House of Lords as a bishop and Lord Spiritual as soon as a Lord Spiritual seat was emptied. She became eligible to take her seat when parliament reconvened in September 2015 after its summer recess and took the seat vacated by Tim Stevens (former Bishop of Leicester and Convenor of the Bishops in the Lords). She sent back the first version of her writ of summons because it referred to her as a “right reverend father in God” (bishops' writs have simply omitted “father in God” ever since — even for male bishops).e.g. Chris Lincoln & Martin Chichester On 26 October 2015, she was introduced to the House by Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Richard Chartres, Bishop of London. Theology Treweek believes that God should be considered to be neither male nor female and tries to avoid using gender-specific pronouns when referring to God.

Color moments are mainly used for color indexing purposes as features in image retrieval applications in order to compare how similar two images are based on color. Usually one image is compared to a database of digital images with pre-computed features in order to find and retrieve a similar Image. Each comparison between images results in a similarity score, and the lower this score is the more identical the two images are supposed to be.  Overview  Color moments are scaling and rotation invariant. It is usually the case that only the first three color moments are used as features in image retrieval applications as most of the color distribution information is contained in the low-order moments.Hui Yu, Mingjing Li, Hong-Jiang Zhang, Jufu Feng. \\"Color Texture Moments for Content-Based Image Retrieval\\". Proc. IEEE Intl Conf. on Image Processing, pp. 929-932, Sep. 2002 Since color moments encode both shape and color information they are a good feature to use under changing lighting conditions, but they cannot handle occlusion very successfully.Xiaoyin Duanmu. \\"Image Retrieval Using Color Moment Invariant\\". Seventh International Conference on Information Technology, pp. 200-203, 2010. Color moments can be computed for any color model. Three color moments are computed per channel (e.g. 9 moments if the color model is RGB and 12 moments if the color model is CMYK). Computing color moments is done in the same way as computing moments of a probability distribution. = Mean = The first color moment can be interpreted as the average color in the image, and it can be calculated by using the following formula :E_i=\\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\\\frac{1}{N}p_{ij} where N is the number of pixels in the image and p_{ij} is the value of the j-th pixel of the image at the i-th color channel. = Standard Deviation = The second color moment is the standard deviation, which is obtained by taking the square root of the variance of the color distribution. :\\\\sigma_i=\\\\sqrt{(\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N}(p_{ij}-E_i)^2)} where E_i is the mean value, or first color moment, for the i-th color channel of the image. = Skewness = The third color moment is the skewness. It measures how asymmetric the color distribution is, and thus it gives information about the shape of the color distribution. Skewness can be computed with the following formula: :s_i=\\\\sqrt[3]{(\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N}(p_{ij}-E_i)^3)} = Kurtosis = Kurtosis is the fourth color moment, and, similarly to skewness, it provides information about the shape of the color distribution. More specifically, kurtosis is a measure of how extreme the tails are in comparison to the normal distribution. = Higher-order color moments = Higher-order color moments are usually not part of the color moments feature set in image retrieval tasks as they require more data in order to obtain a good estimate of their value, and also the lower-order moments generally provide enough information.  Applications  Color moments have significant applications in image retrieval. They can be used in order to compare how similar two images are. This is a relatively new approach to color indexing. The greatest advantage of using color moments comes from the fact that there is no need to store the complete color distribution.M. Stricker and M. Orengo. \\"Similarity of Color Images\\". In SPIE Conference on Storage and Retrieval for Image and Video Databases III, volume 2420, pp. 381-392, Feb. 1995. This greatly speeds up image retrieval since there are less features to compare. In addition, the first three color moments have the same units, which allows for comparison between them.V. Chitkara, M.A. Nascimento, and C. Mastaller. \\"Content-Based Image Retrieval Using Binary Signatures\\". In Technical Report TR-00-18, Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, 2000 = Color indexing = Color indexing is the main application of color moments. Images can be indexed, and the index will contain the computed color moments. Then, if someone has a particular image and wants to find similar images in the database, the color moments of the image of interest will also be computed. After that the following function will be used in order to compute a similarity score between the image of interest and all the images in the database: :d_{mom}(H,I)=\\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^{r}w_{i1}E_i^1-E_i^2+w_{i2}\\\\sigma_i^1-\\\\sigma_i^2+w_{i3}s_i^1-s_i^2 where: :*H and I are the color distributions of the two images that are being compared :*i is the channel index and r is the total number of channels :*E_i^1 and E_i^2 are the first order moments computed for the image distributions. :*\\\\sigma_i^1 and \\\\sigma_i^2 are the second order moments computed for the image distributions. :*s_i^1 and s_i^2 are the third order moments computed for the image distributions. :*w_{i1}, w_{i2}, and w_{i3} are weights, specified by the user, for each of the three color moments used. Finally, the images in the database will be ranked according to the computed similarity score with the image of interest, and the database images with the lowest d_{mom}(H,I) value should be retrieved. \\"A retrieval based on d_{mom}(H,I) may produce false positives because the index contains no information about the correlation between the color channels\\".  Example  A simple and concise example of the use of color moments for image retrieval tasks is illustrated in.Noah Keen. \\"Color Moments\\". Feb. 2005 Consider having several test images in a database and a \\"New Image\\". The goal is to retrieve images from the database that are similar to the \\"New Image\\". The first three color moments are used as features. There are several steps in this computation. #Image preprocessing (Optional) - The image preprocessing step of the computation process is optional. For example, in this step all images could be modified to be the same size (in terms of pixels). However, since color moments are invariant to scaling, it is not necessary to make all images the same width and height. #Computing the features - Use the color moments formulae in order to compute the first three moments for each of the color channels in the image. For example, if the HSV color space is used, this means that for each of the images, 9 features in total will be computed (the first three order moments for the Hue, Saturation, and Value channels). #Calculating the similarity score - After computing the color moments the weights for each of the moments in the d_{mom}(H,I) function should be determined by the user. The weights have to be adjusted each time in accordance with the application or condition and quality of the images. Following that the d_{mom}(H,I) function is used to calculate a similarity score for the \\"New Image\\" and each of the images in the database. #Ranking and image retrieval - From the previous step the d_{mom}(H,I) values were obtained. Now a comparison of these values can be made in order to decide which of the images in the database are more similar to the \\"New Image\\", and thus rank the database images accordingly. The smaller the d_{mom}(H,I) value is the more similar the two color distributions are supposed to be. Finally, some of the top ranked images (the ones with the smallest d_{mom}(H,I) value) from the database are retrieved.

Content Although sharing its title with Francis Ernest Lloyd's classic 1942 work, this treatment focuses primarily on physiology and biochemistry, reflecting the authors' areas of expertise. It also deviates from Lloyd's work in that content is organised by biological mechanism rather than by genus. The book has two appendices: the first is a summary of letters sent by Rebecca Merritt Austin to William Marriott Canby regarding her field observations of Darlingtonia in the 1870s; the second concerns Matthew Jebb's observations of Nepenthes in Papua New Guinea (a precursor to Jebb's \\"An account of Nepenthes in New Guinea\\", published two years later).Jebb, M.H.P. 1991.

Schnell noted that in some cases the book misquotes authors regarding their conclusions and that one should therefore \\"not use [it] as a secondary citation source\\". Schnell also commented on the book's original price of US$150, which he considered high given its print quality. He concluded by writing: > I can recommend this book as an addition to the rather scant carnivorous > plant book literature, with the caveats mentioned above. The authors do > bring forth some new material (even older references missed by Lloyd) and > some stimulating discussion and concepts. However, the work is not > encyclopedic as many might hope it would be. P. M. Smith, writing in New Phytologist, considered the book to present \\"a comprehensive biology of carnivory in plants, with up-to-date facts, informed evaluations and speculations about morphological and physiological adaptations, and how they may have originated\\", but added that \\"[t]here are no great surprises\\".Smith, P.M. 1991. Reviews: The Carnivorous Plants. New Phytologist 117(3): 512–513. He also pointed out the book's \\"unevenness of style\\" and \\"occasionally tortuous\\" writing, concluding: \\"A more critical and systematic editorial policy would have made the book significantly shorter, clearer and cheaper – hence better.\\" In a 1991 review for the Kew Bulletin, Martin Cheek wrote that the book \\"is like no other on the subject\\" and \\"provides a 'modern scientific' insight into the carnivorous mechanisms of plants\\".Cheek, M. 1991. Book reviews: The Carnivorous Plants. Kew Bulletin 46(1): 179–182. However, he thought that the layout of the book \\"makes for very disjointed reading if one is pursuing all the information pertaining to one plant\\". Cheek also pointed out a number of inconsistencies and taxonomic errors in the text (the genus Sarracenia, for example, is said to have 7, 8, and \\"14 or so\\" species on different pages), although he wrote that \\"[i]nconsistencies are inevitable in a multi-author volume such as this\\". Reviewing the book for the Bulletin of the Australian Carnivorous Plant Society, Brett Lymn described it as \\"a serious scientific work\\" though \\"not just a book for academics\\". He continued: \\"The actual information contained in the book is detailed and sometimes very scientific but on the whole, the text can be read and enjoyed by someone that has a keen interest in learning more about the plants that they cultivate.\\" Lymn recommended it as \\"a good addition to the library of any serious grower of Carnivorous Plants who has deep pockets\\".Lymn, B. 1992.

It depicts a motorist who picks up two women from the roadside and later engages in several sex acts with them. Although most scholars consider A Free Ride a 1915 film, some sources claim that it was produced later. The film's director used a pseudonym and the cast remained anonymous. The filming location is not known, although it may have been produced in New Jersey. Two contradictory theories have emerged regarding the identities of the cast: some sources suggest they were people with low social status, but others assert the opposite. The Kinsey Institute has a print of the film in its collection. A Free Ride was screened at the inauguration of the Museum of Sex. In 2004, Lisa Oppenheim, a New York-based artist, remade the film.  Plot  A Free Rides opening intertitle denotes the film's setting as \\"in the wide open spaces, where men are men and girls will be girls, the hills are full of romance and adventure\\". The film shows two women walking home together alongside a rural road. A wealthy male motorist in a right-hand-drive 1912 Haynes 50-60 Model Y Touring Car arrives and offers them a lift. After some hesitation, the women accept his promise to behave properly, and sit beside him in the front seat. However, the man immediately kisses and fondles them, before they get underway. Some time later, the man stops the car and steps out of sight into the trees to urinate, but the women follow and voyeuristically watch him, returning to the car as he finishes to conceal that they've done so. After his return, the women go the same spot themselves to urinate. He secretly follows, watches them, and becomes sexually aroused, also returning to the car before he is discovered. The women return to the car, and accept the man's offer of liquor. The man asks one of the women to accompany him into the woods, and they masturbate each other while standing. The other woman becomes curious and follows them into the woods. Upon seeing them, she becomes sexually aroused and stimulates herself. Meanwhile, the man and the first woman have sex in the missionary position. Soon after, the second woman joins them and the man has sex with her doggy style. Later, they have a threesome, and one of the women subsequently performs fellatio on him. After finishing the sexual acts, they return to the car and drive away. Production Dave Thompson to conclude that the crew strove to make the cast unidentifiable. British author Dave Thompson, in his book Black and White and Blue: Adult Cinema from the Victorian Age to the VCR, notes that D. W. Griffith is credited by one source as director on A Free Ride. But this claim is rejected by film historian Kevin Brownlow and author Thompson himself. The identities of the cast are not disclosed in the credits (the title card says \\"starring the Jazz Girls\\"). Thompson asserts that the cast do not resemble identifiable contemporary silent film stars. He claims the crew strove to make the cast unidentifiable, noting that the actor wears a large fake mustache and a hat. When the actor's mustache became detached before the end of the film, he hid his face until the mustache was reattached. Thompson notes that some historical accounts, which he describes as \\"casual histories\\", have suggested that the cast of early pornographic films were drawn from among people with low social status such as the homeless, drug addicts, the mentally ill, prostitutes, and petty criminals. Thompson argues that there is almost no documentary evidence for this claim, and suggests that the actors likely had higher social status. A Free Ride was shot outdoors. According to cultural historian Joseph W. Slade, there is a legend that it was shot in New Jersey. Most scholars, including Al Di Lauro, Gerald Rabkin and Jonathon Ross, believe that the film was produced in 1915 and is the earliest surviving American hardcore pornographic film. Los Angeles Times columnist Jay Jones notes A Free Ride is believed to be the first pornographic film made for commercial purposes. The 1915 production date is disputed by some sources. According to the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, the film was made between 1917 and 1919. Film scholar Linda Williams also writes that the assertion that A Free Ride is the earliest surviving American stag film is \\"doubtful\\". Kevin Brownlow writes in his book Behind the Mask of Innocence that, \\"judging by the fashions, the film was actually made around 1923\\". Thompson says that the evidence presented to support the later production date is shoddy, but notes that some other experts agree with Brownlow's assertion. Evidence cited in support of a 1923 production date includes the similarity of one of the women's hairstyle to that of Mary Pickford, an actress who dominated American film industry during the 1920s. Proponents of the later date claim that the woman wore a Pickford- style wig. However, Thompson indicates that the curly Pickford-style hair became popular in the 1910s, citing a 1914 interview in Photoplay magazine in which Pickford said that she felt exhausted by incoming letters that inquired about her hair. Thompson further disputes the claim that the woman in the film was actually wearing a wig. Release A Free Ride was reportedly first shown to its target audience in 1915. At that time, it was not possible to screen stag films in public theaters due to the Victorian moral views of contemporary society. Like other pornographic films of that era, A Free Ride was released and circulated underground to avoid censorship. It was likely shown in brothels, gentlemen's clubs, illegal gatherings of men in public places, stag parties, and other all-male venues: the film was kept hidden from society at large and the government. Critical analysis A Free Ride uses humor in its opening credits through false cast and crew names. According to Williams, A Free Ride is a typological representative of a genre of early pornographic movies that included voyeurism. The film also shows sexual intercourse, fellatio, troilism, and urolagnia. Like the Argentinian film El Satario (c. 1907–15) and the German film Am Abend (c. 1910), A Free Ride begins with simple narrative frames, then shows signs of more conventional cinema for a short period, and finally shows hardcore scenes in a fragmented manner. Author Laurence O'Toole has described early stag films such as A Free Ride as \\"a muddle of jerky camerawork and slipshod editing\\". However, like other stag films from the 1910s, this film is of superior quality to the non-commercial pornography which preceded it. Journalist Luke Ford writes that sex is given emphasis over story in A Free Ride. The film uses humor in its opening credits through false cast and crew names, such as A. Wise Guy as director, Will B. Hard as photographer, and Will She as the title writer. Williams describes this as \\"crude humor\\" and asserts it was common in American stag films produced from this time. Professor Frank A. Hoffman of University at Buffalo writes that the film's production standard indicates that there had been previous experimentation with stag films. O'Toole writes that despite the elementary nature of movies like A Free Ride, stag films became \\"rigidified into a restricted visual experience\\" in a short period of time. Hoffman notes that A Free Ride contains many fundamental constituents which are the characteristics of an archetypal pornographic film. He identifies these basic constituents as a carefully planned but not complicated state of affairs to provide introductory motivation, visual stimuli to sexually excite the women, a theme that is generally rare in reality, a straightforward and very quick seduction, and the sex acts as the film's central theme. Reception and legacy A Free Ride was a well-known stag film of the 1910s and, according to Williams, is regarded as a classic pornographic film. It is one of the three earliest pornographic films, along with El Satario and Am Abend, in the collection of the Kinsey Institute. The 1970 documentary film A History of the Blue Movie includes scenes from this film. The Museum of Sex in New York City showed A Free Ride at its 2002 inaugural exhibition. Lisa Oppenheim, a New York-based film director, remade the film in 2004 using no actors; instead the events of the film were represented by \\"the landscape and trees\\".

They were reformed in 1947 and in 1958 reached the proper rounds of the Challenge Cup for the first time. For a time during the 1960s, and 1970s, the club had no permanent home ground, having lost the use of their Sandy Desert ground. They moved to their current ground in 1995. The club have played at the professional stage of the Challenge cup on 21 occasions. These include First Round Proper of the Challenge Cup on four occasions (1958, 1960, 1970 and 1974). In 1970, the club almost caused an upset in the Challenge Cup against Huddersfield at Fartown ground in a narrow 15-10 defeat. Following the restructuring of the Challenge Cup in the 1993-94 season, they have qualified for the third round of the Challenge Cup on eight successive occasions between 1995 and 2002, a record for an amateur club.

It contained the only extant family Peltospiridae (and some prehistoric gastropod families). However, the taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005) does not use the name Peltospiroidea (in that system, the family Peltopiridae is placed within the Neomphaloidea). It was described as a new species within new genus Gigantopelta in 2015 and it was classified within the family Peltospiridae. Location of E2 and E9 sites in the Scotia Sea showing the East Scotia Ridge (ESR) between the Scotia Plate (SCO) and South Sandwich Plate (SAN). Distribution This species is known from two sites near hydrothermal vents in the East Scotia Ridge of the south Atlantic Ocean: from 2,394 m depth at the E9 vent site and from the 2,608 m depth at the E2 site. Description Dorsal view of Gigantopelta chessoia showing a mantle cavity overview. The shell and mantle tissue have been removed. Scale bar is 1 cm. Cross section of Gigantopelta chessoia showing enlarged oesophageal gland (og). ct – ctenidium, si – blood sinus, pm – pedal muscle. The scale bar is 1 cm. The color of the shell is dark olive. The shell has three to four whorls. The width of the shell is from 4.21–45.7 mm. Body size of the juvenile snail is 2 mm, while body size of the adult is 50 mm. It has non-papillate tentacles. The digestive system: there is one pair of radula cartilages. The digestive tract is short and consist of a single loop. The rectum does not penetrate the heart. The radula consist of 1.4% of body volume in juveniles and radula cartilages consist of 2.6% of body volume in juveniles. The respiratory system consist of single left bipectinate ctenidium (gill). The circulatory system is hypertrophied: heart is greatly enlarged. The ventricle is 0.42 mm in juvenile animal length of 2.0 mm. The ventricle grows to the size 6 mm in adults. There is a single left auricle. Gigantopelta chessoia has symbiotic bacteria in its enlarged oesophageal gland. The body of Gigantopelta chessoia has low values of carbon isotope δ13C. This indicates that carbon fixation in Gigantopelta chessoia can occur via Calvin-Benson- Bassham cycle by endosymbiotic Gammaproteobacteria.Reid W. D. K., Sweeting C. J., Wigham B. D., Zwirglmaier K., Hawkes J. A., McGill R. A. R, Linse K. & Polunin N. V. C. (2013). \\"Spatial Differences in East Scotia Ridge Hydrothermal Vent Food Webs: Influences of Chemistry, Microbiology and Predation on Trophodynamics\\". PLoS ONE 8(6): e65553. . The occurrence of endosymbiont bacteria in the oesophageal gland was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy in 2017. The oesophageal gland is fused and enlarged to fill the entire ventral side of mantle cavity. It is occupying 0.6% of visceral mass volume in juveniles, while it is increasing allometrically up to 9% visceral mass volume in adults. Blood sinuses are large, but few and fixed in position. The nervous system has ganglia. The sensory organs of Gigantopelta chessoia include statocysts with statolith. The reproductive system has fully developed gonads in juveniles at body size 2.0 mm.  Ecology  This area between hydrothermal vent chimneys on the E9 site at a depth of 2,398 m is occupied by Gigantopelta chessoia. Scale bar is 1 m. This gastropod is generally found in dense aggregations up to ~1,000 m−2. Small limpets Lepetodrilus sp. East Scotia Ridge are sometimes found on the shells of Gigantopelta chessoia. Other marine fauna, such as actinostolid sea anemones (family Actinostolidae), crabs in the genus Kiwa, and the pycnogonid arthropod or \\"sea spider\\" cf. Sericosura, can be found living together with this species. Gigantopelta chessoia may be a mixotroph in juvenile life and shifting to obligate symbiotrophy as an adult. Gigantopelta chessoia is gonochoristic (they have distinct males and females).

History Nordhausen station Erfurt Central Station under reconstruction (2007) The construction of the Erfurt-Nordhausen railway was constructed in accordance with a treaty between Prussia and the Principality of Schwarzburg- Sondershausen signed on 21 December 1866. Agreements were reached for the provision of government investment and guarantees from Schwarzburg- Sondershausen and the adjacent districts and cities of Prussia so that the Nordhausen-Erfurter Eisenbahn (Nordhausen-Erfurt Railway, NEE) company could be founded on 24 April 1867 and it received a licence for the project from Schwarzburg-Sondershausen on 17 June 1867. The aim of the railway construction was to connect the cities of Nordhausen and Erfurt (both in the Prussian Province of Saxony at that time), and at the same time establish the first rail connection to part of the Schwarzburg-Sondershäuser Unterherrschaft (under dominion), which was the northern part of the principality of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. The line was built by a consortium of the companies of Plessner, Schultze and Steinfeld of Berlin and was opened on 17 August 1869. It ran for its first eight kilometres from Nordhausen to Wolkramshausen along the Halle–Kassel railway towards Eichenberg and Kassel, though on a second track built for the line, reached the Residenzstadt (royal capital) of Sondershausen and further south crossed the Hainleite ridge and ran by Greußen and Straußfurt to the state capital of Erfurt, where it ended at the station of the Thuringian Railway. Later several branches and connecting lines branched off the line. The Kyffhäuser Railway branched off from Sondershausen to Bad Frankenhausen from 1898. The Hohenebra-Ebeleben railway was opened from Hohenebra in 1883 and the Greußen-Ebeleben-Keula railway was opened from Greußen in 1901, connecting to Ebeleben and Keula. The Ballstädt–Straußfurt railway (opened from 1889 to 1906) and the Straußfurt–Großheringen railway (opened in 1874) branched off from Straußfurt and the Erfurt–Bad Langensalza railway (opened in 1897) branched off from Kühnhausen. Following the nationalisation of private railways in Prussia and because the line's profits were below expectations as a result of growing competition from other railways, the company agreed to be bought by the Prussian State, which took control on 1 January 1887. The company was dissolved and its assets were placed under the railway division (Eisenbahndirektion) of Frankfurt, but was soon transferred to the railway division of Erfurt. Planning  It is planned to upgrade the line from Nordhausen and Erfurt to allow a line speed of 120 km/h. It is envisaged that travel time will be reduced to less than an hour and services will connect to the Intercity-Express line to the south. In Kühnhausen provision will be made for the coupling of railcars from Bad Langensalza. The first section between Wolkramshausen and Sondershausen was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2013 but was delayed until 2014. Passenger services  *1880: three pairs of trains per day, running time: 2:18. *1913: six pairs of trains per day, including 2 pairs of express trains, running time: 1:27. *1936: 9 pairs of trains per day, including 2 pairs of express trains, running time: 1:40. *2006: KBS 601, hourly services, every second services was a Regional-Express (RE), running time: 1:19. *2009: up to 17 pairs of services daily with additional services between Nordhausen and Sondershausen during peak hours, hourly services, every second service is an RE, running time: 1:15.

This school is a Christian Religious Minority institution and the related certificate was issued in 2012 by the state Govt. History The fathers of the Missionary Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament (M.C.B.S) invited sisters of CMC Amala province Kanjirappally, to collaborate with them in the Satara–Solapur mission. Sensing the urgent need of an educational institution in the village, the then provincial council decided to start a school as their own in Lonand. The school started functioning with 26 students in K.G section in 1995 in a rented building owned by the Lonand panchayat. It started as co-educational institution with English as medium of instruction. The enrollment increased year by year and the school had to be shifted to spacious building. The province bought a plot of 4 acres of land on the Lonand –Nimbodi road and started construction of the school. A portion of the building was completed and blessed on 8 July 1997 by Rev. Fr. Thomas Thadathil, the mission superior of MCBS (Satara- Solapur) and the school shifted to the new site. In the year 2006, the first batch of 10th std passed out in flying colors. In the year 2012, the school was raised to the status of a Junior College offering science stream. Now that the school has all the facilities of a Junior college such as laboratories, library, computer lab etc. the management procured another adjacent plot of land in 2007 and expanded the playground with basketball, volleyball and football courts.

The bridge provides a second road link from Poole Town Centre to Hamworthy. The intention is that the bridge will allow development of four major sites, two in the town centre and two in Hamworthy, including the old power station, which was closed in 1988. Location The bridge spans the Backwater Channel which links Holes Bay with Poole Harbour. The bridge and approach roads are connected to the junction of West Quay Road in the East and to urban feeder roads in the West. Design The new bridge is intended to operate alongside the existing Poole Bridge with one of the bridges always open for vehicular traffic (except during closures for maintenance or in a marine emergency), the intention is that variable-message signs will direct traffic to the open bridge. The bridge comprises a wide carriageway with two vehicular lanes and two separate cycle lanes. Additionally two wide footpaths are provided which cantilever from the bridge. The bridge is constructed in five spans, with a total length of roughly . The approaches comprise two spans, the centre lifting span consists of two triangular leaves that span between the main bearings to provide a clear channel of when open. To permit the passage of boats through the navigation channel, the lift spans were planned to pivot to 88 degrees powered by two hydraulic rams which operate up to 15 times per day and take two minutes to fully open. Two high masts are fitted to the lifting leaves, the top two metres illuminated with white LED lights. Four high pillars housing the barriers, lights, speakers and traffic controls which link the bridge with the control room are located on the two fixed spans adjacent to the lifting section. Hochtief (UK) Construction was awarded the £18.5 million contract for the construction of the bridge. The contract for the supply of around 900 tonnes of steel was awarded to Cleveland Bridge UK and Gifford UK (Ramboll) working with Wilkinson Eyre Architects are the lead design consultants. Metamont Ltd installed the marine grade stainless steel balustrade including the variable colour DMX lighting. History Plans for a new bridge date to the 1980s, with the second lifting bridge concept being suggested in 2000 after a fixed bridge crossing Holes Bay and linking with the A31 was cancelled by the government in 1998. The council submitted detailed plans to Department for Transport in 2004 and following a public inquiry in 2005, the £37 million Twin Sails bridge project was given approval in 2006/7 but construction was initially delayed due to a stalemate between the council and the land owners. After negotiations were settled in August 2009, there was a further delay in the allocation of the £14.14 million government grant which was finally agreed in March 2010. Construction began in May 2010 with completion and opening planned for late February 2012. Problems with the road surface caused the bridge to remain closed although the opening ceremony and visit by The Princess Royal went ahead in early March 2012. The bridge opened to traffic on 4 April 2012 after the road surface had been relaid, the first motor vehicle crossing at 9.38AM. Problems with the bridge operation continued in the summer of 2012 with delays caused through the barrier operation and lifting mechanism as well as continuing defects in the road surface.

The house is a Grade II* listed building. Richard Somerset's father FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan commanded the British forces during the Crimean War. He died in 1855 and Richard succeeded him, his elder brother having died earlier. In 1858, a large group of the late Lord Raglan's \\"friends and admirers and comrades\\"purchased the house and estate as a memorial to him and presented it to Richard and his heirs in perpetuity. Richard engaged Thomas Henry Wyatt to undertake complete rebuilding of the court in a Tudor style. The house is built of Old Red Sandstone. The interior retains the original Jacobean architecture in the hall; it has an \\"unusual early Renaissance\\" hall frieze which came from Usk Priory. The frieze was decorated in the 1930s by FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, the antiquarian and historian of Monmouthshire, and the author, with Cyril Fox, of the major study of vernacular architecture in the county, Monmouthshire Houses. FitzRoy Somerset, 5th Baron Raglan died in 2010, and the court, its estate, and its major contents were left to his nephew Henry van Moyland of Los Angeles, while the title passed to the 5th Baron's younger brother Geoffrey. There was a legal dispute between family members in 2014, after which the Raglan collection of military memorabilia from Waterloo and the Crimea was sold at auction by Moyland, for just over £2 million. In Spring 2015, the house itself was under offer with a guide price of £1.6 million and was sold in June 2015. Memorials to members of the Raglan branch of the Somerset family can be seen in Church of St John, Llandenny.

Born in Brittnau, Switzerland, he earned his bachelor's degree in 1897 and his Ph.D in 1902 from the Eidgenossisches Polytechnikum in Zurich, and was active in the Baháʼí Faith from 1921. Physics department Kunz arrived at the University of Illinois in 1909 as a theoretical physicist. He taught most of the graduate courses and supervised half of the Ph. Ds up to 1929. Larazus notes that “He was clearly the intellectual leader of the department.” One of his students was E. Frances Seiler who became the first woman to earn a Ph.D in physics at Illinois for her thesis on the color-sensitivity of photoelectric cells. Kunz also wrote papers on and gave public lectures on relativity.  * Photoelectric cells and astronomical photometry Kunz made significant contributions to construction of photoelectric cells improving on the methods introduced by Elster and Geitel. During the fall of 1911, he began a collaboration and friendship with the University of Illinois Observatory director Joel Stebbins that would revolutionize astronomical photometry. Kunz's photoelectric cells were many times more sensitive that what was available commercially and therefore able to detect faint star light. Kunz's cells would be used at half a dozen observatories all across the nation including Yerkes Observatory, Lick Observatory, and Washburn Observatory. Kunz also accompanied Stebbins and four solar eclipse expeditions beginning with the Solar eclipse of June 8, 1918 to measure the total light of the solar corona with the photoelectric photometer. The collaboration between Stebbins and Kunz continued until Kunz's death in 1938. Kunz also collaborated with electrical engineering professor Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner to use a photoelectric cell to photograph sound and reproduce it electronically. When Tykociner demonstrates the first sound-on-film motion picture recordings in 1921 in Urbana, the projector had a Kunz cell at its heart. Family Jakob Kunz was the son of Jakob and Anna Marie Weber Kunz. He was married to Anna Bolliger about 1913 and had two daughters Anna Marie and Margaret. Stebbins remembers Kunz as “the proverbial simplicity of a true scientist; he was liberal in politics and religions, and was always an enthusiastic worker for social justice.” In the Urbana area Kunz and his wife were active in the Baháʼí Faith. In 1922 he spoke on the subject of the harmony of science and religion,* * a subject he and Anna had spoken with ʻAbdu'l-Bahá on during their pilgrimage the year before. In 1919 they had co-signed a letter to ʻAbdu'l-Bahá following the break in communication with the Baháʼís during World War I. They spent about a year abroad.* * The Kunz daughters Annamarie and Margaret lead a class of a youth session of Louhelen Baháʼí School in the summer of 1937. The Kunz family would continue to speak at and sometimes host events of the religion in the coming years.  * Following Kunz' death, Anna moved to Switzerland to help spread the religion there where she died in August, 1973 Their daughter Anna Marie (Annamarie) Honnold gave some talks,* * and authored a well-known collection of stories about ʻAbdu'l-Bahá.

S. Eliot. Written sometime between 1915 and 1918, the poem was published originally in the September issue of the Little Review and first collected in June 1919 in a volume entitled Poems published by Leonard and Virginia Woolf's Hogarth Press. It is one of the quatrain poems, a mode that Eliot had adapted from the mid-19th-century French poet Theophile Gautier. The title is a fainter parody of William Wordsworth's title of the poem, Intimations of Immortality. Analysis The poem was developed in two sections; each contains four stanzas and each stanza contains four lines. The first section where Eliot paid homage to his great Jacobean masters in whom he found the unified sensibility is a kind of \\"versified critique\\" of Jacobean writers, Webster and Donne in particular. Both Webster and Donne are praised by the narrator, the former for seeing the “skull beneath the skin”(l.2), the latter for not seeking any “substitute for sense/ To seize and clutch and penetrate;/Expert beyond experience,..”(l.10-12). The apparent oxymoron of a \\"sense\\" that transcends beyond \\"experience\\" is followed by references to \\"the anguish of the marrow\\"(l.13) and the uncontrollable “fever of the bone” (l.16) that are too corporeal for mundane experience. The second section begins with a description of a modern Russian woman Grishkin whose “friendly bust/ Gives promise of pneumatic bliss”(l.19-20). In the following two stanzas, Grishkin is compared to the “Brazilian jaguar” which “does not in its arboreal gloom/ distil so rank a feline smell/ As Grishkin in a drawing room.”(l.26-28) In the concluding stanza, the narrator said that even her charm is the subject of philosophy. Nevertheless “our lot crawls between dry ribs/ To keep our metaphysics warm.”(l.31-32). References External links * Category:1910s poems Category:Poetry by T. S.

Plot In 1998, Erik, a Danish artist living in New York City, meets Paul, a lawyer, through a phone sex hotline. Clearly attracted to each other, they share an intimate moment and have sex. Erik later visits a man named Russ who seems more interested in showing off his muscles to Erik than having sex. Erik sees Paul again, and tells him about how he broke up with his ex-boyfriend Paolo, who was HIV-positive. Erik confides to his friend Claire on how he is happier now with Paul than he was with Paolo. Meanwhile, Paul asks Erik to keep quiet about his drug use and gets Erik high. Paul, who was closeted before meeting Erik, sees his ex-girlfriend while visiting an art gallery with Erik, who tries to persuade Paul to introduce him to her. While away from the city, Erik calls his doctor for some test results and learns that he is HIV-negative. Later, Paul throws a surprise birthday party for Erik. In 2000, Paul catches Erik talking to another man in the street. While confronting Erik about this, Paul argues with him, but they manage to get over it. Paul then briefly goes missing during a dinner with Erik and his friends, and evades Erik's questions about where he was. Erik, away from home working on his documentary, feels lonely and calls a phone sex hotline. However, he is startled when he is connected with Paul. Erik is left upset. Back in New York, Erik argues again with Paul but they manage to make up in the night. Later, Erik returns home from working on his documentary, he finds an unconscious Paul outside their apartment. Paul is sent to rehab and states that Erik ruined his life. Erik goes to a gay club and meets a painter named Igor. In 2003, with Paul's release from rehab and Erik's success with his film, Erik assumes everything will be better. Erik's life is rocked when he learns that Paul hasn't been home while he was away for work. However, while his sister comforts him, Erik gets a call from Paul who tells him to visit him in his hotel. Paul displays erratic behavior, trying to pretend he is okay while it is clear to Erik that he hasn't improved since rehab. Erik tries to convince Paul to return home, but Paul remains at the hotel and hires a male prostitute whom he has sex with while Erik watches on. Erik later visits Russ, and the two share some drugs and presumably have sex. In 2006, after not having seen each other for about a year, Paul meets Erik at a diner, where both seem better than before. He then invites Paul to spend the night at his apartment, to which Paul agrees, only to avoid having sex before going to sleep. Erik later runs into Igor on the street, and the two have a drink at a bar. While spending time together in the countryside, Erik asks Paul how he feels about their relationship, only for Paul to turn aggressive. Paul gives Erik an ultimatum, stating that he has a few hours to decide whether they move in together, or break up. Erik decides that they should move in together, only to drive to Paul's apartment in the city in the middle of the night to tell him that he's changed his mind. He walks Paul to work and Erik admits that he still loves him, although Paul is skeptical. The two hug, and Paul tells Erik to be well.

One of the most renowned Italian physicians of the late 19th Century, he was Minister of Education of the then young Kingdom of Italy for six times and once Minister of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, for a total period of almost ten years, between 1881 and 1903. He was a teacher to Augusto Murri. Together with Italian surgeon Francesco Durante, Baccelli promoted the construction of the Policlinico Umberto I in Rome. Baccelli as a physician Guido Baccelli spent almost his entire clinical and teaching life in the ancient, glorious but by that time decaying and unfit, mediaeval hospital of Santo Spirito in Saxia in Rome, between the Tiber and the Vatican City.Borghi, Rome’s physician..., p. 396. He was one of the Italian pioneers in the use of the stethoscope - the common people often referred to him as “the physician who examines the sick with the trumpet”Borghi, Rome’s physician..., p. 396. – of intravenous therapy and oxygen therapy.Borghi, Rome’s physician..., p. 396. In particular, he became famous when administered oxygen to the Italian King Victor Emmanuel II, prolonging his life for a few days during his last illness (a severe pneumonia).Crespi, Guido Baccelli.... He gave relevant contributions to the struggle against malaria which, at that time, was one of the main health and social problems of the recently reunited Kingdom of Italy and of its Capital town. In 1878 – with the occasion of the Universal Exposition of Paris – he wrote an important state-of-the-art essay on this subject: La Malaria di Roma.Baccelli's essay can be read inside this Monograph \\"Monografia della Città di Roma...\\". Guido Baccelli successively welcomed in his clinic of Santo Spirito the two future Nobel Prizes Alphonse Laveran (in 1882) and Camillo Golgi (in 1893) who were looking for confirmations of their theories about the origin and evolution of malaria, in the Campagna Romana, then scourged by the disease during summer and autumn time.Borghi, Rome’s physician..., p. 396. Baccelli was quite slow in accepting the anopheles as the sole vector in the transmission of the illness,Borghi, Rome’s physician..., p. 397. nevertheless he was a strong medical and political supporter of the Laws for the drainage of the Campagna Romana and the Pontine Marshes that - along with the free administration of quinine - significantly reduced the incidence of the disease in those areas.Borghi, Rome’s physician..., p. 397. Moreover, in 1889 he devised an effective treatment of the most serious cases of malaria with intravenous injections of quinine.Gorrini, Guido Baccelli..., p. 114.

It is endemic to the United States, where it occurs from New Jersey west to Minnesota and throughout most southern states. Description and ecology This plant is a hairy annual herb producing a stiff stem up to tall. The flowers are pink with purple spots and they bloom between July and September. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it contains chlorophyll to accomplish photosynthesis, but is also parasitic on other plants to obtain some nutrients. In cultivation the plant was able to parasitize Helianthus occidentalis (western sunflower) and Rudbeckia fulgida (showy black-eyed Susan) and it was observed to connect to a grass, possibly Poa compressa (Kentucky bluegrass), in the field. Distribution and habitat This plant has a widespread distribution and it was formerly more common than it is today. It appears to require soil disturbance in order to germinate. In the past, this disturbance may possibly have been caused by herds of bison. The plant can colonize mounds of earth which has been turned over by pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius). There are 40 to 50 known occurrences today, mostly comprising small populations. The largest populations are in Arkansas, Missouri, and Mississippi.

The name Q-York stands for \\"Quality – Yields Our Richest Key\\" and also Queens, New York where the group was founded in 2001. They have released numerous albums, appeared on various compilations/mixtapes worldwide and are the official MC / DJ for the FIBA 3x3 basketball tournament all throughout Asia. Influences Q-York was first inspired to make music through the sounds of the Golden age hip hop of the 1980s and 1990s in New York. They also spent time on the West Coast and were students of both the Los Angeles and Bay Area hip hop scene. Their versatility and flexibility in listening to all styles of music incorporates their open-mindedness into their sound. Although they are mostly known for their uptempo dance tracks, their overall sound remains diverse and has been described in the Philippines as having a \\"local-feel with international appeal\\". They compose their music primarily in English but they also fuse Tagalog within their songs. Specialists in \\"Taglish\\" (a mixture of English and Tagalog), they utilize catchphrases and specific words into their songs as a way of expressing their culture. In their songs, the group emphasizes self- empowerment, positivity, spirituality and pride in their heritage. Their lyrics also address the issues and struggles of Filipino people worldwide in an attempt to bring unity to the divisions within their community. Biography Knowa Lazarus and Flava Matikz met in Queens, New York. Knowa Lazarus needed a DJ for one of his shows and a friend of his referred their cousin \\"DJ Flava\\" to him. They did a few shows together in New Jersey and New York then went their separate ways. Two years passed and Lazarus was in process of recording his demo tape and majoring in Management of Music Enterprise at Baruch College, NYC. Flava Matikz, who was majoring in Music Technology at Queensborough Community College called Lazarus to inform him he was now making beats. They rented out a studio, recorded their first song together, then proceeded to build a home studio in Matikz' home in Woodside, Queens, New York. They released two EPs and an independent album – Let The Truth Be Told, and from 2001-2002 toured the East and West Coast. They generated a small buzz and gained the attention of NBA basketball player, Ron Artest, who had his own record company Tru Warier Records. Through Artest they were able to collaborate with Nature (formerly of The Firm), Canibus, Allure, among others. In early 2003 they relocated to Los Angeles, where they started their own CD/DVD manufacturing and web/graphic design businesses with T.H.E. Menace and other Q-York Senate members. As a web/graphic design company they designed websites for 50 Cent, Remy Martin, Funkmaster Flex and other hip hop artists. As a CD/DVD manufacturing company they worked with top West Coast DJs, reproducing CDs for the likes of DJ Vice, Big Syphe & Eric D-lux, DJ Turbulence, and many others. Artistically, on the West Coast they collaborated with Far East Movement, Diamonique, Dirty Birdy, Andre Nickatina, Equipto, San Quinn, Bambu (of Native Guns), Roscoe Umali, among others. In California they have released five albums – Step Ya Game Up Rapper Vol. 1 (2003), Jose Rizal (2005), How The Q-West Was One (2006) (a collaboration with DJ Lady Tribe), Step Ya Game Up Rapper Vol. 2 (2006), and L.I.F.E. – Lyrics Inspired From Experience (2008). In 2006 in search of a deeper purpose for their artistic talents, they began volunteering for Gawad Kalinga and speaking to public school youth about positivity through hip hop in San Diego, California. Through their advocacy they met the Philippine All Stars when they were competing in the US for the World Hip Hop Dance Championships. They collaborated with some of the members of the Philippine All Stars and recorded a song, \\"Caught Up\\" (sampling 112's song \\"Cupid\\"), which was released in the Philippines, and which made the top 10 on the Wave 89.1 chart. Lazarus and Matikz then decided to visit the Philippines, and toured with the Philippine All Stars for two months in 2007. Visiting their motherland for the first time, they fell in love and felt they discovered the true purpose for their passion. They both worked and saved money for a year and by late 2008, they had sold everything of theirs that wasn't needed and bought a one-way ticket to the Philippines. In 2009 they collaborated with the Philippine All Stars, AF Benaza and Jerome B Smooth and shot the music video for the song \\"Mainit\\" (Hot) which featured Kenjhons and Chelo Aestrid. The group exploded onto the Philippine music scene and garnered many nominations and awards for \\"Mainit\\" – Best Music Video (MYX Music Awards), Best Hip Hop Music Video (Urban Music Awards), and Hip-Hop Artist of the Year (Radio Music Awards). They performed as opening act for the Pussycat Dolls Live in Manila concert in 2009, and for APEC's after party in Singapore in November 2009, as front act for the Shock Value Tour in Manila with Timbaland, Justin Timberlake and JoJo. In 2010 Q-York performed along with Young JV during the Supafest Concert in Manila featuring T-Pain, Kelly Rowland, Sean Kingston and Flo Rida.Dominating performance by Pussycat Dolls  The Manila Bulletin Newspaper Online In 2011 they performed along with Jay-R and Chelo Aestrid at MYX Mo 2011.

Through the influence of their mentors at the camp they expanded their musicality and began to see themselves as more than just hip hop artists. In the Philippines they have collaborated/produced for talents such as Ogie Alcasid, Jay-R, Krista Kleiner, Chelo Aestrid, Young JV, Dannie Boi, Nina Girado, Gloc-9 & Paloma Esmeria. In 2011, Q-York garnered the attention of the Philippines' \\"Platinum Prince of R&B;\\", Jay-R. After a few meetings together, they signed a distribution deal for their album Q-York City with Jay-R's label Homeworkz, a sub-label of Universal Records (Philippines). Their first album to be released with the label was Q-York City. In 2014, the group released their second album titled Q-Labonation which features collaborations with other artists such as Ogie Alcasid, Sponge Cola and Yeng Constantino.

She originated in Alexandria, but moved to Rome during the episcopate of Anicetus ( 157 – 168). She attracted large numbers of followers and founded the Carpocratian sect of Marcellians. Like other Carpocratians, Marcellina and her followers believed in antinomianism, also known as libertinism, the idea that obedience to laws and regulations is unnecessary in order to attain salvation. They believed that Jesus was only a man, but saw him as a model to be emulated, albeit one which a believer was capable of surpassing. Marcellina's community appears to have sought to literally implement the foundational Carpocratian teaching of social egalitarianism. The Marcellians in particular are reported to have branded their disciples on the insides of their right earlobes and venerated images of Jesus as well as Greek philosophers such as Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle. Although the Marcellians identified themselves as \\"gnostics\\", many modern scholars do not classify them as members of the sect of Gnosticism. Historical context Fresco from the nave of the Dura-Europos church, dating to 240 AD, depicting Mary Magdalene alongside two other women (the third now almost completely missing due to extensive damage) approaching the empty tomb of Jesus. Such women were the \\"explicit models\\" for Marcellina and other early female preachers. Women played prominent roles in many early Christians sects as prophets, teachers, healers, missionaries, and presbyters. Mary Magdalene and Mary of Bethany were female followers of Jesus who are mentioned in the gospels and were believed to know the \\"mysteries\\" of the kingdom of God. Women like Mary and Martha were the explicit role models for Marcellina and her fellow female preachers. A creed that may have been recited at Christian initiation ceremonies is quoted by the apostle Paul in {Galatians 3:28: \\"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\\" In the late first century, Marcion of Sinope ( 85 – 160) appointed women as presbyters on an equal basis as men. In the second century, the Valentinians, a Gnostic sect, regarded women as equal to men. The Montanists regarded two prophetesses, Maximilla and Prisca, as the founders of their movement. Female religious leaders like Marcellina were not favored by orthodox theologians, who accused them of madness, unchastity, and demonic possession. The Church Father Tertullian ( 155 – 240) complained: \\"These heretical women—how audacious they are! They have no modesty; they are bold enough to teach, to engage in argument, to enact exorcisms, to undertake cures, and, it may be, even to baptize!\\" He denounced one female religious leader in North Africa as \\"that viper\\". Life and teachings =Carpocratian teachings= As a Carpocratian, Marcellina taught the doctrine of antinomianism, or libertinism, which holds that only faith and love are necessary to attain salvation and that all other perceived requirements, especially obedience to laws and regulations, are unnecessary. She, like other Carpocratians, believed that the soul must follow the path to redemption, possibly going through many incarnations. The goal of the believer is the escape from the cycle of reincarnation by ascending through several stages of deification. The Carpocratians believed that Jesus was only human, not divine, and saw him as an exemplary model to be followed, but an example which a particularly devout believer was capable of surpassing. Jesus's prime virtue was that he could perfectly remember the Divine from his pre-existence. They also venerated Greek philosophers as models to be emulated as well. The Marcellians' syncretic cult of images was a natural consequence of this teaching. One of the foundational teachings of the Carpocratians was the idea of social egalitarianism, which advocated equality for all people. Marcellina's position as the leader of the Carpocratian community in Rome indicates that, for her community at least, this was an idea which was meant to be literally implemented. Some Carpocratians, possibly including Marcellina, held all property in common and shared sexual partners. They also celebrated a form of agape feast. = Adversus Haereses = Irenaeus records that the Marcellians venerated images of Greek philosophers, including Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle. Busts of philosophers, such as this one of Pythagoras, were common objects of adoration in second-century Roman society. The Church Father Irenaeus ( 130 – 202) records in his apologetic treatise Adversus Haereses: > Others of them [i.e., the Carpocratians] employ outward marks, branding > their disciples inside the lobe of the right ear. From among these also > arose Marcellina, who came to Rome under [the episcopate of] Anicetus, and, > holding these doctrines, she led multitudes astray. They style themselves > Gnostics. They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed > from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of > Christ was made by Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among them. They > crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the > philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of Pythagoras, and > Plato, and Aristotle, and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring > these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles.Irenaeus, Adversus > Haereses Book I, Chapter 25, section 6, translated by Alexander Roberts and > William Rambaut Marcellina is the only woman associated with early Gnostic Christianity who is recorded to have been an active religious leader in her own right. Other women such as Helena (allegedly a former Tyrian prostitute turned muse of Simon Magus), Philumena (a prophetess associated with Apelles), and Flora (a student of Ptolemy) are known to have been active as prophetesses, teachers, and disciples involved in sects led by men, but none of them are known to have been leaders themselves. Nonetheless, Marcellina still appears in relation to Carpocrates, a male teacher, who appears to have been more actively involved than her in leading followers, writing treatises, and teaching students. Anne McGuire states that it is unclear whether this description of Marcellina in relation to Carpocrates is a result of Irenaeus's own patriarchal worldview, the actual relationship between her and him, or both. Marcellina's use of images of Jesus and Greek philosophers would not have been unusual in Roman society at the time, because busts and images of philosophers were common objects of adoration in second-century Roman society. While Irenaeus interprets this as a sign of Marcellina's heterodox teaching, to any non- Christian Roman, it would have actually made her seem far less aberrant than \\"orthodox\\" Christians. By venerating busts of philosophers and including Jesus among them as the greatest, Marcellina's followers were honoring him in the same way that other philosophers were typically honored throughout the Greco- Roman world. The Carpocratians may have had a more intellectual outlook than other sects, since, according to Clement of Alexandria, Carpocrates's son Epiphanes had been trained in Platonic philosophy.Clement of Alexandria, Stromata 3.5.3 Nonetheless, Michael Allen Williams states that the veneration of images seems highly unexpected for a supposedly Gnostic sect, since Gnostics are thought to have held the physical body in contempt. He suggests that Marcellina and her followers, like their pagan contemporaries, may have viewed representations of philosophers' physical likenesses as \\"windows to the soul\\" and a means of reflecting on the person's teachings. Peter Lampe interprets Marcillina's use of images of famous philosophers as an indication of religious syncretism. Joan E. Taylor notes that Irenaeus does not state that the Marcellians' portrait of Jesus was inaccurate or that portraits of Jesus were inherently immoral. She also argues that the Marcellians' busts of Jesus and other philosophers may have survived long after their sect declined, observing that, nearly a century later, the Roman emperor Alexander Severus (reigned 222 – 235) is said to have possessed a collection of portrait busts of various philosophers, religious figures, and historical figures including Jesus, Orpheus, Apollonius of Tyana, Alexander the Great, and Abraham. She remarks, \\"For all we know, one of the many unidentified philosopher busts that exist in today's collections might have been thought of as Jesus in the second–third centuries.\\" According to David Brakke, the reason why Marcellina and the members of her school identified themselves as \\"Gnostics\\" was not as a sectarian identification with the branch of early Christianity known as \\"Gnosticism\\", but rather as an epithet for \\"the ideal or true Christian, the one whose acquaintance with God has been perfected\\". He notes that Irenaeus himself identifies Marcellina and her sect with the Carpocratians, not with the \\"Gnostic school of thought\\". Also, Hippolytus of Rome, who relied on Irenaeus as a source, references that the another sect known as the Naassenes \\"call themselves 'gnostics' in their own way, as if they alone have drunk from the amazing acquaintance of the Perfect and Good.\\" In the late fourth century, the ascetic monk Evagrius Ponticus described the most advanced stage of Christian asceticism as \\"the Gnostic\\", indicating that, despite the association of the word \\"Gnostic\\" with Gnosticism, it still retained its original positive meaning in the sense with which Marcellina and her disciples identified. Bentley Layton does not classify Marcellina and her followers as members of the Gnostic sect either. =Contra Celsum= Origen ( 184 – 253) also briefly mentions Marcellina in his Contra Celsum, stating that \\"Celsus knows also of Marcellians who follow Marcellina, and Harpocratians who follow Salome, and others who follow Mariamme, and others who follow Martha.\\" Anne McGuire states that, because all the other figures listed by Origen in this passage are figures who appear in the canonical gospels, it is possible that the Marcellians may have regarded Marcellina, not only as a teacher and religious leader, but as \\"an authoritative source of apostolic tradition\\". Williams notes that Origen seems to have been aware that the Marcellians called themselves Gnostics, since, elsewhere in Contra Celsum, he notes that one of Celsus's arguments against Christianity was the existence of different sects, including ones \\"who call themselves gnostics\\". This would presumably include Marcellina and her followers, but Origen refrains from calling them by this term.  Legacy  It is unclear how Marcellina and her followers were regarded by orthodox Christians living in Rome during the 150s and 160s. Irenaeus states that, among members of his own congregation in Gaul in the 180s, \\"we have no fellowship with them either in doctrine or in morals or in our daily social life\\", but this statement should not be taken to apply to Christians living in Rome over twenty years prior. Irenaeus also states, \\"Satan had set forth these people [i.e. Marcellina and her followers] to blaspheme the holy name of the church, so that the [pagan] people turn their ears from the preaching of truth when they hear their different way of teaching and think we Christians are all like them. Indeed, when they see their religiosity, they dishonor us all.\\" He adds that \\"They misuse the name [Christian] as a mask.\\" This indicates that Marcellina and her Carpocratian followers called themselves \\"Christians\\" and, at least to outsiders, her sect appeared to be connected to other branches of Christianity. Peter Lampe states that it is possible that members of the orthodox community in Rome simply allowed Marcillina and her sect to coëxist, but that it is also possible that they may have actively condemned them. Robert M. Grant identifies the anti- Gnostic writings of Polycarp and Justin Martyr as partially an indirect reaction against Marcellina and her permissive moral teachings. Marcillina and other female prophets like her were consistently portrayed negatively in the histories and canons written by proponents of orthodoxy. According to William H. Brackney, sources indicate that Carpocratians may have continued to exist as late as the fourth century.

Note: This includes In 1788, John Skinner, Sr. was awarded the contract to build the Three Mountain Road from the area now called Upper Strasburg to Burnt Cabins, completing the road about 1790. The original stone tavern was built by John Skinner, Sr., likely in 1788. A little later he built a second tavern, also called Skinners, immediately to the south. By 1794 he had deeded the original tavern to his son George and deeded the second tavern to John, Jr. Sometime after October 21, 1794, President George Washington stayed at or travelled past \\"Skinners\\", while returning from Bedford to Philadelphia during the Whiskey Rebellion.

John II of Baden was the third son of Margrave Jacob I of Baden-Baden and his wife Catherine de Lorraine. John was given a strict religious upbringing, as he was destined from an early age for an ecclesiastical career. At the urging of his father, most of his siblings also followed a religious career, the exceptions being his two oldest brothers Charles I and Bernard II and his sister Margaret. He studied in Erfurt, Pavia and Cologne from 1452 to 1456, together with his younger brothers George and Mark. On 21 June 1456, at the age of 22, he was elected Archbishop of Trier as John II of Baden. His mother was from Lorraine and had connections with Trier. Pope Calixtus III confirmed him as administrator of Trier, because he had not yet reached the minimum age of 35 for consecration as bishop. When he reached that age in 1465, he was consecrated by his suffragan bishop Hubertis Agrippina and the bishops of Metz and Worms. In 1459, Diether von Isenburg was elected Archbishop of Mainz, ahead of Adolph II of Nassau by a narrow margin. However, the Pope did not confirm Dieter's election. This led to the Baden-Palatinate War, in which John II and his brothers participated on the side of Adolph II of Nassau. John II of Baden supported reform in the Benedictine monasteries and encouraged them to join the Bursfelde Congregation. In 1469, he sent Johann Fart, the prior of the St. Mary monastery in Trier to the Maria Laach Abbey, where Johann acted as a reformer abbot. Johann was the 21st abbott, his tenure lasted from 1470 to 1491. By appointing Johann, John II thwarted the intentions of Archbishop Rupert of Cologne, who had a different reform candidate in mind. During John II's reign, the long-anticipated University of Trier was founded on 16 March 1473. The University provided coursed in theology, philosophy, medicine and law. In 1477, he officiated in the wedding of Maximilian of Habsburg and Mary of Burgundy. On 16 January 1500, he appointed his great-nephew Jakob as co- adjutor with the right to succeed () and from 1501, Jakob led the government of the Electorate. John II died in 1503 in Ehrenbreitstein (now part of Koblenz), after a tenure of 46 years, 7 months and 18 days, the longest of any bishop of Trier. He was buried in the Cathedral of Trier in a magnificent grave that he had built during his lifetime. References  *Dieter Kerber: Johann II. von Baden.

The court was built for the Jones family of Treowen and was subsequently the home of Ivor Herbert, 1st Baron Treowen, whose family still owns much of the Llanarth estate, although not the court itself. The court is a Grade II* listed building and is now a private hospital. History The first house recorded on the property goes back to the early medieval period and was called Hendre obaith, Home of the Old Faith. It came into the possession of ancestors of the Jones family well before 1469. In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, it was the home of Philip Jones, merchant and member of parliament for Monmouth Boroughs. His family subsequently rebuilt the house as Llanarth Court in the seventeenth century. The current house was originally built around 1770 for John Jones. It was remodelled 1849–51 by Edward Habershon and his brother, W. G. Habershon, in an Italianate style. Lord Treowen, the ennobled descendant of the Joneses, died in 1933 and, his only son having predeceased him, the court was inherited by his daughter, Fflorens Roch, who gave it to the Roman Catholic Church in 1948. The church passed the court to the Dominican Order which ran a school there, Blackfriars School, until 1967. The Benedictine Order then took over the building, operating a preparatory school for Belmont Abbey School. The school closed in 1986 and the court was sold to AMI Healthcare for conversion into a private hospital. The hospital is currently run by the Priory Group and caters for patients with mental illness or intellectual disabilities. A fire at the court in late April 2020 saw no loss of life, but the destruction of a modern ward. The court itself was undamaged. Description The gatehouse on the southwest drive The architectural historian John Newman describes the court as a \\"monster Neo-classical house\\", consisting of a three-storey, double pile block of thirteen bays. The entrance porch, reputedly modelled on the temple at Paestum, has been removed. The Habershons' work included the rendering and much classical decoration. The interior has been modernised and institutionalised and contains \\"little of either the later eighteenth or the mid-nineteenth centuries\\". The Monmouthshire author and artist Fred Hando, recording a visit to the court in the 1960s, noted the presence of two pictures by Tiepolo, The Healing at the Pool of Siloam and The Woman taken in Adultery. The latter is now in the collection of Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales. The court used to contain the original hall screen from Treowen, but, writing in 1999, Newman stated that the screen \\"is likely to be returned thither\\", a view which echoed that of Hando, writing 30 years earlier; \\"The oak screen dated 1627 was transferred from Treowen where, in my opinion, it would be more happily housed\\". The gardens surrounding the court are a \\"well preserved early 19th century landscape park\\". It is possible that the landscape gardeners Samuel Lapidge and John Claudius Loudon were involved in its design. Developments after World War II significantly altered the landscape and many features have been lost, including the kitchen garden dating from the 19th century, and the lake, which is now silted-up. The Church of St Mary and St Michael, originally the private chapel for the court, stands in the grounds and has its own Grade II* Listing. The gatehouse to the soutwest of the court, and the gates and gate piers to the north have their own Grade II listings.

Biography The parenthood of Cecilia is not mentioned. Little is known of her personally. She is noted to have been the maid-of-honor to queen Philippa. Such position would mean that she was likely a member of the nobility. Cecilia’s relationship with Eric is first noted in the historical record after the death of Queen Philippa in 1430. The relationship reportedly had the \\"character of a marriage\\" from the beginning.Erik av Pommern, urn:sbl:15392, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Gottfrid Carlsson.), hämtad 2018-06-28. The affair was apparently well known and considered so scandalous at the time that the royal council included it in its official list of complaints against the King. One reason for the disapproval was reportedly that the marriage, for some reason, was taken as an indicator that king Eric favored Boguslav of Pomerania as his heir and the introduction of non-elective monarchy.Erik av Pommern, urn:sbl:15392, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Gottfrid Carlsson.), hämtad 2018-06-28.

No children are known from the union. Cecilia was described as loyal, and accompanied Eric to Gotland when he was deposed in 1439, and from Gotland to Pomerania in 1450. At some point, she reportedly married the king. The date of her marriage is unknown. The only evidence of her marriage to Eric is in a record of a donation made to a Pomeranian convent,Dansk biografisk Lexikon / IV. Bind.

Objectives can be completed in any order in each mission, with some missions allowing taking any approach to accomplish a goal (Direct Action) while others have certain conditions, such as requiring stealth. All missions can be played co- operatively, and each mission features an unlockable \\"Dynamic\\" Mode, which changes objectives and objective locations, enemy weapons and locations, to random values and points in the environment. =Demo version= A demo version was released for download of the PlayStation Network. It features the opening tutorial mission where players learn the controls and how to otherwise play the game, as well as the complete first mission, named 'Operation Open Flame'. The demo also provides a leaderboard for this mission, both regional and global, as well as being able to play this mission in \\"Dynamic\\" Mode. However, Dynamic mode does not support leaderboard ranking, as the mission has random insertions and objectives.

Catechising To catechize means to teach: more specifically, to teach by word of mouth.The Free Dictionary - catechist Prior to the Second Vatican Council, the chief catechists at the parish level were priests, religious brothers or nuns. Since the late 20th century, particularly in Europe and the Americas, increasingly the role of the parish catechist has been undertaken by the Catholic laity. In addition to activities in the parish, catechizing also takes place in Catholic schools through more formal classes as part of the curriculum. Catechists are often deployed to teach candidates who are preparing for the sacraments of Reconciliation, First Holy Communion, Confirmation and Baptism (after completing the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults, or RCIA). Various age- appropriate religious education texts and materials are used for instruction in addition to the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Catechists have always been of particular importance in large geographical parishes, such as in Africa, where priests have historically only been able to visit different parts of their parish periodically. In the priest's absence, the parish catechist takes on the role of being the main teacher of the faith in that parish. As such they are afforded a particular place of honor within their parish community.Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples - Guide for Catechists More recently, catechists have become increasingly important in the older Western regions of the Catholic Church, as there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of priests and religious in these regions. In this regard the West has less experience than younger centers of the Church in the selection, formation, oversight, and use of catechists. General Instruction of the Roman Missal The General Instruction of the Roman Missal allows for institution of catechists should a particular Bishops' Conference feel that it is required. A Bishops' Conference may request permission from the Apostolic See: Guide for Catechists In 1993 the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (formerly the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith) published the Guide for Catechists, with the sub-heading Document of vocational, formative and promotional orientation of Catechists in the territories dependent on the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. This document was therefore intended only for catechists at work in the missionary territories of the Church. It also made a very specific distinction between the catechists working in these areas and catechists at work in \\"older Churches\\" such as in the West. As such the detailed framework and structure this document outlines for the selection, formation, oversight and deployment of catechists within the \\"mission territories\\" has not necessarily been applied to catechists at work elsewhere within the Catholic Church. The Introduction to this document states: Note with Pastoral Recommendations for the Year of Faith On 6 January 2012, the Solemnity of the Epiphany of the Lord, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith published the Note with pastoral recommendations for the Year of Faith.Note with pastoral recommendations for the Year of Faith This document provided explanation and suggestions at different levels for parishioners in preparation for the Year of Faith declared by Pope Benedict XVI with the apostolic letter of 11 October 2011 Porta fidei. The Year of Faith began on 11 October 2012, the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council. It was scheduled to end on 24 November 2013, the Solemnity of our Lord Jesus Christ, Universal King. This note made the following recommendations in relation to catechists: = At the diocesan level = 2\\\\. It would be desirable that each Diocese in the world organize a study day on the Catechism of the Catholic Church, particularly for its priests, consecrated persons and catechists. 5\\\\. It would be appropriate for each particular Church to review the reception of Vatican Council II and the Catechism of the Catholic Church in its own life and mission, particularly in the realm of catechesis. This would provide the opportunity for a renewal of commitment on the part of the catechetical offices of the Dioceses which - supported by the Commissions for Catechesis of the Episcopal Conferences – have the duty to care for the theological formation of catechists. = At the parish level = 4\\\\. Catechists should hold more firmly to the doctrinal richness of the Catechism of the Catholic Church and, under the direction of their pastors, offer guidance in reading this precious document to groups of faithful, working toward a deeper common understanding thereof, with the goal of creating small communities of faith, and of giving witness to the Lord Jesus. Recognition of the ministry of catechist There is increasing awareness, acknowledgement and recognition by the Church hierarchy of the important role catechists play in the life of the Catholic Church, and with it the responsibilities the Church has towards them. The latter is clear from the explicit reference in the Note with pastoral recommendations for the Year of Faith highlighting the \\"duty of care\\" each local Bishop has towards the theological formation of the catechists at work within their diocese.
