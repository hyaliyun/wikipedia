For at least part of its history, it was a daily. In 1998 the paper was bought by the Eagle Tribune Company and converted to a weekly. In 2005 it was bought by Community Newspaper Holdings. History Nathan Burrill and Caleb Hersey established the paper in 1821 in Haverhill; politically it supported the Federalists. In 1823 the paper absorbed the Essex Patriot. Among the Gazette's editors: Edward G. Frothingham, John H. Harris, Arthur Asa Hill, Isaac R. Howe, E.P. Rodgers, William Ellsworth Smythe, Jeremiah Spofford, Abijah W. Thayer, John Greenleaf Whittier.National cyclopaedia of American biography. 1921 Publishers have included Howard & Hill. By 1904 it had a circulation of about 8,000 subscribers.\\"Daily newspaper investigations.\\" Printer's Ink, June 29, 1904 Following a strike in 1957 by Local 38 of the International Typographical Union during which it employed replacement printers, the paper found itself in competition with the Haverhill Journal, a daily founded by William Loeb, publisher of the Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader. The new competition was founded after several local business owners sought out a new newspaper to carry its advertising without offending the sensibilities of the significant numbers of Haverhill residents who were members of various shoe manufacturing unions. They prevailed on Loeb to publish a free shopper. Loeb, encouraged by favorable reaction to the first editions of the shopper, launched a daily in December 1957. Haverhill this became one of only three cities in Massachusetts with newspapers owned by competing publishers, the others being in Boston and Lynn. The Gazette was purchased by Newspapers of New England, Inc., a consortium of newspaper publishers who intended to \\"save\\" the Gazette and prevent Loeb from gaining inroads into publishing in Massachusetts, and matched Loeb's offer for the paper. The Gazettes owners included principally the Lowell Sun; The Holyoke Transcript-Telegram; the Brockton Enterprise & Times; Essex County Newspapers Inc. owner of The Newburyport News and The Gloucester Times; the Springfield Union and Springfield Daily News; and the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune. Other members of a 96 publisher association also owned less significant stakes. Loeb sued the Haverhill Gazette Co., Newspapers of New England and its individual managers over antitrust issues. Gazette Co. counterclaimed on the same grounds. Gazette Co. won the suit, after the court found violations of antitrust law in the Journal's solicitation of advertisers. In his ruling, Judge Charles Wyzanski found that based on costs and revenues for newspaper publishing \\"Haverhill is economically a one newspaper city.\\" The court found that NNE had also violated antitrust laws, but excused the behavior as a defensive maneuver. After losing on appeal Loeb suspended the Journal after losing the federal court case which found his company had violated antitrust laws to keep the journal in business. During the battle, Loeb's expenses were extremely high. Union contracts at his plant in Manchester, N.H. provided that a day's work for printers consisted of printing a single publication. Thus his press room was being paid overtime starting at mid-week. Newspapers of New England subsequently sold the paper to Hagadone Newspapers of Idaho which later transferred the paper to Scripps League Newspapers, Inc. of Virginia in a combination sale including a newspaper in Elizabeth, N.J. Scripps League sold its newspapers in 1998 to Pulitzer Newspapers, Inc., which subsequently sold the Gazette to a company owned by the family which controlled the Eagle Tribune of North Andover, Mass., ending a newspaper competition in Haverhill between the Eagle Tribune and the Gazette. Eagle Tribune subsequently converted the Gazette from a daily to weekly. Gazette and research on media and democracy  Jessica Bruder cited the conversion of the Gazette from a daily to a weekly in an article asking, \\"Is the death of newspapers the end of good citizenship?\\" During the three years after the Gazette was converted from a daily to a weekly, \\"the town-owned Hale Municipal Hospital lost $15 million ... . Inaccurate filings by a private manager obscured the extent of the problem, which piled on top of preexisting debt and led to the hospital's sale in 2001. Citizens are still on the hook, repaying $7 million annually until 2023.\\" Bruder mentioned some in the community who claimed that if the Gazette had continued as a full-featured daily, it's more robust reporting would have made it harder for the private manager to conceal the hospital's financial problems for so long. Al White, editor of the Eagle-Tribune, disagreed. \\"Name one community where people won't say that,\\" he said. \\"This is a silly conversation.\\" Variant titles * Haverhill Gazette and Essex Patriot, 1823-1827 * Gazette & Patriot, 1824-1825 * Essex Gazette, 1827-1836, 1839-1840 * Haverhill Essex Gazette, 1838 * Haverhill Evening Gazette (daily), 188?-1947 * The Gazette (daily), 1978-1984 References External links * Haverhill Gazette website Category:Newspapers published in Massachusetts Category:Publications established in 1821 Category:Haverhill, Massachusetts Category:Mass media in Essex County, Massachusetts Category:1821 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Haverhill Gazette"},{"id":"35686189","text":"Asgharabad (, also Romanized as A≈ügharƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Golestan Rural District, in the Central District of Jajrom County, North Khorasan Province, Iran.

In 1928 he co-financed William Penn Airport (later Boulevard Airport, closed in 1951)Little Known Airfields: William Penn Airport near Philadelphia, where he gave flying lessons and joyflights. In 1930, Hutchinson bought a Lockheed Sirius monoplane he named Richmond, Virginia after his home town, trading in his smaller Stinson Junior as part of the purchase. He intended to use the Sirius, a sleek single-seat aircraft, to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a faster time than Charles Lindbergh had in 1927. However, before he could begin his attempt, he crashed the aircraft in Los Angeles.

George and Blanche wrote two books about their adventures - The Flying Family in Greenland (1935) and Flying the States (1937) - and the family were pictured on cereal boxes and made appearances on stage and radio. In 1939, the family attempted another around-the-world flight in a Lockheed Electra.

The route is not bannered but runs in an overall west-east direction from U.S. Highway 190 (US 190) near Lawtell to LA 31 in Leonville. Along the way, it passes through the towns of Washington and Port Barre. Route description From the west, LA 103 begins at an intersection with US 190 just west of Lawtell in western St. Landry Parish. It proceeds north along the two-lane, undivided Prairie Ronde Highway and immediately crosses the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) tracks. Approaching the point known as Prairie Ronde, LA 103 turns to the northeast. It then intersects LA 104 which heads toward Mamou on the west and Opelousas on the east. Continuing northeast, LA 103 passes through Ledoux and crosses the Acadiana Railway (AKDN) tracks. At a point northwest of Plaisance, LA 103 intersects US 167 and LA 10 which are concurrent between Ville Platte on the west and a point between Opelousas and Washington on the east. LA 103 turns northwest to follow US 167/LA 10 briefly before resuming its northeastern course, now known as Grand Prairie Highway. Reaching Grand Prairie, LA 103 turns to the southeast, intersecting LA 363 which heads west through Faubourg and eventually toward Ville Platte. LA 103 continues through a point known as Soileau and then enters the town of Washington on West DeJean Street. Louisiana State Route 103 in Washington, Louisiana, March 2016 In Washington, LA 103 intersects the concurrent LA 10 and LA 182 (North Main Street). Here LA 103 widens to a divided, four-lane highway as traffic continues southeast across North Main Street onto the eastbound lanes of St. Landry Veterans Memorial Highway. (Traffic from the westbound lanes of St. Landry Veterans Memorial Highway intersects North Main Street opposite Sittig Street and, in a brief concurrency with LA 10 and LA 182, turns southwest onto North Main Street for one block to reach West DeJean Street.) After three blocks, LA 103 narrows to a four-lane, undivided highway for a short distance before dividing again through an interchange with Interstate 49 (I-49) at Exit 25. I-49 connects the town of Washington with Alexandria to the north and Opelousas to the south. After passing through the interchange, LA 103 leaves Washington and narrows again to a two-lane, undivided highway. Just east of Washington, LA 103 crosses a bridge over Bayou Carron and intersects LA 743 which follows a parallel course along Bayou Little Teche toward Port Barre. LA 103 continues east roughly along Bayou Wauksha, crossing Bayou Courtableau and eventually intersecting with LA 359. While LA 359 continues along Bayou Wauksha as it turns northeast toward Waxia, LA 103 turns south at the intersection and heads toward Port Barre. About halfway to Port Barre, LA 103 curves to the southwest then, upon reaching Bayou Courtableau, resumes a southerly course along the bayou into town. LA 103 enters Port Barre on Saizan Avenue, the town's main thoroughfare, and follows it as it turns southwest and crosses a bridge over Bayou Courtableau. Immediately after crossing the bayou, LA 103 intersects LA 741 (Bayou Road) which it parallels for the remainder of its route toward Leonville. LA 103 continues along Saizan Avenue and intersects US 190 on the south end of town. It then turns west, briefly running concurrent with the four-lane, divided US 190, before turning southwest along Bayou Teche. LA 103 soon crosses the UPRR tracks and exits Port Barre. After about , LA 103 turns to the south while Church Road continues along the bayou. Cutting across a wide bend in the bayou, LA 103 curves southeast into Leonville. Upon reaching Bayou Teche once again, LA 103 arrives at its eastern terminus at an intersection with LA 31. LA 31 connects to Opelousas on the northwest and Arnaudville on the southeast. History In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 103 made up parts of several routes, including State Route 571 from the western terminus near Lawtell to Grand Prairie; State Route 119 to Washington; State Route 487 to Bayou Saquette; State Routes 214 and 279 to Port Barre; and State Route 238 to Leonville. LA 103 was created with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, and its route has remained unchanged with the exception of the portion running through Washington. Before the construction of I-49 north of Opelousas in the late 1980s, LA 103 followed a slightly different two-lane alignment on the east side of Washington. Heading southeast on what was East DeJean Street (now the eastbound lanes of St. Landry Veterans Memorial Highway), LA 103 turned northeast onto North Bridge Street then southeast onto Water Street. After crossing a now-abandoned rail line, it followed the path of the current alignment briefly before turning northeast onto Elizabeth Street. LA 103 followed the now-abandoned Elizabeth Street a short distance to its dead-end at the I-49 overpass. It then continued through the present site of the overpass and rejoined the current alignment. Once I-49 was constructed, the short Elizabeth Street section by bypassed by the current four-lane alignment. Later, the St. Landry Veterans Memorial Highway was constructed to create a complete four-lane alignment between I-49 and LA 10/LA 182 (North Main Street). LA 103 was now streamlined to connect directly to what was East Sittig Street for westbound traffic and East DeJean Street for eastbound traffic.

ISTD/TCH is the only major in situ thermal remediation (ISTR) technology capable of achieving subsurface target treatment temperatures above the boiling point of water and is effective at virtually any depth in almost any media. TCH works in tight soils, clay layers, and soils with wide heterogeneity in permeability or moisture content that are impacted by a broad range of volatile and semi- volatile organic contaminants.  History  ISTD using TCH was developed by Shell Oil Co. in the late 1980s and grew out of research and development for enhanced oil recovery. During the mid-1990s Shell Oil Company commercialized ISTD with an investment of over $30 million.  Method of operation  Thermal conductive heating is the application of heat to subsurface soils through conductive heat transfer. The source of the heat is applied via electric or gas powered thermal wells. Thermal wells are inserted vertically, or horizontally, in an array within the soil. Heat flows from the heating elements by conduction. The heating process causes contaminants to be vaporized or destroyed by means of: # evaporation # steam stripping # hydrolysis # oxidation # pyrolysis Vaporized contaminants are collected from vapor extraction wells and containerized for removal or recycling.

The Orfordness Rotating Wireless Beacon, known simply as the Orfordness Beacon or sometimes the Black Beacon, was an early radio navigation system introduced by the United Kingdom in July 1929. It allowed the angle to the station to be measured from any aircraft or ship with a conventional radio receiver, and was accurate to about a degree. A second station operating on the same principle was set up to provide wider area coverage and allow two-bearing fixes between Orford Ness and Farnborough Airport. The system was similar to the earlier German Telefunken Kompass Sender and the later Sonne system. Description =Background= In navigation, the determination of a \\"fix\\" requires two measurements to be taken. Using classical triangulation techniques, this was normally the measurement of two angles, or bearings, along the line-of-sight to prominent landmarks, like a lighthouse. After taking the two measurements, lines of position are drawn radiating from the landmark along the reverse angle. They will cross at some point, and their intersection determines the location of the navigator.Charles Husick, \\"Chapman Piloting and Seamanship\\" (64th ed.), Hearst Communications, December 2003, p. 618 =RDF= The introduction of portable radio systems in the early 20th century gave rise to the possibility of using radio broadcasters (beacons) as a landmark that would be visible to a radio receiver at very great ranges, hundreds of miles or more. The angle between the navigator and the beacon can be taken by using a simple mechanism known as a loop antenna which can be rotated around the vertical axis. As the antenna is rotated, the strength of the received signal varies, and drops to zero (the null) when the loop is perpendicular to the line to the beacon.Joseph Moell and Thomas Curlee, \\"Transmitter Hunting: Radio Direction Finding Simplified\\", TAB Books, 1978, pp. 1‚Äì5. This technique, known as radio direction finding (RDF), is useful but only moderately accurate. Measurements better than a few degrees are difficult with a small antenna, and because of the electrical characteristics, it is not always easy to make a larger version that might provide more accuracy. Moreover, the addition of a loop antenna may be difficult on smaller vehicles, or difficult to operate for those without a dedicated navigator. =Orfordness' solution= The Orfordness Beacon was a simple solution to these problems, which essentially moved the loop antenna from the vehicle to the beacon. The station broadcast a continuous AM longwave signal at 288.5 kHz (1040 m) through a large loop antenna which was mechanically rotated at 1 rpm, or 6 degrees a second. As the antenna passed north, the signal was briefly keyed with the morse code signal for the letter \\"V\\" (dot-dot-dot-dash), before returning again to a continuous signal. At two points during the antenna's rotation, it would be perpendicular to the receiver. During these instants, the audible signal would disappear, an event known as a \\"null\\". Navigation using the Orfordness Beacon was quite simple. Navigators simply tuned in the station on their radios and waited for the V signal to be broadcast. They noted the time of the V and counted off the seconds until they heard the null. This could be easily accomplished with the use of a stopwatch. The time in seconds between the ending of the V and hearing the null was then multiplied by 6 to produce the angle from the station to the receiver. This led to the possibility of the user being confused as to which null they were located on, as there are two, located 180 degrees apart (either side of the antenna). In practice this is a relatively minor concern, as traditional navigation methods are normally able to resolve this discrepancy ‚Äì only one of the angles makes sense at a given time. In order to help resolve even this minor problem, the system also broadcast the letter \\"B\\" (dash-dot-dot-dot) as it passed east, helping the listener to identify the lobes. This also served the purpose of allowing the navigator to check that the system was operating properly by timing the period between the V and B, and checking that it was the expected 15 seconds. =System construction and expansion= Looking north-east toward the Beacon, with its powerhouse to the right and barracks to the left. The Orford Ness lighthouse is on the far right. The lighthouse now operates a racon beacon. The original Orfordness Beacon was constructed in a small building that looked similar to the lower portion of a Dutch windmill. Painted black, it remains a prominent landmark today. The system went online in July 1929. The Orfordness Beacon did not broadcast continuously, but on a five-minute on-off pattern. This allowed for the construction of a second Beacon at RAE Farnborough, south-west of London. The Farnborough station broadcast on the same frequency as Orford, using the letters \\"G\\" (dash-dash-dot) for north and \\"W\\" (dot-dash-dash) for east. Orfordness broadcast on the first five minutes of every ten-minute period, and Farnborough on the second five minutes. Operations started in early 1930, but was first used only experimentally, for short periods on weekdays. =Accuracy= A report compiled for the Merchant Marine demonstrated an effective range of about 100 miles, day or night. During the day, a minimum accuracy of 2 degrees measured, and 1 degree was common. However, at night the system degraded considerably, with measurement errors as great as 20 degrees.

Adolphe Marie Messimy (31 January 1869 ‚Äì 1 September 1935) was a French politician and general. He served as Minister of War in 1911-12 and then again for a few months during the outbreak of and first three weeks of the First World War. Having begun his career as an army officer, he returned to the Army and successfully commanded a brigade at the Battle of the Somme, and later a division. Defeated for re-election to the Chamber of Deputies in 1919, he served as an influential senator from 1923 until his death in 1935. Early and personal life Born in Lyon on 31 January 1869, Adolphe Messimy was the eldest son of notary Paul Charles L√©on Messimy and Laurette Marie Anne Girodon. He married Andr√©e, the daughter of Victor Cornil, whom he divorced in 1921. His second marriage, in 1923, was to Marie-Louise Blanc (n√©e Viallar), a widow. He had two children from each marriage. Tuchman described him as ‚Äúan exuberant, energetic, almost violent man, with ‚Ä¶ bright peasant‚Äôs eyes behind spectacles and a loud voice‚Äù.Tuchman 1962, p.46-7 His hobbies were mountain-climbing and collecting weapons and furniture. Early career Messimy entered the military academy of Saint-Cyr at the age of eighteen and after graduation began a career as a line officer. He was promoted to captain at the age of twenty-five and at twenty-seven attained his Brevet d'√©tat-major (qualified as a staff officer), opening up the promise of an excellent military career. In 1899 he resigned from his post as a captain of chasseurs in protest at the Army's refusal to reopen the Dreyfus case, entering politics determined on ‚Äúreconciling the army with the nation\\".Tuchman 1962, p.46-7 After leaving the Army he became a journalist, writing on military matters for a number of Paris newspapers including Le Temps, le Matin, le Rappel, le Radical and Lyon-R√©publicain. He also published documented studies in La Revue politique et parlementaire, La Revue des questions colonials, La Revue bleue and Revue de Paris. He also became an administrator of the General Company of Niger. Prewar political career He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a Radical-socialiste in 1902, for the Seine constituency (14th arrondissement of Paris). In the second round (11 May) he defeated the incumbent deputy, Girou, by 9,068 votes to 8,569. In 1905 he voted in favour of the law separating church and state. He was re-elected as a Gauche radicale-socialiste, again at the second round, on 20 May 1906, by 11,894 votes to 5,438 for his opponent Fraguier. On 8 May 1910, once again at the second round, he was re-elected as a R√©publicain radicale-socialiste by 9,462 votes to 7,182 for his opponent Grangier. His prewar writings included: \\"The Armed Peace, France can Lighten the Burdens\\" (1905), \\"General Considerations on the Organisation of the Army\\" (1907), \\"The Army and its Cadres\\" (1909) and \\"Our Colonial Work\\" (1910). Peacetime War Minister Messimy became Minister of the Colonies in the government of Ernest Monis and served from 2 March 1911 to 27 June 1911. From 27 June 1911 to 14 January 1912 Messimy served as Minister of War in the government of Joseph Caillaux. He was the fourth new War Minister that year, and within a few days of his appointment the German gunboat Panther arrived at Agadir, sparking the Second Moroccan Crisis.Tuchman 1962, p.46-7 Until 1911 the Vice-President of the Conseil Sup√©rieur de Guerre (a body of senior generals, chaired by the President of the Republic) was Commander-in-Chief designate in the event of war but had no planning staff, whilst the Army Chief of Staff reported to the War Minister and dealt solely with administrative matters.Greenhalgh 2014, p.15 The Vice-President, General Victor-Constant Michel, proposed that the French Army adopt a more defensive war plan and attach a regiment of reserves to each regular regiment. Messimy, in common with senior French generals, thought that these plans would blunt the fighting spirit of the French Army. He described them as ‚Äúcomme une insanit√©‚Äù and Michel a ‚Äúnational danger‚Äù and helped to ensure his removal.Tuchman 1962, p.46-7 Messimy abolished the job of Vice-President, and created a new post - soon given to General Joseph Joffre - of Chief of the General Staff (and Commander-in-Chief designate). There were to be two sub-chiefs, one heading the General Staff, based in the ministry and a member of the War Minister's military cabinet, whilst the other was chief of staff to the Commander-in-Chief and dealt with mobilisation and concentration. Alexandre Millerand abolished the former post (in his 1912-13 tenure), helping to create the situation where Joffre acquired enormous power in his hands during the early years of the First World War.Greenhalgh 2014, p.15 Messimy was suspicious of Joffre's choice of the clericalist right-winger General de Castelnau as his chief of staff.Tuchman 1962, p. 48-9 As War Minister Messimy proposed other reforms. He advocated that the manpower of the French Army should be enhanced with large contingents of black Africans, a view which he shared with General Charles Mangin.Greenhalgh 2014, p.10 Like President Theodore Roosevelt he ordered generals to conduct manoeuvres on horseback, to weed out elderly and unfit generals who were ‚Äúincapable not only of leading their troops but of following them\\".Tuchman 1962, p.46-7 Messimy and General Auguste Dubail had tried to introduce 105mm heavy guns, but French generals saw them a defensive weapon like machine guns and as a drag on their offensive doctrine, preferring the more mobile \\"Soixante-Quinze\\" gun, so only a few had been introduced by 1914.Tuchman 1962, p. 230 Out of office Returning to his native district, Messimy was, on 25 February 1912, elected deputy for the arrondissement of Tr√©voux (the Ain) for the Parti r√©publicain radical et radical socialiste, replacing Donat-Auguste Bollet, who had become a senator. Messimy polled 9,734 votes against 4,648 for Ducurtyl and 3,420 for Nanssex, out of 18,186 ballots cast. After visiting the Balkans and seeing the advantage held by Bulgarians in their inconspicuous uniforms, Messimy also proposed replacing the red kepi and pantalon rouge (red trousers) worn by the French Army since 1830 by a grey-blue or grey-green uniform (the British Army had recently switched from scarlet to khaki and the Germans from blue to field-grey). This plan was blocked by French generals and politicians. Messimy later wrote of the ‚Äúblind and imbecile attachment to the most visible of all colours‚Äù.Tuchman 1962, p. 47-8 He was re-elected for his Ain seat unopposed on 26 April 1914, obtaining all of the 11,713 votes cast and holding the seat until his defeat in 1919. War Minister in 1914 =July Crisis= On 13 June 1914 he entered the government, led by Ren√© Viviani, as Minister of War. On 24 July 1914 Messimy summoned Joffre to warn him that war was likely.Greenhalgh 2014, p.1 Greenhalgh gives his rank at the time as Colonel, which appears to be an error News of the German Kriegesgefahr (announcement of danger of war) was announced around 5.30pm on 31 July. Messimy, who had been tipped off an hour earlier by a banking friend in Amsterdam, told the cabinet it was ‚Äúune forme hypocrite de la mobilisation‚Äù. Joffre, who had previously been ordered to keep French troops 10 km away from the frontier, arrived and demanded French mobilisation, but was only allowed to send a ‚Äúcovering order‚Äù because of the Tsar‚Äôs last minute appeal to the Kaiser. Messimy was left fretting at the ‚Äúgreen baize routine‚Äù by which each minister was permitted to speak in turn at cabinet meetings.Tuchman 1962, p. 92-3 The next morning (1 August), after the German ultimatum to Russia, the cabinet agreed that the mobilisation order could be issued but Messimy was required to keep it in his pocket till 3.30pm. Public posters appeared at 4pm, but that evening Messimy had to order the Army, in the President's name, to keep out of the 10 km zone, on pain of court martial. Not even patrols were permitted, and special orders were issued to General Foch, commander of XX Corps, who was suspected of patrolling aggressively.Tuchman 1962, p. 95 Until the Germans were confirmed to have entered Belgium, Messimy forbade any French troops to enter in case reports were a trick to make the French into the violators of Belgian neutrality.Tuchman 1962, p. 127 Messimy was keen to bring the Colonial Corps from North Africa to France. In the fraught atmosphere of the Crisis he was challenged to a duel on 2 August by Navy Minister Armand Gauthier, who had forgotten to send torpedo boats into the English Channel but now wanted to redeem his reputation by using the French Navy to attack the German warships Goeben and Breslau, currently in the Mediterranean, before Germany and France were actually at war. He eventually embraced Messimy tearfully and was persuaded to resign on grounds of health.Tuchman 1962, p. 149-50 =French defeat and defence of Paris= The Germans attacked the outermost Li√®ge forts on 5 August. Three cavalry divisions under General Sordet were to enter Belgium on 6 August to reconnoitre east of the Meuse. Like President Poincare, Messimy would have preferred to send five corps, but this did not meet with Joffre's approval.Tuchman 1962, p.176 Messimy called in General Hirschauer of the engineers on 13 August and ordered him to have the Paris defences ready in 3 weeks, as a precaution.Tuchman 1962, p. 338-9 General Gallieni, who had been designated as Joffre's successor \\"in case of accident\\" went to Vitry (14 August) to lobby Joffre as Messimy refused to go, believing (wrongly) that Joffre would be more likely to listen to his former superior.Tuchman 1962, p. 233 Messimy rang GQG on the night of 18/19 August ‚Äúin anguish‚Äù at the weakness of the French left wing. He spoke to General Berthelot, who assured him that the German centre was weak and he agreed that Joffre should not be wakened.Tuchman 1962, p. 245-6 With the French armies falling back in retreat, and the Paris defences still not ready, Messimy sent for Gallieni and offered him the job of Military governor of Paris in place of General Michel. He shook Gallieni's hand effusively and kissed him when he agreed, promising him three active corps to avoid ‚Äúthe fate of Li√®ge and Namur‚Äù, asking him to return later when he hoped to have cabinet authority to appoint him.Tuchman 1962, p. 338-40 Paris had been besieged in the Franco-Prussian War Messimy fully supported Joffre in his purge of unsuccessful generals, even suggesting that, as in 1793, some of them simply ought to be executed.Terraine 1960, p113 Messimy then learned from General Ebener, GQG's representative at the War Office, that Joffre had ordered 61st and 62nd Reserve Divisions up from Paris to the Amiens sector (where they would form part of a new Sixth Army under Michel Maunoury). When Messimy protested that Paris was in the Zone of the Interior not the Zone of the Armies, and that the troops could not be moved without the authority of the President, the Prime Minister and himself, Ebener replied that the move was already ‚Äúin execution‚Äù and that Ebener himself was to command the two divisions. This left Paris guarded by only one reserve division and three territorial divisions. Messimy hung onto 45th Division despite demands from GQG.Tuchman 1962, p. 338-40 Messimy and Poincar√© had studied the decrees of 1913 and agreed that in wartime the Commander-in-Chief had ‚Äúextended powers‚Äù across the whole country and ‚Äúabsolute power‚Äù, including over the civilian authorities, in the Zone of the Armies. They wished to avoid a repetition of 1870 when War Minister Palikao had taken charge of strategy, sending Marshal MacMahon on his disastrous mission to be encircled and forced to surrender at Sedan. However Messimy found a clause entitling the civil power to protect ‚Äúthe vital interests of the country‚Äù and so, between 2am and 6am he drafted an order to Joffre demanding that he release three corps for the defence of Paris, which he telegraphed and also sent by hand at 11am on 25 August accompanied by a friendly letter.Tuchman 1962, p. 340 On 25 August Messimy complained to Joffre that German cavalry were running amok in Belgium and that ‚ÄúSordet, who has had very little fighting, is asleep. This is inadmissible.‚Äù This was unfair criticism.Spears 1930, p221 =Resignation= Messimy now learned that his job was at risk as the price of getting Millerand back into the government (Delcass√© was also getting back his old job as Foreign Minister in place of Doumergue). He exploded ‚Äúto hell with Albania!‚Äù at his last cabinet meeting when that country was discussed, and had to be told to calm down by President Poincar√©. His last act was to remove General Victor-Constant Michel a second time, this time as Military Governor of Paris, threatening him with arrest until Viviani arrived (apparently by accident) and persuaded Michel to resign. Messimy himself also refused to resign or to accept the position of Minister without portfolio, so the whole government had to resign on 26 August, so Viviani could form a National Unity Government.Tuchman 1962, p. 342 Poincar√© later wrote that Messimy had been too gloomy, warning of imminent defeat.Tuchman 1962, p. 342 Greenhalgh writes that he was ‚Äútemperamentally unsuited ‚Ä¶ and not strong enough to withstand the strain‚Äù of being War Minister.Greenhalgh 2014, p.67 After his resignation Messimy came to say goodbye to Joffre on 1 September. Joffre told him that he expected to renew the offensive on 8 September at Brienne-le-Chateau, a town between the Marne and the Seine - the counterstroke which would become the First Battle of the Marne. Messimy wrote that he had been impressed by his calm.Tuchman 1962, p. 392 At the time his feelings may have been less cordial: in late December 1914 he complained to Abel Ferry that Joffre was responsible for the ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù between GQG and the troops, and that bad intelligence had been responsible for the near disaster of Charleroi and for Joffre's partial and costly attacks.Greenhalgh 2014, p.67 Wartime military service Messimy rejoined the army as a staff captain on the staff of XIV Corps. He soon became head of the deuxi√®me bureau (intelligence) and acted as a liaison officer. He was part of Dubail‚Äôs First Army.Tuchman 1962, p. 343 He was soon promoted to major and made a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur on 16 November 1914. By 1915 Messimy had been promoted to lieutenant-colonel and on 27 July 1915 he was wounded in the Vosges, leading a unit of Chasseurs Alpins on 27 July 1915. Soon afterwards he was promoted to colonel and was given command of the 6th Chasseurs Half-Brigade. Messimy and his brigade took part in the Somme Offensive. His brigade was part of Fayolle‚Äôs Sixth Army, itself part of Foch's Army Group North. On 4 September it attacked the Bois Reinette, Bois Marries and Bois Madame in front of the German Third Position. Philpott describes this as a ‚Äútextbook assault‚Äù. The lead battalions took the first objectives ‚Äì a makeshift trench along the track from Ferme de l‚ÄôHopital to Cl√©ry and some observation posts on the ridge behind, in one rush. The reserve battalion pushed on in skirmish order into the woods, despite machine gun fire on the left (north). In three hours the brigade had taken 150 prisoners and suffered 670 casualties. As a result of this and other successful French attacks, the Germans pulled back to their Third Position across the southern sector of the Somme front.Philpott 2009, p. 353 The brigade attacked again on 12 September. At 1.05pm Messimy learned that his men had taken the German Third Position west of the Bapaume-Peronne road. He asked for and was sent two more battalions from the 44th and 133rd Infantry Regiments. At 6.39pm they advanced again across the final line of trenches, followed by three companies of chasseurs exploiting without orders, into Bouchavesnes village. By 7.30pm they had taken 500 prisoners and ten guns. A statue of Foch now stands nearby.Philpott 2009, p. 345 The German front had been pushed back 3 km, part of a broader Sixth Army advance which took 6 km of the German Third Line. Fayolle, normally highly critical of his subordinates, wrote ‚ÄúMessimy‚Äôs spirit was superb‚Äù.Philpott 2009, p. 355 In common with other French successes on the Somme, this was overshadowed by the Battle of Verdun and received ‚Äì then and now - less recognition than it deserved. The following day (13 September) the City of Verdun was awarded the Legion d‚ÄôHonneur and the British Military Cross.Philpott 2009, p. 412 Flanking attacks having failed ‚Äì Fayolle thought Foch mad to demand a further attack now the German defence was stiffening up ‚Äì Messimy's brigade attacked the Bois St Pierre Vast from the south-west on 5 November. His men waded through knee-deep mud, but the attack failed and they had to withdraw to the start-line.Philpott 2009, p. 399-400 Messimy issued his final order to his chasseurs on 17 November 1916, praising their performance. The brigade had lost 71 officers and 3000 men.Philpott 2009, p. 445 In early April 1917 Messimy warned Prime Minister Ribot, correctly, that most of the senior generals in Micheler‚Äôs Reserve Army Group thought Nivelle‚Äôs planned offensive would cause high casualties but would not succeed.Philpott 2009, p.470 Again wounded, Messimy was promoted to g√©n√©ral de brigade on 11 September 1917 and transferred to command the 213th Infantry Brigade. He ended the war in command of the 162nd Infantry Division with which he liberated Colmar. During the war he received eight citations and ended with the rank of g√©n√©ral de brigade √† titre definitif.permanent brigadier-general. Tuchman (p.343) states that he rose to the rank of General de Division, a rank not attributed to him on the French Parliamentary website He was awarded the Croix de Guerre, and was a Grand Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur. Later political career After the end of the war Messimy re-entered active politics but he was defeated for re-election in 1919. On 15 November he came only sixth out of the list of candidates for the union r√©publicaine et d√©mocratique, receiving only 16,494 votes out of 68,762 cast.This election was conducted under Proportional representation by department, replacing the usual two-round system of voting by arrondissements in use since 1889. He was elected a senator in 1923 at a by-election caused by the death of Alexandre B√©rard. At the second round, held on 10 June, he was convincingly elected with 665 votes out of 871 cast. He was re-elected, this time at the first ballot, on 20 October 1929, with 469 votes out of 877 cast. In the Senate Messimy served on the Committees of the Army, the Air Force, the Colonies and Foreign Affairs. He was President of the Colonies Committee for five years from 1926, before succeeding Albert Lebrun as President of the Army Committee.Lebrun became President of the Senate that year, before becoming President of the Republic the following year He died, still a senator, on 1 September 1935 at Charnoz- sur-Ain from the effects of a cerebral haemorrhage. In his posthumous memoirs (1937, pp350‚Äì1) Messimy once again argued that unsuccessful generals in 1914 should have been executed, quoting the names of six who were sent to the guillotine in 1793‚Äì4.Greenhalgh 2014, p.67 References Books  * * Biography of Messimy on the website of the French Parliament (French) Category:1869 births Category:1935 deaths Category:People from Lyon Category:Radical Party (France) politicians Category:French Ministers of War Category:French Ministers of the Colonies Category:French Ministers of Overseas France Category:Government ministers of France Category:Members of the 8th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 9th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 10th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 11th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:French Senators of the Third Republic Category:Senators of Ain Category:French generals Category:√âcole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr alumni Category:French military personnel of World War I Category:Grand Officiers of the L√©gion d'honneur ","title":"Adolphe Messimy"},{"id":"35686395","text":"Chah Gholami (, also Romanized as ChƒÅh GholƒÅmƒ´) is a village in Golestan Rural District, in the Central District of Jajrom County, North Khorasan Province, Iran.

History In the Records of the Grand Historian, Sima Qian's account of the origins of the House of Ying states that Fei the Great was the son of Ye the Great and Lady Hua. His father is given as Gao Yao, but this seems to have been a mistake of various scholars in reading the original sources. He was eventually titled Boyi or Count Yi. Yi was appointed by Shun to assist in controlling the great flood through the controlled burn use of fire to clear the land forests, overgrowth, and marshes; and, also, to provide meat to feed the workers involved in the disaster management effort: he thus became a close companion of Yu, with whom he worked closely for thirteen years in this effort.Wu, 90 Then, after the successful struggle against the flood, and the subsequent reorganization of government, Yi was appointed Minister of Animal Husbandry.Wu, 97 According to the more mythical accounts, Yi could domesticate animals and birds due to knowing their languages.Yang, 80 Alternately, Yi is credited by creation of the canon of laws, while his relationship to the flood quelling is not underlined. This presentation is provided in the \\"L√º xing\\" ÂëÇÂàë chapter of the Book of Documents, where he is listed together with Yu the Great and Houji as \\"three princes\\" ‰∏âÂêé. After the succession of Yu as sole emperor, Yu initially designated Yi as his successor, in preference to his son Qi.Wu, 116 Versions vary as to whether Yu later changed his mind or if instead Yi was killed in the course of a struggle for the throne, as well as to whether Yi ever served as emperor. According to Sima Qian, Boyi's children by a 'jade lady of the Yao' included Lian the Great and Ruomu.  Descendants  His son Ruomu was appointed lord of Xu in approximately 2061 BC by King Qi of Xia. Yi was believed to be the ancestor of Zhao clan and Qin clan as well. The state of Zhao and Qin were ruled by the two clans respectively. Descendants of Zhao clan were known as Zhao clan of Tianshui. Qin Shi Huang was one of his descendant from Qin clan. Other Ying clansmen, descended from Ruomu, formed Pei clan of Hedong.

Background Recorded in 1991, \\"Imagination\\" was an attempt at a comeback for Farrow, after his original record label in 1983, Rocshire Records, had suffered legal problems and all its assets, including master tapes were seized. Farrow withdrew from music and reportedly opened his own nightclub around 1987, named The Bitter End. Released by the independent record label Graphite Records, \\"Imagination\\" saw Farrow team up with Mars Larsar, Phil Maturano and The Company. \\"Imagination\\" was recorded at Echo Sound Recording and engineered by Eric Scheda.Imagination CD Single Credits It was Farrow's only release on the label, which also manufactured and distributed the single. The song was not a commercial success. In May 1993, Farrow died in West Hollywood, California from a brain disease attributed to AIDS. Release The single was released in America only on 12\\" vinyl, cassette and CD. On the 12\\" vinyl, the A-side featured \\"Imagination (Dance Mix)\\" while the B-side was \\"Imagination (Instrumental)\\". Both the cassette and CD version of the single featured the main track and three remixes. A total of three remixes were created for the single, the \\"Dance Mix\\", \\"Euro Mix\\" and \\"Instrumental Mix\\". \\"Imagination (Dance Mix)\\" lasts over six minutes and features a more dominant use of percussion as well as some spoken vocal, based on the song's lyrics, performed by Farrow, and exclusive to the remix. \\"Imagination (Euro Mix)\\" features an alternative backing keyboard melody and piano, as well as a different vocal take, instead of the original version's vocal. The ending features the lyric \\"Hear what I say\\" which was not used in the original version. \\"Imagination (Instrumental Mix)\\" is the same remix as the \\"Dance Mix\\" but minus all lead vocal, leaving only some backing vocal in places. Music video A music video was filmed to promote the single. It was Farrow's second and final music video, with his first being for his 1983 minor hit single \\"Should I Love You\\".

Life His father was John Frazer, minister of the Associate Church at Auchtermuchty, in Fife, Scotland; his mother was Margaret Erskine. He became minister of the Associate Church at Saltcoats in Ayrshire, in 1796, but within months inherited an estate through his mother, at Lassodie, Beath, in the Fife coalfield. The inheritance required that he changed his name to Dewar: it originated with his great-grandfather Ralph Erskine and his first wife Margaret Dewar. At this point Dewar left the ministry.Scottish Mining, Lassodie History. Dewar retrained as a doctor at Edinburgh University gaining an MD in 1804.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf He then began a new life as an army surgeon, with the 30th Regiment of Foot.Edward Mansfield Brockbank, Sketches of the Lives and Work of the Honorary Medical Staff of the Manchester Infirmary, from its foundation in 1752 to 1830 when it became the Royal Infirmary (1904), pp. 214‚Äì5; archive.org.

He then returned to Edinburgh, becoming a member of the Royal College of Physicians there and lecturer at the Medical Institution. He may have dropped medical practice, and become a writer. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1816. His proposers were Sir David Brewster, Andrew Coventry, and John Barclay. In 1819 he was elected a member of the Wernerian Natural History Society alongside the botanist James Robinson Scott and Robert Kaye Greville. .Memoirs of the Wernerian Natural History Society, vol 3, p.539 In his later life he lived at 37 Nicolson Street in Edinburgh's South Side.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1820-1 The house stood immediately opposite Surgeons' Hall but was demolished in the late 19th century to make way for a small department store.

Trotter had proposed \\"oxygenated muriatic gas\\" (i.e. hydrochloric acid) as a fumigant.Durham Mining Museum, Robert L. Galloway, A History of Coal Mining in Great Britain, Ch. XIV. As far as chemistry went, both their theories were inaccurate. Dewar was a friend of the Newcastle physician John Clark, and Trotter's criticism of Clark has been given as one possible reason for the personal attacks included with the scientific and practical arguments Dewar gave. A scale or chemical slide rule mentioned by Thomas Charles Hope as \\"Dr. Dewar's\\" has been considered to be unpublished work of Henry Dewar. An inquiry into the principles by which the importance of foreign commerce ought to be estimated (1808) was an economic pamphlet. It was taken to be a comment on the Continental System, and a reply to William Spence. Spence's Britain Independent of Commerce (1807) had come under heavy criticism. Dewar was somewhat sympathetic to Spence's positive views of autarky. Dewar wrote an early paper on what was then called \\"double consciousness\\", now diagnostically identified with dissociative identity disorder. It is considered that Dewar was alluding to the celebrated case of Mary Reynolds of Pennsylvania, which was published in 1816 by Mitchill.

The primary objective of the initial Red Dragon mission was to test techniques and technology to enter the Martian atmosphere with equipment that a human crew could conceivably use. The series of Mars missions were to be technology pathfinders for the much larger SpaceX Mars colonization architecture that was announced in September 2016. An additional suggested use for a mission called for a sample return Mars rover to be delivered to the Martian surface. The program was conceived in 2011 as a potential NASA Discovery mission launching as early as 2022, and evolved over several years once it did not receive funding for the 2013‚Äì2015 Discovery Mission program cycle. In April 2016, SpaceX announced that they had signed an unfunded Space Act Agreement with NASA, providing technical support, for a launch no earlier than 2018. In February 2017, SpaceX noted this launch date was delayed to no earlier than 2020. In July 2017, Elon Musk announced that development would be halted and resources redirected to Starship.  Development history  SpaceX worked with NASA's Ames Research Center in 2011 to produce a feasibility study for a mission that would search for evidence of life on Mars (biosignatures), past or present. SpaceX's Dragon version 1 capsule is used to ferry cargo, and SpaceX Dragon 2 is proposed to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station in the future. The Red Dragon proposal called for modifications so it could be used to transport payload to Mars, land using retrorockets, and to become a precursor to a human mission to Mars. = 2011 concept = SpaceX initially planned to propose Red Dragon for funding in 2013 and 2015 as the United States NASA Discovery mission #13 for launch in 2022,Spacex Dragon lander could land on Mars with a mission under the NASA Discovery Program cost cap. 20 June 2014. but it was not submitted. The 2011 Red Dragon concept was conceived to use a modified diameter Dragon module, with a mass of and an interior volume of for up to of Mars-landed payload. The instruments were proposed to drill approximately under ground to sample reservoirs of water ice known to exist in the shallow subsurface. The mission cost was projected in 2011 to be less than US$400 million, plus $150 million to $190 million for a launch vehicle and lander. The goals for a NASA-funded mission, as originally proposed by NASA Ames Research Center, were: ;Scientific goals *Search for evidence of life (biosignatures), past or present *Assess subsurface habitability *Establish the origin, distribution, and composition of ground ice *Understand past climate using ground ice record ;Human precursor goals *Conduct human-relevant entry, descent and landing (EDL) demonstrations *Assess potential hazards in dust, regolith, and ground ice *Characterize natural resources *Demonstrate access to subsurface resources *Conduct in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) demonstration: water extraction and propellant production = 2014 concept = A 2014 study of a potential 2021 NASA-funded Red Dragon mission suggested that it could offer a low-cost way for NASA to achieve a Mars sample return. In the concept, the Dragon 2 would be equipped with the system needed to return samples gathered on Mars, including a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), an Earth Return Vehicle (ERV), and hardware to transfer the sample collected by a previously landed rover mission, such as NASA's planned Mars 2020 rover, to the ERV. The ERV would transfer the samples to high Earth orbit, where a separate future mission would pick up the samples and de-orbit to Earth. NASA did not fund either concept. = 2016 concept = Over time, the Red Dragon concept changed but the basic idea was: use a modified Dragon capsule to test developmental technologies with an uncrewed mission to Mars. The launch vehicle would be the Falcon Heavy, and the capsule would be a SpaceX Dragon 2. In April 2016, SpaceX announced that they were proceeding with the robotic mission for a 2018 launch and NASA would be providing technical support: a departure from the original NASA-funded mission. SpaceX was planning the initial Falcon Heavy rocket launch for late 2017, and Dragon 2 was scheduled to undergo flight tests in mid to late 2017. In April 2016, SpaceX reiterated their plan for a 2018 launch. The first Red Dragon mission was intended as a technology demonstrator and no payload was announced. NASA would have been involved in the mission at the level of technical interchange. In exchange for Martian entry, descent, and landing data from SpaceX, NASA offered technical support and telemetry for the Red Dragon mission. In 2016, NASA anticipated spending about $30 million of its public budgetary funds for employees and equipment to be used to monitor the mission. In May 2017, NASA revealed that SpaceX would launch twin Dragon 2s to assure mission success with redundant spacecraft as insurance, one at the beginning of the 2020 launch window and one at the end, so that the second arrival can learn from the first's arrival, but in July 2017 the mission was halted in favor of using a larger lander yet to be described. = 2017 cancellation = SpaceX announced in 2017 that propulsive landing for Dragon 2 would no longer be developed and landing legs would not be added to the Dragon 2 capsule. The end of propulsive landing development means a Dragon will not be able to land on Mars, and the Red Dragon program has been put on the back burner. Musk stated on Twitter that a \\"vastly bigger ship\\" would be used to test a different landing method now thought to be better than the concept of heat shield on the bottom and thrusters on the sides. SpaceX is redirecting engineering development resources to develop the propulsive landing technologies for the much larger ship he calls Starship.  Landing system  Because to its design integrating a robust heat shield and powerful thrusters, a modified SpaceX Dragon 2 capsule might, with further development, have been able to perform all the necessary entry, descent and landing (EDL) functions in order to deliver payloads of or more to the Martian surface without using a parachute; the use of parachutes is not feasible without significant vehicle modifications. After direct entry into the atmosphere at it was calculated that the capsule's own aerodynamic drag may slow it sufficiently for the remainder of descent to be within the capability of the SuperDraco retro- propulsion thrusters. It could be designed with a center of gravity (CG) offset to enter with a Lift-to-drag ratio of 0.24 (like Mars Science Laboratory). The CG offset could be removed by ejecting 120 kg of ballast mass. It would transition directly from atmospheric flight to powered descent at Mach 2.24. The retrorockets would slow the craft as it descends into Mars' upper atmosphere at supersonic speed. 1900 kg of propellant would provide the Œîv required for soft landing at 2.4 m/s.Red Dragon-MSL Hybrid Landing Architecture for 2018 Concepts and Approaches for Mars Exploration, held June 12‚Äì14, 2012 in Houston, Texas. LPI Contribution No. 1679, id.4216 This approach was expected to allow the capsule to land at much higher Martian elevations than could be done with a parachute, and within landing accuracy. the SpaceX engineering team was developing options for payload integration with the Dragon capsule. Potential landing sites would have been polar or mid- latitude sites with proven near-surface ice. In July 2017, Musk announced that development of propulsive landing had ceased in favor of a \\"much better\\" landing technique for Starship.

It runs in a west-east direction from LA 26 southeast of Oberlin to U.S. Highway 190 (US 190) in Opelousas. Along the way, it passes through the town of Mamou and intersects various north-south routes that service points along US 190 such as Elton, Basile, and Eunice. East of Mamou, connections are also made to Ville Platte, the St. Landry Parish seat, on US 167/LA 10. Route description From the west, LA 104 begins at an intersection with LA 26 at a point southeast of Oberlin known as Soileau. It proceeds east for before crossing from Allen Parish into Evangeline Parish. Now known as Oberlin Road, LA 104 continues east and intersects LA 3277 (George Soileau Road), which heads south to Basile. LA 104 then heads in a general northeastern direction, zigzagging along section line roads, towards the town of Mamou. At the western limit of Mamou, LA 104 intersects LA 13 (Veterans Memorial Highway), which heads toward Alexandria on the north and Eunice on the south. LA 104 continues east onto South Street for several blocks then turns north onto 6th Street. LA 95 continues ahead on South Street before taking a southeasterly course through Chataignier on the way to US 190. Heading north along 6th Street, LA 104 passes through the business section of Mamou. At a four-way intersection near the north end of town, LA 104 turns east onto Poinciana Street; LA 1160 begins to the west; and LA 3149 (Old Highway 13) begins to the north. The latter two highways connect with the modern alignment of LA 13 which skirts the western edge of town. LA 104 continues east on Poinciana Street out of Mamou. After , LA 104 intersects LA 1161 (Pine Point Road), which zigzags in a general northeastern direction toward Ville Platte. After another , LA 104 curves to the northeast briefly before taking a southeastern course toward an area known as Point Blue. About halfway along, LA 104 crosses a bridge over Bayou Des Cannes. In Point Blue, LA 104 intersects LA 1163 (Perron Road) and, shortly thereafter, LA 29 (Chataignier Road). LA 29 heads through Chataignier to US 190 on the south and to Ville Platte on the north where it connects with the concurrent US 167/LA 10. LA 104 turns south to follow LA 29 briefly before resuming a general southeastern course with several zig-zags to the south and east. East of LA 29, LA 104 intersects three minor routes: LA 1166, LA 1167 (L'Anse De Cavailer Road), and LA 1165 (L'Anse Aux Pailles Road). LA 104 crosses from Evangeline Parish into St. Landry Parish past the intersection with LA 1165. In St. Landry Parish, LA 104 enters an area known as Prairie Ronde and intersects LA 103 (Prairie Ronde Highway), which connects to US 167/LA 10 on the north and a point on US 190 near Lawtell on the south. Shortly thereafter, it curves further southeast at an intersection with LA 3043. LA 3043 parallels LA 104 the remainder of the distance into Opelousas. After , LA 104 curves to the east toward Opelousas and gradually approaches the parallel US 190. Just before reaching its eastern terminus, LA 104 once again intersects LA 3043 (Grandnigo Road) which heads north into the Opelousas Industrial Park. LA 104 ends later at an intersection with US 190 on the western city limit of Opelousas. LA 104 is an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length. History In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 104 followed State Route 120 from the western terminus to Mamou; State Route 26 through Mamou; and State Route 219 from Mamou to the eastern terminus in Opelousas. LA 104 was created with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, and its route has remained unchanged to the present day.

Background On the Summer of 1518 the Danish king Christian II started a siege of Stockholm in an attempt to quell the rebellion of the party of Sten Sture the Younger, regent of Sweden. With an army, mostly composed of Danish troops and reinforced by German mercenaries, he firstly camped on Norrmalm, but later moved to S√∂dermalm. In July, Sten Sture the Younger advanced from the south along with an army to break the siege. Christian's troops then took the siege off and marched southwards to meet the approaching Swedish forces. The location of the battle A map dated by 1861 of the area with the G√∂ta highway depicted. The main sources of the Battle of Br√§nnkyrka is an account in Latin of a Danish eyewitness, Lars Werman (Lawrence Wermannus), and one in German by a man in Sten Sture service.B√•da utgivna i \\"Scriptores rerum Suecicarum III:1 (1876) av Claes Annerstedt. None of them mentions Br√§nnkyrka. It is however, mentioned in later sources: Olaus Petri, , the (Stora rimkr√∂nikan) and others. Werman doesn't specify the exact location of the battle but mentions the place had mountains and hills overgrown with bushes on the left side and on the right side there were swamps and fences. The German narrative reports ene scherm√ºslinth by Aerstede op eyne enge, \\"a skirmish at Aerstede in a meadow\\". In a note in Latin that says Annerstedt Aerstede refers to √Örsta farm and therefore the battle should have taken place at between and . The historian believes that Aerstede refers to ,, vol 2:1, T√∂ren, Svartl√∂sa, Sotholm, av Sigurd Rahmqvist och Kaj Janzon 2002, Riksantikvarie√§mbetet. a farm that no longer exists, but that laid west of √Örstaf√§ltet, northwest of G√∂ta highway. This would indicate that at least the concluding part of the battle took place on the slope towards √Örstaf√§ltet between and Ersta, just to the north of √ñrby mill. The Great Swedish historical chronicle states instead that the battle was fought near where it was said were found the traces of what was then assumed to be remnants of the Swedes' camp. Taking into account the circumstances preceding the battle, that Sten Sture's troops marched towards Stockholm from the South and Christian's ones from his camp on S√∂dermalm to meet them, makes a location along the G√∂ta highway a likely place for the skirmish. This is consistent with the above sites, also located around the same site: , √ñrby mill and southern slopes towards √Örstaf√§ltet. Valla field which are also listed as a possible site is a direct continuation of the northern slope towards √Örstaf√§ltet. A number of other places have also been suggested. One theory is that the battle was fought at Victory Memorial (Sigridsmynde), between Br√§nnkyrka and Huddinge churches. The battle No reference to the battle were made by the contemporaries but it was mentioned in Swedish and Danish sources several years later. =According to Swedish sources= Swedes attempted the attack first during the daylight but the Danes were alerted by a sentry located around , √Ñlvsj√∂ so the attack failed. Consequently, the Danish army attacked the southern flank but the Swedes repelled the attack and eventually broke through their defense line. This coincided with the appearance of Swedish reinforcement as a part of the foot soldiers that were not yet involved into the battle and who intervened in the attack. In result the Danish front was dissolved and fled. During the escape Danish heavy cavalry was caught in the swamps. Sture took 300 prisoners with him in Stockholm. It is reported that 1600 farmers have remained on the battlefield. It was believed that Gustav Vasa hold the Swedish banner during the battle but this is now contested. On the other hand, he possibly participated in the battle, at least he was shortly afterwards among Sten Sture's troops. =According to Danish sources= The Danish historian Professor Allen writes: \\"The first Swedish attack was repulsed and at the second they were thrown away and was chased into the woods. During the persecution the Danish troops were disordered and divided into small clusters. Swedes took advantage of the situation. Under the coverage of the woods they gathered again and broke unexpectedly into a single attack. Danes could not withstand due to the disordered state, whereby they were. Especially the German soldiers were driven out in a quagmire or marsh, and found their death over there. The Danes retreated to S√∂dermalm.\\" Aftermath After the battle the Danes withdrew to their camp on S√∂dermalm. After that negotiations were started and an agreement was reached on September 12, 1518 to set up a treaty for a new meeting in July 1519. After that Christian sailed away with the hostages he had before the negotiations. References in arts and literature The 's chronicle, written upon Gustav Vasa's request, gives the battle a major role in Gustav Vasa's life. And while the fact that he hold the Swedish banner during the battle is now considered as less likely, the battle is still represented as the first significant achievement of his. In the of Uppsala Cathedral there are seven frescoes painted by Johan Gustaf Sandberg between 1831 and 1838 that depict important events in Gustav Vasa's life, where the painting of the Battle of Br√§nnkyrka with Gustav Vasa in the background is the first. There are multiple references to the battle in literature where it is represented as a major event in Gustav Vasa's life. As well as in poetry and folk songs. One of the earliest references in 1800s it is mentioned in Geijer and Afzelius, Swedish Folk Songs in 1880, that begins with Swerighis menn achtar iagh att loffwa.

Russia In the 1980s she translated a book on Russian and Soviet Theatre. In 1985 she was a cultural delegate to the World Youth Festival in Moscow where she exhibited her Nuclear Family. In more recent years she has exhibited in St. Petersburg at the Manezh Central Exhibition Hall. She co-initiated the emplacements project (1997‚Äì2003) with Francoise Dupr√©, working with artists from the UK, Western Europe and Russia to stage events in London and St. Petersburg, culminating in temporary public art events throughout St. Petersburg in 2003. the emplacements project at New Holland in 2000 opened the grounds to the general public for the first time in the city's history. For the International Festival of Experimental Art in St. Petersburg in 2008 she invited people from various parts of the world, including Shetland, to participate in an exchange of films made on mobile phones, Swap Shots. Edited versions have been exhibited in Russia, Denmark and Shetland. Permar presented a paper about the project at isea2009 in Belfast. Shetland Projects In 1990 Permar worked with Susan Timmins to create the public art project, The Nuclear Roadshow, and from 1992 to 1995 she worked with Wilma Johnson on The Croft Cosy Project. Permar has worked with young people in Shetland through projects largely focussing on the use of digital media and the Internet, including Fishtastic: The Scalloway Moving Image Project The Sonic Postcards Project for the Sonic Arts Network and Shetlands' Cauld Waaters (2001‚Äì02) commissioned by Scottish Natural Heritage. She is a founder member of Veer North, Shetland's Visual Artists group. She created Come and Go (2007, Soundtrack, David Sjoberg), a film for the permanent displays in the new Shetland Museum and Archives. New Technologies and Underwater Exploration In the late 1990s Permar began to work with sound producing site specific sound installations, such as 'In-take' for a former wine vat in France. In 2000 Permar undertook a Scotland Year of the Artist Residency at Subsea7 in Aberdeen when she began to investigate the relationship between technology and underwater exploration. The residency culminated in a body of work exhibited at The Aberdeen Maritime Museum (2001) and the Shetland Museum (2002). The film, Through the Moonpool, was exhibited in Crossover UK in 2003 and again in Japan in 2005. For Crossover UK 2004 she exhibited The Webnitki, a collection of animations made for the Internet at a Lab Culture residency. The webnitki, are characters who 'knit' their way across the world's continents, 'threading' their way across time and space, land, sea and 'through the moonpool'. The work reflects urban and rural environments, drawing on subject matter related to Permar's experience of living and working in diverse cultures. She invented the word 'webnitki' by combining the English word 'web' with the Russian word 'nitki', meaning 'threads'. Participatory and Temporary Public Art Projects Participation and collaboration in temporary public art projects have been an ongoing concern in Permar's practice. Commissions include Echolalia's Walsall Archive for In Memoriam (The New Art Gallery Walsall, 2000‚Äì01), Park Matters (London, 2004) and Blueprints, (Newlyn Art Gallery 2005‚Äì07).

The Indian Navy's Boeing P-8I, advanced maritime surveillance aircraft is also expected to be stationed at Karwar. The commissioning of a Naval Air Station at Karwar will decongest INS Hansa at the nearby Dabolim Airport which is a front line Air Station that is highly congested with both operational and training flying. The resulting restrictions on civil commercial air traffic has met with opposition from civilian quarters since Goa is a popular tourist destination In India In early 2007, there were reports of a concerted move by the Navy, the AAI, and the state of Karnataka to extend the runway planned at the naval base at Karwar to 2,500 metres (8,200 ft) to accommodate Airbus A320s and to acquire 75 extra hectares for this purpose. However, there have been no corresponding plans announced so far to relocate flight training from Dabolim to this airport or any other more convenient place.  Civilian Use  Navy had initially planned to construct a 2,000 metre long runway for the naval air station. The Karnataka State Government approached the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to use the air station for civil operations. The MoD approved of the proposal and asked the State government to facilitate the extension of the runway by another 1000 metres to a total of 3000 meters. The AAI had carried out an inspection of the site at the request of the Karnataka Government in 2006. It had given suggestions regarding orientation, location and extension of the proposed runway to 2,500 metres and also of its land requirements of an additional 75 hectares. Accordingly, in 2019, the district administration began acquiring 40 acres for extension of the runway and for the terminal building. The State Government has requested the Central Government to bear the cost of acquisition of this additional land, estimated to be Rs. 20 crores.

It was in use between the years 742 and 1423 before it lost its function when the Serrata del Maggior Consiglio passed power into the hands of the aristocratic class interior. History =The origin and the conquest of power for the election of the Doge= The origin of the popular assembly is uncertain. Assemblies of free men were already in existence in the 6th‚Äì7th centuries in various cities of maritime Venice for the election of local magistrates (or tribunes). Although the Venetian traditions called for a general meeting of Venetians, in 697 the appointment of the first Doge, Paolo Lucio Anafesto, would have been the prerogative of the Byzantine Emperor through the Exarchate of Ravenna. The first actual election was probably that of the third Doge, Orso Ipato, when in 726 the Venetians, rejecting measures imposed by iconoclasts of the 'Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian, chose their own leadership autonomously. Upon the death of Orso however, the Byzantines replaced the government with a ducal courts annually in the magistri militum until 742 when the emperor formally granted the populate the right to elect the Doge.Diehl, Charles: La Repubblica di Venezia, p.21., Newton & Compton Editori. The power of the assembly at this time had yet be precisely defined and author John Deacon reports that in 887 Doge Giovanni Participazio II had to reaffirm that it was the responsibility of the people's assembly to elect the Doge.Giovanni diacono, Cronaca, in Cronache veneziane antichissime, Fonti per la storia d'Italia IX, Roma 1890, p. 129. =The struggle for power= Despite the power delegated to the Concio, over time several Dukes tried to change the assembly, turning the monarchy from being an elective into a hereditary arrangement. One strategy chosen was to circumvent the electoral power of the Concio by associating the throne with a co-regent, also called co-Dux, selected from children or close relatives. This person would, on the death of the Doge, automatically succeed him, with the co-regent being already on the throne and thus in a position of strength. It is unclear what role that the Assembly had at the time in the coronation of coreggenti, and whether it could exert some form of confirmation of their appointment. However between the 8th and 11th centuries, there were at least fifteen coreggenti that were associated with the throne. This chaotic phase was resolved in 1032 when the Concio refused to recognize the coronation of Domenico Orseolo and appointed Flabanico Domenico in his place. At this time the Concio enacted the first law of the Constitutional Republic. This law forbade the practice of association to the throne, separated the perpetual Orseoli from the government, and provided two ducal councilors for the Doge, to constantly supervise his actions. =The training of municipal institutions and the loss of power of Concio= After this period the Concio in effect was the supreme arbiter of the state. It now faced the need to create permanent organizations that were able to replace the previous ducal power structures. At the same time, the ancient noble families were no longer committed to push for a hereditary sovereign and began to form, along with other prominent families, a class of aristocrats able to influence and direct the city politics. In 1143, the city installed its first Consilium Sapientium, who was appointed by and responsible to support the Doge permanently in government. The new communal form of the State was sanctioned by the Veneciarum Commune (\\"City of Venice\\") documents. The first step that marked the beginning of the decline of the power of Concio occurred in 1172. At this time, the Consilium Sapientium, became the Great Council and was entrusted with the ordinary legislative power. Also at this time, it decided to entrust the election ducal seven elected by voters. A second event came six years later in 1178 when the Concio lost significant control over the appointment of the doge. From that, the seven electors from this nominated no longer directly choose the Doge: they instead began to raffle four with the task of appointing the forty ducal actual voters. The Council of Forty sold out the task and then remained in power as an assembly of the government and as a supreme court. In 1207 the appointment of members of the Great Council was entrusted to a small group of three voters and then subsequently increased to seven in 1230. A consequence of this choices was that the aristocratic part increased in these municipal bodies. The status quo of popular power supported by an aristocratic power cracked in 1286 when two attempts, rejected, to foreclose access to the Great Council families popular, marked the opening of hostilities between the two factions. Rejected again in 1296, with difficulty, the proposed Serrata was finally approved at the urging of the Doge Pietro Gradenigo on 28 February 1297. After these events, in 1300 and in 1310 a plot of Marin Bocconio and Tiepolo attempted a restoration of the people. However, these failed and the aristocratic form of the state was now a reality. =The abolition= Deprived of any real power, the Concio of the People survived only as a formal meeting at dell'acclamazione under the new Doge that was elected. The body still presented the crowd with a ritual phrase: :( VEC ) ::\\"Questi xe monsignor el Doxe, se ve piaze!\\" :( EN ) ::\\"He is our lord, the Doge, if you like!\\" (ritual presentation of the new Doge to the People) The meeting was at this point useless and officially abolished in 1423. However, the custom of ritual request for approval to the people remained in use until the fall of the Republic in 1797.

The majority of death tolls reported for each day comes from the Local Coordination Committees, an opposition activist group based in Syria, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, another opposition group based in London. May 2012 =1 May= The Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC) reported 45 people were killed, including 18 in a reported massacre in the Idlib province. Herv√© Ladsous, the United Nations (UN) Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, said that both sides had violated the 12 April ceasefire agreement. =2 May= The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that 15 Syrian troops, including two colonels, were killed in an ambush by rebels in the northern province of Aleppo. Two rebel fighters were also killed. The New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that government forces had killed at least 95 civilians and demolished hundreds of houses in a two-week offensive in Idlib during ceasefire negotiations. The report documented dozens of extrajudicial executions, killings of civilians, and destruction of civilian property that qualify as war crimes, as well as arbitrary detention and torture by the Syrian government. 30 people were killed across Syria, the LCC reported. =3 May= 25 people were reported killed by Syrian security forces, including at least 4 students from Aleppo University. Around 1,500 students had been protesting in student dormitories next to Aleppo university's main campus when security forces and Shabiha attacked them, firing tear gas and live ammunition to disperse the student protesters. 200 students were reportedly detained, and the university announced the suspension of all classes as a consequence of the attack on campus. The White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said it may be time for the world to acknowledge the cease-fire in Syria is not holding and try a new approach to stopping the violence. =4 May= Anti-government protesters took to the streets after Friday prayers, with the largest demonstrations occurring in Aleppo, Damascus, the Idlib and Daara provinces, and Homs and Hama. Syrian forces killed at least 12 people when they fired on demonstrators in Damascus and Aleppo. The LCC reported that 37 people were killed across Syria by the Syrian army. Amnesty International senior crisis adviser Donatella Rovera, returning from a visit to Idlib, reported that Syrian forces were executing scores of suspected opposition sympathisers in Idlib. Kofi Annan's spokesman Ahmad Fawzi told reporters in Geneva that the \\"peace plan is on track.\\" US officials say the plan is failing mainly because of Syrian government violations. =5 May= SOHR reported that at least 5 people were killed in a bomb explosion at a car wash in the Al Sukari neighborhood of Aleppo. A member of the Free Syrian Army claimed responsibility for the attack, saying the car wash was used by members of a pro-Assad militia.

Opposition groups denied responsibility while Haitham Maleh, a leading opposition figure, blamed the government. Media attention focused on the Al-Nusra Front, a little known jihadi-type group that had previously claimed responsibility for bombings in Damascus and Aleppo. Earlier in the week Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, head of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), had expressed worries that Syria was rushing into an uncontrollable spiral of sectarian violence and following the latest bombings urged the perpetrators to refrain from violence and let the peace process move forward. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) condemned the attacks and urged all sides to \\"immediately and comprehensively\\" implement the six-point peace plan of UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan. The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the bombings the work of \\"outsiders\\", alleging that unspecified foreign states shared the blame. The LCC responded by asserting that the Syrian government had orchestrated and masterminded the bombings to bolster the Russian position. The United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said that it was too early to call the peace plan a failure. She confirmed that the US was providing logistical and communication support to the Syrian opposition, but had shied away from providing arms. Elsewhere, the LCC reported that 37 people were killed, including 10 in Homs. =11 May= Anti-government protesters took to the streets after Friday prayers, with the largest demonstrations occurring in Aleppo, Damascus, the Idlib and Daara provinces, and Homs and Hama. Syrian forces killed at least 14 people by mid day when they fired on demonstrators in Damascus and Aleppo. The Al-Nusra Front allegedly claimed responsibility for Thursday's twin bombings in Damascus in a video posted online. The Al-Nusra Front however denied responsibility, saying the video was a fake and that any information regarding their operations would be announced through Jihadi forums. Al Nusra denied responsibility for the attack. Two Turkish journalists arrested in March were released following Iranian mediation. =12 May= The LCC reported 20 people killed by mid-day. =13 May= The LCC reported 30 people killed. =14 May= The LCC reported that at least 22 people were killed. 23 soldiers were killed by the FSA when the Syrian army attempted to assault Rastan, Homs Province.

The Syrian army barraged Rastan with artillery fire. =18 May= Protesters took to the streets for weekly Friday protests, this time with the biggest protests at any single time in Aleppo. The Salahadin and Shukour neighborhoods saw tens of thousands, and tens of thousands more protested in the other area of Aleppo. Damascus and its suburbs, the Idlib and Daraa provinces, the Homs and Hama provinces, and Latakia and Deir Ezzor also saw large protests. Protesters were shot and killed across the country, including in the Tandamoun area of central Damascus. At least 33 people were killed by security forces by mid-day. =19 May= A car bomb at an intelligence complex in the city of Deir al-Zour killed 9 members of the security forces and left 100 injured. The LCC reported 26 people killed. =20 May= During the very early morning the Free Syrian Army (FSA) launched widespread attacks against the Syrian government in Central Damascus. The Kafer Souseh, Mezzeh, Malki, and Ruk al Adn neighborhoods erupted with intense gunfire. Security forces began closing off Umayyad square and absereen square, and blocked of Central Damascus' Al-Shami Hospital. The Free Syrian Army's Damascus council announced that one of their operatives from the FSA's Al Sahabeh battalion had successfully poisoned all eight members of Bashar Assad's Crisis Cell, a group of top military officials who currently run the Syrian army's daily operations. Members of the Crisis cell include the interior and defense ministers, as well as Assef Shawkat. The Free Syrian Army's Damascus council said they believed at least six out of the eight to have been killed. Mohammed Shaar, the interior minister, apparently denied the assassinations by telephone, calling it \\"categorically baseless\\". He also denied the gunfire in Damascus which was confirmed by all witnesses. Adib Habb al-Rumman, the head of Idlib's Jish Shugour's Baath party branch, was assassinated by the FSA, the SOHR reported. The SOHR also made note of increased political and military assassinations by the FSA in recent weeks. At least 28 people were killed by mid-day in Syria, primarily in the Hama province. Soran, Hama, and Douma, Damascus, came under intense artillery shelling by the Syrian army. By the end of the day more than 60 people were killed nationwide. =21 May= 5 civilians, 11 rebels, and 22 soldiers were killed by mid-day. Much of the soldier deaths occurred when the Syrian army attempted to storm Atarib, Aleppo. The LCC reported 33 people killed by the end of day. According to S.O.H.R, 31 soldiers were killed by the end of the day. =22 May= An IED exploded in the Damascus neighborhood of Qaboun, killing at least five people. The LCC reported that at least 25 people killed. =23 May= 23 people were killed, including 6 in Homs. =24 May= 40 people were killed. 203 soldiers reportedly defected to the opposition, including 3 officers. An FSA officer said that the FSA was now present in all governorates and regions of Syria. A Brigadier General in the Syrian army who had defected to the FSA gave a speech in which he said that a safe zone or international intervention like air strikes was needed to stop what he called the genocide the Syrian army was committing in Syria. =25 May= Protesters took to the streets for weekly Friday protests, amassing in Aleppo, Damascus and its suburbs, Homs, Hama, Qamishli, and the Daraa, Idlib, and Deir Ezzor provinces. Tens of thousands protested in central Aleppo, to which security forces responded with live fire, killing several. Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, head of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), confirmed opposition group claims that at least 90 civilians were killed, including 32 children in Houla, Homs province. General Mood declared the killings \\"indiscriminate and unforgivable\\" without explaining how they happened, but said the violence had begun Friday evening with the use of \\"tanks, artillery, rocket-propelled grenades, and heavy machine guns\\", implying an attack by government forces since the FSA do not possess heavy weaponry. The official news agency of the Syrian government alleged that \\"Al-Qaeda terrorist groups\\" were responsible for the killings, while opposition groups alleged that the Syrian military and government-linked militias known as Shabiha were the perpetrators. The Syrian National Council (SNC), Syria's main opposition bloc, put the death toll at more than 110 people, half of them children. State media claimed 17 had been killed. A further 43 people were killed according to the LCC. On the same day, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon blamed the Syrian government for the \\"unacceptable levels of violence and abuses\\" occurring every day in Syria. Ban cited the government's continued use of heavy weapons, reports of shelling and \\"a stepped-up security crackdown by the authorities that has led to massive violations of human rights by government forces and pro-government militias\\". He said there was only \\"small progress\\" in implementing the UN peace plan. =26 May= The UK Foreign Secretary William Hague called for an urgent session of the UNSC following Friday's \\"appalling crime\\" at Houla. He urged the regime to grant full and immediate access to Houla for UN monitors and stop all military options, as demanded by special envoy Kofi Annan. However General Mustafa Ahmed al-Sheikh, head of the Turkey-based Free Syria Army (FSA) military council, said regime opponents had lost all faith in the UN Security Council, on which Damascus has Russia as a powerful backer (see also Russia‚ÄìSyria relations). 65 people were killed across the country, including 25 in Homs. =27 May= The Syrian army engaged in heavy artillery shelling in Hama and the Damascus suburbs. The clashes in Hama started after the rebels attacked government military checkpoints. According to opposition claims, after the military reportedly suffered four dead, the government troops started to shell residential areas, killing 30-37 civilians.Syria's Hama bears brunt as 90 killed Sunday, the sun dailySyrian bombardment of Hama kills 41: opposition , Chicago Tribune 51 people were reported killed by the end of the day, according to the LCC. =28 May= The Syrian army killed 28 people by the late afternoon, including 9 in Hama. At the same time, the conflict has started moving into the two largest cities (Damascus and Aleppo) that the government claimed was being dominated by the silent majority, which wanted stability, not government change. In both places there has been a revival of the protest movement in its peaceful dimension. Shopkeepers across the capital staged a general strike and in several Aleppo commercial districts mounted a similar but smaller protest. This has been interpreted by some as indicating that the historical alliance between the government and the business establishment in the large cities has become weak.Ivan Watson (12 June 2012) \\"Syria: Battle for the cities\\". CNN. =29 May= Another mass execution was discovered near the eastern city of Deir ez- Zor. The unidentified corpses of 13 men had been discovered shot to death execution-style. This incident raised awareness that the violence in Syria was heading towards an inexorable vicious cycle of tit-for-tat attacks between the different parties involved. According to the opposition, the 13 people who were shot at point blank range and later found in a field were employees at the electricity company in Deir Ezzor, who went on strike in protest of the massacres committed by the Syrian regime. They all had their hands tied behind their backs and were shot in the head according to a UN report. The head of a UN observer mission in Syria was ‚Äúdeeply disturbed‚Äù by the killings in Deir Ezzor, calling it an ‚Äúappalling and inexcusable act.‚Äù Several days later, the dead were identified to be military and the opposition than claimed they were army defectors killed by government forces. However, on 5 June, the jihadist group the Al-Nusra Front to Protect the Levant claimed responsibility for the killings, stating that they had captured and interrogated the soldiers in Deir al-Zor and \\"justly\\" punished them with death, after they confessed to crimes. =30 May= Early in the day 46 people were killed, including 10 in Douma, Damascus. The Free Syrian Army announced that they were giving president Bashar al-Assad a 48-hour deadline to abide by an international peace plan to end violence. \\"It ends on Friday at 1200 (0900 GMT) then we are free from any commitment and we will defend and protect the militants, their villages and their cities.\\", the FSA spokesperson is quoted saying. Syria's Consul General Hazem Chehabi of the Syrian American Council defected in California. He said that the Houla Massacre had been a tipping point and he could no longer support the \\"barbaric Syrian regime\\". Meanwhile, Syrian Army forces attacked Tadlu, Houla, the site of the Houla massacre days before. Machinegun fire was followed by shelling, forcing villagers to flee heavy shelling in fear of more carnage. =31 May= 61 people were killed, including 29 in Homs. An army sniper killed a boy in Taldou, Houla, where the Houla massacre took place. \\"Frightened residents of the area fled\\" for nearby towns, according to SOHR. June 2012 The first weekend of June witnessed the death of 80 security personnel throughout Syria. =1 June= Protesters took to the streets for weekly Friday protests with the largest protests occurring in Aleppo, Damascus, Hama, Homs, idlib, Daraa, and the Deir Ezzor province. 43 were killed, including 13 in the Damascus suburbs. 13 people were killed in another mass execution by the Syrian army in Qusayr.

Early life H√ºseyin √ñzer was born in 1949, in a village of Re≈üadiye town in Tokat Province in northern Turkey. His parents separated when he was very young. Unwanted by his parents, √ñzer was raised by his grandfather. Unable to attend primary school, he taught himself to read and write. Working in his village as a shepherd, √ñzer was sent at the age of eleven to Ankara to earn money, where he became a street kid. To learn English, he bought books. In 1967 he moved to Istanbul, where he found employment in restaurants as a dish washer. He continued to learn English, paying a tutor to teach him. Following his military service, H√ºseyin went to London in 1975 by bus, as he could not afford to fly there. There, he worked in a d√∂ner kebab shop in Mayfair and attended English courses in his spare time. Career √ñzer acquired the d√∂ner kebab shop he was working in, and turned it into a restaurant in 1981. His success paved the way for him to open more London restaurants, called \\"Sofra\\" (in Turkish dining table), in Covent Garden, Mayfair, Regent Street and St John's Wood. Each restaurant is unique. The menus consist of typical mezes, kebabs and desserts of Turkish cuisine. He has owned up to twenty caf√©s and restaurants in several locations in London. However, his current focus remains on the two fine dining restaurants. In addition to his restaurant business, chef √ñzer runs a catering service company. √ñzer has an estimated personal fortune of ¬£37 million, according to television programme, The World's Richest People. Social life Dedicated to education, √ñzer established a trust in Ankara in his early years, which turned into a foundation named \\"H√ºseyin √ñzer Education Foundation\\". In a partnership program with Middlesex University, he teaches students how to open and run successful restaurants. He has contributed to the Turkish-English Chamber of Commerce.

If a code has relative distance \\\\delta, then it is possible in principle to recover an encoded message when up to \\\\delta / 2 fraction of the codeword symbols are corrupted. But when error rate is greater than \\\\delta / 2 , this will not in general be possible. List decoding overcomes that issue by allowing the decoder to output a short list of messages that might have been encoded. List decoding can correct more than \\\\delta / 2 fraction of errors. There are many polynomial-time algorithms for list decoding. In this article, we first present an algorithm for Reed‚ÄìSolomon (RS) codes which corrects up to 1 - \\\\sqrt{2R} errors and is due to Madhu Sudan. Subsequently, we describe the improved Guruswami‚ÄìSudan list decoding algorithm, which can correct up to 1 - \\\\sqrt{R} errors. Here is a plot of the rate R and distance \\\\delta for different algorithms. https://wiki.cse.buffalo.edu/cse545/sites/wiki.cse.buffalo.edu.cse545/files/81/Graph.jpg  Algorithm 1 (Sudan's list decoding algorithm)  =Problem statement= Input : A field F; n distinct pairs of elements {(x_{i},y_{i})_{i=1}^n} in F \\\\times F; and integers d and t. Output: A list of all functions f: F \\\\to F satisfying f(x) is a polynomial in x of degree at most d To understand Sudan's Algorithm better, one may want to first know another algorithm which can be considered as the earlier version or the fundamental version of the algorithms for list decoding RS codes - the Berlekamp‚ÄìWelch algorithm. Welch and Berlekamp initially came with an algorithm which can solve the problem in polynomial time with best threshold on t to be t \\\\ge (n+d+1)/2. The mechanism of Sudan's Algorithm is almost the same as the algorithm of Berlekamp‚ÄìWelch Algorithm, except in the step 1, one wants to compute a bivariate polynomial of bounded (1, k) degree. Sudan's list decoding algorithm for Reed‚ÄìSolomon code which is an improvement on Berlekamp and Welch algorithm, can solve the problem with t = (\\\\sqrt{2nd}). This bound is better than the unique decoding bound 1 - \\\\left (\\\\frac{R} {2} \\\\right) for R < 0.07. =Algorithm= Definition 1 (weighted degree) For weights w_x,w_y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ , the (w_x,w_y) ‚Äì weighted degree of monomial q_{ij}x^i y^j is iw_x + jw_y. The (w_x,w_y) ‚Äì weighted degree of a polynomial Q(x,y) = \\\\sum_{ij} q_{ij}x^iy^j is the maximum, over the monomials with non-zero coefficients, of the (w_x,w_y) ‚Äì weighted degree of the monomial. For example, xy^2 has (1,3) -degree 7 Algorithm: Inputs: n,d,t; {(x_1,y_1)\\\\cdots(x_n,y_n)} /* Parameters l,m to be set later. */ Step 1: Find a non-zero bivariate polynomial Q : F^2 \\\\mapsto F satisfying * Q(x,y) has (1,d)-weighted degree at most D=m+ld * For every i \\\\in [n], Step 2. Factor Q into irreducible factors. Step 3. Output all the polynomials f such that (y- f(x)) is a factor of Q and f(x_i) = y_i for at least t values of i \\\\in [n] = Analysis = One has to prove that the above algorithm runs in polynomial time and outputs the correct result. That can be done by proving following set of claims. Claim 1: If a function Q : F^2 \\\\to F satisfying (2) exists, then one can find it in polynomial time. Proof: Note that a bivariate polynomial Q(x, y ) of (1, d)-weighted degree at most D can be uniquely written as Q(x,y) = \\\\sum_{j=0}^l \\\\sum_{k=0}^{m+(l-j)d} q_{kj} x^k y^j. Then one has to find the coefficients q_{kj} satisfying the constraints \\\\sum_{j=0}^l \\\\sum_{k=0}^{m+(l-j)d} q_{kj} x_i^k y_i^j = 0, for every i \\\\in [n]. This is a linear set of equations in the unknowns {q_{kj}}. One can find a solution using Gaussian elimination in polynomial time. Claim 2: If (m+1)(l+1)+d \\\\begin{pmatrix}l + 12\\\\end{pmatrix} > n then there exists a function Q(x,y) satisfying (2) Proof: To ensure a non zero solution exists, the number of coefficients in Q(x,y) should be greater than the number of constraints. Assume that the maximum degree deg_x(Q) of x in Q(x,y) is m and the maximum degree deg_y(Q) of y in Q(x,y) is l. Then the degree of Q(x,y) will be at most m+ld . One has to see that the linear system is homogenous. The setting q_{jk} = 0 satisfies all linear constraints. However this does not satisfy (2), since the solution can be identically zero. To ensure that a non-zero solution exists, one has to make sure that number of unknowns in the linear system to be (m+1)(l+1)+d \\\\begin{pmatrix}l + 12\\\\end{pmatrix} > n, so that one can have a non zero Q(x,y). Since this value is greater than n, there are more variables than constraints and therefore a non-zero solution exists. Claim 3: If Q(x,y) is a function satisfying (2) and f(x) is function satisfying (1) and t>m+ld, then (y-f(x)) divides Q(x,y) Proof: Consider a function p(x) = Q(x,f(x)). This is a polynomial in x, and argue that it has degree at most m+ld. Consider any monomial q_{jk}x^k y^j of Q(x). Since Q has (1,d)-weighted degree at most m+ld, one can say that k+jd \\\\le m+ld. Thus the term q_{kj}x^kf(x)^j is a polynomial in x of degree at most k+jd \\\\le m+ld. Thus p(x) has degree at most m+ld Next argue that p(x) is identically zero. Since Q(x_i,f(x_i)) is zero whenever y_i = f(x_i) , one can say that p(x_i) is zero for strictly greater than m+ld points. Thus p has more zeroes than its degree and hence is identically zero, implying Q(x,f(x)) \\\\equiv 0 Finding optimal values for m and l. Note that m+ld and (m+1)(l+1)+d \\\\begin{pmatrix}l + 12\\\\end{pmatrix} > n For a given value l, one can compute the smallest m for which the second condition holds By interchanging the second condition one can get m to be at most (n+1-d \\\\begin{pmatrix}l + 12\\\\end{pmatrix})/2 - 1 Substituting this value into first condition one can get t to be at least \\\\frac{n+1}{l+1} + \\\\frac{dl}{2} Next minimize the above equation of unknown parameter l. One can do that by taking derivative of the equation and equating that to zero By doing that one will get, l = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2(n+1)}{d}} -1 Substituting back the l value into m and t one will get m \\\\ge \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(n+1)d}{2}} - \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac {(n+1)d}{2}} + \\\\frac{d}{2} - 1 = \\\\frac{d}{2} -1 t > \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2(n+1)d^2}{d}} - \\\\frac {d}{2} -1 t > \\\\sqrt{2(n+1)d} - \\\\frac {d}{2} -1  Algorithm 2 (Guruswami‚ÄìSudan list decoding algorithm)  =Definition= Consider a (n,k) Reed‚ÄìSolomon code over the finite field \\\\mathbb{F} = GF(q) with evaluation set (\\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_n) and a positive integer r, the Guruswami-Sudan List Decoder accepts a vector \\\\beta = (\\\\beta_1,\\\\beta_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\beta_n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}^n as input, and outputs a list of polynomials of degree \\\\le k which are in 1 to 1 correspondence with codewords. The idea is to add more restrictions on the bi-variate polynomial Q(x,y) which results in the increment of constraints along with the number of roots. =Multiplicity= A bi-variate polynomial Q(x,y) has a zero of multiplicity r at (0,0) means that Q(x,y) has no term of degree \\\\le r, where the x-degree of f(x) is defined as the maximum degree of any x term in f(x) \\\\qquad deg_x f(x) = \\\\max_{i \\\\in I} \\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\} For example: Let Q(x,y) = y - 4x^2. https://wiki.cse.buffalo.edu/cse545/sites/wiki.cse.buffalo.edu.cse545/files/76/Fig1.jpg Hence, Q(x,y) has a zero of multiplicity 1 at (0,0). Let Q(x,y) = y + 6x^2. https://wiki.cse.buffalo.edu/cse545/sites/wiki.cse.buffalo.edu.cse545/files/76/Fig2.jpg Hence, Q(x,y) has a zero of multiplicity 1 at (0,0).

Similarly, if Q(x,y) = [(y - \\\\beta) - 4(x - \\\\alpha)^2)] [(y - \\\\beta) + 6(x - \\\\alpha)^2)] Then, Q(x,y) has a zero of multiplicity 2 at (\\\\alpha,\\\\beta).

Many of his most successful works were based on the sketches he drew during the time he spent in Egypt in 1831‚Äì1832. Early life He was born in Vertaizon. Encouraged by local artists, Marihat began painting at an early age. Although his parents wanted him to work in the cutlery business of Thiers, Puy-de-D√¥me where he lived, the Baron de Barante convinced them he was more suited to an artistic career. He went to Paris in 1829 where he studied under Camille Roqueplan, exhibiting for the first time at the Paris Salon in 1831 with his Site d'Auvergne.\\"Antoine-Georges-Prosper Marilhat (1811-1847)\\", Art Experts. Retrieved 1 May 2012. Career In May 1831, Marilhat was invited by Charles von H√ºgel to join him on a lengthy expedition but he only accompanied him as far as Alexandria. Over the following months, from October 1831 to May 1833, he completed ten albums of sketches there which would form the basis of his later paintings. In 1835, he travelled through Italy and spent 1836 in Provence. He exhibited in all the Paris Salons from 1837 to 1841 as well as at the Salon of 1844. While he specialized in architectural paintings and landscapes, he also painted portraits including one of his friend Th√©odore Chass√©riau which is now in the Louvre.\\"Prosper Marilhat (1811 - 1847)\\", Museumnetwork.org. Retrieved 1 May 2012. Prosper Marilhat: Place de l‚ÄôEsbekieh au Caire From 1840 to 1844, Marilhat painted a number of works inspired by his travels including Ruines de la mosqu√©e El-Hakem au Caire, said to have captured the monumentality of the ruins and the romanticism of the location. Theophile Gautier was deeply moved by his Place de l‚ÄôEsbekieh au Caire, remarking: \\"On seeing this painting, I became sick at heart, and yearned for the Orient, in which I had not yet set foot.\\" At the Salon of 1844, his Souvenir des bords du Nil was praised, as was Arabes syriens en voyage, now in the Mus√©e Cond√©, Chantilly. Marilhat's work falls into three periods: his early traditional landscapes and portraits, the drawings and sketches during his travels to the Orient, and his paintings after 1838 which, in addition to his well-received oriental works also included mythological subjects. Suffering from syphilis, Prosper Marilhat became insane and died in a Paris asylum in September 1847, only 36 years old.

He was noted for his loyalty to Richard III, under whose command he fought at the Battle of Bosworth, where Richard was killed. Under the victorious Tudor dynasty he suffered attainder and forfeiture of his property, but he was eventually restored to royal favour, due partly to a marriage connection to the new King's mother. Background John la Zouche was the son of William la Zouche, 6th Baron Zouche and his first wife, Katherine Lenthall, daughter of Sir Rowland Lenthall, Sheriff of Herefordshire and his wife Lucy Grey, daughter of the 4th Baron Grey of Codnor. His father had inherited the barony of St Maur through his mother Alice St Maur, first wife of William la Zouche, 5th Baron Zouche (c. 1402 ‚Äì 1462), and daughter of Sir Richard St. Maur (died 6 January 1409) by Mary Pever, the daughter of Thomas Pever (died 22 September 1429). After the death of Alice St Maur, the 5th Baron married Elizabeth St. John, whose half-sister was Margaret Beaufort, mother of the future Henry VII, a connection which later proved to be of great value to his grandson. Zouche's mother seems to have died soon after his birth; his father died when he was nine. His stepmother, Katherine Plumpton, remarried Sir Gilbert Debenham, a Suffolk landowner who acquired considerable influence at the Court of Edward IV. Other family connections strengthened the tie to the House of York: Elizabeth, Lady Zouche, after the 5th Baron's death, remarried John Scrope, 5th Baron Scrope of Bolton, who was to be a strong supporter of Richard III. John's sister Margaret married Sir William Catesby, who was to be one of the mainstays of Richard's government. His career under Richard III During Richard's brief reign Zouche became a leading political figure. His family's influence in Northamptonshire was useful to the King, who otherwise relied mainly on the Yorkshire nobility for his political support. Zouche in turn sought to expand his influence in Cornwall, and also in Devonshire, where his wife's family, the Dynhams, were major landholders who had gained considerable political power under Edward IV. Zouche's political career was destroyed at the Battle of Bosworth. Being staunchly loyal to Richard, he fought for him in the battle, and was captured by the victorious Tudor army either during it or shortly afterwards. Unlike his brother-in-law Sir William Catesby, who was considered to be such a danger to the new regime that he was executed summarily, Zouche's life was spared. Attainder He was attainted by Henry VII's first Parliament (November‚ÄìDecember 1485), and suffered the forfeiture of all his lands. He was pardoned in July 1486 and given a small annuity, but the attainder was not reversed even in part until 1489, and even then he was permitted only to inherit the property his grandfather had received through his second marriage. It has been suggested that Henry's treatment of him was exceptionally severe, perhaps reflecting his position of power under Richard III. On the other hand Henry VII strove throughout his reign to discipline the nobility by imposing on them severe financial penalties, often on the flimsiest of pretexts, to such an extent that in the last years of his reign the nobility have been described as living in a perpetual atmosphere of \\"watchfulness, fear and suspicion\\". Zouche attempted to gain favour with the King by serving in the French campaign of 1492, but without success. His financial situation continued to suffer: his position was considered insufficient to allow him to maintain the status of a nobleman and he suffered the humiliation of being styled a mere knight. Restoration of titles and dignities He was eventually restored to all his titles and dignities in 1495. He owed a good deal of thanks for this to the prominent courtier Sir Reginald Bray, for whose support he had to pay a heavy price, selling him several manors at an undervalue. A more surprising ally was Margaret Beaufort, the King's mother, who throughout her life showed a warm affection for all of her extended family, and especially the St. Johns of Lydiard Tregoze; so that even Lord Zouche, who was merely the grandson of her sister's husband by a previous marriage, benefited from her generosity. She probably used her influence to have the attainder reversed; she certainly obtained a pension for Lady Zouche, and had some of the Zouche children brought up in her own household. Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of King Henry VII, later a surprising ally of Lord Zouche, who was a distant relative by marriage. By 1500 Zouche was in fairly good standing at Court: he was part of the entourage which accompanied the King to meet Archduke Philip of Austria at Calais, and the following year he was one of the nobles who greeted Catherine of Aragon on her arrival at Amesbury. His later years were uneventful; he died at Castle Cary in March 1526. Marriage and children He married Joan Dinham, a daughter of Sir John Dinham (1406‚Äì1458) of Hartland and of Nutwell both in Devon, by his wife Joan Arches, sister and heiress of John Arches and daughter of Sir Richard Arches (died 1417), MP for Buckinghamshire in 1402, of Eythrope and Cranwell (both in the parish of Waddesdon) and Little Kimble, Buckinghamshire. She was one of the four surviving sisters and co-heiresses of her brother John Dynham, 1st Baron Dynham (1433‚Äì1501), KG. By his wife he had at least six children, including: *John Zouche, 8th Baron Zouche (died 1551), eldest son and heir. *William Zouche of Bulwick, Northamptonshire, who married Jane Bradborne, and had at least one daughter, Frances Zouche, who married William Saunders: they were ancestors of the Dukes of Buckingham *Jane Zouche, who married Sir Edward Hungerford (died 1522) and was the mother of Walter Hungerford, 1st Baron Hungerford of Heytesbury (1503‚Äì1540). *Katherine Zouche, who married firstly John Carew (d.1528)Prince, John, (1643‚Äì1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, London, p.167, note of Haccombe in Devon, and secondly Sir Robert Brandon, an uncle of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk.Vivian, Lt.Col.

In 1933, he was appointed to the inaugural board of the Tennessee Valley Authority, with which he remained until 1948, including three years (1938‚Äì1941) as chairman. In both capacities, he promoted a philosophy known as \\"the common mooring,\\" which stressed a harmonious relationship between man and the environment, and consistently worked to introduce more efficient and less destructive farming techniques in the Tennessee Valley.Milton Klein, \\"John Harcourt Alexander Morgan,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 1 May 2012. Early life Morgan was born in 1867 and raised by his parents Rebecca (n√©e Truman) and John Morgan on a farm near Kerwood in Adelaide Township, Ontario. He attended the University of Toronto's Ontario Agricultural College, earning his Bachelor of Science in 1889. He briefly attended Cornell University and conducted research at the Marine Biological Laboratory before accepting a position as professor of entomology at Louisiana State University.Milton Klein, \\"'The State is the University's Campus:' Harcourt A. Morgan, Thirteenth President of UT .\\" University of Tennessee website. Retrieved: 1 May 2012. At LSU, Morgan studied two parasitical insects, the cattle tick and the cotton boll weevil, both of which had proven destructive to farmers in the state. Camping out in pastures and cotton fields, Morgan collected invaluable data on the habits of both insects that finally enabled scientists to get their populations under control. But the boll weevil infested cotton crops throughout the South in the early 20th century, causing much destruction and costing countless agricultural jobs.Jack Neely, \\"The Common Mooring,\\" Tennessee Valley Authority website. Retrieved: 1 May 2012. Morgan's role in fighting the cattle tick and boll weevil infestations endeared him to many of the state's farmers and gained the respect of regional agricultural experts. Marriage and family After getting established in teaching and research, Morgan married Sara Elizabeth Fay. They had four children together: Harcourt Jr.; John, Fay, and Lucy. University of Tennessee In 1904, the University of Tennessee hired Tulane professor Brown Ayres as president. While living in Louisiana, Ayres had become familiar with Morgan's work, and invited him to join U.T.'s faculty as professor of entomology and zoology, and director of the school's agricultural experimental station. In 1913, Morgan was named Dean of the school's College of Agriculture. Morgan shared Ayres' view that the university's extension services were as important as the school's teaching mission, as they believed that many of the South's agricultural problems were due to lack of information among the region's farmers. Morgan (far left) at the Tennessee State Capitol in 1921, with Governor Alfred A. Taylor (center), state senate speaker William Bond (left of center), state house speaker Andrew Todd (right of center), and Judge Edward Terry Sanford (far right) During this period, Morgan developed a philosophy known as \\"the common mooring,\\" which stressed a harmonious relationship between man and the environment, and taught that human endeavors should align with the demands of nature.Sarah T. Phillips, This Land, This Nation: Conservation, Rural America, and the New Deal (2007), pp. 90‚Äì91. Morgan believed that the South's overemphasis on commodity row crops such as cotton and tobacco, which were harmful to the soil, threw this relationship out of balance. He held numerous demonstrations and exhibits that encouraged area farmers to practice crop rotation, replace row crops with soil-enriching grasses, clovers, and legumes, avoid planting corn on hill slopes (a practice in which many East Tennessee mountain farmers were adept), and improve eroded pastures with lime and phosphate. Morgan's extension work earned him the trust of Tennessee's farmers, which in turn brought influence among the state's politicians. This proved critical at a time when the state's three Grand Divisions still harbored Civil War-era animosities. Many state politicians disliked the idea that East Tennessee, which had been sympathetic to the Union, was the site of the state's land-grant institution. In 1915, Morgan convinced Governor Tom Rye to approve a one million dollar appropriation for the university. During World War I, Morgan was appointed as the state of Tennessee's Food Administrator. After being selected as U.T.'s president following Ayres' death in 1919, Morgan managed to convince Governor Austin Peay to appropriate several million dollars for the university, which Morgan used to expand the school. During Morgan's presidency, the student population quadrupled, and several new buildings were constructed, including Ayres Hall and many of the buildings on \\"The Hill,\\" as well as Shields-Watkins Field, the forerunner of Neyland Stadium. As the university became more reliant on state appropriations, Morgan grew wary of agitating state legislators. In 1923, a controversy known as the \\"Slaughter of the Ph.Ds\\" erupted when Morgan allowed the dismissal of seven faculty members whom administrators considered to be \\"troublemakers\\".William Bruce Wheeler, Knoxville, Tennessee: A Mountain City in the New South (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2005), p. 54. The dismissal of eccentric law professor John R. Neal sparked an outcry among law school alumni, and Morgan was forced to defend the university's actions before Governor Peay and the Board of Trustees.Bobby Hicks, \\"The Great Objector: The Life and Career of Dr. John Randolph Neal,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 41 (1969), pp. 40‚Äì42. When the state passed the Butler Act barring the teaching of the theory of evolution in 1925, many of the state's university leaders opposed the bill and looked to Morgan and U.T. for leadership. In spite of reservations about the law, however, Morgan did not speak out about the issue. In 1927 Morgan served as president of the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges. He served as president of the university until 1934, following his appointment to the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Tennessee Valley Authority In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Morgan to the inaugural board of the newly formed Tennessee Valley Authority, along with Arthur E. Morgan (no relation), a civil engineer and educator, as Chairman, and David Lilienthal, an attorney and public administrator in public utility law. Chosen for his agricultural expertise and familiarity with the region's people, Harcourt Morgan considered TVA's unified approach to agricultural and resource development to be the ultimate opportunity to implement his \\"common mooring\\" ideas.Richard Colignon, Power Plays: Critical Events in the Institutionalization of the Tennessee Valley Authority (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1997), pp. 119‚Äì120. In TVA's early years, he would provide a critical connection between the agency and the often suspicious local population. Morgan testifying before the TVA Joint Congressional Committee in May 1938 From the outset, Harcourt Morgan and Lilienthal found themselves at odds with the chairman, Arthur Morgan. Whereas the chairman sought to work directly with farmers, Harcourt Morgan insisted on working through the extension services of state agencies and land grant colleges, to make the best use of existing networks. The chairman also sought to work with private power companies operating in the valley, whereas Lilienthal supported public control of the valley's power resources. Lilienthal and Harcourt Morgan consistently voted down the chairman's initiatives, leading the chairman to accuse them of dishonesty and fraud. In March 1938, President Roosevelt summoned the three to Washington to discuss their issues. When the chairman was unable to give specific examples of dishonesty on the part of his two fellow directors, he was removed. A subsequent congressional investigation also cleared Harcourt Morgan and Lilienthal of any wrongdoing.Erwin Hargrove and Paul Conkin, TVA: Fifty Years of Grass-Roots Bureacracy (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1983), pp. 45, 95‚Äì98. After Arthur Morgan's removal, Harcourt Morgan was appointed as chairman. Preferring to focus on his agricultural initiatives, he delegated most of his chairmanship duties to Lilienthal. Morgan consistently argued in favor of the region's farming interests. In 1938, he briefly clashed with conservationist Gifford Pinchot, who believed Morgan was neglecting TVA's forestry initiatives in favor of agricultural interests. Morgan opposed the Douglas Dam project because it would inundate some of the state's best farmland, and had similar reservations about the Fort Loudoun Dam project.Walter Creese, TVA's Public Planning: The Vision, the Reality (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1990), pp. 156, 206, 272. Morgan served as chairman until 1941, and remained on the board as a director until 1948. Lilienthal later wrote that he and Harcourt Morgan's personalities complemented one another, stating that Morgan was instrumental in getting the conservative local population to accept the agency's progressive initiatives, while Lilienthal in turn dealt with many of the agency's critics in Washington. Morgan was unimpressed with his colleague's book about the TVA, Democracy on the March, concluding that Lilienthal apparently never understood his \\"common mooring\\" philosophy. Death and legacy After retiring from TVA, Morgan, then in his 80s, continued to tour the state and lecture on his common mooring philosophy. He died on August 25, 1950, and is buried in Knoxville's Greenwood Cemetery. *Morgan was awarded an honorary doctorate from Emory and Henry College. *The Progressive Farmer named him \\"Man of the Year\\" in 1940. *Morgan Hall, the main building of the University of Tennessee's College of Agriculture, is named for him.

The animal is able to identify subtle genetic distinctions in odor, and this behavior enables an animal to distinguish between kin and non-kin. The theory was proposed by Richard Dawkins who hypothesized that it would be advantageous to an animal to be able to recognize its kin in this way so as to increase its fitness and reproductive success, an example being a mother's ability to feed her own offspring rather than those of another individual. To test whether the hypothesis was true, experiments were performed on ground squirrels, cowbirds and golden hamsters. It was found that juvenile Belding's ground squirrels behaved differently when presented with plastic cubes rubbed with secretions from their relatives as compared to non-kin secretions. An experiment with chicks of brown-headed cowbirds provided evidence of self-referent phenotype matching, but in this case, a visual cue was used rather than an olfactory one. An experiment using young golden hamsters showed that they could recognise kin from non-kin even when, as infants, they had been removed from their mother at birth and reared by an unrelated female. In general, the armpit effect seems to exist and to be beneficial to the species concerned because it lessens the chance of inbreeding. Background The armpit effect is a form of ontogenic recognition, wherein an animal uses its own or another animal‚Äôs physical characteristics for recognition purposes. Under this behavior model, an animal uses its own scent to distinguish between kin and non-kin. The odors that an animal uses to compare itself to its counterparts are caused by differences in genetics. Although the scent glands that produce an animal's odor are structurally similar, these genetic differences cause different odors to be released. An animal's ability to identify subtle genetic distinctions based on unique scents is facilitated by the olfactory system in the brain. The armpit effect is crucial for an animal to increase its fitness (biology) and reproductive success. Origin The ability of an animal to recognize its kin can be the difference between life and death for a mother‚Äôs children. If she recognizes her children properly, she will give her children food and avoid feeding non-familial children. Richard Dawkins hypothesized that an animal had the ability to recognize kin and non-kin based on its own scent and defined this phenomenon as the ‚Äòarmpit effect.‚Äô In an effort to find evidence for the ‚Äòarmpit effect,‚Äô Warren G. Holmes and Paul W. Sherman conducted a three-year study on two species of squirrels: Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus peryii) and Belding's ground squirrels (Spermophilus belding). Examples =Belding‚Äôs ground squirrels= An experiment was done where the offspring of captive female Belding‚Äôs ground squirrels were switched at birth. This created four classes of individuals: where siblings were reared apart, where siblings were reared together, where nonsiblings were reared apart, and where nonsiblings were reared together. After these offspring grew, the juvenile ground squirrels were placed in an arena in pairs and their interactions were observed. In most cases, animals that were raised together, if they were related or not, tolerated each other more. On the other hand, animals that were raised apart were observed to act aggressively to each other. However, biological sisters that were raised apart were observed to be in fewer aggressive interactions than nonsiblings reared apart. It was noted Belding‚Äôs ground squirrels have scent-producing glands by Jill Mateo. It was also noted that because of these glands, squirrels sniff the oral glands of other squirrels to acquire information and how the scents compare to the sniffers‚Äô own scent. In another experiment, Mateo captured pregnant ground squirrels and moved them to laboratory enclosures. The juvenile offspring of the squirrels were observed investigating plastic cubes that had been rubbed on the dorsal glands of squirrels that were related to the youngsters in different ways (mother, grandmother, etc.). The juveniles had never met, and thus, had no prior experience with their relatives. However, if the juveniles knew what they smelled like themselves, then they should be able to accurately compare their own scents with nonrelatives and relatives. The length of time a Belding‚Äôs ground squirrel sniffed an object indicated its interest, and the results of the experiment showed that cubes that have been rubbed on relatives received a quick inspection. On the other hand, cubes that have been rubbed on nonrelatives received a longer inspection. =Cowbirds= In a set of creative experiments, the scientists dyed the feathers of 14 nestlings over a three- year period, using a nontoxic, permanent, black sharpie. The control nestlings had gray feathers which remained unchanged. The nestlings were then removed from the nests of song sparrows and eastern phoebes shortly after hatching and raised separately in visual isolation from all birds. The nestlings were then introduced to two adult female cowbirds, one which was painted, and one that was normal, before they molted. These introductions to the two cowbirds were the nestlings‚Äô first visual encounter with other birds. It was observed noticed that as the trials progressed, the cowbird nestlings‚Äô exhibited more and more ‚Äúbirdlike‚Äù behavior. It was noted that, as the birds became more social with each other, the painted young cowbirds approached the painted adults much more than they approached the non-painted birds. The cowbird nestlings showed the ability to inspect themselves, memorize certain characteristics and traits and seek out individuals showing those same characteristics to be social partners. This study was considered to be ‚Äúthe first evidence of self-referent phenotype matching through experimental manipulation of a recognition cue.‚Äù ‚Äúthe armpit of the avian world‚Äù article by Rebecca Sloan Slotnick. =Golden hamsters= In an experiment, newborn laboratory hamsters were separated from their mothers and siblings and placed them in the care of unrelated mothers and in the company of unrelated young hamsters. After seven weeks, female juvenile hamsters were presented a choice of flank-gland scents from a number of unrelated and related hamsters. In these seven weeks, these female hamsters were at a time when they would be choosing a mate, and thus, in nature, they would usually choose a mate that was unrelated to them. In the experiments, the female hamsters consistently chose unrelated strangers for a mate over unfamiliar siblings and foster siblings. Jill Mateo commented that the results were ‚Äúremarkable‚Äù as the armpit effect was seen in a group of laboratory animals that were highly inbred and thus had very similar genetic makeup. However, the group still had enough genetic difference between individual hamsters to produce different scents. Mateo said ‚ÄúWe never saw them sniffing themselves, but they certainly know what they smell like. Because of the way we structured this experiment, there is no other way they could have known the scent of their family. Any time you need to discriminate accurately among kind, this is the way to do it.‚Äù Advantages and disadvantages There are several advantages associated with the armpit effect. The first advantage is that it prevents inbreeding. Inbreeding could cause many problems such as infertility and an increased chance of recessive traits being passed on. Another advantage is that it ensures that one is providing food and resources to family members. On the other hand, there are disadvantages to the armpit effect. One disadvantage is that if the olfactory receptors are damaged, another animal or non-relative could be identified as a relative and it could cause harm to the individual.

Written by Ali Adler and directed by Eric Stoltz, the episode is the second of two new episodes that aired back-to-back on Fox in the United States on May 15, 2012. It features New Directions facing off against Vocal Adrenaline at the Nationals show choir competition in Chicago, and several special guest stars: Whoopi Goldberg as NYADA dean Carmen Tibideaux, Jonathan Groff as Vocal Adrenaline director Jesse St. James, Lindsay Lohan as herself judging the competition and Rex Lee playing a Chicago alderman who is another of the judges. The episode received mostly positive reviews, both in general and for the musical performances in particular. While reviewers were not impressed with the judging scene and highly critical of the inclusion of Emma and Will's having sex for the first time as part of the post-victory sequence, the overall quality was lauded by many. The musical numbers were widely praised, and although some critics felt that Vocal Adrenaline gave better performances than New Directions, the three main competition soloists‚ÄîRachel (Lea Michele), Finn (Cory Monteith) and Unique (Alex Newell)‚Äîwere especially singled out for encomiums. However, none of the episode's seven songs charted on the Billboard Hot 100, though two of the New Directions competition songs, Rachel's \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\" and the group number featuring Finn and her, \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\", did chart on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 6.03 million American viewers and received a 2.5/7 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The total viewership was down slightly from \\"Props\\" in the previous hour, and more significantly down from \\"Prom-asaurus\\" the week before. Plot The New Directions glee club is in Chicago for the national show choir competition, but Mercedes (Amber Riley) is sick in her hotel bed with a bad fever and stomach pains, possibly due to food poisoning. Will (Matthew Morrison) drafts Quinn (Dianna Agron) and Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) into the Troubletones number to add vocal heft with Mercedes sidelined, and Sue (Jane Lynch) starts medical measures to restore her to health. During final rehearsals, fights break out among the New Directions members, but are easily resolved because the intensity of their focus is on winning. On the day of the show, Rachel (Lea Michele) is accosted by Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), her former boyfriend and current director of rival show choir Vocal Adrenaline. Jesse tries to hurt her confidence by bringing up her failed NYADA audition before Carmen Tibideaux (Whoopi Goldberg), but she realizes his intent and that his own uncertainty is showing. The Nationals judges are introduced: Lindsay Lohan, Perez Hilton, and Chicago alderman Martin Fong (Rex Lee). New Directions is the first group to compete, and Mercedes arrives just in time to go onstage with the group, healthy again thanks to Sue. The Troubletones lead off with \\"The Edge of Glory\\". Rachel then performs \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\". Carmen arrives during the number, for which Rachel receives a standing ovation. The finale is \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\", which also brings the audience to its feet, and gets an approving whistle from Carmen. Later, in the lobby, Jesse approaches Carmen and recommends Rachel for NYADA. Mercedes and Kurt go to the Vocal Adrenaline dressing room to wish lead singer Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell) good luck, but he tells them that he that he has chosen not to perform because he can no longer take the pressure of his new celebrity status. Kurt suggests that Unique, Wade's transgender alter ego, might be able to handle what Wade is unable to, and the teen starts to get ready. On stage, Unique and Vocal Adrenaline perform \\"Starships\\" and \\"Pinball Wizard\\". The judges name Unique the Nationals MVP, but they award the Nationals trophy to New Directions, with Vocal Adrenaline in second place. Back at McKinley, the glee club members are treated as heroes by the school. Sue is restored as sole coach of the Cheerios, displacing co-coach Roz Washington (NeNe Leakes). At their apartment, Emma (Jayma Mays) and Will have sex for the first time. Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) arranges with Finn and Rachel for New Directions to perform the next night at the Teacher of the Year ceremony, which is won by Will. The group congratulates Will and performs \\"We Are the Champions\\". Production The episode was written by co-executive producer Ali Adler and directed by Eric Stoltz. Shooting of the episode had begun by April 18, 2012, and continued at least through April 27, 2012; the final episode of the season began filming the following Monday, April 30, 2012. The final day of shooting the Nationals competition scenes, April 26, 2012, was also the day that the show celebrated filming its 400th musical performance. The New Directions portion of the competition includes three songs: Lady Gaga's \\"The Edge of Glory\\" performed by the Troubletones, Celine Dion's \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\" sung by Michele, and a group performance of Meat Loaf's \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\" with Monteith and Michele as primary leads. These three songs were released as singles for digital download, along with an additional four from the episode: Nicki Minaj's \\"Starships\\" and The Who's \\"Pinball Wizard\\", both performed by Newell with Vocal Adrenaline, as well as Queen's \\"We Are the Champions\\" performed by New Directions featuring Monteith, Michele, Agron, Colfer, Naya Rivera and Mark Salling, and Grouplove's \\"Tongue Tied\\", also by New Directions. \\"The Edge of Glory\\" and \\"We Are the Champions\\" are also featured on the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, The Graduation Album, with the former song retitled \\"Edge of Glory\\" in both single and album releases. Special guest stars include Goldberg as NYADA dean Carmen Tibideaux, Groff as Vocal Adrenaline director Jesse St. James, and actress Lindsay Lohan and gossip columnist Perez Hilton as themselves, in the role of celebrity judges for the competition. Rex Lee plays Alderman Martin Fong, another judge. Recurring guest stars appearing in the episode include glee club members Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), Rory Flanagan (Damian McGinty), Joe Hart (Samuel Larsen) and Sugar Motta (Vanessa Lengies), Principal Figgins (Theba), football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones), cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), synchronized swimming coach Roz Washington (Leakes), retiring teacher Mrs. Hagberg (Mary Gillis) and Vocal Adrenaline transgender lead vocalist Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Newell). Reception =Ratings= \\"Nationals\\" was first broadcast on May 15, 2012 in the United States on Fox, as the second hour in a two-hour special evening with \\"Props\\" having aired in the first hour at the show's regular broadcast time. It received a 2.5/7 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and attracted 6.03 million American viewers during its initial broadcast, slightly lower than the 2.5/8 rating/share and 6.09 million viewers during \\"Props\\" in the hour before, but a significant decrease from the 2.7/8 rating/share and 6.67 million viewers of the previous week's episode, \\"Prom-asaurus\\", which was broadcast on May 8, 2012.US viewership data: *\\"Nationals\\" and \\"Props\\": *\\"Prom- asaurus\\": In Canada, which also aired the episode as the second hour of a two-episode special on the same day as its American premiere, viewership rose significantly, by over 16% to 1.56 million viewers from the 1.34 million viewers for the first hour. \\"Nationals\\" was the tenth most-viewed show of the week as compared to \\"Props\\", which had been fourteenth most-viewed. \\"Nationals\\" viewership was still down by over 5% from the 1.65 million viewers who watched \\"Prom-asaurus\\" the week before.Canadian viewership data: *\\"Props\\"/\\"Nationals\\": *\\"Prom-asaurus\\": Although the United Kingdom also aired these two episodes together, \\"Nationals\\" aired in the show's regular time slot, while \\"Props\\" aired an hour earlier than usual. Viewership fell in the second hour, though it remained higher than the previous week. \\"Nationals\\" first aired on May 17, 2012, and was watched on Sky 1 by 776,000 viewers. This was down slightly from the 795,000 viewers in the earlier hour, but was an increase of over 4% from the previous week's episode, \\"Prom-asaurus\\", which attracted 744,000 viewers.UK viewership data: *\\"Props\\"/\\"Nationals\\": *\\"Prom- asaurus\\": In Australia, \\"Nationals\\" was broadcast on May 24, 2012, a week after \\"Props\\" aired, rather than on the same night as in the other three. It was watched by 618,000 viewers, up slightly from the 607,000 viewers for \\"Props\\" on May 17, 2012. Glee was the seventeenth most-watched program of the night for the second week in a row.Australian viewership data: *\\"Nationals\\": *\\"Props\\": =Critical reception= The episode was given positive reviews by most critics. Michael Slezak of TVLine described it as a \\"spectacular hour of jaw-dropping musical numbers and satisfying plot developments\\", and The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff called it \\"one of the finest episodes the show's ever done and perhaps the best it's done since the season one finale\\". She gave it an \\"A\\" grade. Jeff Dodge of BuddyTV said that episode gave \\"quality to go along with some great music\\", and Entertainment Weekly Erin Strecker wrote that the evening's two episodes were a \\"return to form for the show\\". Rae Votta of Billboard, on the other hand, said that by having \\"Props\\" and \\"Nationals\\" air back to back, \\"they both lose their individual potent high points and come out blander than they deserve\\", and characterized \\"Nationals\\" as \\"jarring and strange\\". Both Huffington Post Crystal Bell and Washington Post Jen Chaney wanted to \\"be honest\\" about Vocal Adrenaline vs. New Directions in the competition: Bell said that Vocal Adrenaline \\"put on the better show\\" and Chaney wrote that they were \\"better than New Directions\\": \\"their dance moves were sharper and more in sync, and Unique's Minaj-esque magnetism factor sold the whole thing\\". VanDerWerff wrote that he \\"could quibble that Vocal Adrenaline had stronger choreography overall\\" or that he \\"found Unique a more engaging performer than Rachel\\", but that as \\"New Directions also used its whole ensemble better than Vocal Adrenaline did\\", he felt that \\"either outcome seemed reasonable\\". Dodge simply stated, \\"We all knew that New Directions would win and they'd get their happily ever after, but it was exciting to see it finally all play out.\\" Bell wrote that \\"seeing the judges debate behind-the-scenes kind of takes away the entire title\\", though she appreciated Lohan's Freaky Friday reference. VanDerWerff said that the judging scene \\"wasn't very good\\", and Votta described it as \\"mostly waste[d]\\". Futterman wrote that there was \\"not really any emotion\\" in Lohan's lines, though Strecker thought that the \\"lines they gave her were pretty funny‚Äîif not a bit sad\\". Reviewers were critical of what Votta called \\"a really regrettable sequence where Emma leaves a pamphlet about losing her virginity on Schue's desk and then they finally have sex\\". Bell characterized it as \\"weird and uncomfortable, and the reasoning was horrendously misogynistic\\", and VanDerWerff thought that making it part of the post- Nationals victory montage as \\"a little too creepy, at best\\". Votta thought that though the victory segment \\"should feel joyous\\", it instead feels \\"awkward and emotion-less\\". Will's being awarded \\"Teacher of the Year\\" was called \\"surprising\\" by Strecker, who hearkened back to him having \\"discovered that he wasn't so good\\" at teaching Spanish \\"a few months ago\\". Bell asked how it was \\"possible\\" for Quinn to so rapidly recover her ability to walk and then dance, something also touched on by VanDerWerff, who was again critical of \\"Fox's rampant abuse of the Twitter hashtag thing\\" by displaying onscreen hashtags during the episode. Strecker praised Jesse's scenes, and said she \\"couldn't stop cracking up\\". =Music and performances= As with the episode, the musical performances were mostly received with enthusiasm by reviewers. VanDerWerff wrote that the \\"big performances\\" were \\"all aces\\". Of the seven songs, the one that received the fewest comments was \\"Tongue Tied\\", which Strecker described as \\"montage music\\" and graded a \\"B\\". As Chaney noted, it \\"wasn't a number so much as a musical celebration of New Directions' championship status\\", but it nevertheless received an \\"A‚àí\\" grade from her and from Slezak. Rolling Stone Erica Futterman called it a \\"spirited take on Grouplove\\". Of all the songs performed in competition, \\"The Edge of Glory\\" was given the most mixed reception. Chaney gave the song a \\"C\\" grade, and said that while it \\"started strong\\" the energy level was \\"lacking\\", a word that Futterman used to describe the performance as a whole, to which she added \\"emotionless and rushed\\". A diametric view of the song was evident in the \\"A‚àí\\" grades given by both Slezak and Strecker, and the latter also complimented the \\"different\\" arrangement while both were enthusiastic about the entire set of three songs: Slezak said New Directions \\"completely killed it\\", and Strecker said this song \\"kicked off what was a truly an all-time great performance\\". That performance continued with \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\", which was widely praised. Dodge said that it, like the prior song, was \\"covered to perfection\\". Although Chaney said she hated that song, she wrote that Michele hit it \\"out of the park\\" and gave it an \\"A\\", the same grade Strecker gave with the encomium \\"outstanding\\", and added that she then \\"rewatched three times\\". An \\"A\\" was not sufficient for Slezak, who declared that it was \\"one of Glee's five best vocals ever\\" and gave it an \\"A+\\". Futterman \\"loved\\" the song except for its ending, which she described as \\"an abrupt cliffhanger\\". The New Directions set closed with \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\". While a number of reviewers, including Chaney and Dodge, questioned the choice of the song for a variety of reasons, they expressed enthusiasm with the final result. Jyll Saskin of MTV called it a \\"quirky yet catchy song choice\\" that \\"was the episode's standout\\", and both Slezak and Strecker gave it an \\"A\\" grade; the latter said it was the \\"real group number\\" of the three and added, \\"The vocals, choreography and energy were all top-notch.\\" Chaney's grade of \\"A‚àí\\" came with the declaration that \\"this may have been Finn at his absolute best\\" and Futterman said he did \\"a surprisingly decent Meatloaf\\"; Futterman added that the \\"already theatrical song is somehow made better by the show choir arrangement\\". VanDerWerff described it as \\"one of the better New Directions group performances\\". The two Vocal Adrenaline performances were generally very well received; as noted above, Bell and Chaney used very similar words to explain why they thought Vocal Adrenaline was \\"better\\" than New Directions. \\"Starships\\", the first number, was also the more praised of the two: Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said that it \\"stole the show\\" for him, and was the best musical number of the night. Flandez called it \\"an electric and sassy delivery\\" by Unique, and Strecker asked \\"is there anything she can't do\\" before she gave the performance an \\"A‚àí\\". Futterman thought it felt \\"more subdued than the warp-speed of Minaj's hit\\" though she added that the \\"stage acrobatics trump everything anyone else does\\", and Saskin said it \\"was fun to watch, but the vocals don't add much to the original version\\". Slezak gave it an \\"A\\" grade and praised the \\"dazzling\\" choreography of both numbers. \\"Pinball Wizard\\" was called \\"turbo-charged from beginning to end\\" by Flandez, and both Strecker and Slezak gave the song a \\"B+\\" grade; the former's enthusiasm was tempered by the arrangement, which was not very \\"different from just karaoke of the original\\", and the dancing on the pinball machines as \\"a bit much for my taste\\". Futterman said that Unique \\"riffs the hell out the song\\", but added that \\"the robot dancers of Vocal Adrenaline make it hard to glean any personality from the performance\\". Dodge wrote, \\"This one I'm liking even less than the first\\", but Saskin said, \\"Mercedes needs to watch out, because Unique sure can belt it out!\\" The episode's closing number, \\"We Are the Champions\\", received excellent grades: A from Slezak and Chaney, and an \\"A‚àí\\" from Strecker. Saskin wrote that it was \\"a new Glee classic\\", and Chaney said it \\"worked wonderfully as an assertion of the New Directions' championship status\\". Futterman described the performance as \\"rife with emotion\\" and added, \\"It's moments like this that are pure and straight to the show's original appeal\\", while Strecker complimented the song choice and how \\"it really showcased the group's harmonies\\". In December 2012, TV Guide listed the rendition as one of Glee best performances. =Chart history= Two of the seven singles released for the episode charted on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100: \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\", which debuted at number seventy-five, and \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\\", which debuted at number ninety-four. Neither song charted on the US Billboard Hot 100, but two other singles from the episode affected the charting there of songs by the original artists. \\"Tongue Tied\\" sold 22,000 copies in the Glee version, and did well enough in the Grouplove original to re-enter the Billboard Hot 100 at number seventy- four, close to the song's previous chart high of sixty-nine, while \\"Starships\\" sold 18,000 in the Glee version and 174,000 in the Nicki Minaj original, which moved from six to five on the Hot 100, matching its highest chart position to date. \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\" charted at number one at the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles on June 2, 2012.

Normally, the pressure within the pleural cavity is slightly less than the atmospheric pressure, in what is known as negative pressure.Khanorkar, p. 205 When the pleural cavity is damaged/ruptured and the intrapleural pressure becomes equal to or exceeds the atmospheric pressure, pneumothorax may ensue. Intrapleural pressure depends on the ventilation phase, atmospheric pressure, and the volume of the intrapleural cavity.Blom, p. 7 At rest we have a negative intrapleural pressure. This gives us a transpulmonary pressure expanding the lungs. In simpler terms, if we didn't maintain a slightly negative pressure even when exhaling, our lungs would collapse on themselves because all the air would rush towards the area of lower pressure. Intra-pleural pressure is sub- atmospheric. This is due to the recoil of the chest and lungs away from each other. M√ºller's maneuver can temporarily significantly decrease the intrapleural pressure. The logic in intra-pulmonary pressure and the intra- pleural pressure is that the pressure becomes more negative during inspiration and allows air to get sucked in (Boyle 's law.) P vs V relationship and during expiration, the pressure becomes less negative(Note: still less than atmospheric pressure, also take note of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide) and air is given out. The only difference in the pressures are intra- pleural pressure is more negative than intra-pulmonary pressure. Factors affecting are: Physiological effects: # M√ºllers maneuver (forced inspiration against a closed glottis results in negative pressure) # # Deep inspiration Pathological effects: # Emphysema # # Pneumothorax Condition A person breathing at rest inhales and exhales approximately half a litre of air during each respiratory cycle, this is tidal volume. The respiratory rate is directly affected by concentration of carbon dioxide in blood. Lungs do not collapse after forceful respiration because of residual volume.

Early life and education Faisal bin Abdullah was born in Riyadh on 13 May 1950. He is from the Mohammad sub-branch of the Saud bin Faisal branch of the Al Saud family. His mother is Nouf bint Abdulaziz Al Saud, a daughter of Ibn Saud and the full sister of King Abdullah. He was educated in the United States, receiving a bachelor's degree in business administration from Menlo College in 1971 and a master's degree in industrial engineering from Stanford University in 1977. His master's degree studies included the fields of values, technologies and society, and futurology. Career Faisal bin Abdullah worked in the research and industrial development center at the ministry of commerce from 1971 to 1973. During the period 1992 to 1997, he founded companies and became stakeholder in some firms. Faisal bin Abdullah was deputy commander of the National Guard‚Äôs western sector from 1992 to 2003. In the years before his 2009 appointment as minister of education, he was deputy chief of General Intelligence Presidency (GIP), a position he had held since 2003. Prince Faisal was responsible for the reorganization of GIP's administrative structure. In addition to these official posts, Faisal bin Abdullah played a role in improving the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. He was also the chairman of steering committee of Al Aghar Group of Strategic Thought. Faisal bin Abdullah was appointed minister of education to the Saudi cabinet on 14 February 2009, replacing Abdullah bin Saleh bin Obaid who had been in this post since 2005. At the time of the appointment, western news media reported that Faisal had earlier been involved in efforts to reduce extremist influences from the Saudi education system; his appointment was thought to reflect the King's intention to reinforce efforts to reduce the influence of extremists in the domain of education. However, his appointment as well as the others made in 2009 was regarded as a struggle for power rather than a dynamic of reform. On 22 December 2013, Prince Faisal was removed from office upon his request and Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud was appointed minister of education.Saudi King Appoints New Minister of Education Al Arabiya. 22 December 2013 =Views= It was thought that Faisal bin Abdullah supported the reform initiatives of King Abdullah. Furthermore, he was regarded as progressive. Faisal bin Abdullah described King Abdullah as \\"the closest route between two points - a straight line.\\" He further argued that King perceived the things as straightforward. Faisal bin Abdullah stated in 2010 that curricula should be reorganized and improved to include more focus on progressive development and investment in human beings and to depend on Saudi Arabia's religious, historical and cultural characteristics. He told in May 2010, speaking on Saudi Television's \\"Good Morning\\" program, that women would be employed to teach boys at the public primary school level, although there are no mixed classrooms in Saudi Arabia. He further argued that it might be time for children to attend mixed-sex primary schools. Concerning the unavailability of physical education courses in public schools for female students in Saudi Arabia, he stated in August 2011 that the ministry was still reviewing the issue. =Membership= Faisal bin Abdullah is the chairman of the National Committee for Education, Culture and Sciences. He has a keen interest in heritage with a passion for archaeology. He supports the Saudi Commission for Tourism and Antiquities (SCTA), headed by Sultan bin Salman. For him, SCTA is very crucial to preserve Saudi Arabia‚Äôs heritage. Faisal bin Abdullah is in favor of more parallel efforts by related authorities to assist the SCTA to achieve its mission. He is also member of the following organizations: Vice president of King Abdulaziz and his companions foundation for giftedness and creativity; president of the Saudi Arabian Boy Scouts Association, (at the age of 14 in 1963 he attended the 11th World Scout Jamboree in Marathon, Greece); president of the Saudi national commission for childhood, and chairman of the board of trustees of the equestrian fund. He founded a think tank, dealing with the reform of higher education. Personal life Faisal bin Abdullah is married to Adila bint Abdullah, daughter of late King Abdullah. Princess Adila was one of only a few female members of the royal family to have a semi-public role. It was thought that Princess Adila was very significant backing for his political initiatives. They have six children, two sons and four daughters. One of their daughters is a graduate of King's College in London. Faisal bin Abdullah has lived in Jeddah since 1992 when he was appointed to the National Guard in the Western Province. He is a professional photographer.

Plot Beautiful Penny Black rose to fame as the face of Ubernu, the mega-corporation taking over the world. Penny likes the high life, expensive clothes, and fancy restaurants, but she just became guardian for her sister, Alex. She's 18 going on 8, always dresses like her favorite superhero, Lapwing, and she's driving Penny crazy! When she inadvertently sabotages a photoshoot, drives Penny into a public rage, and puts Penny's modelling career in jeopardy, she panics and heads for Wellington to try to win her job back. Without anywhere to leave Alex she reluctantly packs her in the car, too, and they hit the road, cruising south till Penny accidentally plants the car into a paddock. Luckily, Guy, a charismatic activist picks them up and offers to take them both to Wellington. Guy is smart, charming and has a different way of looking at the world, and Penny soon warms to his apple tree planting, dumpster diving, billboard altering ways. But in the middle of their mayhem, adventure, and bending the law, things start to go wrong... Cast * Astra McLaren as Penny Black * Anton Tennet as Guy * Toni Garson as Alex Black * Sash Nixon as Lapwing * Ross MacLeod as Henchmen Production Penny Black features a core cast of three, and went into pre-production in October 2011. The film was completed in 2015 and premiered at the Arohanui Film festival in Te Aroha. Sponsors included Wicked Campers, Phoenix Organic and Whittakers with funding topped up by a PledgeMe campaign. Penny Black was filmed on RED Scarlet from July‚ÄìOct 2012 in Auckland, Pukekohe, Hamilton, Te Aroha, Taupo, Napier, and Wellington, New Zealand. The role of Penny's sister, Alex Black, was originally a male role, but when finding an actor with availability throughout the filming period became difficult the production team started to consider changing the role to a sister. When they found Toni, a Te Aroha College student, they decided she was perfect for the role and rewrote the script to suit her. During production Astra McLaren became vegan which she attributes partly to the theme of Penny Black opening her eyes and giving her time to think about issues she already knew were there. A short film entitled 'Lapwing' was made to be used within the narrative of Penny Black, and to provide back story for the superhero character. It was largely shot on the grounds of the University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand.

Her works range from simplistic drawings to rendering of the human body by layering torn and manipulated photos of body parts.Egan, Danielle. \\"Angela Grossmann: Flesh For Fantasy\\" , Canadian Art , 3 May 2012. Early life and education Grossman was born in London, England. She graduated from Emily Carr College (now University) of Art + Design in 1985. That year her artwork was included in the Vancouver Art Gallery's exhibition of \\"Young Romantic\\" painters. She earned an MFA at Concordia University. Career Grossman taught at Ottawa University, and then returned to Vancouver in 1997 to paint and to teach at Emily Carr. She has exhibited widely across Canada, the United States and Europe and her work is in many public and private collections. Grossmann's art often portrays subjects of displacement and social margins through the use of collaged and transferred discarded materials.\\"Angela Grossmann's Models of Resistance upends erotica\\" . The Georgia Strait, by Robin Laurence on April 22nd, 2015 In an early series titled Affaires d'Enfants (1987), Grossman created paintings on the insides of old suitcase. In 1991, her exhibition (Sign)ifying the END of the (Second) 2nd World War, included photographs, found in second-hand shops, of European children. Correction(s) (1999) consisted of mug shots of prisoners in the British Columbia Penitentiary and the records of their crime and daily habits while incarcerated during the 1940s. My Vocation (1999), presented the human figure graphically sketched and enlarged, using letters, photographs, addresses, envelopes, postage and cancellation marks. Alpha Girls (2004), Campbell, Deborah. Paper Dolls (2006) and Swagger (2007) portrayed themes of social status, fashion and identity in teen girls and boys.\\"Angela Grossmann's women provoke strong responses\\" . Vancouver Sun, April 24, 2015 Kevin Griffin In June 2006, she was included in a list of 100 artists who have most influenced students at eleven leading British art schools, including the Royal Academy, Slade and Royal College of Art. In 2006, she joined forces with Douglas Coupland, Graham Gillmore, Attila Richard Lukacs and Derek Root to create a large sculptural installation entitled \\"Vancouver School\\". Grossmann collaborates with this group on a regular basis for special projects. In April 2012, Grossman mounted an exhibition titled, The Future is Female, an introspective look on the essence of being female. Her collages are edited photographs, keeping the heads of the figure untouched, but manipulating the limbs and torso for artistic effect. In combination with monochrome oil on vellum or mylar paintings of candid female subjects, she creates visually complex collages. In 2015 her portraits of women, entitled \\"Models of Resistance\\", were exhibited at the Marion Scott Gallery.\\"Best of 2015: West Coast artists continue to sparkle\\" .

In 2015, China proposed including the corridor as part of its vision for the Belt and Road Initiative, China's signature global connectivity initiative. The BRI was boycotted by India from the start. In May 2019, the BCIM was not mentioned in a list of 35 corridors and projects in a joint communique issued by state leaders attending the 2nd Belt and Road Forum, indicating the BCIM had been dropped from the BRI. In the same year India has sought to keep the BCIM intact by sending a delegation to the 13th BCIM Forum in Yuxi, noting however the corridor predates the BRI. The proposed corridor will cover 1.65 million square kilometres, encompassing an estimated 440 million people in China's Yunnan province, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and West Bengal in Eastern India through the combination of road, rail, water and air linkages in the region. The BCIM envisages greater market access for goods, services and energy, elimination of non-tariff barriers, better trade facilitation, investment in infrastructure development, and joint exploration and development of mineral, water, and other natural resources. History =Background= The concept of economic cooperation within the BCIM region was first developed by Rehman Sobhan who advocated that multi-modal transport connectivity and supported by other initiatives and infrastructure development could significantly reduce transaction costs, stimulate trade and investment and consequently accelerate growth and poverty alleviation in this region. Sobhan's pioneering ideas would eventually lead to the development of the platform in the 1990s which came to be known as the \\"Kunming Initiative\\". The first meeting of the Initiative was convened in 1999 in Kunming; presided by a number of representative organisations such as The Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) from Bangladesh, Centre for Policy Research (CPR) from India and Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences in Kunming, China; from the Myanmar side it was the Ministry of Trade which represented the country. The Kunming Initiative evolved into the BCIM Forum for Regional Cooperation during its first with the objective to create a platform where major stakeholders could meet and discuss issues in the context of promoting economic growth and trade in the BCIM region; identify specific sectors and projects which would promote greater collaboration among the BCIM nations; and strengthen cooperation and institutional arrangements among the concerned key players and stakeholders to deepen BCIM ties. Over the years, the Kunming initiative developed into what came to be popularly known as the BCIM Forum. Successive BCIM Forums were held annually making a seminal contribution in raising awareness about the potential benefits accruing from the BCIM cooperation. BCIM cooperation also started to feature in intergovernmental discussions, at highest political levels, as was recounted above. The initial vision of the Kunming initiative was to gradually steer the endeavour from an essentially civil society (Track II) to an intergovernmental (Track I) one where political buy-in and intergovernmental ownership would be key to realising the vision and the objectives of the initiative. =Initial steps= One of the most recent developments to the BCIM came to fruition during the meeting between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2013. Li's visit marked the first time high-ranking officials had discussed the trade corridor. Furthermore, earlier in the year, the first ever BCIM car rally was held between Kolkata and Kunming via Dhaka to highlight road connectivity in the four countries. On 18 December 2013, the four nations drew up a long discussed plan, emphasizing the need to quickly improve physical connectivity in the region, over two days of talks in the south-western Chinese city of Kunming ‚Äì the provincial capital of Yunnan, which borders Myanmar ‚Äì on Wednesday and Thursday. This marked the formal endorsement of the BCIM EC by the four nations, whereby it was agreed that the corridor would run from Kunming to Kolkata, linking Mandalay in Myanmar as well as Dhaka and Chittagong in Bangladesh. Economic advantages The economic advantages of the BCIM trade corridor are considerable, most notably: access to numerous markets in Southeast Asia, improvement of transportation infrastructure and creation of industrial zones. The construction of industrial zones will have a twofold benefit. Firstly, it will lead to industrial transfer boosting industries such as processing, manufacturing and commerce logistics. Secondly, as labour costs rise in China, labour-intensive industries such as textile and agro processing will eventually be shifted out of China. These industries will need to be transferred to new regions with lower labour costs. Companies operating in China will likely give priority to the trade corridor region given its established infrastructure, improved logistics and ease of access India's isolated eastern and north-eastern states also stand to gain by higher trade and connectivity with China and the rest of Asia. Priority sector The eleven BCIM Forums, organised in rotation by the aforesaid institutions in the four countries, have highlighted the potential benefits of closer cooperation among the four countries in such areas as connectivity, trade, investment, energy, water management, tourism and other areas. The four countries also agreed to encourage greater cooperation and exchanges in the BCIM region in the areas of education, sports and science and technology. Leadership and representation The Bangladesh‚ÄìChina‚ÄìIndia‚ÄìMyanmar Forum for Regional Cooperation (BCIM) is a sub-regional organisation of Asian nations aimed at greater integration of trade and investment between the four countries and the economic corridor has grown out of it. During the last held session in 2013, India was represented at this week's talks by Joint Secretary (East Asia) at the Ministry of External Affairs Gautam Bambawale, who was joined by the Deputy Planning Minister of Bangladesh, the Vice Chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission, and a Senior economic affairs official from Myanmar. Cooperation with other corridors Through linking the ASEAN Free Trade Area, ASEAN‚ÄìChina Free Trade Area and the ASEAN‚ÄìIndia Free Trade Area, the corridor would constitute as one of the largest free trade areas. Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar hope to create a corridor that would effectively combine road, rail, water and air linkages in the region. This will also improve foreign trade of the BCIM countries and empower bilateral trading.

It aired from January 10, 1986 to October 3, 1987. The series is based on comics created by Italian physicist Andrea Romoli. Story The series depicts the adventures of four astronauts who travel through space and visit many planets. On each planet they have an adventure. Each adventure seems to have a sort of morality, such as the value of friendship or the protection of endangered species. Setting The series takes place in a seemingly not so distant future. The world greatly resembles the world of the late 20th century, but there is a considerable amount of futuristic technology: interstellar travel is common place (the spatial agency which employs the characters is a modest private agency not related to the government), weapons which fire lasers exist, etc... But there isn't any mention of the Internet (the series was created before the internet became really common) and the characters use outdated technology such as floppy disks (instead of CDs or DVDs) to store data. At the beginning of the series the characters are mostly on Earth, but as the series progress the characters travel through space on board of their spaceship called \\"The Sagittarius\\". The characters visit many planets on which they have many adventures. Although the Sagittarius is an old spaceship which use a sort of oil as fuel, the spaceship is able to leave Earth and reach planets sometimes in as little time as a few hours. The characters do not require artificial respiratory systems and are able to breathe on each of the planets which they visit. Themes The show was full of humour but incorporated also very mature themes. Many episodes talked about subjects such as: friendship, war in general, danger of nuclear war or nuclear explosion (which is not surprising since Japan was the victim of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings), protection of the environment and of endangered species, slavery (Sebeep was the personal singer of a taxidermist in one episode), alcoholism (there was an adventure in which Toppy had become an alcoholic and abandoned his family), pirates, virtual reality (in one adventure there was a complete world which was an illusion entirely controlled by a computer),etc. Characters =Main characters= ; : Toppy is the leader of the group. He is a young father with a wife and a baby daughter. He is usually the one who devises the strategy and tell the others what they should do. He is sometimes in conflict with Rana. In the beginning of the series he was a pilot employed by a spatial agency. The \\"Sagittarius\\", which is the spatial ship in which the heroes travel through space, comes from that agency. ; : He resembles an anthropomorphic green frog. He is married to an obese woman. He has seven children who love him dearly. When unemployed by the Sagittarius crew, he has difficulty to find a job he likes, often forced to work in bad conditions in factories, waiting for the next travel with the Sagittarius. He is the most aggressive of the group and has a short temper. He also like to flirt with women. He adores lasagna. ; : A giant yellow guy, he is the taller of the group. After Toppy he is the most wise member of the crew. He is a scientist and knows a lot about subjects such as chemistry, botany, among other things. He is completely in love with Professor Ann though there are not married during the most part of the show. Rana has a tendency to irritate him. Giraffe and Toppy are really the brains of the team and as such their role in the show is crucial. ; : An anthropomorphic plant which resembles a cactus. Seebeep was found by Toppy, Rana and Giraffe on a planet in one of their adventures and he became a member of the team. Sebeep is always happy and smiling. He is always seen with a guitar attached on his back. He likes to sing and dance. Many times during the series he takes his guitar and sing a song. The episodes in which Sebeep is the star are very emotional episodes and almost always involve singing at some point. ; : A scientist, Professor Ann is the most regularly seen woman in the show. She has pink hair and her face resembles Toppy's a lot. She loves Giraffe, although she sometimes appear rude to him. =Other characters= ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : References  External links  * * Category:1986 anime television series Category:1986 Japanese television series debuts Category:1987 Japanese television series endings Category:Adventure anime and manga Category:Nippon Animation Category:Science fiction anime and manga Category:Television shows based on comics Category:Anime based on comics Category:TV Asahi original programming ","title":"Uch≈´sen Sagittarius"},{"id":"35689276","text":"Sazeman-e Mirza Baylu (, also Romanized as SƒÅzemƒÅn-e Mƒ´rzƒÅ BƒÅyl≈´) is a village in Golestan Rural District, in the Central District of Jajrom County, North Khorasan Province, Iran.

Von Erberg was born in Ljubljana. After graduating from mathematics, logics, philosophy, and administrative law, he was at first a board councillor at the Carniolan Provincial Estates. In 1794, he married Josephine, Gr√§fin von Attems. They had seven children. In 1804, he became a chamberlain at the Austrian Court, and was from 1809 until 1814 the educator of the young Ferdinand I of Austria. In 1815, von Erberg moved to Dol pri Ljubljani, where he intensively collected books and numerous other cultural and natural objects from Carniola and also created a garden with over 7000 plants. He was a friend of Sigmund Zois and also corresponded with other Carniolan scientists and artists. Until the end of his life, he only rarely left Dol. In 1832, he hired Franz Franz, an officer, to inform him about events in Vienna and in Ljubljana. In the following eight years, Franz sent him about 1800 letters, which have been preserved until today and give an insight in the history of Ljubljana before the 1848 revolutions. In 1825, von Erberg wrote the Attempt at a Sketch of the Literary History of Carniola (), which he intended for his personal use. It consists of twelve questions about the literary history of his homeland and extensive answers to them. Even today, it represents a source of information about the older Slovenian literary history.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. At the time of its nomination it contained 67 resources, which included 40 contributing buildings, three contributing structures, and 24 non-contributing buildings. with History As Ottumwa grew in the mid to late 19th century many of its wealthier citizens built houses on the bluff overlooking the town and the Des Moines River Valley below. By doing so they were able to move away from the swampy river bottom and were able to capitalize on the view. Construction began in this part of the city in the 1850s. There were, however, three main periods of development: the 1860s, the 1890s, and the 1920s. Prominent citizens who built homes on the bluff included George Morrell of John Morrell & Company, F.W. Simmons of American Mining Tools Company, G.C. Janney of Janney Manufacturing, J.W. Edgerly who was a wholesale druggist, J.H. Merrill who was a wholesale grocer and Judge H.B. Hendershott. Construction in the area was largely concluded by 1930. Italianate, Queen Anne, and Tudor Revival are the most popular architectural styles that are found in the district. In 1895 the streets were paved with bricks and lined with limestone. Architecture Because of its location along a bluff, the area is primarily residential and has had little in the way of commercial development. It contains some of the best examples of several architectural styles in the city, and the largest concentration of architect-designed houses and buildings. Nine different architects contributed designs to the district including Ottumwa architect George M. Kerns, New York City architect F.R. Comstock, Davenport architect Edward Hammatt, and the Omaha architectural firm of Fisher & Lowrie. Historic churches in the district include First Baptist and Trinity Episcopal. The contributing structures include the brick streets, stone retaining walls, and an iron fence. The Foster/Bell House and the Jay Funeral Home are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The series revolves around the various antics of two fraternal twins, Dipper (voiced by Jason Ritter) and Mabel Pines (voiced by Kristen Schaal), who were handed over to their Great Uncle (or \\"Grunkle\\") Stan (voiced by Alex Hirsch), who runs a tourist trap called The Mystery Shack, in the town of Gravity Falls, Oregon. They soon realize that the mysterious town holds plenty of secrets. When Dipper finds an old journal in the forest, their everyday lifestyle changes with odd things and creatures they encounter. A pilot for Gravity Falls was pitched to Disney Channel in 2010 which led to the series being green-lit. The series premiered on Disney Channel on June 15, 2012. On March 12, 2013, the show was renewed for a second season. However, Disney did not officially confirm the second season until July 29, 2013. That was just four days before the season one finale, \\"Gideon Rises\\", aired. The second season premiered on August 1, 2014 on Disney Channel, and on August 4, 2014 on Disney XD. On November 20, 2015, Alex Hirsch stated that the second season of the show would be the last, and would conclude with the final part of the three-part finale entitled \\"Weirdmageddon\\". The episode aired on February 15, 2016. Series overview Episodes =Pilot (2010)= Prior to the creation of Gravity Falls, Alex Hirsch was helping to develop the Disney Channel animated series Fish Hooks, when Disney contacted him and asked him if he would like to pitch his own animated series to the network, which Hirsch accepted. Disney commissioned Hirsch to create an eleven minute low- budget flash animated pilot for Gravity Falls which he later described as \\"a short version of Tourist Trapped\\". In December 2010, it was announced that Disney Channel had green-lit Gravity Falls for a full series based on the pilot which was originally slated to premiere in spring of 2012. The pilot was never broadcast on television and for many years Hirsch had no intention of releasing it to the public. During the Cipher Hunt in July 2016, Hirsch made the promise to finally release the pilot as a reward for completing the 2,000 piece jigsaw puzzle which was a clue in the hunt. The puzzle was completed on August 1, 2016 and Hirsch uploaded the Gravity Falls pilot to the Internet on August 3. The pilot was later included as a special feature in the Gravity Falls Complete Series DVD/Blu-Ray box set which was released on July 24, 2018. =Season 1 (2012‚Äì13)= =Season 2 (2014‚Äì16)= Shorts The short series, Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained, Mabel's Guide to Life, Fixin' It with Soos, TV Shorts and Mabel's Scrapbook, aired between the first and second season of Gravity Falls. =Shorts overview= =Creature in the Closet (2012)= =Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained (2013)= =Mabel's Guide to Life (2014)= =Fixin' It with Soos (2014)= =Public Access TV (2014)= =Mabel's Scrapbook (2014)= =Creepy Letters from Lil' Gideon (2014)= =Old Man McGucket's Conspiracy Corner (2015)= =Grunkle Stan's Lost Mystery Shack Interviews (2015)= ='Pocalypse Preppin' (2015)= =Mystery Shack: Shop at Home with Mr. Mystery (2015)= =Soos' Stan Fiction (2017)= =Gravity Falls x Line Rider (2020)= =Call Me Maybe Parody (2020)= Behind-the-scenes special { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"margin: auto; width: 100%\\" - !! style=\\"background:#FF8C00; color:#100; text-align:center;\\"Title !! style=\\"background:#FF8C00; color:#100; text- align:center;\\"Original air date !! style=\\"background:#FF8C00; color:#100; text-align:center;\\"U.S. viewers (millions) } Notes References External links *List of Gravity Falls episodes at The Futon Critic *List of Gravity Falls episodes on MSN * Category:Lists of American children's animated television series episodes Category:Lists of Disney Channel television series episodes Category:Gravity Falls Category:Lists of Disney television series episodes ","title":"List of Gravity Falls episodes"},{"id":"35689663","text":"Anduqan (, also Romanized as ƒÄnd≈´qƒÅn and AndeqƒÅn) is a village in Chahardeh Sankhvast Rural District, Jolgeh Sankhvast District, Jajrom County, North Khorasan Province, Iran.

The SOPD was the first and the largest of the collaboratist organizations in the country, ‚Äúnumbering perhaps a hundred former internees.‚Äù Foundation and dissolution The SOPD was founded in 1951 by Jan Hartman, formerly of the NSB, the fascist party that allied itself with the German Nazi movement after the occupation of the Netherlands in 1940. Hartman became the organization's secretary. A co-founder was the lawyer Jan Wolthuis, another former NSB member who had been a justice of the peace in Arnhem during the German occupation, essentially an NSB appointment to a political office meant to render Anton Mussert immune from prosecution and to handle infractions committed by NSB matters. The organization was ‚Äútolerated‚Äù by the Dutch government, but a political party, founded by SOPD member Paul van Tienen, was not. Van Tienen, an associate of Swedish fascist Per Engdahl, had founded a Dutch chapter of Engdahl's European Social Movement, the Werkgemeenschap Europa in de Lage Landen (‚ÄúWorking Community Europe in the Low Countries‚Äù), in 1951. He merged this group with the SOPD to form ‚Äúthe first post-war extreme-right party in the Netherlands‚Äù, the Nationaal Europese Sociale Beweging (‚ÄúNational European Social Movement‚Äù). The party had numbered between 100 and 400 members, all ‚Äúold comrades‚Äù, and was banned in 1954 by a Dutch court on the basis of a 1944 decree signed by Queen Wilhelmina, the ‚ÄúResolution concerning the Dissolution of Treasonable Organisations‚Äù, a decision confirmed by the Supreme Court of the Netherlands in 1955.

Biography =Until 1945= Born in Groningen, Wolthuis studied law at the University of Groningen. In 1933 he joined Anton Mussert's National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands, or NSB. In the years before 1940 he fulfilled a number of offices in the NSB at the local level, and during the war proved himself a fanatical Nazi, adhering to the ideology of Meinoud Rost van Tonningen. He received an appointment as \\"justice of the peace\\" in Arnhem, essentially a political office occupied by NSB members and intended to handle civil infractions involving NSB members. In addition, the justice of the peace in Arnhem was also a justice of the economy, a special position introduced in 1941 to punish infractions in the domestic economy, particularly in relation to food rationing and price control. Wolthuis made no secret of his allegiance; he was known to occasionally wear his NSB uniform under his robes.Venema, Rechters in oorlogstijd p. 281. The cases he handled that were reported on in the papers were minor: he sentenced a chaplain to two months in jail for an unauthorized fundraiser, and presided over a case in which a citizen (a member of the NSB) complained that his bicycle had been requisitioned without a proper notification and subsequently insulted the mayor, claiming he was responsible for the theft of his bicycle. =After the war= After the war he was jailed for four years and was banned from working in the legal and judicial professions. An unrepentant ideologue, he corresponded regularly with Arnold Meijer, the Catholic fascist who had been convicted as a collaborator and was released from jail in 1948. An attempt to organize a celebration for Dutch SSers who were killed in the war, a \\"Celebration of Heroes,\\" was unsuccessful. In the 1950s, he co-founded (with fellow Waffen-SS volunteer and collaborator Jan Hartman) the Stichting Oud Politieke Delinquenten. This was the first and largest of Dutch organizations of convicted collaborators; an attempt at resurrecting the NSB under the transparent moniker NESB, or Nationaal Europese Sociale Beweging, was unsuccessful. His activities with the NESB led to an arrest in 1953, when he and Paul van Tienen were sentenced to two months' imprisonment for running an organization considered a successor to the NSB. After the NESB was dismantled Wolthuis ceased having any importance in far-right parties, though he remained involved with organizations that supported veterans of the Eastern Front. With Hartman, he played a never fully explained part in the 1952 escape of seven convicted war criminals from the Koepelgevangenis in Breda, including Klaas Carel Faber.

Born in Dundee, his mother worked as a jute weaver while his father was a building labourer with Communist sympathies, his family relocated to South London when O'Brien was two. Leaving Beaufoy‚Äôs Boys‚Äô School in Lambeth at 15 without qualifications, he worked in casual jobs and became interested in acting. He trained as an actor at the Guildhall School and later as a film and television director at the National Film and Television School (NFTS), in the early 1970s. \\"I was interested in the scale of the arena, the scale of story telling\\", he said later. At the Nottingham Playhouse, his performance in Barry Reckord's Skivers resulted in a Critics‚Äô Nomination for Most Promising Newcomer to the English stage. He also directed productions at the Nottingham theatre. O'Brien was best known for co-directing (with Christopher Morahan) the much acclaimed 14-part serial The Jewel in the Crown (Granada Television, 1984), based on Paul Scott's novel sequence The Raj Quartet. The BBC's The Monocled Mutineer (1986), from scripts by Alan Bleasdale had a more mixed reception. Although O'Brien's skill as a director gained positive attention, the BBC's billing of the four-part serial's billing as a \\"true-life story\\" antagonised conservative critics as, although essentially factually based, it contains dramatic license. The Daily Mail labelled it ‚Äúa tissue of lies‚Äù. The feature film The Dressmaker (1988) is based on novel by Beryl Bainbridge and set in Liverpool during the second world war. His last television work was an adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca (1997). From the late 1990s, he also taught at the NFTS. O'Brien married Christine Hauch in 1972; the couple had two sons.

Preview. The Myth was then distributed as a pamphlet in its full form, including sections on evidence for the clitoral orgasm, female anatomy, and reasons the \\"myth\\" of vaginal orgasm is maintained. Koedt wrote this feminist response during the sexual revolution of the 1960s. The goal of this response is to address both the 'myth of the vaginal orgasm', create awareness and education for women and men about female sexual pleasure, and to counter previous thought about the female orgasm. Koedt reflects in her writing, \\"It was Freud's feelings about women's secondary and inferior relationship to men that formed the basis for his theories on female sexuality. Once having laid down the law about the nature of our sexuality, Freud not so strangely discovered a tremendous problem of frigidity in women. His recommended cure for a woman who was frigid was psychiatric care. She was suffering from failure to mentally adjust to her 'natural' role as a woman.\\" Koedt breaks societal barriers of what is considered acceptable to discuss and her article played a vital role in the feminist sexual revolution, and draws on research done by Alfred Kinsey, among others, about human sexuality to support her claims.

Dismounting, he turns the girl over to find she is wearing a wicked fox mask and laughing, as two men ride up to rob him. Quickly getting on his horse, he is chased and finally caught, forced to hand over, on forfeit of his life, the gold he was taking to pay his taxes to Colonel Montoya. The following day Captain Grisham calls at Don Frederico's hacienda to collect the taxes and is surprised when Frederico is able to pay because he has an angel of mercy, and Tessa Alvarado, his goddaughter, appears at the door. At a ruined coastal house, two of the thieves, brother and sister, Teodora and Isabel Selvera, are discussing their loot when they spy nearby Don Frederico and Tessa walking and chatting about Tessa's mother and father. Suddenly accomplice Ramon, whose father had recently been murdered (ep. 04, \\"Vengeance\\"), appears, surprised to see them, and Teodora is worried, but his sister assures him Ramon will not betray them as he loves her. Later that afternoon Captain Grisham's dalliance with Vera is interrupted by Don Selvera complaining about the thieves and wanting action, unbeknownst to him that his daughter and son, Teodora and Isabel, in the carriage, are the culprits. In the evening back at the dilapidated ruin, the three thieves are discussing their next robbery victim and decide on Tessa Alvarado, but Ramon is reluctant to rob his childhood friend. The next morning the three burst into the Alvarado hacienda to find Tessa, Marta, and visiting Don Frederico present. Taking gold and valuables, they escape, chased by Don Frederico as they make their getaway. Teodora turns and shoots Frederico and he dies in Tessa's arms. Ramon is shocked and at Don Frederico's funeral tries to comfort Tessa in church, but Isabel and Teodora are present to hear Tessa say her godfather will be avenged. Colonel Montoya, under pressure from the Dons, is unsympathetic to Tessa, but goes along with her plan to act as decoy to smoke out the thieves. Marta is very unhappy with Tessa as Montoya cannot be trusted. The thieves learn Tessa is carrying her gold in a coach (a ruse) and a reluctant Ramon agrees to one more robbery. On the trail Tessa and Marta (in the coach) are chased and stopped by the thieves under the watch of nearby Montoya, Grisham, and his soldiers. As the robbery unfolds, Montoya stops Grisham intervening, as he hopes Tessa is killed when the thieves discover there is no gold, so that he can get her hacienda. But Montoya's own hopes are not fulfilled and he allows Grisham and his men to capture the thieves. The thieves scatter but Grisham shoots at Ramon, causing his horse to fall, and Tessa is shocked to discover who it is as Grisham takes him to jail. She visits Ramon in his cell, but he refuses to name his partners-in-crime. Meeting Marta outside, Marta points out Ramon saved her life, but Tessa is confused whether justice will be done. When crossing the square, Isabel calls to her father and Tessa recognises her voice, and knows she and her brother, who is with their father, are the other two thieves. Colonel Montoya, under pressure for results from Don Selvera, orders Captain Grisham to try to beat the information from Ramon, but Vera interrupts, indignant at Grisham's treatment of a Don's son, but it is a ploy to discover where the loot is hidden. With the information Grisham and his men head for the ruined house but Isabel is already there when she is challenged by the Queen, only for Grisham to arrive, and they both hide. Grisham hears a noise, and to protect Isabel, the Queen shows herself, and after engaging Grisham's men, she makes her escape, followed by Grisham and his men allowing Isabel to emerge, and as she is about to leave, the Queen, having lost Grisham, reappears and convinces Isabel to tell the truth to save Ramon. Confessing to Colonel Montoya, Grisham wants to hang all three, but Montoya sees a chance to make money and in the church negotiates 5000 reales and a quarter of Don Silvera's land for his children's lives, but Ramon will be shot by firing squad. Despite the little matter of a missing candle-stick, Captain Grisham returns the stolen property to Tessa and informs her Ramon is to be executed, and Tessa is shocked that he makes no mention of the other two thieves. Later, at the appointed time, Ramon is led to the execution post with a distraught Isabel screaming to the annoyance of Montoya. As Grisham is about to give the order to fire, the Queen appears riding on top of two horses and dives on to the first man in the firing squad causing the line to collapse like dominoes. She frees Ramon and takes on the garrison single-handed to enable Ramon to escape. In the confusion Ramon calls to Isabel and she jumps onto the horse Ramon has taken, only for her brother Teodora to take a rifle to shoot Isabel. Stopped by his father, allowing Grisham to arrest him. The Queen escapes on Chico, taking along another horse. Meeting Ramon and Isabel outside town, she tells them to go and never come back.

Biography =Until 1945= Born in Yogyakarta, Van Tienen joined the Waffen-SS during World War II and became an Untersturmf√ºhrer. He was active on the Eastern Front in a propaganda detachment. =After the war= After the war he continued his political activism and became involved with the European Social Movement of Per Engdahl, whom he cited as a political ally in 1953. Unlike many of his collaborationist colleagues he never lost his right to vote or his Dutch citizenship, since he was considered a minor when he joined the SS. A member of the Dutch organization of former collaborators Stichting Oud Politieke Delinquenten (\\"Foundation of Former Political Delinquents\\"), he went on to organize a political party associated with that organization, the National European Social Movement, which was dissolved by the Supreme Court of the Netherlands in 1954/1955. His activities with the NESB had led to an arrest in 1953, when he and Jan Wolthuis were sentenced to two months' imprisonment for running an organization considered a successor to the NSB. Throughout the 1950s, Van Tienen, a bookseller in Utrecht, published revisionist articles in an irregularly appearing periodical, the Nederlands Archief der Conservatieve Revolutie (\\"Dutch Archive of the Conservative Revolution\\"). That he was being actively investigated by the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service is clear from records made public by the Dutch Argus foundation. He also operated a mail-order book-selling business and was arrested and convicted in 1965 of insulting a segment of the population because he sold antisemitic literature. He was sentenced to three months imprisonment and three months probation. He had lost his passport because of his SS involvement and fled to Spain, probably with false papers, where he operated a penny arcade, and died sometime in 1995.

It is located in the road that connects Perugia to Assisi, through Ponte San Giovanni. Very close to the Monastery of San Pietro and to the Church of San Bevignate, this street is one of the \\"royal roads\\", that led out of the town through the main gates of Perugia, along a road network already used by the Etruscans and Romans.  Origins of the name and first settlements  The area's name is thought to derive from Monturreno or Mons Turrenius, that derives from Turrena, the medieval name given to Perugia, due to the presence of numerous defensive towers. The area was first settle around the 3rd century BC; a travertine ossuary was found in the garden of the castle together with three bronze mirror discovered by Mauro Faina: one of those represent the mythological figures of Peleus and Thetys. The main block of the castle dates to the 13th century. In the Perugia's archives there is a document\\"Codice diplomatico del comune di Perugia, periodo consolare e podestarile : 1139-1237\\", pp. 48 e 95 dated 18 January 1200 certifies that Gerardo di Ugolino di Alberico, making himself an official citizen of Perugia, submitted his properties in the hill of \\"Montarone\\" to the consul Bernarduccio.\\"Francino. L'altra storia di Francesco d'Assisi\\", Giuseppe F. Merenda - pag.33 Father Felice Ciatti in \\"Memorie Annali et Historiche delle cose di Perugia\\" (1638), writes: Gerardo di Ghislerio di Alberico, on 14 January, wanting to be a Perugia citizen, submitted the land he had near the hill Montirreno - called Montarone, and every thing he had in the area of Perugia, swearing he would like to stay under the Perugia jurisdiction and whole its rules...  Templars knights and Monterone castle  Until their abolition in 1312, the Templar Knights were linked to the castle. The Templars owned the Monastery of San Bevignate. The rumors and the proximity of the church to the castle make us think that catholic pilgrims received hospitality in that building, being itself submitted to the Order. Lupattelli wrote in 1899: \\"Being Templars Knights in San Bevignate from 1200 until 1312, we can assume that the land submitted by Gerardo di Ghislerio to Perugia would include his main house, the castle, where he hosted the lay pilgrims, as they had found in it a monastic institution. So, the ancient building depended by the temple of S.Bevignate and by the Monastery where it was settled the fourth Order of Priests\\". According to the tradition, there should be underground passages that connect Castello di Monterone to the Church of San Bevignate. After 1312, the Castello di Monterone was probably abandoned for a long time.  Medieval Period  During this period, the castle was used as watch-tower in order to protect and control the access to the town. Between the 14th and 16th centuries, many wars affected Perugia. The main struggle for the power was between Raspanti (artisans working class) and Beccherini (the people sustaining the noble class). This internal tense situation involved more parties (Pope, Milan Lordship) that were all interested in taking the control on the town. For this reason, Castello di Monterone was seriously damaged by military attacks, especially by Braccio da Montone and Malatesta Baglioni (in 1416 and 1582 respectively). From the 17th century, the castle was likely abandoned then inhabited for at least three centuries and maybe it was modified according to the owners‚Äô needs. At the end of the 18th century the castle was property of Counts Ansidei; in the 19th century it was bought by the Piceller family.  Castello di Monterone in modern history  Piceller family, who has origins in S. Ulrico, Val Gardena (now it is Ortisei), moved to Perugia at the end of 1600; here, they acquired lands and properties and established Castello di Monterone as the family residence. Many were the members of the family who had artistic or social merit, like Giuseppe, friend of Francesco Morlacchi, an important flautist and founder of the first music band in Perugia, Bernardino Piceller, painter and drawer of many historic and religious subjects. At the beginnings of 1800, Piceller family was enriched by the trade of ironware with Epiteto di Cristoforo. The son of Epiteto, Alessandro, is a very important character in the history of Castello di Monterone. Archaeologist for pleasure and antiquarian, Alessandro restored and extended the castle in the same way he did with the \\"Casetta Piceller\\", a 14th-century chapel situated in Collestrada, restored and re-adapted into a little country-house. Casetta Piceller Restoration works were directed by Filippo Lardoni and Alessandro Arienti. On 23 November 1849, the bishop Vincenzo Gioacchino Pecci (he will become Pope Leone XIII) inaugurated the castle. Alessandro Piceller did not only restored the ancient medieval building but he enriched it with many artistic and architectural elements (bas-reliefs, statues, a little rose, balconies, mullioned windows and so many other objects from different historic periods. The cloister, delimited by columns and marble capitals (these were collected by the same Alessandro Piceller) was decorated by urns, etruscan bas-reliefs of great historic importance. Castello di Monterone is something unique just because of this mix of styles, romantic elements and materials (sandstone, brick, stone) and it is different form the other XIX examples of Umbria. Among the main pieces of art inside the castle, we must mention the frescoes representing the signs of the main characters of the late middle age fights for the power, painted by Matteo Tassi, who realised also the Sala dei Notari inside the Palazzo dei Priori; the fresco representing The Madonna of Loreto with Saints Peter and Paul, is attributed to Jacopo da Foligno. On 20 October 1929, Alessandro Piceller died and after his death and the castle was abandoned again. During World War II it hosted displaced people and the bombs heavily ruined the building. The Castle was restored after the war.

The Abdiaziz Abdinur Ibrahim controversy began in February 2013 when journalist Abdiaziz Abdinur Ibrahim interviewed Lul Ali Osman, who claimed that she was raped by government security forces while living in an internally displaced peoples camp in Mogadishu, Somalia. The two were arrested, tried, and sentenced to a year in prison for having allegedly fabricated the story. The trial was described by some human rights groups as politically motivated. Osman was later in the month acquitted following an appeal, and Ibrahim's sentence was reduced to six months. It was concurrently announced that an Independent Task Force on Human Rights had been established, which would review his case to see if due process has been followed. Ibrahim was released from detention the following month, on 17 March 2013.  Incidents  In December 2012, Lul Ali Osman, a 27-year-old mother, claimed to have been gang-raped earlier that year by five security officers employed by the government. The police commissioner, General Sharif Shekuna Maye, stated that there was no evidence that Osman had been raped and dismissed the story as \\"propaganda\\". On 6 January 2013, local reporter Abdiaziz Abdinur Ibrahim interviewed Osman regarding her story. On 10 January 2013, Colonel Abdullahi Hassan Bariise, the head of Somalia's Criminal Investigation Department (CID), detained Osman and used her phone to contact Ibrahim. Upon being interrogated at the CID, Ibrahim admitted to having interviewed Osman, and was detained. A week later, Maye held a press conference in which he charged that Ibrahim had been involved with an Al Jazeera report on sexual violence in IDP camps in the capital. Human Rights Watch asserted that Ibrahim had no connection with Al Jazeera and had not published any of his findings, as did Al-Jazeera. Ibrahim was charged with \\"insulting state institutions\\", and Osman was charged with \\"insulting a political body\\". The trial began on 2 February in a court in Mogadishu. The prosecution called upon a midwife who testified that Osman had not been raped. The defense was not permitted to present witnesses or medical evidence to the court. On 5 February, the defendants were sentenced to a year in prison. Osman's sentence was deferred until she had completed breastfeeding her child. After the sentencing, Kulmiye Radio journalist Daud Abdi Daud spoke out in court, arguing that reporters should have the right to interview other citizens. When he reportedly claimed that he would seek to interview the president's wife, he was arrested. Daud was released after a week in custody. Ibrahim and Osman appealed their conviction, and appeared in a court in Banaadir on 20 February. Judge Hassan Mohamed Ali heard evidence from their defense attorney, Mohamed Ibrahim, before adjourning the court for one week. On 3 March, Judge Ali upheld Abdiaziz Ibrahim's conviction, stating that he \\"misled the alleged rape victim into the interview\\", but reduced his sentence from one year to six months. The court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to convict Osman, and declared her not guilty.  Responses  The National Union of Somali Journalists protested the detention of Ibrahim, and described his upheld conviction as \\"unjust\\". Audrey Gaughran, Africa program director at Amnesty International, said that the manner in which the case was handled \\"risks discouraging victims of rape and other forms of sexual violence and the media from talking about this taboo subject\\". Daniel Bekele, Africa director of Human Rights Watch, stated that the trial was \\"flawed by serious violations of due process\\" and that it suggested the Somali government was \\"more concerned with deflecting criticism than protecting ordinary citizens.\\" When Ibrahim's conviction was upheld, Bekele said that \\"the court of appeals missed a chance to right a terrible wrong\\". Navi Pillay, the United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that it is \\"deeply disturbing that a woman alleging rape can be penalized for reporting such a crime, and a journalist jailed for investigating it.\\" UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement expressing his disappointment regarding the sentences given to Ibrahim and Osman. Abdi Farah Shirdon, Somalia's Prime Minister, commented on the issue, saying that he would not intervene because the judiciary and the executive are independent branches of government. He described the work of journalists as \\"essential\\", and urged the courts to follow due process throughout the proceedings. After the appeal verdict was announced and Osman was released, Shirdon praised the decision, remarking that \\"we are a step closer to justice being done.\\" He also indicated that although Ibrahim's sentence was reduced to six months, he had ultimately hoped for the journalist's release since he believed that Ibrahim was simply reporting a story and since freedom of expression is guaranteed in the constitution.  Task Force  Concurrent with the Ibrahim affair, Prime Minister Shirdon launched an Independent Task Force on Human Rights in February 2013 in order to firm up on the protection of individual rights. The 13-member committee of volunteers was formed after extensive consultations with civil society groups and the Speaker of Parliament, Mohamed Osman Jawari. Chaired by prominent human rights attorney Maryam Yusuf Sheikh Ali, one of four women on the panel, the Task Force includes an educator, a peace activist, leaders of Somali women's organizations, senior police officers, a humanitarian campaigner, a religious leader, and a media representative. It is tasked with investigating allegations of human rights abuses and journalist intimidation, including the Ibrahim case in Mogadishu, which it will review to see if due process has been followed. At the end of its three-month mandate, the committee is scheduled to publish a report on its findings and recommended courses of action. The Task Force will eventually give way to a permanent parliamentary Human Rights Commission, which will have the capacity to investigate allegations over a longer period.  Release  On 17 March 2013, Somalia's apex court released Ibrahim from prison and dropped all charges against him. Judge Aydeed Abdulahi Ilkahanaf cited lack of evidence as the reason for the acquittal. Upon his release, Ibrahim stated \\"I am happy that I got my freedom back and I thank all those who took part in the effort to bring a just end to this case particularly my lawyers and colleagues.\\" In 2014, Ibrahim was one of three winners of the Oxfam Novib/PEN Award. The prize is annually presented to recognize writers who have been persecuted for their work and continue working despite the consequences.

One application is to encrypt and authenticate users records, using the biometric inputs of the user as a key. Fuzzy extractors are a biometric tool that allows for user authentication, using a biometric template constructed from the user's biometric data as the key. They extract a uniform and random string R from an input w with a tolerance for noise. If the input changes to w' but is still close to w , the same string R will be re-constructed. To achieve this, during the initial computation of R the process also outputs a helper string P which will be stored to recover R later and can be made public without compromising the security of R . The security of the process is ensured also when an adversary modifies P . Once the fixed string R has been calculated, it can be used for example for key agreement between a user and a server based only on a biometric input. Historically, the first biometric system of this kind was designed by Juels and Wattenberg and was called \\"Fuzzy commitment\\", where the cryptographic key is decommitted using biometric data. Later, Juels and Sudan came up with Fuzzy vault schemes which are order invariant for the fuzzy commitment scheme but uses a Reed‚ÄìSolomon code. Codeword is evaluated by polynomial and the secret message is inserted as the coefficients of the polynomial. The polynomial is evaluated for different values of a set of features of the biometric data. So Fuzzy commitment and Fuzzy Vault were precursors to Fuzzy extractors. This description is based on the papers \\"Fuzzy Extractors: A Brief Survey of Results from 2004 to 2006\\" and \\"Fuzzy Extractors: How to Generate Strong Keys from Biometrics and Other Noisy Data\\" Yevgeniy Dodis, Rafail Ostrovsky, Leonid Reyzin, and Adam Smith. \\"Fuzzy Extractors: How to Generate Strong Keys from Biometrics and Other Noisy Data\\". 2008\\\\. by Yevgeniy Dodis, Rafail Ostrovsky, Leonid Reyzin and Adam Smith Motivation In order for fuzzy extractors to generate strong keys from biometric and other noisy data, cryptography paradigms will be applied to this biometric data. This means they must be allowed to (1) Limit the number of assumptions about the content of the biometric data (this data comes from a variety of sources, so in order to avoid exploitation by an adversary, it's best to assume the input is unpredictable) (2) Apply usual cryptographic techniques to the input. (Fuzzy extractors convert biometric data into secret, uniformly random and reliably reproducible random strings). These techniques can also have other broader applications for other type of noisy inputs such as approximative data from human memory, images used as passwords, keys from quantum channel. According to the Differential Privacy paper by Cynthia Dwork (ICALP 2006), fuzzy extractors also have applications in the proof of impossibility of the strong notions of privacy for statistical databases. Basic definitions =Predictability= Predictability indicates the probability that an adversary can guess a secret key. Mathematically speaking, the predictability of a random variable A is \\\\max_{\\\\mathrm{a}}P[A = a]. For example, given a pair of random variable A and B , if the adversary knows b of B , then the predictability of A will be \\\\max_{\\\\mathrm{a}}P[A = a  B = b]. So, an adversary can predict A with E_{b \\\\leftarrow B}[\\\\max_{\\\\mathrm{a}} P[A = a  B = b . We use the average over B as it is not under adversary control, but since knowing b makes the prediction of A adversarial, we take the worst case over A . =Min-entropy= Min-entropy indicates the worst-case entropy. Mathematically speaking, it is defined as H_\\\\infty(A) = - \\\\log(\\\\max_{\\\\mathrm{a}}P[A = a]) . A random variable with a min-entropy at least of m is called a m -source. =Statistical distance= Statistical distance is a measure of distinguishability. Mathematically speaking, it is expressed for two probability distributions A and B as SD[A,B] = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{\\\\mathrm{v}}  P[A = v] - P[B = v] . In any system, if A is replaced by B , it will behave as the original system with a probability at least of 1 - SD[A,B] . =Definition 1 (strong extractor)= Setting M as a strong randomness extractor. The randomized function Ext: M \\\\rightarrow \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^l with randomness of length r is a (m,l,\\\\epsilon) strong extractor if for all m -sources W on M (Ext(W;I), I) \\\\approx_\\\\epsilon (U_l, U_r), where I = U_r is independent of W . The output of the extractor is a key generated from w \\\\leftarrow W with the seed i \\\\leftarrow I . It behaves independently of other parts of the system with the probability of 1 - \\\\epsilon . Strong extractors can extract at most l = m - 2 log \\\\frac {1} {\\\\epsilon} + O(1) bits from an arbitrary m-source. =Secure sketch= Secure sketch makes it possible to reconstruct noisy input, so that if the input is w and the sketch is s , given s and a value w' close to w , w can be recovered. But the sketch s must not reveal information about w , in order to keep it secure. If \\\\mathbb{M} is a metric space with the distance function dis, Secure sketch recovers the string w \\\\in \\\\mathbb{M} from any close string w' \\\\in \\\\mathbb{M} without disclosing w . =Definition 2 (secure sketch)= An (m,\\\\tilde{m},t) secure sketch is a pair of efficient randomized procedures (the Sketch noted SS, the Recover noted Rec) such that : (1) The sketching procedure SS applied on input w \\\\in \\\\mathbb{M} returns a string s \\\\in {\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^*} . The recovery procedure Rec uses as input two elements w' \\\\in \\\\mathbb{M} and s \\\\in {\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^*} . (2) Correctness: If dis(w,w') \\\\leq t then Rec(w',SS(w)) = w . (3) Security: For any m -source over M , the min-entropy of W given s is high: for any (W,E) , if \\\\tilde{H}_{\\\\mathrm{\\\\infty}}(WE) \\\\geq m , then \\\\tilde{H}_{\\\\mathrm{\\\\infty}}(WSS(W),E) \\\\geq \\\\tilde{m} . =Fuzzy extractor= Fuzzy extractors do not recover the original input but generate a string R (which is close to uniform) from w and allow its subsequent reproduction (using helper string P ) given any w' close to w . Strong extractors are a special case of fuzzy extractors when t = 0 and P = I . =Definition 3 (fuzzy extractor)= An (m,l, t, \\\\epsilon) fuzzy extractor is a pair of efficient randomized procedures (Gen ‚Äì Generate and Rep ‚Äì Reproduce) such that: (1) Gen, given w \\\\in \\\\mathbb{M} , outputs an extracted string R \\\\in {\\\\mathbb\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^l} and a helper string P \\\\in {\\\\mathbb\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^*} . (2) Correctness: If dis(w,w') \\\\leq t and (R,P) \\\\leftarrow Gen(w) , then Rep(w',P) = R . (3) Security: For all m-sources W over M , the string R is nearly uniform even given P , So \\\\tilde{H}_{\\\\mathrm{\\\\infty}}(WE) \\\\geq m, then (R,P,E) \\\\approx ( U_{\\\\mathrm{l}}, P, E) . So Fuzzy extractors output almost uniform random sequences of bits which are a prerequisite for using cryptographic applications (as secret keys). Since the output bits are slightly non-uniform, there's a risk of a decreased security, but the distance from a uniform distribution is no more than \\\\epsilon and as long as this distance is sufficiently small, the security will remain adequate. =Secure sketches and fuzzy extractors= Secure sketches can be used to construct fuzzy extractors. Like applying SS to w to obtain s and strong extractor Ext with randomness x to w to get R . (s,x) can be stored as helper string P . R can be reproduced by w' and P = (s,x) . Rec (w',s) can recover w and Ext(w,x) can reproduce R . The following lemma formalizes this. =Lemma 1 (fuzzy extractors from sketches)= Assume (SS,Rec) is an (M,m,\\\\tilde{m},t) secure sketch and let Ext be an average-case (n,\\\\tilde{m},l,\\\\epsilon) strong extractor. Then the following (Gen, Rep) is an (M,m,l,t,\\\\epsilon) fuzzy extractor: (1) Gen (w,r,x): set P = (SS(w;r),x),R = Ext(w;x), and output (R,P) . (2) Rep (w',(s,x)) : recover w = Rec(w',s) and output R = Ext(w;x) . Proof: From the definition of secure sketch (Definition 2), H_\\\\infty(W  SS(W)) \\\\geq \\\\tilde{m} . And since Ext is an average-case (n,m,l, \\\\epsilon)-strong extractor. SD (( Ext(W;X),SS(W),X),(U_l,SS(W),X)) = SD((R,P),(U_l,P)) \\\\leq \\\\epsilon. =Corollary 1= If (SS,Rec) is an (M,m,\\\\tilde{m},t) secure sketch and Ext is an (n,\\\\tilde{m}-log(\\\\frac {1} {\\\\delta}),l,\\\\epsilon) strong extractor, then the above construction (Gen,Rep) is a (M,m,l,t,\\\\epsilon + \\\\delta) fuzzy extractor. The reference paper includes many generic combinatorial bounds on secure sketches and fuzzy extractors. Basic constructions Due to their error tolerant properties, a secure sketches can be treated, analyzed, and constructed like a (n,k,d)_{\\\\mathcal{F}} general error correcting code or [n,k,d]_{\\\\mathcal{F}} for linear codes, where n is the length of codewords, k is the length of the message to be codded, d is the distance between codewords, and \\\\mathcal{F} is the alphabet. If \\\\mathcal{F}^n is the universe of possible words then it may be possible to find an error correcting code C \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}^n that has a unique codeword c \\\\in C for every w \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}^n and have a Hamming distance of dis_{Ham}(c,w) \\\\leq (d-1)/2. The first step for constructing a secure sketch is determining the type of errors that will likely occur and then choosing a distance to measure. Red is the code-offset construction, blue is the syndrome construction, green represents edit distance and other complex constructions. =Hamming distance constructions= When there is no risk of data being deleted and only of it being corrupted then the best measurement to use for error correction is the Hamming distance. There are two common constructions for correcting Hamming errors depending on whether the code is linear or not. Both constructions start with an error correcting code that has a distance of 2t+1 where {t} is the number of tolerated errors. Code-offset construction When using a (n,k,2t+1)_{\\\\mathcal{F}} general code, assign a uniformly random codeword c \\\\in C to each w, then let SS(w)=s=w-c which is the shift needed to change c into w. To fix errors in w' subtract s from w' then correct the errors in the resulting incorrect codeword to get c and finally add s to c to get w. This means Rec(w',s)=s+dec(w'-s)=w. This construction can achieve the best possible tradeoff between error tolerance and entropy loss when \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\geq n and a Reed‚ÄìSolomon code is used resulting in an entropy loss of 2t\\\\log(\\\\mathcal{F}). The only way to improve upon would be to find a code better than Reed‚ÄìSolomon. Syndrome construction When using a [n,k,2t+1]_{\\\\mathcal{F}} linear code let the SS(w)=s be the syndrome of w. To correct w' find a vector e such that syn(e)=syn(w')-s, then w=w'-e. =Set difference constructions= When working with a very large alphabet or very long strings resulting in a very large universe \\\\mathcal{U}, it may be more efficient to treat w and w' as sets and look at set differences to correct errors. To work with a large set w it is useful to look at its characteristic vector x_w, which is a binary vector of length n that has a value of 1 when an element a \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U} and a \\\\in w, or 0 when a otin w. The best way to decrease the size of a secure sketch when n is large is make k large since the size is determined by n-k. A good code to base this construction on is a [n,n-t\\\\alpha,2t+1]_{2} BCH code where n=2^{\\\\alpha}-1 and t \\\\ll n so k \\\\leq n-log{n \\\\choose{t}}, it is also useful that BCH codes can be decode in sub- linear time. Pin sketch construction Let SS(w)=s=syn(x_w). To correct w' first find SS(w')=s'=syn(x_w'), then find a set v where syn(x_v)=s'-s, finally compute the symmetric difference to get Rec(w',s)=w' \\\\triangle v=w. While this is not the only construction than can be used to set the difference, it is the easiest one. =Edit distance constructions= When data can be corrupted or deleted, the best measurement to use is edit distance. To make a construction based on edit distance, the easiest is to start with a construction for set difference or hamming distance as an intermediate correction step and then build the edit distance construction around that. =Other distance measure constructions= There are many other types of errors and distances that can be used to model other situations. Most of these other possible constructions are built upon simpler constructions, like edit distance constructions. Improving error-tolerance via relaxed notions of correctness It can be shown that the error-tolerance of a secure sketch can be improved by applying a probabilistic method to error correction and only requesting errors to be correctable with a high probability. This allows to exceed the Plotkin bound which limits to correcting n/4 errors, and to approach Shannon‚Äôs bound allowing for nearly n/2 corrections. To achieve this enhanced error correction, a less restrictive error distribution model must be used. =Random errors= For this most restrictive model use a BSC_{p} to create a w' that a probability p at each position in w' that the bit received is wrong. This model can show that entropy loss is limited to nH(p)-o(n), where H is the binary entropy function, and if min-entropy m \\\\geq n(H(\\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\gamma)) + \\\\varepsilon then n(\\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\gamma) errors can be tolerated, for some constant \\\\gamma > 0. =Input-dependent errors= For this model errors do not have a known distribution and can be from an adversary, the only constraints are dis_\\\\text{err} \\\\leq t and that a corrupted word depends only on the input w and not on the secure sketch. It can be shown for this error model that there will never be more than t errors since this model can account for all complex noise processes, meaning that Shannon‚Äôs bound can be reached, to do this a random permutation is prepended to the secure sketch that will reduce entropy loss. =Computationally bounded errors= This differs from the input dependent model by having errors that depend on both the input w and the secure sketch, and an adversary is limited to polynomial time algorithms for introducing errors. Since algorithms that can run in better than polynomial time are not currently feasible in the real world, then a positive result using this error model would guarantee that any errors can be fixed. This is the least restrictive model the only known way to approach Shannon‚Äôs bound is to use list-decodable codes although this may not always be useful in practice since returning a list instead of a single codeword may not always be acceptable. Privacy guarantees In general a secure system attempts to leak as little information as possible to an adversary. In the case of biometrics if information about the biometric reading is leaked the adversary may be able to learn personal information about a user. For example an adversary notices that there is a certain pattern in the helper strings that implies the ethnicity of the user. We can consider this additional information a function f(W). If an adversary were to learn a helper string, it must be ensured that, from this data he can not infer any data about the person from which the biometric reading was taken. =Correlation between helper string and biometric input= Ideally the helper string P would reveal no information about the biometric input w. This is only possible when every subsequent biometric reading w' is identical to the original w. In this case there is actually no need for the helper string, so it is easy to generate a string that is in no way correlated to w. Since it is desirable to accept biometric input w' similar to w the helper string P must be somehow correlated. The more different w and w' are allowed to be, the more correlation there will be between P and w, the more correlated they are the more information P reveals about w. We can consider this information to be a function f(W). The best possible solution is to make sure the adversary can't learn anything useful from the helper string. =Gen(W) as a probabilistic map= A probabilistic map Y() hides the results of functions with a small amount of leakage \\\\epsilon. The leakage is the difference in probability two adversaries have of guessing some function when one knows the probabilistic map and one does not. Formally: : Pr[A_1(Y(W)) = f(W)] - Pr[A_2() = f(W)] \\\\leq \\\\epsilon If the function Gen(W) is a probabilistic map, then even if an adversary knows both the helper string P and the secret string R they are only negligibly more likely figure something out about the subject as if they knew nothing. The string R is supposed to kept secret, so even if it is leaked (which should be very unlikely) the adversary can still figure out nothing useful about the subject, as long as \\\\epsilon is small. We can consider f(W) to be any correlation between the biometric input and some physical characteristic of the person. Setting Y = Gen(W) = R, P in the above equation changes it to: : \\\\Pr[A_1(R, P) = f(W)] - \\\\Pr[A_2() = f(W)] \\\\leq \\\\epsilon This means that if one adversary A_1 has (R,P) and a second adversary A_2 knows nothing, their best guesses at f(W) are only \\\\epsilon apart. =Uniform fuzzy extractors= Uniform fuzzy extractors are a special case of fuzzy extractors, where the output (R,P) of Gen(W) are negligibly different from strings picked from the uniform distribution, i.e. (R, P) \\\\approx_\\\\epsilon (U_\\\\ell, U_{P}) =Uniform secure sketches= Since secure sketches imply fuzzy extractors, constructing a uniform secure sketch allows for the easy construction of a uniform fuzzy extractor. In a uniform secure sketch the sketch procedure SS(w) is a randomness extractor Ext(w;i). Where w is the biometric input and i is the random seed. Since randomness extractors output a string that appears to be from a uniform distribution they hide all the information about their input. =Applications= Extractor sketches can be used to construct (m, t, \\\\epsilon)-fuzzy perfectly one-way hash functions. When used as a hash function the input w is the object you want to hash. The P, R that Gen(w) outputs is the hash value. If one wanted to verify that a w' within t from the original w , they would verify that Rep(w', P) = R. (m, t, \\\\epsilon)-fuzzy perfectly one-way hash functions are special hash functions where they accept any input with at most t errors, compared to traditional hash functions which only accept when the input matches the original exactly. Traditional cryptographic hash functions attempt to guarantee that is it is computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that hash to the same value. Fuzzy perfectly one-way hash functions make an analogous claim. They make it computationally infeasible two find two inputs, that are more than t Hamming distance apart and hash to the same value. Protection against active attacks An active attack could be one where the adversary can modify the helper string P. If the adversary is able to change P to another string that is also acceptable to the reproduce function Rep(W, P), it causes Rep(W, P) to output an incorrect secret string \\\\tilde{R}. Robust fuzzy extractors solve this problem by allowing the reproduce function to fail, if a modified helper string is provided as input. =Robust fuzzy extractors= One method of constructing robust fuzzy extractors is to use hash functions. This construction requires two hash functions H_1 and H_2. The Gen(W) functions produces the helper string P by appending the output of a secure sketch s = SS(w) to the hash of both the reading w and secure sketch s. It generates the secret string R by applying the second hash function to w and s. Formally: Gen(w): s = SS(w), return: P = (s, H_1(w,s)), R = H_2(w,s) right The reproduce function Rep(W, P) also makes use of the hash functions H_1 and H_2. In addition to verifying the biometric input is similar enough to the one recovered using the Rec(W,S) function, it also verifies that hash in the second part of P was actually derived from w and s. If both of those conditions are met it returns R which is itself the second hash function applied to w and s. Formally: Rep(w',\\\\tilde{P}): Get \\\\tilde{s} and \\\\tilde{h} from \\\\tilde{P}; \\\\tilde{w} = Rec(w',\\\\tilde{s}). If \\\\Delta(\\\\tilde{w}, w') \\\\leq t and \\\\tilde{h} = H_1(\\\\tilde{w},\\\\tilde{s}) then return: H_2(\\\\tilde{w}, \\\\tilde{s}) else return: fail right If P has been tampered with it will be obvious because, Rep will output fail with very high probability. To cause the algorithm accept a different P an adversary would have to find a \\\\tilde{w} such that H_1(w, s) = H_1(\\\\tilde{w},\\\\tilde{s}) . Since hash function are believed to be one-way functions, it is computationally infeasible to find such a \\\\tilde{w}. Seeing P would provide the adversary with no useful information. Since, again, hash function are one- way functions, it is computationally infeasible for the adversary to reverse the hash function and figure out w. Part of P is the secure sketch, but by definition the sketch reveals negligible information about its input. Similarly seeing R(even though it should never see it) would provide the adversary with no useful information as the adversary wouldn't be able to reverse the hash function and see the biometric input.

It was made for cable TV and subsequently internationally distributed on DVD. Plot Young archaeologist Dr. Valerie Cammon (Polly Shannon) and her colleague Dr. Kim (Philip Moon) go by ship to a volcanic island in the Mediterranean sea. While she seeks relics in a cave, a seaquake sinks their ship without survivors. At about the same time all archaeologists except for Dr. Cammon get eaten by the re-awakened ancient Lernaean Hydra. During the tempest, a whole island disappears. Two months later, Vincent (Alex McArthur) and Dixie Camden (Jana Williams) intended to organize a man-hunt for cranky millionaires. Their Captain (Michael Shamus Wiles), unaware of the Hydra, suggests the nearby, aforementioned island as a substitute. Four ex-convicts, Tim Nolan (George Stults), Gwen Russell (Dawn Olivieri), Bob Crick (James Wlcek) and Ronnie Kaplan (Texas Battle), are marooned at the shore and given 24 hours' headstart. The following day the rich hunters (played by Paul Rae, Roark Critchlow, Ricco Ross and William Gregory Lee) arrive, having been informed that their targets are responsible for various personal losses in their lives (Kaplan killed one man's daughter in a drunk driving accident, Crick raped and murdered another man's daughter, and Gwen killed the son of the third man, although Nolan was randomly selected as the intended fourth victim had a heart attack during the abduction). However, the hunters attract the Hydra's attention and get eaten. The same fate befalls some of the fugitives. Dr. Cammon runs into the surviving fugitives and helps Tim to find the magic sword of Hercules. As Dr. Cammon tries to distract the Hydra, Tim gets the sword so he can now fight the beast, but, sadly, he retrieves the sword too late and Dr. Cammon is torn apart and eaten by the Hydra. Tim manages to cut off its heads for good, but fails to cut the last head completely off. With Dr. Cammon dead, the remaining fugitives are forced to go on without her help. Eventually, the only ones left are Tim and Gwen and they return to the ship, not knowing that the Hydra has recovered and is following them. Now only one- headed, it can move like a snake and makes its way into the belly of the ship. Gwen wants to use the radio for calling SOS but the microphone is damaged.

By observing transitions between as many vibrational energy levels as possible, for example through electronic or infrared spectroscopy, the difference between the energy levels, \\\\Delta G_{v+\\\\frac{1}{2}}=G(v+1)-G(v) can be calculated. This sum will have a maximum at v_{max}, representing the point of bond dissociation; summing over all the differences up to this point gives the total energy required to dissociate the molecule, i.e. to promote it from the ground state to an unbound state. This can be written: D_0=\\\\sum_{v=0}^{v_{max}} \\\\Delta G_{v+\\\\frac{1}{2}} where D_0 is the dissociation energy. If a Morse potential is assumed, plotting \\\\Delta G_{v+\\\\frac{1}{2}} against v+1/2 should give a straight line, from which it is easy to extract v_{max} from the intercept with the x-axis. In practice, such plots often give curves because of unaccounted anharmonicity in the potential; furthermore, the low population of the higher states (or the Franck‚ÄìCondon principle) makes it difficult to experimentally obtain data at high values of v. Thus the extrapolation can be inaccurate and only an upper limit for the value of the dissociation energy can be obtained. This method takes its name from Raymond Thayer Birge and Hertha Sponer, the two physical chemists that developed it. A detailed example may be found here.David, Carl W., \\"The Birge Sponer Extrapolation\\" (2008). Chemistry Education Materials.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. At the time of its nomination it contained 158 resources, which included 101 contributing buildings, six contributing structures, and 51 non-contributing buildings. with History The property that encompasses the Vogel Place Historic District belonged to E.B. and Elizabeth Vogel, from which it derives its name. Upon E.B.‚Äôs death the land passed to their daughters. The original plat map was certified by the Wapello County recorder in September 1907 and it was filed by the recorder in March of the following year. The daughters started selling lots in 1908. Most of the houses in the district were built in the 1920s and the 1930s. The Ottumwa Electric Railroad served the neighborhood on North Court Street and was an important means of transportation to the central business district. It was one of the first neighborhoods in the city where a garage was considered an important part of the development. St. Joseph Hospital (1925), a contributing building, was listed as its own historic district on the National Register in 2015. Architecture The area covered by the district includes 91 houses, a hospital, a church (non-contributing), a brick paved street, and four distinctive driveways. The houses are basic middle-class structures that are one to two stories tall. Most of the houses are constructed of wood with a small garage behind the house. There are several houses where the exterior is composed of brick veneer and two houses were built of concrete block. Nearly a quarter of the houses were built in either the Bungalow or the American Craftsman styles. They were built between 1912 and 1930. The Tudor Revival style was also common and there are examples of both the half-timbered and English Cottage versions. Larger homes in the Romantic Revival styles are found along North Court Street while some of the other larger homes from the 1920s were built in the Colonial Revival style. There are also five examples of American Four Square houses on Vogel Avenue.

His ancestral name was Ying () and Duke Xiang was his posthumous title. He was the first Qin ruler to be granted a nobility rank by the king of Zhou; under his reign, Qin was formally recognized as a major vassal state of Zhou China. Accession to the throne Duke Xiang was not the eldest son of his father Duke Zhuang of Qin. Duke Zhuang had three sons, and Shifu (‰∏ñÁà∂) was the eldest and therefore the legal heir. However, Shifu refused the throne, and would rather devote his life to campaigning against the Rong tribes in order to avenge the death of his grandfather Qin Zhong, who was killed in battle against the Rong in 822 BC. Duke Xiang was then made the Crown Prince, and succeeded his father when Duke Zhuang died in 778 BC. War with the Rong tribes Duke Xiang ruled during a time of turmoil. The Zhou Dynasty had been at war with the western Rong tribes since the time of Duke Xiang's grandfather Qin Zhong. Qin, being the westernmost of the Zhou states, bore the brunt of the fighting against the Rong. Soon after Duke Xiang ascended the throne, in 777 BC he married his younger sister Mu Ying to a Rong leader called King Feng (Ë±êÁéã) in an apparent attempt to make peace. The following year he moved the Qin capital eastward from Quanqiu (Áä¨‰∏ò, also called Xichui, in present-day Li County, Gansu) to Qian (Ê±ß, in present-day Long County, Shaanxi). Soon afterwards Quanqiu fell to the Rong. Shifu, Duke Xiang's older brother who led the defence of Quanqiu, was captured by the Rong, but was released a year later. Enfeoffment In 771 BC King You of Zhou deposed Crown Prince Yijiu and made Bofu, the son of his favorite concubine Bao Si, the new crown prince. Yijiu was the son of Queen Shen who was the daughter of Marquis of Shen. Marquis of Shen rebelled at the news and made an alliance with the Quanrong tribe to attack the Zhou capital Haojing, killing King You at Mount Li. Marquis of Shen and other feudal rulers then installed Prince Yijiu on the Zhou throne as King Ping of Zhou. As Haojing was now ruined and still under the threat of the Quanrong, it was decided that the Zhou capital would be moved east to Luoyi, and Duke Xiang sent the Qin army to escort King Ping to Luoyi and established him at the new capital. This event marked the start of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. To reward Duke Xiang's contribution, King Ping formally granted him a nobility rank and enfeoffed him as a feudal lord. Qin was now elevated from a minor \\"attached state\\" (ÈôÑÂ∫∏, fuyong) to a major vassal state. King Ping further promised to give Qin the land west of Qishan, the former heartland of Zhou, if Qin could expel the Rong tribes that were occupying the land. Death and succession In 766 BC, the 12th year of his reign, Duke Xiang died while campaigning against the Quanrong in Qishan. He was succeeded by his son Duke Wen of Qin. He was buried in Quanqiu and his tomb has been discovered in Li County, Gansu Province.

The Great Council Lockout (Italian: Serrata del Maggior Consiglio) refers to the constitutional process, started with the 1297 Ordinance, by means of which membership of the Great Council of Venice became an hereditary title. Since it was the Great Council that had the right to elect the Doge, the 1297 Ordinance marked a relevant change in the constitution of the Republic. This resulted in the exclusion of minor aristocrats and plebeian from participating in the government of the Republic. Although formerly provisional, the Ordinance later became a permanent Act, and since then it was disregarded only at times of political or financial crisis (e.g. after the war against the League of Cambrai).  History  = Historical background = When the Commonwealth of Venice was formed, the Doge was assisted by a Council of Wise Men (Consilium Sapientium) elected by the people's assembly (Concio). Once obtained sovereign power in 1172, such Council came to be known as Great Council. It originally functioned as an extension of the people's assembly, and its members were elected on a yearly basis, with the general election usually falling on the day of Saint Michael (29 September). Later, in 1207 the election system was changed: the Concio was required to elect three representatives (up to seven since 1230), who had the duty to nominate the Councillors. Over the years, the Great Council became the bone of contention between the people's party, which aimed to preserve the status quo, and the aristocratic party, which aimed to exclude up-starters from the government. On 5 October 1286, during the government of Doge Giovanni Dandolo, the aristocratic party presented a bill to reform the eligibility criteria for the Great Council, with the purpose of limiting its members to those who had already joined the Council or those whose paternal relatives held the position of Councilman. The proposal also demanded that candidates without family credentials could run for a position only upon joint approval on behalf of the Doge, the Minor Council, and the Council of Forty (Quarantia). After such bill was repelled, another bill was proposed, which required new entrants to be subject to approval on behalf of outgoing Councilmen. However, even this proposal was rejected. = The First \\"Lockout\\" (Serrata) = On 25 November 1289, Pietro Gradenigo, who was the leader of the aristocratic party, was elected Doge of the Republic. After 6 years he submitted a new lockout provision drawing on drafts of the previous ones. On 6 March 1296 the proposal was repelled by a narrow majority. Finally, after new yearly elections (29 September 1296), the Council approved the bill on 28 February 1297 (that is, the last month of 1296, according to the Venetian Calendar). The approved provision ruled that, in order to be eligible, members were required to either have been Councillors at least once in the past four years, or to be patrilineally related to a former Councillor. In order to better time the entrance of new members, 40 young men would be selected each year by means of a raffle, and their names inscribed in the list of candidates.  Content of the Provision  The 1297 Provision empowered the Council of the Forty, granting it the following rights and duties with regards to the election of the Great Council: * The Forty had the duty to compile a list of previous Councillors who held a position in the past 4 years. Whoever appeared in such list met the eligibility criteria; * The Forty had also the duty to elect the Great Council on a yearly basis. * In order to be elected, candidates needed a minimum of 12 votes in a session with 30 attendants (75% of the Council of Forty), provided the voting session was notified to them with at least a 3 days notice; * Once elected, Councillors would hold the position until the next day of Saint Michael (29 September 1297); * Councillors could be confirmed for the next year, as part of the normal election process; * All those who had to renounce their seat in the Council (e.g. because they were abroad or unable to stay in charge due to other commitments) could be admitted again, but only upon approval of the Council of Forty. The Provision also made explicit the conditions for its annulment: * Abrogation was subject to the approval of at least: 5 members of the Minor Council, 25 members of the Council of Forty, and two thirds of the Great Council; * The Provision had to be verified and ratified with a Council vote taking place twenty-five days before the next Saint Michael's day (4 September 1298); * If the Provision was not ratified, Councillors were expected to pay a penalty to the State's Attorneys. = Following events = The Act was ratified in September 1298, and again in 1299. Its approval caused unrest among the people's party, which eventually led to Marin Bocconio's 1300 attempted coup. The failure of his conspiracy triggered the approval of a new provision (22 March 1300), which raised the threshold for the admission of upstart candidates by the Council of Forty (requiring 20 votes instead of the former 12 needed for election). A second wave of limitations occurred in 1307. This led to another attempted coup (1310), on behalf of a faction led by Bajamonte Tiepolo. The conspiracy was averted by the Doge Pietro Gradenigo. As a reaction to the conspiracy, the government instituted a new special court‚Äîthat is, the Council of Ten, whose purpose was that of dealing with crimes against the constitution of the State. In 1315, the process of compiling lists of candidates was formalized thanks to the creation of the Golden Book (Libro d'Oro): namely, a demographic registry that included the names of all the eligible candidates aged 18 or above. The creation of the Golden Book was followed by the enactment of even stricter rules against up- starters (homini novi). The final lockout occurred in 1319. The election of new candidates was ultimately abolished and the status of Councillor became automatic for all male patricians aged 25 or above. An exception was made every year for 30 young patricians, randomly chosen on the day of Saint Barbara, who were allowed to join at the age of 20. Since then, the Great Council positions remained hereditary. Eventually, this led to the dismissal of the obsolete people's assembly (Concio) in 1423.Frederic C.

It is being actively developed by Thermo Fisher Scientific in collaboration with the Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB), and commercially distributed by Thermo Fisher Scientific. Overview Amira is an extendable software system for scientific visualization, data analysis, and presentation of 3D and 4D data. It is used by thousands of researchers and engineers in academia and industry around the world. Its flexible user interface and modular architecture make it a universal tool for processing and analysis of data from various modalities; e.g. micro-CT, PET, Ultrasound. Its ever-expanding functionality has made it a versatile data analysis and visualization solution, applicable to and being used in many fields, such as microscopy in biology and materials science, molecular biology, quantum physics, astrophysics, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), finite element modeling (FEM), non-destructive testing (NDT), and many more. One of the key features, besides data visualization, is Amira‚Äôs set of tools for image segmentation and geometry reconstruction. This allows the user to mark (or segment) structures and regions of interest in 3D image volumes using automatic, semi-automatic, and manual tools. The segmentation can then be used for a variety of subsequent tasks, such as volumetric analysis, density analysis, shape analysis, or the generation of 3D computer models for visualization, numerical simulations, or rapid prototyping or 3D printing, to name a few. Other key Amira features are multi-planar and volume visualization, image registration, filament tracing, cell separation and analysis, tetrahedral mesh generation, fiber-tracking from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, skeletonization, spatial graph analysis, and stereoscopic rendering of 3D data over multiple displays and immersive virtual reality environments, including CAVEs. As a commercial product Amira requires the purchase of a license or an academic subscription. A time-limited, but full- featured evaluation version is available for download free of charge. History =1993‚Äì1998: Research software= Amira‚Äôs roots go back to 1993 and the Department for Scientific Visualization, headed by Hans-Christian Hege at the Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB). The ZIB is a research institute for mathematics and informatics. The Scientific Visualization department‚Äôs mission is to help solve computationally and scientifically challenging tasks in medicine, biology, engineering and materials science. For this purpose, it develops algorithms and software for 2D, 3D, and 4D data visualization and visually supported exploration and analysis. At that time, the young visualization group at the ZIB had experience with the extendable, data flow- oriented visualization environments apE, IRIS Explorer, and Advanced Visualization Studio (AVS), but was not satisfied with these products‚Äô interactivity, flexibility, and ease-of-use for non-computer scientists. Therefore, the development of a new software system was started in a research project within a medically oriented, multi-disciplinary collaborative research center. Based on experiences that Tobias H√∂llerer had gained in late 1993 with the new graphics library IRIS Inventor, it was decided to utilize that library. The development of the medical planning system was performed by Detlev Stalling, who later became the chief software architect of Amira. The new software was called ‚ÄúHyperPlan‚Äù, highlighting its initial target application ‚Äì a planning system for hyperthermia cancer treatment. The system was being developed on Silicon Graphics (SGI) computers, which at the time were the standard workstations used for high-end graphics computing. The software was based on libraries such as OpenGL (originally IRIS GL), Open Inventor (originally IRIS Inventor), and the graphical user interface libraries X11, Motif (software), and ViewKit. In 1998, X11/Motif/Viewkit were replaced by the Qt toolkit. The HyperPlan framework served as the base for more and more projects at the ZIB and was used by a growing number of researchers in collaborating institutions. The projects included applications in medical image computing, medical visualization, neurobiology, confocal microscopy, flow visualization, molecular analytics and computational astrophysics. =1998‚Äìtoday: Commercially supported product= The growing number of users of the system started to exceed the capacities that ZIB could spare for software distribution and support, as ZIB‚Äôs primary mission was algorithmic research. Therefore, the spin-off company Indeed ‚Äì Visual Concepts GmbH was founded by Hans-Christian Hege, Detlev Stalling, and Malte Westerhoff with the vision of making the extensive capabilities of the software available to researchers in industry and academia worldwide and to provide the product support and robustness needed in today‚Äôs fast-paced and competitive world. In Feb 1998 the HyperPlan software was given the new, application-neutral name ‚ÄúAmira‚Äù. This name is not an acronym, but was chosen for being pronounceable in different languages and providing a suitable connotation, namely ‚Äúto look at‚Äù or ‚Äúto wonder at‚Äù, from the Latin verb ‚Äúadmirare‚Äù (to admire), which reflects a basic situation in data visualization. A major re-design of the software was undertaken by Detlev Stalling and Malte Westerhoff in order to make it a commercially supportable product and to make it available on non-SGI computers as well. In March 1999, the first version of the commercial Amira was exhibited at the CeBIT tradeshow in Hannover, Germany on SGI IRIX and Hewlett-Packard UniX (HP-UX) booths. Versions for Linux and Microsoft Windows followed within the following twelve months. Later Mac OS X support was added. Indeed ‚Äì Visual Concepts GmbH selected the Bordeaux, France and San Diego, United States based company TGS, Inc. as the worldwide distributor for Amira and completed five major releases (up to version 3.1) in the subsequent four years. In 2003 both Indeed ‚Äì Visual Concepts GmbH, as well as TGS, Inc. were acquired by Massachusetts-based Mercury Computer Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRCY) and became part of Mercury‚Äôs newly formed life sciences business unit, later branded Visage Imaging. In 2009, Mercury Computer Systems, Inc. spun off Visage Imaging again and sold it to Melbourne, Australia based Promedicus Ltd (ASX:PME), a leading provider of radiology information systems and medical IT solutions. During this time, Amira continued to be developed in Berlin, Germany and in close collaboration with the ZIB, still headed by the original creators of Amira. TGS, located in Bordeaux, France was sold by Mercury Computer systems to a French investor and renamed to Visualization Sciences Group (VSG). VSG continued the work on a complementary product named Avizo, based on the same source code but customized for material sciences. In August 2012, FEI, to that date the largest OEM reseller of Amira, purchased VSG and the Amira business from Promedicus. This brought the two software sisters Amira and Avizo back into one hand. In August 2013, Visualization Sciences Group (VSG) became a business unit of FEI. In 2016 FEI has been bought by Thermo Fisher Scientific and became part of its Materials & Structural Analysis division in early 2017. Amira and Avizo are still being marketed as two different products; Amira for life sciences and Avizo for materials science, but the development efforts are now joined once again. In the meantime, the number of scientific articles using the Amira / Avizo software, is in the order of 10 thousands. As in the beginning, the Amira roadmap continues to be driven by the challenging scientific questions that Amira users around the world are trying to answer, often at the leading edge in their fields.

Written and directed by Brad Falchuk, it aired on Fox in the United States on May 22, 2012. It features the graduation of the McKinley High class of 2012, and with it, eight members of the New Directions glee club. The episode introduces special guest star Gloria Estefan as Maribel Lopez, Santana's (Naya Rivera) mother, and has appearances by six other parents of graduating seniors. The episode was well received by many reviewers, though some were not as happy with it. The enthusiastic ones cited the combination of humor and tears, past events and present revelation, while those who were more critical felt there was not enough time to wrap up all the storylines or that it strayed into sappiness. Particular praise was given to the scene with Burt and Kurt Hummel that featured the former's \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\\" number, which was the favorite performance of the reviewers, and the scene when Finn tells Rachel he's sending her to New York instead of marrying her, which was described as Monteith's and Michele's best acting on the show. Monteith was also praised for his solo in the song \\"You Get What You Give\\", and Michele's rendition of \\"Roots Before Branches\\" received even higher marks. Other songs were given a less enthusiastic reception. \\"Goodbye\\" attracted 7.46 million American viewers during its initial broadcast and received a 2.9/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, a significant increase over the prior episode's 2.5/7 rating/share and 6.03 million viewers on May 15, 2012. Plot Will (Matthew Morrison) gives the members of New Directions one final assignment: perform songs to say goodbye to each other. He starts by singing \\"Forever Young\\". The graduating seniors as a group perform \\"You Get What You Give\\", and tell the underclassmen that it is now their glee club. The underclassmen, joined by Will, sing \\"In My Life\\" to express their gratitude to the seniors. Kurt (Chris Colfer) reflects on how his experience at McKinley High has enabled other students to be openly gay. His father (Mike O'Malley) meets him in the school auditorium and recalls the evolution of their relationship. Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Brittany (Heather Morris) then join him on the stage to help him re-enact the turning point, which serves as Kurt's graduation gift: the \\"Single Ladies\\" dance. Kurt and Blaine (Darren Criss) pledge to remain a couple, despite being in different cities in the fall. Mercedes (Amber Riley) has been offered a recording contract as a backup singer and will be moving to Los Angeles; Mike (Harry Shum, Jr.) has accepted a scholarship to the Joffrey Ballet in Chicago. Both revelations upset Santana (Naya Rivera), who has a cheerleading scholarship from the University of Louisville, yet wants to be a performer like them. Brittany announces that she will not be graduating, and Santana tells her mother, Maribel (Gloria Estefan), that she will stay in Lima. Maribel later gives Santana the money that she had been saving for Santana's college education, saying she trusts her to follow her dreams. Quinn (Dianna Agron) helps Puck (Mark Salling) study for the test he needs to pass in order to graduate. She tells him that with all they went through, they are bonded for life, and she kisses him. Emboldened, Puck passes his test. Later, Quinn returns her cheerleading uniform to Sue (Jane Lynch), and the two have a tearful farewell. Will tells Finn (Cory Monteith) that he had planted marijuana in Finn's locker in order to blackmail him into joining the glee club, which Finn thinks makes him \\"even cooler\\". Finn is disappointed that the Army refused to change his late father's dishonorable discharge to an honorable one, and wonders to his mother (Romy Rosemont) whether his father would be proud of him if he became an actor. After the graduation ceremony, Finn, Kurt, and Rachel (Lea Michele) gather to open their acceptance letters‚ÄîFinn for the Actors Studio and Kurt and Rachel for NYADA. Finn and Kurt are rejected, while Rachel is admitted; she decides to defer her admission for a year to help the other two reapply so the trio can go to New York together. She gets into Finn's car to go to their wedding, but instead of driving to the wedding venue, Finn drives her to the train station. He tells her that he loves her too much to marry her if it means she has to give up her dreams; he also reveals that he will be joining the Army. Will and the glee club meet them on the train platform to say goodbye, and a crying Rachel sings \\"Roots Before Branches\\" as she boards the train for New York. Production \\"Goodbye\\" marked Dianna Agron's final appearance as a regular in the series The season's final episode was written and directed by series co-creator Brad Falchuk. Shooting began on April 30, 2012, and was scheduled to take two weeks. The cast recorded their final vocal tracks for the episode's songs on April 21, 2012, and the final scene was shot late on the evening of May 10, 2012. Some scenes for the episode have been filmed on location in New York City. Falchuk tweeted two photos on the evening of Monday, May 7, 2012. One was a photo of Lea Michele sitting on a suitcase on a sidewalk, along with the message, \\"Two from yesterday. Yep. NYC Sunday, back in LA Monday.\\" It was originally announced that this episode would include eight songs from the album Glee: The Music, The Graduation Album. However, only five of the album's tracks are used in the episode, none of which have been released separately as singles. These are Bruce Springsteen's \\"Glory Days\\" performed by Monteith and Salling, Madonna's \\"I'll Remember\\" performed by Colfer, New Radicals' \\"You Get What You Give\\" performed by the graduating members of New Directions, Rod Stewart's \\"Forever Young\\" performed by Morrison, and Room for Two's \\"Roots Before Branches\\" performed by Michele and Monteith. The episode also has new performances of three songs that are not on the album. \\"In My Life\\" by The Beatles, performed by the non-graduating members of New Directions, is the only song that has been released as a single available for digital download. The other two are repeat performances of \\"Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat\\" from Guys and Dolls, first sung in the series' pilot by Colfer, Michele, Kevin McHale, Ushkowitz and Riley, and Beyonc√©'s \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" from \\"Preggers\\", performed by O'Malley, Ushkowitz, and Morris; both numbers include flashbacks to the original performances, which for \\"Single Ladies\\" included Colfer rather than O'Malley. There is another flashback to the pilot episode showing Monteith's a cappella performance of \\"Can't Fight This Feeling\\" by REO Speedwagon. Although Gloria Estefan (pictured) was reported to have signed to play Santana's mother in early December 2011, her debut was in the season finale Gloria Estefan makes a special guest appearance as Maribel Lopez, the mother of Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera). Estefan was reported to be in talks to play Santana's mother as early as November 30, 2011, the morning after the episode \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" aired. After the episode, in which Santana comes out as a lesbian and her grandmother‚Äîthe only relative of hers shown on screen‚Äîdisowns her, though Santana says her parents accepted the news, Estefan tweeted, \\"Did anyone see Glee last night? Santana could really use a sympathetic mommy right about now, don't you think?? Lol!\\" Estefan was definitively reported as having signed to be a guest star on December 8, 2011, and as being scheduled to appear in one of the then-upcoming winter episodes, but this episode marks her debut on the show. Many recurring guest stars appeared in the episode. These include glee club members Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), Joe Hart (Samuel Larsen), Rory Flanagan (Damian McGinty) and Sugar Motta (Vanessa Lengies), Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones), synchronized swimming coach Roz Washington (NeNe Leakes), European geography teacher Eleanor Doosenbury (Kathleen M. Darcy), and the parents of many other graduating students: Kurt's father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), Finn's mother Carole Hudson-Hummel (Romy Rosemont), Mike's parents Michael Chang, Sr. (Keong Sim) and Julia Chang (Tamlyn Tomita), Quinn's mother Judy Fabray (Charlotte Ross) and Puck's mother (Gina Hecht). James Lipton of the Actors Studio makes an appearance as himself. On August 6, 2012, co-creator Ryan Murphy uploaded a deleted scene from this episode to YouTube in which Kurt reads a message Rachel wrote in his yearbook. On August 9, 2012, Murphy uploaded a second deleted scene, this one featuring Mike and Tina, in which Mike's parents give him a graduation present. Murphy noted that the episode had initially run \\"15 minutes long\\", and these were two of the scenes that were cut from the finished version. Reception =Ratings= \\"Goodbye\\" was first broadcast on May 22, 2012 in the United States on Fox, an hour later than its usual time, in order to air after the first day of the two-day American Idol finale. This was the same time that the previous episode, \\"Nationals\\" aired the week before as the second hour in a two-hour special evening. \\"Goodbye\\" received a 2.9/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic and attracted 7.46 million American viewers during its initial broadcast, a significant increase over the prior episode's 2.5/7 rating/share and 6.03 million viewers on May 15, 2012.US viewership data: *\\"Goodbye\\": *\\"Nationals\\": In Canada, which also aired the episode an hour later than usual on the same day as its American premiere and immediately following American Idol, viewership rose by over 4% to 1.63 million viewers from the 1.56 million viewers who watched \\"Nationals\\" at the same hour the week before. \\"Goodbye\\" was the seventh most-viewed show of the week, an improvement of three slots over \\"Nationals\\", which had been the tenth most-viewed.Canadian viewership data: *\\"Goodbye\\": *\\"Props\\"/\\"Nationals\\": In the United Kingdom, \\"Goodbye\\" first aired on May 24, 2012, at the show's usual time, which was the same time that \\"Nationals\\" had aired the previous week. It was watched on Sky 1 by 776,000 viewers, the same number as had watched \\"Nationals\\".UK viewership data: *\\"Goodbye\\": *\\"Props\\"/\\"Nationals\\": In Australia, \\"Goodbye\\" was broadcast on May 31, 2012. It was watched by 657,000 viewers, up over 6% from the 618,000 viewers for \\"Nationals\\" on May 24, 2012. Glee was the twelfth most-watched program of the night, up from seventeenth the week before.Australian viewership data: *\\"Goodbye\\": *\\"Nationals\\": =Critical reception= The episode was well received by many critics, though some were not as happy with it. The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff gave it an \\"A\\" grade, and wrote that what she \\"liked most of all\\" was it being \\"remarkably clear-eyed about who these people are and what they're capable of\\". Crystal Bell of Huffington Post described it as \\"heartfelt, comical and, yes, absolutely ridiculous\\", and The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg called it a \\"tearful and touching finale\\". Though she acknowledged exceptions, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone characterized the episode as a \\"nonstop sapfest of too many tears and not enough nostalgia\\", while Entertainment Weekly Erin Strecker said it had \\"the perfect amount of flashbacks and revelations\\" and described it as \\"a season finale that sure felt like a series finale\\". Rae Votta of Billboard wrote that \\"there simply isn't enough time to settle the fates of so many seniors in a mere hour\\", a sentiment also expressed by Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson, who thought the episode might have \\"felt a little more logical if it was given a full two hours to breathe\\". Hankinson also said it left him with \\"mostly questions\\" but also \\"some fury\\". TV Guide two reviewers were both enthusiastic: Kate Stanhope described is as a \\"perfect mix of the kids' past, present and future\\", and Damian Holbrook wrote that the \\"class of 2012 went out on a high note with a season finale so solid, emotional and entertaining, you would have thought you were watching one of the show's first 13 episodes\\". VanDerWerff called Kurt opening his NYADA rejection letter \\"as good a gut-punch as I can think of for this series\\", though John Kubicek of BuddyTV characterized it as \\"the most unbelievable plot twist ever on this show\\". Bell hoped that this would extend his stay in Lima because it could give \\"more screen time for Burt Hummel, who is arguably the best character on Glee\\". The scene where Burt gives Kurt his present was described as a \\"gift\\" by many reviewers. Kubicek wrote, \\"Kudos to Glee for turning a sappy moment into a funny one\\", and Strecker noted how powerful scenes typically were between the Hummels before she added \\"last night was no exception\\", and ended by quoting Kurt: \\"Best. Graduation Gift. Ever.\\" The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez deemed \\"unrealistic\\" the notion that Santana's mother would allow the money she had saved for Santana's college expenses to be \\"wasted on a dream\\", and Bell described it as \\"too good to be true\\". Michael Slezak of TVLine agreed and called Maribel \\"crazily lenient\\", but said Estefan had done \\"good work\\". Kubicek, however, maintained that Estefan was wasted in the role, and Futterman wrote that the \\"choppy, random scenes would have been a lot better with some Gloria Estefan singing\\". The scene where Finn tells Rachel he's sending her to New York instead of marrying her both surprised and impressed reviewers. Strecker called it one of her \\"favorite non-singing scenes of the year, possibly the series\\", and VanDerWerff put it even more strongly: \\"It's one of the best things I've seen on TV this year\\". Both Monteith and Michele were praised for their acting: Slezak said it was their \\"best work\\", VanDerWerff said they \\"kill[ed]\\" the scene, and Bell said it was \\"some of Cory Monteith's finest acting\\". Rachel's arrival in New York brought comparisons to Mary Tyler Moore from Bell and Strecker; as the latter put it, \\"she's going to make it after all\\". =Music and performances= The performances were given generally good marks by reviewers, and the one that received the most enthusiastic reception was not for singing at all, but Burt's lipsynch and dance to \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\\" with the aid of Tina and Brittany. Futterman called it the \\"best gift of the season\\" and Slezak said it was \\"another shining (albeit silly) moment for Glee's best parental unit\\" and gave it an Bell wrote \\"I loved every second of it\\", and E! Online Jenna Mullins described it as the episode's \\"rewind moment\\". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post was fond of the other flashback number, \\"Sit Down You're Rockin' the Boat\\", to which she gave an and commented, \\"it was a nice reminder of how far these plucky Glee kids have come\\". MTV's Fallon Prinzivalli was not as enthusiastic about the repeat performance, and said it was \\"not much better\\" than the pilot rendition and he was \\"happy to see their version of the song retired\\". \\"Forever Young\\" generated differing reactions from reviewers. Slezak wondered whether Will's \\"diminished role this year\\" reduced the impact of his farewell song and gave it a \\"B\\", and Futterman wrote that \\"while the bare-bones guitar arrangement is suitably melancholy, Schue's voice never quite settles in, seeming forced the whole way through\\". Strecker thought \\"it sounded lovely\\", gave it a \\"B+\\" and asked for more in the next season, and Chaney graded it an \\"A\\" and said that it was \\"sweet\\". The same word, \\"sweet\\", was applied by Slezak to Kurt's rendition of \\"I'll Remember\\"; he called the song an \\"underrated Madonna ballad\\" and graded it a \\"B+\\". Chaney, however, said it was \\"not one of Madonna's best\\" and the performance \\"not particularly memorable\\", so she gave it a while Pinzivalli wrote \\"leave this one to Madge\\". Futterman characterized Kurt as \\"dapper and emotional while singing in a crisp, clear and natural voice\\", though she wanted the performance to be \\"more than everyone's sad faces\\". Strecker's grade was an and she wrote that \\"Colfer sold it\\" and that it was a \\"nice arrangement for his voice\\". \\"You Get What You Give\\" by the graduating seniors was welcomed by reviewers. Prinzivalli called it \\"one of Cory Monteith's best solos all season\\" and a fun cover, while Futterman described it as \\"fine and fun, but nothing really spectacular\\". Slezak gave it an \\"A\\" and wrote, \\"this spirited rendition captured [the song's] jaunty essence\\", and Strecker noted with her \\"B+\\" that \\"this was the moment when it really kicked in that the show will never be the same\\". Chaney also complimented Finn for having gotten \\"the hang of this whole singing-and-dancing thing in the last three episodes of this season\\" and gave a grade of \\"B\\". She gave an \\"A\\" to \\"In My Life\\", sung by the underclassmen, and said \\"the harmonies sounded lovely\\"; Bell called it \\"a perfect song to signify graduation\\". Others were less enthusiastic: Futterman described it as \\"a blended-past-recognition, laden-with-harmonies Beatles tune\\" and the point where the show \\"entered sappy hour\\", and Slezak said it was \\"not the most ringing endorsement for the National Champions' 2013 chances\\" and graded it a \\"C+\\". Reviewers wondered at the inclusion of \\"Glory Days\\". Chaney stated, \\"There is no way anyone should have been blaring Springsteen in the middle of a commencement ceremony\\", and Slezak called the song \\"a tone-deaf choice for modern teenagers on their big day\\"; their grades were \\"B\\" and \\"C+\\" respectively. Strecker merely noted that the ceremony \\"doubled as a performance\\" when she gave her \\"B+\\", and Futterman thought it looked \\"more like a fashion show than a graduation ceremony\\". The show's final number, \\"Roots Before Branches\\", was greatly praised.

Early life Arthur Clouston was born on 7 April 1908 at Motueka, New Zealand, the eldest of nine children of mining engineer Robert Edmond Clouston (1874‚Äì1961) and his wife Ruby Alexander Scott (1886‚Äì1943). As a teenager, Arthur developed engineering and practical country skills, and established a business repairing and reselling motor cars. His ambition was to be a master mariner, but that was abandoned due to incurable seasickness. He was inspired by the expansion of aviation, and particularly the pioneering flights in Australia and New Zealand by aviators such as Charles Kingsford-Smith and C.W.A. Scott in the late 1920s. He learned to fly at the Marlborough Aero Club at Omaka Aerodrome, near Blenheim. In 1930, after failing his attempt to join the Royal New Zealand Air Force, he moved to the United Kingdom.Clouston 1954Orange 2004 RAF career, 1930‚Äì1935 In 1930, after arriving in England, Clouston found that there was a waiting list to join the RAF, so he then joined Fairey Aviation Company as a working student. Applications to the RAF were repeatedly halted, until it was found that his blood pressure was lower during flying than while awaiting medical examinations on the ground. In October 1930, he joined No. 3 FTS at RAF Spitalgate, where he went solo after about two hours flying. In April 1931, he was posted as pilot officer to No. 25 Squadron at RAF Hawkinge, flying Hawker Fury I fighter biplanes. In April 1932, he was promoted to flying officer. He was one of the team that performed formation aerobatics, including loops, with nine Furies at the April 1934 RAF display at RAF Hendon. In August 1934, he was posted to No. 24 Squadron at Hendon. In October 1935, he declined to renew his short service commission, and left the RAF, although remaining as a Reserve Air Force Officer (RAFO) pilot with the RAFVR.Oliver 1994 Hafner AR.III (G-ADMV) at Heston, 1935 Civilian flight testing, 1935‚Äì1939 In October 1935, Clouston accepted the offered post of civilian test pilot at RAE Farnborough. Soon after he had started flying a Cierva C.30 autogiro at Farnborough, he was invited by Raoul Hafner to carry out test flying of the Hafner AR.III in his off-duty time, and Clouston later flew demonstrations of that gyroplane at many aviation events. He conducted official flight test aerodynamics work on aircraft including Parnall Parasol and Miles Falcon; ice formation research on Airspeed Courier, Handley Page Heyford and Northrop Gamma; and anti-intruder wire strike tests with Miles Hawk and Fairey P.4/34. In January 1938, he was awarded the Air Force Cross. In October 1938, Air Vice Marshal Arthur Tedder asked Clouston to conduct test flying of the prototype of the Westland Whirlwind, in place of Westland test pilots. Clouston piloted its first flight from Yeovil Aerodrome to Boscombe Down.Barrass, M. Air of AuthorityMiddleton 1982 Races and record-breaking flights, 1935‚Äì1939 Miles Hawk Speed Six (G-ADOD), September 1936 While employed at RAE, Clouston developed a spare time interest in civil aviation, air racing and record-breaking. On 13 April 1936, he displayed his Aeronca C-3 (G-ADYP) at the Pou-du-Ciel (Flying Flea) rally at Ashingdon. He test flew several Flying Fleas from Heston Aerodrome and from Gravesend Aerodrome. On 30 May 1936, he flew his Aeronca C-3 from Hanworth Aerodrome in the London to Isle of Man Race, but missed the final turning point in fog. On 14 June 1936, he flew the Aeronca in the South Coast Race at Shoreham, and came first, but was then disqualified on a technicality. On 11 July 1936, he flew a Miles Falcon (G-AEFB) in the King's Cup Race at Hatfield. On 3 August 1936, he borrowed a Flying Flea (G-ADPY), and raced it in the First International Flying Flea Challenge Trophy Race at Ramsgate Airport, but retired when an oil pipe fractured.Lewis 1970 On 29 September 1936, he took off from Portsmouth Airport in his Miles Hawk Speed Six (G-ADOD), at the start of the Schlesinger Race to Johannesburg. He was one of nine starters, but force landed 200 miles short of the race destination, and was the last of eight entries that failed to reach Johannesburg. On 29 May 1937, he flew a Miles Hawk Major (G-ADGE) from Hanworth in the London to Isle of Man Race. DH.88 Comet (G-ACSS), Gravesend, August 1937 In June 1937, he learned that the DH.88 Comet (G-ACSS), that won the 1934 MacRobertson Race, was for sale by a scrap dealer, after it had been damaged in Air Ministry testing. He persuaded architect Fred Tasker to purchase the Comet, and then arranged for it to be repaired with upgraded engines and propellers, by Jack Cross of Essex Aero at Gravesend Aerodrome. He entered the Comet for the planned 1937 New York to Paris air race, but the US Department of Commerce refused all necessary permissions for the race. The French government reorganised the race to run from Istres Airfield near Marseille, via Damascus, to Paris. The only inscriptions on the Comet were the registration and race number \\"G-16\\", but it was also nicknamed \\"The Orphan\\" to reflect the lack of sponsors. On 20 August 1937, accompanied by Flt Lt George Nelson as co-pilot of the Comet, Clouston took off from Istres as one of 13 entrants, of which all the others were more powerful, and all heavily sponsored by European governments. He arrived at Le Bourget in fourth position, a few minutes behind the Savoia-Marchetti S.73 of Bruno Mussolini. In 1937, Clouston broke the record for a return flight from England to Cape Town. Betty Kirby-Green was relatively new to flying, with an appetite for adventure, and agreed to help raise money for an attempt on the Cape record set by Amy Johnson in 1936. Burberry sponsored the flight and provided Burberry flying clothing, and their DH.88 Comet, G-ACSS was consequently named renamed \\"The Burberry\\". On 14 November 1937, Clouston and Kirby-Green took off from Croydon Aerodrome, and reached Cape Town on 16 November in a record 45 hours and two minutes. Their return journey of 57 hours and 23 minutes was also record-breaking. The DH.88 Comet has since been restored, and is now held at the Shuttleworth Collection. On 20 November, they arrived back at Croydon in dense fog, having broken several records and covered about 14,690 miles in less than six days. As a result, Clouston was awarded the Britannia Trophy and the Segrave Trophy, and Betty was awarded the Segrave Medal. On 4 December 1937, Clouston married Elsie Turner, the daughter of engineer Samuel Turner of Farnborough; they subsequently had two daughters. In December 1937, Daily Express air correspondent Victor Ricketts proposed to Clouston that they should attempt to break the England to Australia flight record. Ricketts arranged for sponsorship from the Australian Consolidated Press, and once again the DH.88 Comet G-ACSS was hired. It was overhauled and equipped with a small typewriter to compile press reports in flight for dispatch at refuelling stops. It was named \\"Australian Anniversary\\", representing the 150th anniversary of Australia. On 6 February 1938, Clouston and Ricketts took off from Gravesend Aerodrome. The first scheduled stop was to be Aleppo in Syria, but bad storms forced Clouston to land at a flooded airfield at Adana in Turkey. His permits were dismissed by Turkish officials, but next day he refuelled with unofficial help, and took off from a roadway, although damaging the undercarriage. He flew to an unmarked airfield on Cyprus, having abandoned the record attempt. Engineer Jack Cross, plus the financier and some equipment, was flown to Cyprus by Alex Henshaw in a Vega Gull borrowed from Charles Gardner. After repairs to the Comet, Clouston flew it back to Gravesend, accompanied by Jack Cross.Henshaw November 1984 On 15 March 1938, Clouston once again departed from Gravesend with Victor Ricketts in DH.88 Comet G-ACSS. He flew via Cairo, Basra, Allahabad, Penang and Singapore to Darwin, but without beating the 1934 record set by C. W. A. Scott and Tom Campbell Black in the same aircraft. He flew on to Sydney via Charleville, without being aware of the London to Sydney record, until massive crowds welcomed him there as a record-breaker. The next day, 20 March 1938, he flew across the Tasman Sea to Blenheim Municipal Aerodrome (Omaka) in New Zealand, setting more records. He then flew back to Australia, and continued on a return flight to Croydon, arriving in fog on 26 March 1938. He had established eleven records at the end of a round-trip of about 26,000 miles. On 2 July 1938, he flew BA Eagle 2 (G-AFIC) in the King's Cup Race at Hatfield Aerodrome, but was placed outside the top three. Second World War On 1 October 1939, Clouston rejoined the RAF, and served as a test pilot with the rank of flight lieutenant and acting squadron leader, in the Aerodynamics Flight at Farnborough. His activities included test flying of radio-controlled Airspeed Queen Wasp target drones. In June 1941, he was promoted to squadron leader. Although the unit operated some high speed fighters, it was forbidden to arm their weapons, but Clouston chased intruding German aircraft without damaging them. Increasing incursions led to orders to arm the fighters, and Clouston then claimed a shoot-down of a Heinkel 111 and a Messerschmitt Bf 110 during the same flight in a Spitfire. He carried out many flight tests using both tethered and untethered flares launched from a Handley Page Hampden flying behind a Whitley bomber, in experiments to illuminate target aircraft at night. He also flew tests with a Douglas Havoc, dispensing flash flares. In April 1941, he was attached to No. 219 Squadron, operating Beaufighters from RAF Redhill, to experience night fighter tactics. His reports to the Air Ministry led to improvements to cannons on Beaufighters, and better training for radar operators. On 12 May 1941, he was posted as CO of No. 1422 Flight RAF of the RAE based at RAF Heston. There he carried out testing of the Turbinlite concept of an aerial searchlight mounted on a Havoc night fighter, in collaboration with Group Captain William Helmore and with aeronautical engineer L.E. Baynes, nicknamed \\"The Baron\\", for whom he had great admiration. The next experiments involved dropping coils of wire suspended from parachutes, intended to interfere with the operation of intruding aircraft. Clouston conducted another trial instigated by Helmore, involving radio control of a full-size motor launch boat from a high-flying aircraft, using a Douglas DB-7 Havoc. He was also involved in testing the Leigh Light, an aerial searchlight designed to illuminate submarines and surface vessels, and trialled on a Vickers Wellington. In March 1943, Clouston was promoted to wing commander, and posted to command No. 224 Squadron firstly at RAF Beaulieu, then in April 1943 at RAF St Eval. The squadron was mainly involved in anti- submarine operations in the Bay of Biscay, operating B-24 Liberators with airborne radar and depth charges, later supplemented with Leigh lights. The Liberators were often attacked by formations of Bf 110s and Junkers Ju 88s, and in October 1943 Clouston was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions, followed in April 1944 by the Distinguished Service Order. In February 1944, he was promoted to group captain, and posted as commanding officer of RAF Langham, that was still under construction. Operations there started with No. 455 Squadron and No. 489 Squadron, both flying Beaufighters on anti-shipping missions in the North Sea area. In October 1944, the Beaufighter squadrons were replaced by No. 521 Squadron with Lockheed Hudsons and No. 524 Squadron with Wellingtons. Postwar In May 1945, Clouston was posted as CO of German airstrip B151 that was being developed into the headquarters of BAFO (British Air Forces of Occupation), and named RAF B√ºckeburg. In April 1946, he was appointed to a permanent commission with his existing rank of squadron leader. However, he was then offered the job of Director General of Civil Aviation of New Zealand. Instead of being released by the RAF, he was promoted to group captain, and given a two-year posting as commanding officer of RNZAF Base Ohakea, the main RNZAF strike base, operating de Havilland Mosquitos. In February 1950, he was posted as CO at RAF Leeming, then in July 1953 as commandant of ETPS (Empire Test Pilot School) at Farnborough. In October 1953, he was posted as SASO (Senior Air Staff Officer) at No. 19 Group, RAF Coastal Command. In July 1954, he was promoted to acting air commodore, then posted as Air Officer Commanding Singapore. In 1957, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and was given his final posting as commandant of Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down. On 7 April 1960, Arthur Clouston retired to Cornwall, and died on 1 January 1984.Henshaw, February 1984 Notes Bibliography *Clouston, A.E. 1954. The Dangerous Skies.

History The BIFR was established under The Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (SICA). The board was set up in January 1987 and became functional as of 15 May 1987. A new industrial policy was tabled in Parliament on 24 July 1991 aiming to maintain growth in productivity and gainful employment and to encourage the growth of entrepreneurship and upgrades to technology. That year the SICA was amended to include public sector enterprises in the board's purview. The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act of 2002 placed corporate debt outside the purview of the BIFR. By preventing reference to the BIFR, which had become a haven for the promoters of sick companies, the Act gives banks and financial institutions a better tool for recovering bad debt. It was complemented by the corporate debt restructuring package under which lenders and borrowers would meet to agree on a way of recasting stressed debt. National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) would take over the functions of the BIFR and other bodies and speed up the process of winding down sick companies. The Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2001 was introduced because the government considered that the BIFR had not met its objective of preventing industrial sickness. The Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003 replaced SICA and sought to dissolve the BIFR and the Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (AAIFR), replacing them by the NCLT and NCLAT. However, legal hurdles prevented the NCLT from being constituted. Structure and objectives The Board has a Chairman and from two to fourteen other members, all to be qualified as High Court judges or else to have at least fifteen years of relevant professional experience. The Board only handles large or medium-sized sick industrial companies in which large amounts have been sunk. Under the Sick Industrial Companies Act, the Board of a sick industrial company is legally obliged to report it to the BIFR, and the BIFR has the power to make whatever inquiries are needed to determine if the company is in fact sick. Among other objectives the act was to provide a way to revive sick industrial companies and release public funds. If a company is found to be sick, the BIFR can give the company reasonable time to regain health (bring total assets above total liabilities) or it can recommend other measures. The board can take other actions including changes to management, amalgamation of the sick unit with a healthy one, sale or financial reconstruction. The Board can recommend a sick industrial company for winding up. The BIFR was intended to bridge the legal gap between sickness and revival. It would impose time schedules for revival related activities to be completed, oversee their implementation and conduct periodic reviews of sick accounts. The BIFR would provide a forum for sharing views, coordinating effort and developing a unified approach to dealing with sick companies, speeding up the start of corrective action. The BIFR was meant to either turn companies around within six months or order closure. Activity and results By the end of March 1991, the BIFR had registered 1020 cases and heard 954. 175 were dismissed as not maintainable, and 124 were approved for the company to try to become net-worth positive on their own. Of the other 661 cases, the board sanctioned 182 revival plans and recommended that 120 cases be wound up. Up to the end of 2007, the BIFR had registered 5,471 references with 1,337 being recommended for winding up and 825 revival schemes being sanctioned. There were 66 sick Public Sector Enterprises registered with the board as of the end of March 2008, of which the government had approved 34 for revival. BIFR has had mixed success. Some examples of successful recoveries are the recovery of Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited in the 1980s, and more recently the turnaround of Arvind Mills, Scooters India and the North Eastern Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation. There have been many more cases where attempts to revive the companies failed, including Binny and Co., Calico Mills, Guest Keen Williams, Hindustan Cables, Metal Box Company and Wyman Gordon. Problems have included insufficient resources, delays and lack of political willingness to take tough decisions. The BIFR in practice often became a way of prolonging the life of unviable companies for years at taxpayer expense. According to former Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) chief Pradip Baijal, the board \\"was created to deal with the change in status quo outside government and given a quasi-judicial structure, to act in favour of public good, but has perhaps joined the tribe of numerous rent- seekers in the public ownership structure\\". Discussing MS Shoes, whose reference was registered by BIFR on 22.2.2002. The productions and export turnover of MS Shoes increased from Rs.25 crores to Rs.171.93 crores. The company came up with public issues which were over subscribed by more than 50 times the company attempted for 5 star hotel land and ready built guest house complex at Hudco Place, New Delhi for deluxe 5 star hotel and 4 star hotel. The reasons of sickness was devolvement of public issue of February 1995 and cancellation as well as forfeiture by Hudco of the amount paid by MS Shoes. Nirmala Ganapathy said: \\"One look at the track record of BIFR, and it doesn‚Äôt take a to conclude that it is nothing but a graveyard of companies. A tiny fraction comes out healthy ‚Äî only if the promoter is interested in putting it back up on its feet\\". The BIFR approved the revival scheme of the company as the promoters brought in Rs. 41.20 crores as on 31.3.2011 and Rs. 22.08 crores as loan to the company to be converted into equity shares further approving the promoters contribution to be converted into equity by increasing authorised capital from existing Rs. 90 crores to Rs. 200 crores. The promoters brought up the company to its healthy situation since the promoters were interested in putting the company back up on its feet.

The term Barnabotti derives form the fact that the group met and lived in the zone of the Campo San Barnaba. The presence of these nobles in this area is attested by toponyms such Cas√¨n dei Nobili, used to describe certain gambling houses. The area of Campo San Barnaba, being distant from the city centre, attracted lower rents. The term Barnabotti refers to those patricians who, although having lost much of their fortune, continued by law to maintain their seat in the Great Council of Venice, the assembly that governed the Venetian city and state. Although they maintained a position of political influence, due to their impoverishment the Barnabotti as a group were frequently involved in disputes with the rest of the nobility. Their lack of means, however, meant that they were susceptible to vote buying. Barnabotti were barred from commercial trades, and were therefore given a small allowance from the state. During the 17th century, efforts were made to improve the welfare of the Barnabotti, by establishing a school in 1617 for the special education of children, the Accademia della Giudecca. However, the number of poor nobles increased with the loss of the island of Crete and the migration of its nobles to the city of Venice. After the plague of 1630-1631, the number of nobles began to fall dramatically. An insider commented late in the 17th century that there were only fourteen or fifteen men capable of serving as Savio Grande. The need for recruiting noblemen was used to justify granting membership in the Great Council to rich patrons. Between 1645 and 1718, nobility was conferred on 127 persons, each of whom paid 100,000 ducats and were personally recommended by the Collegio. This, however, failed to reduce falling numbers. Membership fell from around 2,500 members in the mid-16th century, to 1,660 after the plague, and in 1775 membership was down to 1,300 members. Among adult Venetian males in 1520, about 6.4 percent were noblemen. By 1797, this number was down to 3.2 percent.

Koompartoo and her sister ferry, Kuttabul, commenced ferry service in 1922. The highest capacity ferries to ever run on Sydney Harbour, they were designed and built for the short heavy-lift run on the Circular Quay to Milsons Point across to Sydney's North Shore prior to the 1932 opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Following the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, both ferries were redundant. During World War II, they were requisitioned by the Royal Australian Navy. Kuttabul was sunk during the 1942 Japanese Attack on Sydney Harbour with the loss of 19 lives. Koompartoo was converted to a boom defence vessel and taken to Darwin. Following the War, she was laid up in Sydney until 1962 when she was taken to Launceston, Tasmania where her hull was used as bauxite barge. Her final fate is unclear. The name, \\"Koompartoo\\", is thought to be an Australian Aboriginal word meaning \\"fresh start\\", and the boat followed about twenty previous Sydney Ferries K-class vessels named with Aboriginal words starting with \\"K\\". Sydney Ferries Limited Sydney Ferry Koompartoo being launched, 1922 In the early twentieth century, prior to the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932, Sydney Ferries Limited was running one of the largest ferry fleets in the world to cater for booming demand for ferry services across Sydney Harbour to Sydney's North Shore. In particular, more and bigger ferries were needed to service the crowded Milsons Point to Circular Quay route (in the approximate location and route of the current Sydney Harbour Bridge). The Milson's Point wharf was an interchange with the North Shore rail terminus and is now the location of Luna Park. Peak hour ferries were leaving either side of the harbour at the rate of one fully loaded vessel every six minutes. An order was placed for two similar and very large steel-hulled high capacity ferries - Koompartoo and Kuttabul to service the short heavy-lift route. The two ferries were built in 1922 by the Walsh Island Dockyard and Engineering Works in Newcastle. At in length, and with very large beams of , the two vessels were the largest ferries owned by Sydney Ferries and the last of the company's K-class. The two boats represented the peak of the K-class design of double- ended ferries. Rated to 2,089 people, they had the highest passenger capacity of any ferries ever on Sydney Harbour, and could carry almost 500 people more than even the larger Manly ferries. thumb Koompartoo's 113 hp triple-expansion steam engine, built by the builder, pushed her to 12 knots. The two sister ferries were built with steel hulls and wooden superstructures unlike most other K-class ferries, which were built with timber hulls (sisters Kanangra and Kirawa, both 1912, also had steel hulls). Koompartoo was constructed with 18 watertight compartments, regarded as being unsinkable and therefore was not required to carry life saving equipment.The Koompartoo Sydney Morning Herald 13 April 1922 Koompartoo's livery generally followed the Sydney Ferries Limited tradition of varnished superstructures with white edging around the promenande deck. The steel hull and main deck bulwarks were painted a light grey. Her strikingly tall single funnel was painted black. With the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932, the once crowded Circular Quay to Milson's Point route was now effectively redundant. Koompartoo and Kuttabul were too big to be useful on the other cross harbour routes which also saw significant and sudden drops in trade, and the two ferries were laid up. Almost twenty Sydney Ferries were decommissioned in the two years following the bridge's opening. They were both of relatively young age and were considered for conversion to run the Manly route.Andrews (1975), p. 103 Koompartoo was later made available for tourist, spectator and concert cruises on the harbour.SS Koompartoo Ferries of Sydney Her wheel houses were raised (flying bridges) in the 1930s to allow her master to see over spectators on the decks. Her roles included service carrying crowds of passengers to the regular Head of the River rowing carnivals and following the sailing boat races that were growing in popularity at the time. This was also the period of the Great Depression and Koompartoo found a new career as a concert boat, a role she filled between 1935 and 1941. World War II HMAS Koompartoo at HMAS Waterhen In 1941, Koompartoo was purchased by the British Ministry of War Transport for service in the Middle East and taken to Mort's Dock for conversion. However with the outbreak of the Pacific War she was never deployed, instead being taken over by the Royal Australian Navy on 18 June 1942 and converted to a boom defence vessel. Armed with two 20mm Oerlikons and four Vickers .303 MGs, she was commissioned on 23 December 1942 under the command of Lieutenant GG Moss, RANR (S) and taken to Darwin in January 1943 where she served until the end of the war.. Held in reserve in Darwin from 1945 until 1950, she returned to Sydney and was laid up at Athol Bight. In April 1962, she was declared for disposal and sold out of the Service on 8 June 1962, stripped of her superstructure and towed to Launceston in 1966 for use as a bauxite barge.navy.gov.auAndrews (1975), p. 89 Her final fate is unclear, however, it is thought she may have sunk in Port Latta and then removed.facebook.comflickr.com Gallery File:Koompartoo New.jpgKoompartoo thought to be photographed new at Walsh Island Dockyard, 1922 File:Kaikai Kulgoa Koompartoo.jpgKoompartoo (right) circa mid to late 1930s after her wheelhouses were raised for spectator cruises.

For a few years, there were no reported cyclones, although many systems certainly formed. 1910 Three known tropical cyclones formed in 1910. The remnants of one of them entered southern California on September 15, bringing of rain to Santa Barbara County. 1911 Eleven known tropical cyclones formed in 1911 in the eastern Pacific proper. On September 11, Hurricane 4 of this year's Atlantic season survived passage over Central America and emerged into the Pacific Ocean, where it dissipated on September 12. On September 29, a ship reported strong winds and a pressure of 998 mbar inside a storm to the east of Hawaii. There were no other reports of this possible tropical cyclone. A \\"tropical hurricane\\" formed southwest of Mexico on October 1. The system recurved, coming ashore on October 4 near Guaymas, accompanied by a devastating storm surge early on the morning of October 5, with some 500 reported dead.Berkeley Daily Gazette, October 12, 1911, p.1 It then crossed through western Mexico, before becoming an extratropical cyclone across the American southwest on October 5. The cyclone had a long life thereafter, moving east-northeast across the United States into the western Atlantic on October 7. Racing northeast, the cyclone moved over the Polar ice cap on October 11, arcing north of Europe, before dropping into northern Asia on October 13, then crossing through Siberia until October 21, when the low dissipated. A \\"tropical hurricane\\" formed south of Mexico on October 6. The system moved north-northwest, making landfall west of Acapulco on October 8, before dissipating inland on October 10. 1912 Four known tropical cyclones formed in 1912. One of them, which stayed at sea, was tracked from August 10 to 11 of this year. A \\"tropical hurricane\\" formed southwest of Mexico on October 23. The cyclone moved northwest, then northward, through western Mexico on October 26 before dissipating on October 27. 1913 There was only one known tropical cyclone in 1913. 1914 There were no known tropical cyclones. 1915 Four tropical cyclones formed in 1915.

Zorio's artwork shows his fascination with natural processes, alchemical transformation, and the release of energy. His sculptures, paintings, and performances are often read as metaphors for revolutionary human action, transformation, and creativity. He is known for his use of materials including: incandescent electric light tubes, steel, pitch, motifs, and processes through the use of evaporation and oxidation. He also creates precarious installations using fragile materials such as Stella di Bronzo and Acidi within his work.  Education  Zorio studied at the Scuola di arte e di ceramica (School of Arts and Ceramics) and then the Academy of Fine Arts in Turin (1963-1970). Gilberto originally studied painting, but he soon moved on to sculpture and had his first solo show of three-dimensional works in 1967 at the Galleria Sperone, Turin. He continued to live there and teach after he graduated.  Early work  A lot of Zorio's early work tended toward that which the North American artist Robert Morris identified as a 'dedifferentiation' between the materials and forms of art in post minimalist sculptural practice. This led to Zorio presenting objects that asserted dynamic relationships with their materials and spatial or environmental context. This can be seen in Zorio's semi-cylinder of cobalt chloride which changed color in reaction to the spectator's presence. Throughout his career, Zorio was influenced by Michelangelo Pistoletto, Piero Gilardi, and Mario Merz. Zorio's early pieces done between 1966 and 1968 concretized energy processes. These works utilized the process of chemical reactions or simple physical actions (such as oxidation, evaporation, refining, or electric transmission). These early works are based on autonomous changes taking place within a given system, or on changes caused by outside intervention (e.g., by the viewer). These events and changes take place within the work occurring at a slow pace, turning the weight and impact of time and the relentless rhythm of nature into something tangible. Energy, both on the physical-chemical and emotional level, is common to all these processes. These concepts can be seen in pieces such as: Rosa-blu-rosa, Tenda, Piombi, Senza titolo, 1967 and Senza titolo, 1968.  Role in Arte Povera  Since his first exhibition at the Galleria Sperone in Turin in 1967, Gilberto Zorio's work has been linked to the history of Arte Povera. These first productions were strange objects, which were results of completed actions or ones that are still under way. Next came his work involving the action and reaction of the artist's body like in Odio (\\"hate\\" in Italian), a word inscribed with an ax in a wall. The role of words and speech is essential in these pieces. Zorio participated in the famous exhibition When Attitudes Become Form (1969), organized by Harald Szeemann in Bern. There Zorio presented Torcia, a radical piece where flaming torches, suspended above the ground, fall causing the collapse and destruction of the work itself. In 1969 he also exhibited in Paris for the first time along with New York for the event \\"Nine at Castelli\\" where, with Giovanni Anselmo, they were the only European artists, faced with artists of Process Art, Antiform and Post-minimal artists. \\\\- Translated from French Later in life, Zorio commented on the beginning of the Arte Povera movement and his role, with the other artists of the Arte Povera movement, that \\"leaving the box or leaving the framework, acting outside the framework, I don't know whether that was understood as a gesture of liberty, of freedom, whether we were understood as a force saying 'Here we are, we are ready to enter into dialog' I think a lot has to do with perception of the other and what happens around the perception of the other.‚Äù Zorio has stated that his belief in art is that ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be masked or disguised, and I think I can say that of the work of so many artists, it can't be masked or hidden or disguised. And that I think is a very positive fact, I mean you can physically destroy a work of art, you can try and affect its intrinsic strength as a result of the context in which it exists, but I don't think you can actually change it.\\" Themes =Alchemy= Like many of the artist of the expanded Arte Povera movement, Zorio professed faith in and practiced alchemy. This added to the reasons why Zorio identified with the luck-bringing five pointed pentagram, which is the symbol of Venus. Many of his pieces were influenced by this belief and influenced his choice in materials. An example of this is found in his pieces using mine lamps. One can interpret the lamp as a symbol for the enlightenment of the spirit. =Stella= Stars are a recurring theme in Gilberto's work. It became an obsession and he saw it as a part of the public imagination. He described his processes in these works by stating \\"I have done nothing more than make it, drag it in, and make use of it in favor I know not what of, though I hope and believe in favor of a need for energy and amazement.\\" =Canoe= Zorio has worked with the idea of canoes throughout his career. He created these using assorted materials such as pitch or steel. He describes a canoe as \\" A javelin of water, it is desire and dream, forward motion, the idea of effort, conquest, new landfalls.\\" = Giavellotti= Javelins are a recurring theme in Zorio's work. He used javelins as stand- alone objects and has also used them to work into other the themes. An example of this can be found in Zorio's piece titled Stella di giavellotti (Star of javelins). According to Zorio, the javelin is an instrument whose \\"design has been perfected through the millennia (and has) reached absolute beauty.\\" Works =Tenda (1967)= Zorio's Tenda is a work that plays with the laws of physics and chance. Zorio took a green cloth, which was soaked in salt water, draped it over a metal scaffolding, and clamped it in place. The salt water ran through the cloth and onto the ground, where it evaporated, leaving traces of salt on the cloth. This was shown at Sperone gallery, Turin, in Zorio's solo show in 1967. It was shown again in 'Con temp l'azione', in Turin in 1967. =Colonna (1967)= Zorio created Colonna (Column). This piece is a simple column made of asbestos that crushes a rubber tube. Zorio created three works with the same materials and dimensions that have been realized with the same title. Zorio commented on this piece saying, ‚ÄúRubber is a plant material, it becomes very hard with this cement that runs over it and it doesn‚Äôt touch the ground, in a terrifying balance, where the air chamber supports the overturned capital pipe. It is as if the breath were missing from a historic being, one might speak of feelings, of forces and relationships between present and past, but interpretations risk missing the mark.\\" =Rosa-blu-rosa (1967)= For Rosa-blu-rosa (Pink-blue-pink) Zorio created a half-cylinder of asbestos cement that contains a mixture of cobalt chloride. This causes it to changes color from pink to blue in relation to changes in atmospheric humidity. A defining feature of this work is, therefore, the contrast between its elemental form and its instability, including the static structure and its ability to change, identifying not in a state of quiet, but in an energetic process in perpetual transformation, thanks to which, the time becomes a constitutive element of the work. Germano Celant, an Italian art historian, critic, and curator, commented on this piece saying, \\"Thus this involves a time system that reacts to the changes that concern it, and its formal equilibrium, in the absence of an optimal or quiet state, is changed by external intervention; to experience the work, the viewer must be present, since it is his or her presence that necessarily transforms the appearance of the work. The change of color is not dictated by aesthetic principles, but by an extra-artistic element.\\" =Senza titolo (1968)= Zorio's Senza titolo (untitled) is a performative sculpture. Zorio took a bowl and filled it with a mix of bright yellow sulphur powder and iron powder. In the bowl of powder is a magnetic handle. As the participant drags the handle along the powder, it picks up the black iron powder thus creating black marks across the surface. Eventually the handle loses its magnetic pull and the iron will start falling back into the sulphur mixture. = Senza titolo (1969)= Zorio's Senza titolo (untitled) is a piece created out of bamboo branches, bonfire, Pyrex pot, and cement bricks. A bundle of bamboo sticks are suspended 40 cm above the floor. Below this, Zorio built a small fire between two cement blocks, on which he balanced an upturned Pyrex dish. When talking about this piece, Zorio comments that ‚ÄúIn my work... I see and proceed... with discontinuous movements; it is a way of acting and reflecting that takes into account senses of time and impulses that are at times very short while at other highly extended; it is a kind of exploration in which, sometimes, I am surprised to discover the remains of an old campsite of mine... It would be enough to light the fire again.\\" =Scrittura bruciata (1968-69)= Zorio's Scrittura bruciata (Burnt writing) is one of the sculptures which he used as part of a performance, as well as a stand-alone piece. A heated copper plate was placed inside a rectangular wire cage. A sheet of copper was attached to one side of the cage to make a ledge where Zorio placed a sheet of paper and a pen with invisible ink on top of it. Zorio wrote messages on the paper in invisible ink and dropped the page onto the hot plate where the words became visible for a few seconds until the paper burnt up. It was first exhibited at Sonnabend Gallery, Paris, 1969, and was shown later that year as part of the exhibition \\"Op losse schroeven\\" at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. =Per purificare le parole (1969)= Per purificare le parole was one of the first of Zorio's large series. This work is intended to be an interactive piece which facilitates the alchemical transformation of spoken language by filtering through alcohol. A long tube of soft hemp was filled with alcohol and attached to a metal frame. The tube was left with two open ends that were raised to the level of a standing persons height. This work becomes interactive when the spectator speaks into one end of the tube. His voice is then filtered, as it runs through the tube, and comes out at the other end of the tube \\"purified.\\" This work was originally shown at the 1970 \\"Gennaio '70: Third International Biennial of Young Painting,\\" Bologna. Zorio commented on this work saying, \\"Alcohol is a mystic liquid. It is also called 'spirits.' It disinfects, burns, inebriates, it transforms and modifies perception.\\" -Gilberto Zorio,\\" 1985. =Confine incandescente (1970-1971)= Zorio has used text as image throughout his career. He uses many different materials in the creation of these works. Examples of these are in pieces such as: Odio [hate], Confine [border], and Fluidit√† Radicale [radical fluidity]. Three different versions of Confine were created. In one the word confine was written in incandescent wire and hung in a room. Another version was created by photographer Paolo Mussat Sartor in 1971. Sartor used long exposure to photograph the artist sitting in Sartor studio with the word \\"confine\\" written in the air from the smoke of a cigarette. The smoke made it so that the artist could barely be seen. Another version was created by Zorio in 1971 when Zorio wrote \\"confine\\" on a gallery wall with luminous ink which was visible only when the lights were off. Every four minutes the lights would turn off for a few seconds to reveal the hidden ink before the lights turned on again. =Canoa (1984-1991)= Zorio created his first Canoa in 1984. That piece was formed of an elongated terracotta triangle which was balanced on a crucible. Zorio created this series out of many unconventional materials including: wood, leather, javelins, copper sulphate, hydrochloric acid, and alcohol. Morio's installations have a strong spatial presence, and his canoe has the same aerodynamic feel as the tips of his javelin piece, Stella di giavellotti (Star of javelins). This element is common in his work. Canoa is a real and symbolic piece which suggest fluidity, action, and speed. Zorio uses stars and crucibles in conjunction with his canoes which are associated with sailors and navigation.

Those imprisoned for debt could apply to the court to be released, unless they were in trade or guilty of fraudulent or other dishonest behaviour, by reaching an agreement with their creditors that ensured a fair distribution of their present and future assets.

Lovell sang on the motion picture soundtracks for several horror films during the early 1970s, including Scream Blacula Scream in 1973, The Return of Count Yorga in 1971, and Terror House. During the 1970s and 1980s, Lovell began to pursue other professions and interests outside of entertainment. She returned to college as an adult and became a therapist. She specifically focused on AIDS patients with the onset of the AIDS epidemic during the 1980s. Lovell and her husband, Peter Matz, held fundraisers which raised thousands of dollars for AIDS Project Los Angeles. Lovell continued her therapy practice during the 1990s.

In official documents, surnames usually appear before given names. Given names Romanians have one, two or more given names, e.g. Ana Cristina Maria (three given names), all being chosen by the child's parents. One of them, usually the first, is used in daily life while the others are solely for official documents, such as birth, marriage, or death certificates. Traditionally, most people were given names from the Romanian Orthodox calendar of saints. Common names of this type are Ion or Andrei for males and Maria or Elena for females. Given names with a Christian lineage have an identifiable English equivalent: Andrei (Andrew), Constantin (Constantine), Cristian (Christian), Daniel/Dan (Daniel/Dan), Gheorghe/George (George), Grigore (Gregory), Ilie (Elijah), Ion/Ioan (John), Iacob (Jacob/James), Lauren»õiu (Lawrence), Luca (Luke), Marcu (Mark), Matei (Matthew), Mihail/Mihai (Michael), Nicolae/Niculaie (Nicholas), Pavel/Paul (Paul), Petru/Petre (Peter), »òtefan (Stephen), Vasile (Basil). The most common name, MariaRom√¢nia, genera»õia 2010: Cele mai frecvente cinci nume de bƒÉie»õi »ôi fete; G√¢ndul.info, Retrieved 8 May 2012 is the equivalent of Mary. Maria has led to many closely related names such as Mariana, Marioara, Maricica, Maricela, MƒÉriuca, Mara, Marina, Marilena, Marieta, Marinela, Marisa, Mari»õa, Marusia, Mia, Mioara. Roman heritage is reflected in Romance given names such as Traian (Trajan), Titus, Marius, Octavian, Ovidiu (Ovid), Aurel (Aurelius), Cornel (Cornelius) etc. Such names are common especially in Transylvania. Dacian heritage is reflected through the name Decebal (from king Decebalus). Some names are inspired from nature, such as Sorin/Sorina (soare, \\"sun\\"), Codru»õ/Codru»õa or Codrin/Codrina (codru, \\"woods\\"), or flowers: Crin/Crina, Narcis/Narcisa, Viorel/Viorica, Anemona, Br√¢ndu»ôa, Camelia, Iolanda, LƒÉcrƒÉmioara etc. The word floare (\\"flower\\") has led to several names such as Florin/Forina, Florentin/Florentina, Florian/Floriana, Florica, Floarea, . Traditional Romanian names which come from Romanian words include Doina which means \\"doina\\", a traditional Romanian musical tune style, or Lumini»õa, meaning \\"little light\\", from the word \\"luminƒÉ\\" (light). The name LƒÉcrƒÉmioara refers to the name of a flower (lily of the valley), but also means \\"little tear\\", from the word \\"lacrimƒÉ\\" (tear). Crengu»õa means \\"little branch\\", from the word \\"creangƒÉ\\" (branch). Slavic influence on Romanian is present at all linguistic levels, including names. These include names containing the Slavic root -mir. Examples of Slavic names in Romanian include Bogdan, Drago»ô, Mircea, Radu, Tihomir, Vlad, Vladislav, Vladimir, Miroslav, Casimir, Anastasia, Irina, Milena, Olga, Raisa. Some common names are the names born by historical rulers (domnitori/voievozi), such »òtefan (»òtefan cel Mare), Mihai (Mihai Viteazu), Mircea (Mircea cel BƒÉtr√¢n), Vlad (Vlad »öepe»ô), Rare»ô (Petru Rare»ô), although not all parents make such associations, especially when the name in that of a Christian saint. Alexandru/Alexandra are very common names. They also include the variants of Alex, Alexia, Alexandrina, or the 'foreign' variants of Alessia, Alessandra, Alexa (see below). In the 1990s, as telenovelas started to be broadcast in Romania, Spanish/Latin American names have become popular; and the trend of giving children such names has been reinforced by the migration or travel of parents to Spain or Italy. As such, names like Mario, Antonio, Alberto, Esmeralda, Gianni, Giovanni, Alessia etc. are relatively common. Indeed, Mario, Antonio and Alessia were in the top 50 as baby names in 2009. The prevalence of given names follows trends, with some names being popular in some years, and some considered definitely out-of-fashion. As an example, few children born since 1980 would bear the names of Gheorghe, Vasile, or Ilie, which are generally associated with the idea of an elderly man (while the name of Gheorghe is rare among the younger generation, the variant George is more common). However, such \\"old-fashioned\\" names are sometimes used as middle names. By contrast, some names are associated with the younger generations: for example the feminine name Andreea become popular from the 1970s onwards, being one of the most common given names in the younger generations, ranking third in popularity among feminine names given to children born in 1989,http://www.b365.ro/care-sunt-cele-mai-populare-nume-la- romani_183417.html second in 2009,http://www.behindthename.com/top/lists/romania/2009 and fourth in 2014.http://www.gandul.info/stiri/top-10-cele-mai-populare-nume-la-baieti-si- fete-cum-au-ales-romanii-in-2014-numele-copiilor-13749047 Compound given names are uncommon, with only one notable exception, i.e. Ana-Maria (sometimes spelled Anamaria). In that case this is not considered to be two separate given names. Diminutives are often used as names (e.g. Ionu≈£, Ionel, Ionela, Ani≈üoara). Ionu≈£, a diminutive from Ion/Ioan, is one of the most common names in Romania. It ranked second in popularity among male names given to children born in 1989, third in 2009, and ninth in 2014. Romanian male given names end in a consonant (Adrian, Ion, Paul, »òtefan, Victor) or in any vowel other than -a (Alexandru, Andrei, Mihai), with some exceptions (Mircea, Mihnea),while almost all female names end in -a (Ana, Elena, Ioana, Maria), with only very few exceptions such as Carmen. This is most easily seen in the male-female name pairs: Gabriel-Gabriela, Ioan-Ioana, George-Georgiana, Mihai-Mihaela, Nicolae-Nicoleta, etc. The most common Romanian name is Maria, with approximately 1.38 million females having it as one of their given names. Also, almost 1.37 million Romanians have Ion, Ioan and Ioana as one of their given names. The most common names are: * For males: Alexandru, Adrian, Andrei, Mihai, Ionu≈£, Florin, Daniel, Marian, Marius, Cristian for all males.http://www.name-statistics.org/ro/prenumecomune.php For boys born in 2014 they are: Andrei, David, Alexandru, Gabriel, Mihai, Cristian, ≈ûtefan, Luca, Ionu≈£, Darius. * For females: Ana-Maria, Mihaela, Andreea, Elena, Alexandra, Cristina, Daniela, Alina, Maria, Ioana for all females. For girls born in 2014, they are: Maria, Elena, Ioana, Andreea, Sofia, Alexandra, Antonia, Daria, Ana, Gabriela. The given name can be changed on request, but it is necessary to prove a legitimate interest for the change (usually that the current name is a cause of mockery etc.). Surnames Like in most of Europe, in Romania it is customary for a child to take its father's surname, and a wife her husband's surname. In cases where paternity is not established, the child takes the mother's surname. The law however is flexible, allowing for the couple to choose their family name, and thus the surname they would use for all their children. Typically it is the father's surname (in keeping with the tradition), but parents may also opt to use the mother's surname; or for both of the spouses to have both surnames; or for one spouse to use a double-barrelled name. Romanian law does not require any of the spouses to change their surname, but in practice in most families both spouses will have the husband's original surname. If parents have different surnames, a child will have either the surname of one of them, or both surnames. Romanian surnames remain the same regardless of the sex of the person. After a divorce, the spouse who changed the surname (usually the wife) will generally revert to the original surname. However, the married surname can be retained, either with the consent of both spouses, or by court order. If the other spouse does not consent to the retaining of the surname, the spouse who wants to retain it can petition the court and ask it for permission. The relevant laws are Art. 282, Art. 383 Art. 449 Art. 450. of the Civil Code of Romania. Until the 19th century, the names were primarily of the form \\"[given name] [father's name] [grandfather's name]\\". The few exceptions are usually famous people or the nobility (boyars). The name reform introduced around 1850 had the names changed to a western style consisting of a given name followed by a family name (surname). As such, the name is called prenume, while the family name is called nume or, when otherwise ambiguous, nume de familie (\\"family name\\"). Middle names (second given names) are also fairly common. Many Romanian names are derivative forms obtained by the addition of some traditional Romanian suffixes, such as -escu, -ƒÉscu, -eanu, -anu, -an, -aru, -atu, or -oiu. These uniquely Romanian suffixes strongly identify ancestral nationality. Historically, when the family name reform was introduced in the mid-19th century, the default was to use a patronym, or a matronym when the father was dead or unknown. A typical derivation was to append the suffix -escu to the father's name, e.g. Ionescu (\\"Ion's child\\") and Petrescu (\\"Petre's child\\"). The -escu is derived from Latin -iscum, and cognate with Italian -esco and French -esque, but its pervasiveness in Romanian may have come from Slavic influence, by way of Old Slavonic -—åsk—ä (which is in fact cognate to Latin -iscum via Proto-Indo-European). Another common derivation was to append the suffix -eanu or the simpler forms -anu and -an to the name of a place, river, village, or region, e.g. Ardeleanu (from Ardeal), Moldoveanu (from Moldova), Mure»ôanu (from Mure»ô), Sadoveanu etc. (cognate to Italian -(i)ano). They may indicate a country or ethnic origin (e.g. Grecu - from Greece, Ungureanu - from Hungary, Rusu - from Russia). The suffix -cea (as in Mihalcea, Grigorcea, Neculcea, Oncea, etc.) is Slavic. Furthermore, the Slavic influence on Romanian has manifested itself by way of the emergence of Romanian surnames of Slavic origin (as in Bucinschi, Chirilov, Covaci, Levandovschi, Marcovici, Novac, etc.). There are also descriptive family names derived from occupations or nicknames, e.g. Ciobanu/PƒÉcuraru (\\"shepherd\\"/\\"pitch-maker/pitch-vendor\\"), Croitoru (\\"tailor\\"), Fieraru (\\"smith\\"), Moraru (\\"miller\\"), BƒÉlan (\\"blond\\"), »öƒÉranu (\\"villager\\") etc. Also some Romanian surnames come from various animals and plants, most probably being former nicknames, with or without the addition of various suffixes, e.g. Bourean(u) (\\"ox\\"), CƒÉpreanu (\\"goat\\"), Jderoiu (\\"marten\\"), Lupu (\\"wolf\\"), Ursu (\\"bear\\"), Zimbrean (\\"bison\\"), Vidraru (\\"otter\\"). Some surnames come from colors: e.g. Ro»ôu (Red), Negru (Black), Albu (White). The most common Romanians surnames in 2007 were Popa (191,938 people), meaning priest and Popescu (147,784 people), meaning priest's son/daughter.

It was first identified in a 1944 paper by J. F. Villalta and M. Crusafont in . Anthropologists disagree as to whether Hispanopithecus belongs to the subfamily Ponginae (most closely related to modern orangutans) or Homininae (most closely related to gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans). The genus contains two known species: Hispanopithecus laietanus and Hispanopithecus crusafonti. The fossils have been dated to between 11.1 and 9.5 million years ago. Morphology Postcranial features exhibit morphological features that suggest a mosaic of locomotive behaviors. The structure of the cortical bone at the proximal and distal ends of the femur, particularly the neck of the femoral head, indicate an orthograde body plan.Pina, M, Alba, D, Alm√©cija, S, Fortuny, J, & Moy√†-Sol√†, S 2012, \\"Brief communication: Paleobiological inferences on the locomotor repertoire of extinct hominoids based on femoral neck cortical thickness: The fossil great ape Hispanopithecus laietanus as a test-case study\\", American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 149, 1, p. 142-148, Scopus, EBSCOhost, viewed 23 October 2014. Recovered vertebrae indicate a relatively short, wide, and deep thorax support the orthograde posture for climbing, clambering, and feeding in an arboreal environment. The longer forelimbs and dorsally situated scapulae provide a broad range of motion which would enable suspensory below-branch behavior and proficiency in reaching food during foraging.Susanna, I, Alba, D, Alm√©cija, S, & Moy√†-Sol√†, S 2014, 'The vertebral remains of the late Miocene great ape Hispanopithecus laietanus from Can Llobateres 2 (Vall√®s-Pened√®s Basin, NE Iberian Peninsula)', Journal of Human Evolution, 73, p. 15-34, Scopus, EBSCOhost, viewed 23 October 2014. The humeral-ulnar joint allowed for hyperextension and flexion of the forearm.Alba, D, Alm√©cija, S, Casanovas- Vilar, I, M√©ndez, J, & Moy√†-Sol√†, S 2012, \\"A Partial Skeleton of the Fossil Great Ape Hispanopithecus laietanus from Can Feu and the Mosaic Evolution of Crown-Hominoid Positional Behaviors\\", Plos ONE, 7, 6, pp. 1-16, Academic Search Premier, EBSCOhost, viewed 23 October 2014. The robust carpals and metacarpals with dorsally extended articular surfaces provide strong indication of palmigrade quadrupedalism in above-branch locomotion. The proximal phalanges are strongly curved and relatively long when compared to other great apes and most closely resembling the structure of extant orangutans. The length and curvature of the manual phalanges indicates the 'double-locking' mechanism similar to orangutans and enable a powerful grip around slender branches.Alm√©cija, S, Alba, D, Moy√†-Sol√†, S, & K√∂hler, M 2007, 'Orang-Like Manual Adaptations in the Fossil Hominoid Hispanopithecus laietanus: First Steps towards Great Ape Suspensory Behaviours', Proceedings: Biological Sciences, 1624, p. 2375, JSTOR Journals, EBSCOhost, viewed 23 October 2014. The body mass estimates of recovered specimens provides strong evidence of sexual dimorphism. The males have been estimated to weigh approximately and possess prominent canine teeth. The females have been estimated to weigh approximately and possess reduced canine teeth. The dental formula of Hispanopithecus, common to great apes, is with the Y5 occlusal surface present on the lower molars. Diet and environment Analysis of the microwear of the teeth of Hispanopithecus indicate a morphological preference for softer foods, including fruits and possibly young leaves. A combination of surface scratches and pitting are indicative of a mixed diet, lacking many hard foods like nuts and seeds except in times of soft food scarcity and lacking wear patterns common with heavy folivore diets.DeMiguel, D, Alba, D, & Moy√†-Sol√†, S 2014, 'Dietary specialization during the evolution of Western Eurasian hominoids and the extinction of European great apes', Plos ONE, 9, 5, Scopus¬Æ, EBSCOhost, viewed 23 October 2014. Linear hypoplasia is common, which would suggest episodes of malnutrition stress during dental development, indicating the need for fall-back foods in the diet when preferred foods are unavailable. Evidence suggests that the environment of Hispanopithecus on the Iberian Peninsula was tropical to subtropical with marsh-like features. Flora of the period is preserved as samples of evergreen laurels, palms, reeds, and marsh herbs in wet areas and diverse leguminous trees and shrubs in lowland dry areas. Figs have been preserved in the stratographic layer which also contained hominid teeth, which would have been available year-round in the Middle Miocene.Alba, D, Casanovas-Vilar, I, Alm√©cija, S, Robles, J, Arias- Martorell, J, & Moy√†-Sol√†, S 2012, 'New dental remains of Hispanopithecus laietanus (Primates: Hominidae) from Can Llobateres 1 and the taxonomy of Late Miocene hominoids from the Vall√®s-Pened√®s Basin (NE Iberian Peninsula)', Journal of Human Evolution, 63, 1, p. 231-246, Scopus¬Æ, EBSCOhost, viewed 23 October 2014. The climate changed in the Late Miocene to a cooler, dryer, less tropical environment. This would have brought seasonal change which would have impacted the available food sources of Hispanopithecus, possibly contributing to extinction near this time.Marmi, J, Casanovas-Vilar, I, Robles, J, Alba, D, & Moy√†-Sol√†, S 2012, 'The paleoenvironment of Hispanopithecus laietanus as revealed by paleobotanical evidence from the Late Miocene of Can Llobateres 1 (Catalonia, Spain)', Journal of Human Evolution, 62, 3, p. 412-423, Scopus¬Æ, EBSCOhost, viewed 23 October 2014.

She was launched in May 1793 at Bayonne.Demerliac (1996), p. 106, #739. The British frigates and captured Pr√©voyante in 1795 and the British took her into the Royal Navy after first converting her to a fifth rate. She served as a frigate until 1800, when she underwent reconversion back to a store ship. As a store ship she sailed to the Mediterranean, Cape of Good Hope, and Quebec. She was sold for breaking up in July 1819. French career and capture In late 1794, Admiral Jervis signed a safe-conduct pass for Prevoyante so that she could repatriate British prisoners of war.University of Durham, Catalogue of the Papers of the 1st Earl Grey On 2 May 1795 Rear Admiral George Murray sent Captain Alexander Cochrane in Thetis, together with Hussar, to intercept three French supply ships reported at Hampton Roads. At daybreak on 17 May the British came upon five ships 20 leagues West by South from Cape Henry. The French made a line of battle to receive the British frigates. An action commenced, with three of the French vessels eventually striking their colours. Thetis took possession of the largest, which turned out to be Pr√©voyante, pierced for 36 guns but only mounting 24. Hussar captured a second, Raison, pierced for 24 guns but only mounting 18. One of the vessels that had struck nonetheless sailed off. Two of the five had broken off the fight and sailed off earlier. (The three that escaped were Normand, Trajan, and Hernoux.) An hour after she had struck, Pr√©voyantes main and foremast fell over the side. In the battle, Thetis had lost eight men killed and nine wounded; Hussar had only two men wounded. Four of the French ships had escaped from Guadeloupe on 25 April. They had sailed to American ports to gather provisions and naval stores to bring back to France. Cochrane had intended to leave the prizes in charge of the cutter Prince Edward after repairing the damage to his vessel during the night. However, a breeze picked up and by morning the escaping French vessels were out of sight. The British sailed with their prizes to Halifax. British frigate Admiral Murray commissioned Prevoyante under Captain John Poo Beresford, who had been captain of Hussar. He proceeded to pay for some of her fitting out from his own pocket. They also took into service. While on the Halifax station, Hussar, Captain Charles Wemyss, and Prevoyante captured the ship Minerva on 10 May 1796. Six or so months after Beresford had assumed command, the Admiralty appointed him to Raison and Charles Wemyss to Prevoyante.Ralfe (1820), pp.100-101. Then Beresford apparently returned to command of Prevoyante as he was in command when Prevoyante captured the ship Argus on 7 August 1797. In October 1797 Wemyss replaced Beresford on Prevoyante, On 9 November 1798 Prevoyante captured the brig Norge. In January 1799, Captain J. Seater replaced Wemyss. On 16 May, Prevoyante captured the schooner Caroline. Prevoyante was among the many British vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture of the French frigate D√©sir√©e, which HMS Dart, under Patrick Campbell, captured on 8 July 1800 in the Raid on Dunkirk. Prevoyante was serving on the North Sea station when she shared in the seizure of the 40-gun Danish frigate Freya on 25 July 1800 off Ostend.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.157. The seizure of the Freya for opposing the British right of search led to strained relations with Denmark. The British government had to dispatch Lord Charles Whitworth to Copenhagen, with a substantial Royal Navy escort, to convince the Danes to drop the matter. This incident and another in Malta ultimately led in the next year to the British capturing Copenhagen. At the capitulation the British again captured Freya, which they then added to the Royal Navy as . British store ship On 10 September 1800 Prevoyante arrived as Sheerness. Between October and May 1801 she was at Sheerness and Deptford fitting out as a store ship. In 1803 she was at Woolwich under the command of Mr. William Brown, Master. On 25 April she arrived at Plymouth with a cargo of hemp and iron intended for the dockyards. She had left Malta about a month earlier.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 9, p.333. On the leg from Gibraltar, Prevoyante was in company with and when they sighted two French ships of the line off Cape St. Vincent. The French ships veered off rather than engage the British vessels.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 9, p.337. On 10 December 1804, Prevoyante was under the command of Mr. Daniel M'Coy when she was in company with when Defence captured the Spanish vessel \\"Detipente\\". Defence, Prevoyante, and Guerrier shared in the capture of the Spanish ship Diligente on 30 December. Prevoyante shared with and in the proceeds from the capture on 11 June 1805 of the Prussian ship Edward. The proceeds were forwarded from Gibraltar. Prevoyante, still under Mr. M'Coy's command, sailed for the Cape of Good Hope on 30 August 1806. She then sailed for the Mediterranean on 28 June 1807. She underwent repair between May 1811 and May 1812. In 1813 her master was Mr. Stephen Trounce. His replacement, in September 1814, was Mr. Thomas Stokes. On 15 January 1815 and left Rio de Janeiro, escorting a convoy that included the storeships Prevoyante and , and seven merchantmen.Lloyd's List, - accessed 26 November 2013.

The ICBG had as its aim to document the biodiversity of Chiapas, Mexico and the ethnobotanical knowledge of the indigenous Maya people ‚Äì to ascertain whether there were possibilities of developing medical products based on any of the plants used by the indigenous groups. While the project had taken many precautions to act ethically in its dealings with the indigenous groups, the project became subject to severe criticisms of the methods used to attain prior informed consent. Among other things critics argued that the project had not devised a strategy for achieving informed consent from the entire community to which they argued the ethnobotanical knowledge belonged, and whom they argued would be affected by its commercialization. The project's directors argued that the knowledge was properly to be considered part of the public domain and therefore open to commercialization, and they argued that they had followed established best practice of ethical conduct in research to the letter. After a public discussion carried out in the media and on internet listservers the project's partners pulled out, and the ICBG was closed down in 2001, two years into its five years of allotted funding. The Maya ICBG case was among the first to draw attention to the problems of distinguishing between benign forms of bioprospecting and unethical biopiracy, and to the difficulties of securing community participation and prior informed consent for would-be bioprospectors. Events =Background= In 1993 National Institute of Health, National Science Foundation and USAID established the International Cooperative Biodiversity Group (ICBG) program to promote collaborative research on biodiversity between American universities and research institutions in countries that harbor unique genetic resource in the form of biodiversity. The basic aim of the program was to benefit both the host community and the global scientific community by discovering and researching the possibilities for new solutions to human health problems based on previously unexplored genetic resources. It therefore seeks to conserve biodiversity, and to foment, encourage and support sustainable practices of usage of biological resources in the Global South. Projects would be initiated by principal investigators who would apply for a five-year period of funding, and who would establish the terms of the collaboration.Rosenthal, Joshua. The International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups (ICBG) Program. =Maya ICBG= In 1998 the renowned ethnobotanist Brent Berlin and his wife, Dr. Eloise A. Berlin, founded an International Cooperative Biodiversity Group ‚Äì the Maya ICGB.B Berlin, E A Berlin, J C F Ugalde, L G Barrios, D Puett, R Nash, M Gonzalez-Espinoza. 1999.

The group was intended as a combined bioprospecting and research cooperative between the University of Georgia where the Berlins were employed, the ECOSUR (a University in Chiapas), a small Welsh pharmaceutical company called Molecular Nature ltd., and a newly created NGO called PROMAYA supposed to represent the Indigenous Maya of Chiapas. The two primary investigators had worked for more than 40 years documenting and describing the ethnobotany of the Tzeltal Maya of the region.Brown, Michael F. 2004. Who Owns Native Culture?

International Social Science Journal, 55: 629‚Äì638. doi: 10.1111/j.0020-8701.2003.05504012.x The aim of the project was to collect and document the ethnobotanical knowledge of the Maya people of Chiapas, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots.James V. Lavery (2007). \\"Case 1: Community Involvement in Biodiversity Prospecting in Mexico\\". Ethical Issues in International Biomedical Research: A Casebook. Oxford University Press. p. 23. =PROMAYA= The NGO PROMAYA was established as a foundation that could receive a percentage of the profits from any marketable products resulting from the research, as well as exercise rights over the uses to which the indigenous knowledge would be put. As such, PROMAYA represented the project's will to comply with valid ethical standards and share rights and benefits with the original holders of the medicinal knowledge. Berlin began the NGO by contributing $30,000, money he had personally received as an award for his research. The benefit share agreement on any profits derived from the project allotted the majority to the Welsh pharmaceutical company, about 12‚Äì15 percent to the University of Georgia and 2‚Äì5% to the PROMAYA NGO. The plan was that Maya communities could then petition for grants from the NGO, to be used for community development.Preston Hardison. 2000. ICBG-Maya: A Case Study in Prior Informed Consent The Monthly Bulletin of the Canadian Indigenous Caucus on the Convention on Biological Diversity November 2000 No. 16 =Information campaign= The project began with an information campaign directed at the Maya communities with which they wished to cooperate. Using the medium of theater they presented the aims and goals of the project to the Maya. The information step was a vital part of the project's attempt to obtain a prior informed consent from members of the participating communities. The project made the deliberate decision not to include information about the possibility that profits would eventually be made from the knowledge collected, or information how any potential benefits would be divided among them, surmising that the chance of this happening was so slim that it would be a better strategy to introduce this issue when and if it were to arise. This decision would later be an important point of criticism by activists claiming that prior informed consent had not been obtained. =The controversy= Soon after being initiated, the project became the subject of harsh criticisms by indigenous activists and Mexican intellectuals who questioned how knowledge obtained from individual Maya could be patented by researchers or foreign pharmaceutical companies, how the PROMAYA NGO established by the Berlins and under their control could be considered representative of the many different Maya communities in Chiapas, and how it was possible for the knowledge that had been collective property of the Maya peoples to become suddenly privatized without the prior consent of each of the individual initial holders of the knowledge. Among the most vocal opponents of the project were RAFI, a Canadian NGO, and COMPITCH an organization of indigenous healers. Much of the criticism was circulated on listservers and in internet fora.Organizaciones indigenas denuncian biopirateria en Chiapas ‚Äì Biopiracy Project in Chiapas, Mexico Denounced by Mayan Indigenous Groups 12/01/1999 RAFI \\"Stop Biopiracy in Mexico!\\" Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Organizations from Chiapas Demand Immediate Moratorium The Berlins argued that the establishment of the NGO was the only feasible way of managing benefit sharing with the community and of obtaining prior informed consent, and that since the traditional knowledge was in the public domain among the Maya no individual Maya could expect remuneration. As tensions mounted the Mexican partner UNAM withdrew its support for the project, and later the NIH causing the project to be closed down in 2001 ‚Äì without having been able to produce any results.GENTECH archive listserv.

Marie, Michigan. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1956 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Henry Rowe Schoolcraft Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, 1855 Henry Rowe Schoolcraft (March 28, 1793 - Dec. 10, 1864) was a notable author, explorer, and Native American culture expert. Schoolcraft was born on March 28, 1793 in Albany County, New York. In 1817, he participated in a mineralogical trip through what is now Missouri and Arkansas, and in 1820 he was the topographer on an expedition through the upper Mississippi River and Lake Superior regions. After publishing an 1821 book on his travels, Schoolcraft was appointed in 1822 as US Indian agent at Sault Ste. Marie. There, Schoolcraft accepted an invitation from John Johnston to stay at his house. In 1823, Schoolcraft married Jane Johnston Schoolcraft, daughter of Johnston and his wife Ozhaguscodaywayquay, herself the daughter of Ojibwe war chief Waubojeeg, After their marriage, the couple continued to live in the Johnston house. The Schoolcrafts had four children: William (1824), who died young, a stillborn daughter in 1825, Janee in 1826 and John in 1829. Henry Schoolcraft remained an Indian Agent at Sault Ste. Marie and (in 1833) Mackinac Island, and became superintendent of Indian affairs in 1836. In 1841, he resigned his commission and moved to New York City. Perhaps due to the death of their first two children, Henry and Jane grew estranged, and Jane died soon after Henry's resignation in 1841. Schoolcraft wrote further about Indian culture, and died on Dec. 10, 1864 in Washington, D.C. Schoolcraft House History After being appointed to his position in Sault Ste. Marie, Schoolcraft requested the construction of a suitable building to house the agency. Schoolcraft designated a site, and plans were drawn up by Obed Wait, who had earlier designed Michigan's territorial capitol located in Detroit. Construction began in 1826 and was completed in 1827. The building, dubbed \\"Elmwood\\" due to the surrounding elms, was the headquarters for Indian affairs throughout the upper Great Lakes, as well as the home of the Schoolcrafts, from its construction until 1833, when the agency headquarters was relocated to Mackinac Island. The building was still used by the agency through the 1830s and 1840s. In 1853, the government leased Elmwood to Charles T. Harvey, who supervised the construction of the first Soo Locks while living in the house. Sault Ste. Marie merchant and businessman Peter Barbeau purchased the building in 1874 when the government sold it. Around the 1880s, substantial Queen Anne-style alterations were done to the building, diminishing the \\"classical elegance\\" of the original design. Around 1900, the building, along with a swath of the surrounding shoreline, was sold to the Michigan Lake Superior Power Company. It was used as an office building, then lay vacant for decades while owned by Union Carbide. It was used in the 1950s and 1960s to display the collection of the Chippewa County Historical Society. In 1979, Elmwood was moved from its original location at 705 East Portage Avenue to its current location at 435 East Water Street, next to the John Johnston House. At the same time, the building was restored to its original footprint, in particular removing the extensive 1880s additions. It is planned to reconstruct the original Federal- style appearance of the structure. The west wing, that originally housed the Indian Affairs Agency, is open to the public. Description Elmwood before the 1880s remodel. The original section of Elmwood was a Federal style building, with a two-story central section and single-story wings on each side connected to the central section via breezeways. The entire structure was nearly long, with a veranda running the full length. The interior had 15 rooms. The building was originally situated directly on the banks of the St. Marys River, within a grove of maples, mountain ash, and elms (from which it took its name).

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1958. John Johnston John Johnston (1762‚Äì1828) was born on August 25, 1762 in Northern Ireland, the son of William Johnston and Elizabeth McNeil, well-to-do landowners. In 1790, he moved to what is now Canada, and became associated with the North West Company, a fur trading company headquartered in Montreal, Quebec. In 1791, Johnston went on a trading trip to Mackinac Island, and continued on himself, establishing a trading post on the Bad River near what is now Ashland, Wisconsin and befriending the local Ojibwe. At the end of the season, Johnston took his furs to Montreal, but in 1792 returned to the Bad River area and married Ozhaguscodaywayquay, the daughter of Ojibwe war chief Waubojeeg. In 1793, Johnston and his wife settled in the Sault to trade with the native residents there. The couple had four sons and four daughters, including Jane Johnston Schoolcraft, who married notable author, explorer, and Native American culture expert Henry Rowe Schoolcraft. John Johnston was Justice of the Peace in Sault Ste Marie for many years. He remained in Sault Ste. Marie for the rest of his life, remaining in the fur trade. In 1812, Johnston helped British troops take control of Fort Mackinac on Mackinac Island. In 1814, American forces burned his house, as well as $40,000 of his goods, in retaliation. However, Johnston rebuilt, in part by selling his parent's estate in Ireland, and became connected with John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company. John Johnston died on September 22, 1828. History of the John Johnston House In 1794, John Johnston constructed a house on this site. That house was destroyed in 1814 by American forces in retaliation for Johnston's aid to the British in the War of 1812. Johnston rebuilt the house in 1815. In 1822, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft was appointed US Indian agent at Sault Ste. Marie. Schoolcraft married John Johnston's eldest daughter Jane in 1822, and Johnston built a substantial addition to the 1815 structure for them to live in. This addition comprises the whole of the current Johnston House. The Schoolcrafts lived in this house until 1827, when they moved into Elmwood, the Indian Agency headquarters in the Sault. Colonel Eben S. Wheeler lived in the house from 1883 to 1900; Wheeler added the dormer windows and made further architectural changes. In 1910, a tree fell on the house, demolishing the original 1815 section. The Great Lakes Towing Company purchased the house shortly thereafter. In 1949, they gave the house to the city of Sault Ste Marie, and it was restored by architects Mayer and Savoie. Thou house is currently used as an architecture and construction exhibit of the common look of houses of the period. In the 1980s, three other historic structures were moved to a location near the Johnston House, including Henry Rowe Schoolcraft's Elmwood.

Description The John Johnston House is a rectangular, 1-1/2 story house, constructed of cedar logs and covered with clapboards. Two gabled dormers are in the roof. The first floor contains five rooms and a central hall. An early description of the house, written before the destruction of the 1815 section of the Johnston house, said: :The house was one of the finest in the North at the time it was built. Someone has described it as a long, low, well-built log house in a beautiful old-fashioned garden, where roses, lilacs, sweet williams, bachelor buttons, marigolds, and other flowers grew luxuriantly. When Johnston lived there, the great sideboard in the dining room was lipped with many pieces of solid silver brought from his ancestral home in Ireland; while the portraits, massive-framed, upon the walls, and the many foreign articles about the rooms, aroused great wonder and admiration...

The structure is 2-1/2 stories on a poured concrete foundation with a wood frame superstructure. It consists of a main power plant building, a 1-1/2 story residence and a 1-story cookhouse. The power plant foundation is distinctive, with semicircular windows. A semicircular bay with arched windows projects out on a rock spur. History The Smuggler-Union Hydroelectric Powerplant was built to power the Smuggler-Union Mine below in 1907, providing alternating current for industrial purposes. The plant was proposed by Smuggler-Union Mine manager Buckley Wells who lived in the residence as a summer home until the 1920s.Katie Klingsporn, At Bridal Veil, a new chapter Long-time owner/operator Eric Jacobson terminates lease, telluridenews.com, October 5, 2010 It was originally accessed in winter by an aerial tramway but that was eventually destroyed. It operated in its original configuration until its decommissioning in 1953, serving the Idarado Mining Company. The living quarters and especially the power house/generator fell into disrepair and were heavily vandalized by the time of the historic registry survey in 1979. A local resident, Eric Jacobson, acquired a 99-year lease from the Idarado Mining Company for the property in 1988 and proceeded to restore the facility and eventually moved his family into the residence. The AC plant was restored to operation in 1991 with power being generated by its original 2300 volt Westinghouse Electric AC generator, one of the oldest AC generators still in operation.M. Whelan, The History of Electrification: Ames and Smuggler-Union Power Plants at Telluride, edisontechcenter.orgCOLORADO & UTAH TOURBOOK, 2004, page 130 In 2010 Jacobson gave up the lease to the Idarado Mining Company citing continual regulation and legal problems associated with the site. Idarado has kept the plant in operation and the power generated now provides about 25 percent of Telluride's demand for electricity. As of 2012, the plant generates approximately 2,000 megawatt hours a year ‚Äì enough electricity to power about 2,000 average American homes, which is purchased from Idarado by the local San Miguel Power Association.Bridal Veil Power To Be Used Locally, Watch Newspapers, Jul 04, 2012 The Smuggler-Union Powerplant was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 27, 1979.

Two mothers from entirely different worlds play major roles in the story. Ofelia is a human, who struggles for the acceptance of her mother-in-law, and hopes that with the birth of her daughter she will gain the happiness and acceptance of her husband's family. Neptuna, an adult mermaid with a bright orange-and-gold scaly fish tail and matching bra whose pure and strong motherly love for her daughter, Perlita, knows no bounds and will do anything to make sure she is safe and happy. Neptuna's daughter Perlita was fascinated with humans and dreams of living happily with them, often going near the seashore to watch the humans. She even once stole the mystical pearl that can transform a mermaid into a human and back at will. Unfortunately, when she went near the seashore to watch humans who were watching and playing with firecrackers, a drunken villager played with a dynamite. Victor, Ofelia's good husband, confronts him and unknowingly throws the dynamite into the part of the sea where Perlita was hiding. Neptuna went to warn her daughter, but was not able to make it in time. Thus, she saw the death of her dearly beloved daughter and angrily promises to do everything she can to make Victor and Ofelia feel the intense pain and sorrow of losing their own beloved daughter. Ofelia and Victor's child, whom they named Aryana, was then born. As Ofelia was hoping for, she gained the acceptance of her mother-in-law. During Aryana's baptismal celebration, Neptuna (as a human woman) steals newborn Ayrana, making her as her own daughter for a while until she discovered that she cannot make Aryana a complete mermaid unless her mother gives her to her willingly. Reluctantly, Neptuna gave Aryana back to Ofelia with the agreement that on Aryana's fourteenth birthday she must give her back to her. Ofelia desperately accepts, and with no intention of giving her daughter back, she runs away from their seaside village and goes to the urban city to forget about the mermaid curse on her daughter, just as Neptuna thought she would. Everyday, Ofelia gets a reminder that her daughter is and will forever belong to the sea when she turns fourteen. Aryana, who does not know that she is forever cursed to become a mermaid on her fourteenth birthday, lives out her dream of being a professional swimmer; unaware of her inherent mermaid abilities over water. As she faces her inevitable destiny of becoming a mermaid, Aryana is torn between choosing the sea and the surface world of humans where her heart belongs.

Guild members are often also members of other guilds and societies in London and support other bands of ringers including: Southwark Cathedral; St Martin-in-the-Fields; St Michael, Cornhill and St Olave Hart Street. Home Tower The Guild of St Magnus is based at St Magnus-the-Martyr, the Wren tower built in 1704 which houses a 26cwt ring of 12 bells. The bells were cast during 2008/9 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry and were consecrated by the Bishop of London on 3 March 2009 in the presence of the Lord MayorRinging the changes: church to end its sixty year silence, photo with caption on p. 8 of Daily Telegraph issue no 47,821 (dated Wednesday 4 March 2009) and the ringing dedicated on 26 October 2009 by the Archdeacon of London. Bells The tower of St Magnus the Martyr Prior to the Great Fire of 1666 the old tower had a ring of five bells. The new tower was completed in 1704 and in 1714 a ring of 8 bells was installed. These were increased to 10 in 1714 with the addition of 2 trebles given by two lost ringing Societies, the Eastern Youths and the British Scholars. The 10 bells were removed for safe keeping in 1940. After the War, the bells were cleaned whereupon four of them were found to be cracked. A lack of funds and enthusiasm for the bells led to them being scrapped in 1976. A fund was set up on 19 September 2005, led by the Ancient Society of College Youths, with a view to installing a new ring of 12 bells in the tower in a new frame. The money was raised and the bells were cast during 2008/9 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. They were consecrated by the Bishop of London on 3 March 2009 in the presence of the Lord Mayor and the ringing dedicated on 26 October 2009 by the Archdeacon of London. The bells project is recorded by an inscription in the vestibule of the church.See also the photograph of the 11th bell in The Times, 11 February 2012, pp. 96‚Äì97 Notable recent peals have included one of Stedman Cinques on 16 April 2011 to mark the 400th anniversary of the granting of a Royal Charter to the Plumbers' Company, a peal of Cambridge Surprise Royal on 28 June 2011 when the Fishmongers' Company gave a dinner for Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh at their Hall on the occasion of his 90th birthday and a peal of Avon Delight Maximus on 24 July 2011 in solidarity with the people of Norway following the tragic massacre on Utoeya Island and in Oslo. On the latter occasion the flag of the Orkney Islands was flown at half mast. The BBC television programme Still Ringing After All These Years: A Short History of Bells, broadcast on 14 December 2011, included an interview at St Magnus with the Tower Keeper, Dickon Love. Ringing times The bells at St Magnus-the- Martyr are currently rung by the guild every Sunday, following the service, around 12.10pm.

The site of the dam is inland from Miri, the second largest city in Sarawak. The dam is part of the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy and, if completed, would support a 1,200 MW power station. In November 2015, the Sarawak Chief Minister Tan Sri Adenan Satem announced that the Sarawak government had decided to shelf the Baram Dam because the people in Baram did not welcome the plan. Design If built, the dam will be tall and its reservoir will cover an area of . The length of the dam at its crest will be . A tall saddle dam about southwest of the main dam will help retain the reservoir. Background Baram 1 is one of 12 dams to be constructed in Sarawak and is being developed by Sarawak Energy. It is the next to be constructed after Murum Dam's reservoir impounded in 2013. Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is carrying out the design of the dam and 1,200 MW power station. In 2010, Fitchner completed a feasibility study on the dam and power station. In November 2012, the Social and Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA) for the project began. On 11 July 2014, the Sarawak state government has unofficially approved the dam project although the SEIA report has not been completed. As of 17 December 2014, Sarawak Energy announced that it has yet to complete a comprehensive feasibility study and SEIA report due to ongoing protests against the Baram dam project. Corruption has also been alleged, the Baram MP Jacob Dungau Sagan, currently the Malaysian Deputy Minister of International Trade and Industry, was accused of supporting the project after obtaining RM63 million worth of contracts and timber concessions for the Baram district. He dismissed it as a political ploy ahead of parliamentary elections. Impacts =Displacement= At least 20,000 people from 25 longhouses would be displaced if the dam is built, according to International Rivers. The feasibility study estimated that 6,000 to 8,000 people from 32 longhouses would be displaced. This number has also been verified by Miri Resident's office. The displaced communities mostly consisted of Kenyah, Kayan, and Penan communities. In the upcoming SEIA, a household register would be developed for proposed resettlement of the displaced communities. According to Sarawak Energy, the dam project would accelerate the development of Baram township and to provide work opportunities and better infrastructure development for the local communities. With the threat of displacement, protests by locals and international anti-dam groups against the dam have been common and have stalled preliminary construction such as access-road building. In September 2012, a document containing thousands of signatures was submitted to Sarawak's Chief Minister office. However, also in 2012, the Federation of Orang Ulu Association Malaysia, a group representing local ethnic groups dwelling near the site, pledged their support to the project. A group of 300 indigenous people staged a demonstration during IHA 2013 World Congress held by International Hydropower Association (IHA) at Borneo Convention Centre Kuching in May 2013. Written demands were submitted to executive director of IHA, Richard M Taylor. On 23 October 2013, native protesters disrupted 30 Sarawak Energy Berhad (SEB) workers who were doing geological studies at the proposed construction area. Road blockades have impacted construction, one blockade has been erected near Long Lama and another one was erected near the proposed dam construction site. The blockade continued for nearly one year until 21 October 2014 when 50 police personnel dismantled the \\"KM15\\" blockade at Long Kesseh. Another blockade was re-erected few hours later. On 23 October 2014, the protesters celebrated one-year anniversary of the continuing blockade. In November 2015, the late Sarawak Chief Minister Tan Sri Adenan Satem said that the Sarawak government had decided that the Baram Dam project had been shelved, though this is described as \\"temporary\\".

Semmes was the founder of 1-800-Flowers, a floral retailer, gift and distribution company in the United States. Biography He was born on April 3, 1927 in Memphis, Tennessee to Benedict Joseph Semmes and Amy Elizabeth Lardner. He earned a bachelor's degree from Duke University. Semmes served in the United States Navy before moving to New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1949. Semmes first worked at Whitney National Bank. He then joined the staff of WWL-TV as an advertising account executive, where he worked for thirty years. Semmes is best known as the founder of 1-800-Flowers, a telephone business which allowed consumers to order flowers using a credit card without having to visit a florist. Semmes came up with the idea for the business while taking a shower. He was friends with both a florist and an executive for a telephone company. Unfortunately for Semmes, the telephone number for his proposed 1-800-Flowers was owned by a truck driver who lived in Wisconsin at the time. Semmes flew to Wisconsin, where he purchased the phone number. In addition to 1-800-Flowers, which Semmes launched in the 1980s, the company has expanded to the Internet with 1-800-Flowers.com. Semmes' personal interests included historic preservation, gemstones, woodworking and tennis. Semmes and his son purchased five historic homes, built before the Civil War, in the Irish Channel neighborhood of New Orleans during the 1970s. The five homes, located on First Street, included three of the last five remaining brick double homes in New Orleans. Semmes restored all five homes, and later purchased the remainder of the buildings on the same city block. Semmes also had interests in gemstones and gemology. He owned two jewelry stores, called Chatelaine Fine Gems, with branches in the Royal Orleans and the Royal Sonesta hotels in New Orleans. Additionally, Semmes worked as a gem appraiser and a master gemcutter, achieving the title of fellow from the Gemological Institute of Great Britain. Semmes died at the Touro Infirmary in New Orleans on March 30, 2012, aged 84. He was survived by his wife, Jane (n√©e Pfister) Semmes; two daughters and six sons, and a large extended family.

It was created over 430 years ago in the San Bernardino monastery, as part of evangelization efforts. Since then it has been in the possession of the community. Rather than being kept in the parish church it is in the custody of a sponsor or mayordomo, whose family is in charge of the many festivities and traditions associated with the image for a year. These include taking care of the image proper along with taking the image to church and to visit the sick. It also includes sponsoring many parties especially on certain dates such as Candlemas and Day of the Child on April 30. The image and names The Ni√±opa is the most venerated of Xochimilco‚Äôs various important Child Jesus images which include the Ni√±o Dormidito, the Ni√±o de Bel√©n, the Ni√±o Tamalerito, the Ni√±o Grande and the Ni√±o de San Juan. The image dates from 1573 and has since been in the possession of the town of Xochimilco. The image is fifty-one cm tall and weighs 598 grams. It was designed to be placed seated or lying down. Its right hand is raised as an act of benediction. It has light brown eyes of crystal with black eyelashes. Its nose is small and rounded. The ears are also small but not well defined. The mouth is slightly open as if about to speak, with the upper lip a more intense red than the lower. The skin is white and somewhat pink. As the image is over 430 years old, it must be handled with care to keep it from deteriorating. Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH) has recommended that the image be dressed only in light clothing with no metal such as zippers or hooks in order to conserve the surface. They also recommend that all photographs be taken without flash and without kissing the image directly, only the clothing. The image has been called by several variations of the name including ‚ÄúNi√±opa,‚Äù ‚ÄúNi√±o-pa‚Äù and ‚ÄúNi√±opan.‚Äù According to the municipal historian, Rodolfo Cordero, the name is ‚ÄúNi√±o-pa‚Äù and derives from ‚Äúni√±o‚Äù (child) and a shortening of ‚Äúpadre‚Äù (father) to ‚Äúpa‚Äù with a meaning of Father Child. The alternative ‚ÄúNi√±opan‚Äù is the Spanish ni√±o (child) with the Nahuatl ‚Äúpan‚Äù (place) meaning ‚Äúchild of the place.‚Äù The historian notes that the denotation of ‚ÄúNi√±opan‚Äù has grown in popularity, surpassing ‚ÄúNi√±opa‚Äù. Other names include Ni√±o Peregrino (Pilgrim Child) and Ni√±o del Pueblo (Child of the Town/People). Others state that the real name is ‚ÄúNi√±opan‚Äù and that ‚ÄúNi√±opa‚Äù is a mistaken interpretation to mean ‚ÄúNi√±o Patron‚Äù (as in patron saint, which it is not) or Ni√±o Padre, but the image represents the Son of God, not God the Father. Another name for the Ni√±opa is the Ni√±o Consentido (Well-Cared-For Child). History Chinelos in procession with the Ni√±opa The story of its origin was that it was brought from Valencia, Spain, by Martin Cort√©s, arriving in Xochimilco in 1586, made of the wood of an orange tree. Before he died, Cort√©s gifted his Child Jesus images, making each recipient mayordomos. When one of these died, who was Mart√≠n Cer√≥n de Alvarado (grandson of Hern√°n Cort√©s), a chest in Michoac√°n was opened to find the Ni√±opa, which still smelled of oranges. In reality, it was created in Xochimilco from a local wood most likely by an indigenous craftsman in the workshops of the San Bernardino monastery. Bernardino de Sahag√∫n wrote that the indigenous of the Xochimilco area made offerings of corn to a child image of the god Huitzilopochtli on December 26. The Franciscans who evangelized the region also made note of this tradition. The evangelists created Child Jesus images to substitute for this tradition, including the Ni√±opa. There are two possible reasons why this image is venerated. It is possible that the image belonged to the last indigenous ruler of Xochimilco Mart√≠n Cort√©s de Alvarado as his will states that he left several Child Jesus images to the town including one that fits the description of the Ni√±opa. The second is that the infant Jesus is figured prominently in various oil paintings on the altarpieces from the 16th and 17th centuries in the San Bernardino church and in the former monastery of Santa Mar√≠a Tepepan. Mayordomos The traditions surrounding the image have not changed much in the over 400 years even though Xochimilco has transformed from a rural area to an urban one. As it is associated with popular religious expression and because of this, it does not reside in a church but rather with a family. It is part of popular religious expression and not official Church doctrine. Because of this, the image does not reside in a church but rather in the home of a family. He is ‚Äúlaid down to sleep‚Äù each night in a basket made for him, in his underclothes and wrapped in a blanket. Each morning, he is ‚Äúawoken‚Äù to Las Ma√±anitas before he is dressed. Each evening it attends Mass before heading back to the home of the mayordomo. Since 1995, the image has been taken once a year for a ‚Äúcheck up‚Äù with the ‚Äúpediatrician,‚Äù which is annual examination, including X-ray and maintenance work done by INAH. The image is hosted by a sponsor or ‚Äúmayordomo‚Äù each year in the family home, often in a room built especially for the purpose. This area is open to the public with all free to come and go. It is believed that those who become a mayordomo of the image receive blessings and prosperity. The waiting list to host the image extends past 2040 and families have waited as much as fifty years. If the person on the waiting list dies beforehand, the privilege is inherited by another member of the family. Families who have hosted the image receive a life-sized copy. In addition to the care of the physical image, the mayordomo is in charge for the many festivities and traditions that surround it. Almost every day, the image leaves to attend Mass and to visit families, the sick and hospitals. This is done with fanfare, accompanied by musicians, Chinelo dancers, mariachis, tunas called ‚Äúestudiantinas‚Äù in Mexico, fireworks, traditional foods such as mole, mixiote and various types tamales and more. This is even the case when the image is taken for its yearly ‚Äúcheck up,‚Äù brought to INAH in Coyoac√°n from Xochimilco. The reason for this is that the image represents the life that God gives and the purpose is to take care of this life. While there are festivities around the image almost every day of the year, some are private and some public. The most important include Las Posadas (December 16‚Äì24), Three King‚Äôs Day (January 6), Candlemas (February 2) and Day of the Child (April 30) . The most important of these is February 2 when there is a change mayordomos. This events draws thousands of spectators, many carrying photos and posters of the Ni√±opa, from both Xochimilco and outside. The crowd was estimated at 4,000 in 2007. The festivities on February 2 is part of a tradition where families take their images of the Child Jesus to church, especially dressed for the occasion, to be blessed. After the mass for Candlemas, the bishop takes the Ni√±opa from the outgoing mayordomos and transfers it to the new ones. Everyone at the event is fed traditional food such as mole, rice, pork and tamales. This ceremony is also associated with the blessing of seeds for good harvests as well as the blessing of candles to be lit in case of illness or death the duality of life and death, a pre Hispanic element. Candlemas marks the beginning of the growing season for the chinampas of Xochimilco. The ceremony includes baskets of seeds such as corn, beans, lentils, wheat and more. While agriculture is no longer the main economic activity, these seeds represent abundance. Because of the large quantity of clothes and other items, it takes up to two trucks to move the image from one house to another. 2011 was the first time that the Archbishop of Mexico (Norberto Rivera Carrera) participated in the event. The image receives gifts year round but especially on Three Kings‚Äô Day on January 6 and on the International Day of the Child on April 30. Most of these gifts are later distributed among children from poor families. On April 30, the festivities occur at the house of the mayordomo, who offers food to guests. Visitors leave offerings of toys, flowers and fruit. In the streets, the mayordomos also place various castillos with fireworks and amusement rides. During the Las Posadas, the Ni√±opa leaves the house of the mayordomo each day to a different Xochimilco neighborhood, accompanied by an image of the Virgin Mary, Chinelos, music and many followers. It goes to the designated house, owned by the ‚Äúposadero.‚Äù The house and the surrounded street are elaborately decorated with paper ornaments, lamps, flowers and Christmas gifts. Hundreds of people attend to sing and otherwise take part. At noon, the posadero and the rest of the procession accompany the Ni√±opa to church. After they return there is more singing, music, Chinelos and food. There are no social class distinctions at this event and no alcohol is served. A fireworks frame called a ‚Äúcastillo‚Äù (castle) is burned and at the end of the day, dozens of pi√±atas are broken and a dance begins for the evening. This repeats each day of the Las Posadas until December 24, when the Ni√±opa is laid in a manger to sleep in the San Bernardino parish. Stories about the image Because of its age and the uncertainty of its origin, there have been a number of stories surrounding the image. One of the disproven ones include that there is a pre Hispanic image inside and the image is not original. The last stems from a story that the original Ni√±opa was lost in a canal in the San Antonio Molotlan neighborhood in 1940. Its origin from Spain and orange tree wood was disproven in the 1970s, when the image was dropped and a finger broke. This allowed examination of the wood, which was determined of a tree locally called ‚Äúchocol√≠n‚Äù and made at the workshops of the San Bernardino de Siena monastery in the 16th or 17th century. One persistent story is that the image comes to life. Many of these revolve around the image playing with its toys at night and even wandering outside. Evidence for this, say believers, is that toys are often strewn about, laughter is heard from the image‚Äôs room, the image has dirty clothes in the morning and small footprints have been found in the yard of the house in which it is cared for. It is said that the color in his cheeks disappears when he is angry and is more red when his is happy. He is even said to smile more. It is also claimed that the Ni√±opa travels into the dreams of petitioners, especially sick children. Most stories revolve around miracles attributed to the image. These include curing disease, bringing peace to fighting families, helping with finances, finding work and more. The Ni√±opa has received penitents from other countries as well, including a woman from the U.S. who claimed to have been cured of terminal cancer after seeing the image on television. One story states that a mayordomo planted lilies which were destroyed by a hailstorm. The money from the crop was destined for festivities for the image. Without money, he asked the image‚Äôs forgiveness and arranged for various masses in the Ni√±opa‚Äôs honor. After this, the damaged lilies began to grow again.

Description Sunlight is created in the American impressionist style. It is a portrait of a woman, who has been identified as Benson's daughter, Eleanor, standing on a hill, looking out towards the Atlantic Ocean off Penobscot Bay in Maine. She is in a white dress that is getting ruffled by the wind blowing off the ocean. Her left hand is up, shielding her face from the sun, while her right hand is planted on her hip, a pose Benson used multiple times. Because of the woman shielding her eyes form the sun, it is likely that the sunlight is the actual subject of the painting. Historical information Frank W Benson started working with the Impressionist style at the turn of the 20th century, and started exclusively using the style by 1909. Benson was one of the forerunners of American Impressionism, especially within the Ten American Painters. Benson was known for painting the idealized world, especially that of the leisure of New England. Benson was, like most Impressionists, very interested in light. Benson himself stated that, \\"I follow the light, where it comes from, where it goes.\\" =Acquisition= Painted in 1909, the painting was included in the Sixth Annual Exhibition of Works by American Artists, December 4, 1910 - January 1, 1911.

It is the only coalfield in South India. It lies in the basin of the Godavari River. History Dr. King of the Geological Survey of India discovered coal in Khammam district in 1871. The Hyderabad (Deccan) Company Limited acquired mining rights to exploit the coal in 1886. The Singareni Collieries Company Limited, incorporated in 1920, acquired all assets of the Hyderabad (Deccan) Company Limited. Hyderabad State purchased majority shares of The Singareni Collieries Company Limited in 1945. With the reorganization of states, the controlling interest of The Singareni Collieries Company Limited vested with the Government of Andhra Pradesh now Telangana in 1956. The implementation of the five year plans saw large scale expansion in the activities of The Singareni Collieries Company Limited. Since March 1960 it was jointly owned by the Government of Telangana and the Government of India. The activities of Godavari Valley Coalfield extended to the districts of Adilabad, Karimnagar, Khammam and Warangal. The coal extracted in the Godavari Valley Coalfield, the sole coalfield in South India, up to 2009-10 was about 929.12 million tonnes. The coalfield The cumulative basin area of Godavari Valley Coalfield is 17,400 km2. The coal bearing area is 11,000 km2. However, the area considered potential for regional exploration is 1,700 km2. The Godavari Valley Coalfield, sometimes referred to Pranhita-Godavari Valley Coalfield, is a continuation of the Wardha Valley Coalfield. It extends over an area of 9,000 km2. The Lower Gondwana rocks consisting of Talchir, Barakar and Kamthi measures are well developed in the area. The Godavari Valley Coalfield is divided into twelve coal belts. Important coalfields of the area are: Tandur Coalfield; North Godavari and South Godavari Coalfield; Karlapalli or Kamaram Coalfield; Ramagundam Coalfield etc. Reserves According to the Geological Survey of India, Godavari Valley Coalfield has total reserves (as on 1 January 2004) of 16,697.26 million tonnes of non-coking coal, up to a depth of 1,200 m, out of which 8091.10 million tonnes are proved reserves and the rest being indicated or inferred. A large portion of the coal is up to a depth of 300 m.

He served in several key battles in the Western Theater. After the war, he was an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan in Arkansas. Later in life, he became a significant leader in Confederate veterans' reunions and served for a time as the Major General in Command of the Arkansas State Guard. Early life Shaver was born on April 18, 1831 in Sullivan County, Tennessee.Coogan, Harold \\"Robert Glenn Shaver (1831‚Äì1915)\\", Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture, Accessed May 1, 2012. He came to Arkansas with his parents from Sullivan County, East Tennessee, in 1850, locating at Batesville, where in 1856 he was married to Miss Adelaide Louise Ringgold, a beautiful and accomplished daughter of Col. John Ringgold, one of the State's most prominent citizens. Some three years later he removed to Lawrence County, where he was licensed to practice law.Confederate Veteran, Volume XXIII, pages 178‚Äì179, 1915, Accessed May 1, 2012. Shaver was an early leader in the Arkansas State Militia. He was elected Colonel of Lawrence County's 60th Arkansas Militia Regiment on July 23, 1860.Arkansas Military Department Records, List of Commissioned Officers of the Militia 1827‚Äì1862, Arkansas History Commission, Microfilm Roll 00000038-8, Page 518 During the Civil War In the spring of 1861, Shaver recruited and organized the 7th Arkansas Infantry Regiment for the Confederate army and was elected its first colonel. He and his regiment moved to Columbus and Bowling Green, Kentucky, and on the evacuation of the latter place by General Albert Sidney Johnston in February, 1862, Colonel Shaver, as senior Colonel of the brigade in which his regiment was serving, commanded the rear guard of General Johnston's army to Nashville, Tennessee. At Shiloh, April 6 and 7, 1862, Colonel Shaver, commanded the 1st Brigade of General Thomas C. Hindman's Division, 3rd Army Corps, composed of the 2nd, 6th, and 7th Arkansas Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Confederate Infantry Regiment. Colonel Shaver initiated the fight on the Confederate right early Sunday morning, the 6th, where the fighting was fierce and incessant throughout that bloody struggle. The 7th Arkansas, Colonel Shaver's own regiment, went into action on the left of the brigade, Lieutenant Colonel Deane commanding, with its drum-and-fife corps playing \\"Granny, Will Your Dog Bite?\\"Confederate Veteran, Volume XXIII, pages 178-179, 1924 Colonel Shaver had two horses killed under him during the day and one on the following day. General Hardee, in his report of the battle, said that Colonel Shaver's conduct was most satisfactory, skillful, and exemplary throughout both days' fighting. Early in June, 1862, Colonel Shaver was transferred to the Trans- Mississippi Department. ; On the September 8, 1862, Colonel Shaver organized the 38th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, at Jacksonport, Arkansas and was once again elected colonel. Shaver continued to command the 38th Arkansas during the various campaigns and battles in that department and usually commanded the brigade to which it was assigned. During the evacuation of Little Rock, September 10, 1863, Colonel Shaver was in command of his brigade and covered the Confederate retreat out of the city southward. He was greatly chagrined and deeply mortified that he was not permitted to engage the enemy, and he always contended that General Price should have offered battle; that his forces were numerically superior to the Federals under General Steele and were in fine trim and anxious to fight. In the fall of 1864, General Kirby Smith consolidated the 38th and the 27th Arkansas Infantry Regiments, and they were known thenceforth until the surrender in May, 1865, as Shaver's Infantry Regiment. He participated in all the principal battles fought in the Trans- Mississippi Department after June, 1862, including Prairie Grove, Mansfield, Jenkins' Ferry, Poison Springs, Marks Mill, and all the battles incident to Gen. Dick Taylor's Red River Campaign against General Banks. When Shaver received notice the war was over, he took his command to Shreveport, Louisiana, and surrendered to General Francis Herron. Shaver procured a large steamboat to transport his men to Jacksonport (most of his troops were from northern Arkansas) from General Herron. He arrived at Jacksonport on June 20, 1865, and his men were disbanded.Powell, Wilson. \\"'Fighting Bob' Shaver.\\" Independence County Chronicle 3 (October 1961): 38‚Äì44. After the war Shaver's activities with the Arkansas Ku Klux Klan after the war eventually caused serious legal problems. At one time, Shaver claimed that he was the Klan commander in Arkansas with 10,000 Klansmen in opposition to the Governor Powell Clayton's carpetbagger regime. By 1868, the Clayton administration had Shaver charged with murder, arson, treason, and robbery. When General Daniel Phillips Upham and the state militia were sent to arrest him, he quickly fled the state to British Honduras. By 1872, Shaver returned to Arkansas upon hearing that Elisha Baxter had replaced Clayton as governor. All charges and indictments against him were quickly dropped. Shortly after returning to Jacksonport in 1872, he was informed that Governor Baxter had appointed him to the position of sheriff for newly created Howard County in western Arkansas. Shaver lived in Center Point (Howard County) until 1899, practicing law after leaving his duties as sheriff. In 1899, he and his family moved to Mena (Polk County) to live with his son. In the 1890s, Shaver was made commander of the State Guard and the Reserve Militia of Arkansas and received the rank of Major General. He was also the commander of the Arkansas Division of the United Confederate Veterans (UCV). In 1910, Shaver helped raise funds and to dedicate a monument and choose its location on the Shiloh battlefield to honor all the Arkansas soldiers who fought and died there. On September 26, 1911, Shaver gave the main address at the dedication of the memorials on the former battleground at Shiloh. When Little Rock was chosen as the site for the annual reunion of the Confederate Veterans, he was made commander-in-charge of the camp, and the National Encampment of the United Confederate was known as \\"Camp Shaver.\\"Cooger, Harold. \\"General Robert G.

It was founded by George Gale, opening in 1854 and closed in 1939. Several religious denominations used the facilities as a college and later as a training school. History Judge George Gale went to college at the University of Vermont and moved to the western frontier in La Crosse, Wisconsin in the early 1850s. After finding little interest in starting a college in La Crosse, he bought 2000 acres to start Galesville at a choice spot for his upcoming university. The state of Wisconsin chartered the school in 1854 as \\"Galesville University\\" and he held the first classes in the county courthouse in Galesville. The first class had 16 students including Gale's son George Gale Jr. Old Main was completed in 1862 and the campus becomes occupied in 1863. Gale ran the nonsectarian college until 1865 and the school floundered while his health deteriorated during his involvement in the American Civil War. In 1865, the Methodist Episcopal Church took over the school and it held classes until 1871. The Presbyterians took over until 1901 and changed the name to Gale College in the 1890s. The Synod of the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America purchased the college in 1901. In 1915, they build a new dormitory and gymnasium. They constructed a new heating building in 1921. The Lutherans suspended the school for the 1938-9 school year because of too small enrollment and closed it permanently in June 1939. The Society of Mary, Province of St. Louis purchased the buildings and 20 acres of land in 1941 for $10,000. Its buildings included two dormitories, the main building, and a heat building. The Catholic order used the buildings to train novitiate brothers and priests. They named the school Marynook and operated the novitiate before it became a retreat in 1973. It operated as a retreat until June 1994 when the city of Galesville purchased it for $150,000. The city granted a 50-year lease in 2000 to the Garden of Eden Preservation Society. =Founder's Day= Throughout the school's varied history, it held a \\"Founders Day\\" celebration on June 4. A wreath was usually placed at George Gale's tomb and the grounds were typically open to the public.

Biography =Until 1945= Hartman was born in Beilen and as a young man spent time in Germany. In the 1930s he joined the NSB and worked in propaganda, and in 1941 he volunteered with the Waffen-SS and (like Paul van Tienen) saw action at the Eastern Front. =After the war= After the war Hartman was sentenced to ten years but was released early, in 1950, on probation. He founded the SOPD together with Jan Wolthuis in 1951. Hartman became the organization's secretary. The SOPD was the first and the largest of the collaboratist organizations in the country, \\"numbering perhaps a hundred former internees.\\" In 1952 he and Wolthuis played a never fully explained part in the escape of seven convicted war criminals from the Koepelgevangenis in Breda, including Klaas Carel Faber.

Pons was a knight who died during the crusade in the spring of 1099. Raymond was the chaplain of Count Raymond IV of Toulouse. Although the work is attributed to both of them, it seems that Pons did little beyond encouraging Raymond to begin writing before his death. The finished work is basically Raymond's., pp. iv‚Äìviii. As an eyewitness of the events of the First Crusade, he is one of its most important chroniclers, comparable in importance to the Gesta Francorum and Fulcher of Chartres. The Historia Francorum was probably written during the crusade., vol. IV, p. 1009. It presumed to have been completed before 1105, because it does not mention the death of Raymond's patron, the count of Toulouse, in that year. Probably it was substantially complete by 1101, since it was certainly used by Fulcher of Chartres for his book, finished in that year. The Historia makes some limited use of the Gesta Francorum, but it is in the main a firsthand account with a completely different focus from the Gesta. Because he was close to the count, Raymond was better informed regarding the inner workings of the crusader leadership than the author of the Gesta. The Historia Francorum was one of the texts given to King Louis VII of France as a coronation gift in 1137. Besides Fulcher, the author of the Historia belli sacri and William of Tyre also used it as a source. Seven manuscripts of the Historia survive: three from the 12th century, two from the 13th and one each from the 14th and 15th. In most cases, it was bound in a codex alongside the works of Fulcher and Walter the Chancellor. Editions The Historia Francorum was translated into modern French at the beginning of the 19th century by the French scholar Fran√ßois Guizot, in Memoires sur l'histoire de France XXI (1824), 227‚Äì397. The Latin text was first published by Jacques Bongars (Gesta Dei per Francos, I, 139‚Äì183), and again in the Recueil des historiens occidentaux des croisades (1866), 235‚Äì309.

The Doy≈çbi (\\"Saturday\\", in Japanese) was named after the Vendredi (\\"Friday\\"), an organ of the French Popular Front. Katsuo Nose (1894‚Äì1979), Masakazu Nakai (1900‚Äì1952) and Kaname Hayashi (1894‚Äì1991), who were popular academics in Kyoto, were responsible for the editing, while Raitaro Saito (1903‚Äì1997), a film actor, managed the finances and advertisements by sponsors. The Doy≈çbi was a six-page tabloid-size newspaper. The cover page consisted of an illustration by Kenzo Itani (1902‚Äì1970) and an editorial opinion from Nakai, Nose or another editor. > \\"When a straight gray railroad cut across a beautiful stream with shallows, > sweet flowers and small killifishes swimming, Ruskin shuddered with the > feeling as if all past things familiar to human beings were cut off > diagonally. At that time, however, Tennyson's response was that the arts can > cover the railroad bank as nature can cover it with flowers. > These flowers blooming on the railroad have not needed great strength but > they have only kept meeting continuous daily needs. > By not abandoning to live here and to be here, by not relinquishing to > criticism, by only this way, all gray railroads can be covered with > flowers.\\" > (Editorial opinion of the first issue of Doy≈çbi, July 7, 1936) Apart from the cover page, one page was reserved for movie information while the remaining four pages were filled by columns about culture, women and entertainment. The content and writing were significantly simple and plain, but maintained an anti-fascist and ant-war stance with cautious wording. The Doy≈çbi was distributed by bookstores, with each store stocking 5 to 30 copies. To quickly boost sales, Saito delivered 20 to 30 copies of the Doy≈çbi to sponsoring caf√©s for free. The Doy≈çbis reputation then spread day by day, and many caf√©s bought and put the Doy≈çbi on tables. The Doy≈çbis circulation, which was 2,000 at first, increased to 8,000 at the peak. Nose and Nakai held editorial meetings at caf√©s like the Salon de th√© Fran√ßois, which became the center of the Popular Front movement in Kyoto. The Doy≈çbi frequently reported on the lives of workers in Kyoto as well as full of amusing articles about movies and fashions, and these articles were the principal characteristic of this newspaper. However, the police strengthened the suppression of the left- wing activists after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937. In November 1937, Nakai and Saito were arrested and the Doy≈çbi was discontinued. Afterward, the police arrested the rest of the members including Nose intermittently. This wholesale arrest was later called the Kyoto Popular Front Incident of 1937.

Description A. chilensis is a perennial vine whose stalks can grow to about in length. The climbing stalks have boomerang-shaped alternate leaves. The flowers may be yellowish or brownish-purple in color, and emit an unpleasant odor that attracts the flies which pollinate it. Retorse (downward-pointing) hairs on the flower, similar to those of pitcher plants, impede the departure of the flies. Once trapped within the utricule (a sac-like structure of the flower), pollen from the stamens is deposited on the flies; pollen they brought with them is deposited on the stigmata as they enter. Within the flower, they are sustained by nectaries for a day, while the stamens ripen and the flower withers. This releases tension in the retorse hairs and frees the flies. The flower usually grows between 15‚Äì30 cm (6‚Äì12 in) tall with the scrambling vines growing to about 1 meter (3 ft). Aristolochia chilensis hairs (close up) Distinguishing characteristics Aristolochia chilensis flower with downward pointing hairs Members of the genus Aristolochia are known for fly pollination and are similar to pitcher plants and flytraps. The main difference is that those plants digest the insects for nutrients, while the Aristolochia use them mainly for pollination. Every part of the plant is also poisonous if ingested by humans or animals. Caterpillars and the swallowtail butterfly actually feed on the leaves, flowers, and shoots of the plant. Caterpillars can especially tolerate the acids contained within the plant and, in turn, cause them to become poisonous to predators. The plant is also zygomorphic and usually has foetid flowers to attract pollinators (flies) while repelling predators. The aroma of the flower especially helps with its survival. Environment and habitat This plant is only native to Chile and is found in low altitude valleys and coastal mountains. They tend to be found in coastal areas from 0 ‚Äì 500 meters and mountains from 500 ‚Äì 2000 meters in altitude. They thrive in very dry areas with little to no rainfall and can tolerate droughts. They also thrive on full exposure to sunlight and grow only on level or northern facing slopes. The plant can not handle snow but it can tolerate brief freezing spells of approximately -5 ¬∞C which is the approximate temperature of the morning frost in Chile. They also need adequate drainage to mature properly.http://www.chileflora.com/Florachilena/FloraEnglish/HighResPages/EH0472.htm Ecology Aristolochia chilensis, like the related Aristolochia bridgesii, is a larval food source for the gold rim swallowtail butterfly, Battus polydamas. Uses and chemical components Aristolochia chilensis has ornamental and medicinal value and has also yielded the new 4-aryltetralone (‚àí)-aristotetralone. Being in the family Aristolociaceae, Aristolochia chilensis contain aristolochic acid. This has typically been used in traditional Chinese medicine to help with ailments from mouth ulcers to arthritis. However, the use of this acid for medicinal purposes has been banned in Europe since 2001 and China in 2003 due to studies showing that the acids are carcinogenic, mutagenic, and nephrotoxic, thus causing much more harm then good. Although they do not smell pleasant, they are often used for groundcovers in xeriscaping.

It can grow as either a shrub or a tree up to tall and can be burned to produce fuel. Its essential oil may have pharmaceutical or cosmetic uses. Distribution Lippia substrigosa is native to southern Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. In Guatemala, L. substrigosa can be found in the departments of Alta Verapaz, Baja Verapaz, Chimaltenango, Chiquimula, Guatemala, Huehuetenango, Jalapa, Quetzaltenango, El Quiche, Sacatep√©quez, San Marcos, Santa Rosa, Solol√°, and Zacapa. Habitat and ecology Lippia substrigosa is able to grow in diverse habitats. It has been found at altitudes from and can grow in oak-pine forests, open rocky slopes, and in wet or dry thickets. Morphology Individuals of this species are either trees or shrubs that can grow to a height of . The branches of an individual plant of this species are usually densely packed with sticky hairs. The hairs themselves may be harsh, brownish spreading hairs that are sometimes long and soft, or pale spreading hairs. The leaf petioles are long. The leaf blades are ovate to broadly ovate or ovate-elliptic. They typically range in size from long and wide. At their tips, leaf blades are acute to acuminate (tapering to a sharp point), while at their base, they are either cordate to abruptly contracted and obtuse or long, slender and wedge shaped. The surface of the leaf blade is puckered with a blistery appearance or is wrinkly and rugged. The leaf blade feels rough to the touch and has hairs that may be soft, weak, thin and clearly separated or coarse, rough, long and densely matted. The edges of the leaf are toothed, and may be crenate (with rounded edges), or serrate (with jagged edges). An individual plant of L. substrigosa typically has four to eight peduncles in each leaf axil. They tend to be long and are covered with long, rough, and coarse hairs. Pubescent hairs, arising from glands, also grow on the peduncle. The flower of an individual of this species is arranged in a subglobose shape, meaning it is somewhat, but not exactly, spherical. At the time of flowering, or anthesis, the flower is long and wide. The corolla of the flower is 4 mm to 6 mm long and is pale yellow. Below the corolla, the calyx is 2 mm to 2.5 mm long and is covered with long, soft and weak hairs that are somewhat dense. In addition to the sepals of the calyx, L. substrigosa also has bracts that are broadly ovate to kidney-shaped. At their apex, the bracts are either rounded or acute and taper to a sharp firm point. The lower bracts can sometimes grow to become long. Bracts may have long, erect and rigid hairs or short, soft and erect hairs that are confined to glands. Flowers and fruit  Flowers of L. substrigosa have stamens that are didynamous, meaning they come in two pairs of unequal length. These four stamens only protrude slightly from the flower and are located near the middle of the corolla tube. The anthers of the stamen are not appendages and appear to have an ovate shape. The cells of the anther are parallel to one another. Individual plants of this species have ovaries with two chambers, each of which contains one ovule. The ovules are located near the base of the flower and are erect, or they are attached horizontally near the base. The style (the structure that connects the ovary to the stigma) is terminal. The stigma can be asymmetrical, bent backwards or downwards, or consist of two lobes. The flowers of this species produce fruits that are dry and small. These fruits are also usually found near the calyx. The fruit's pericarp is hard and dry and the seeds do not have an endosperm. When these fruits mature, they separate into two pyrenas, or seeds surrounded by hardened endocarp. Usage Not many uses have, as yet, been discovered for L. substrigosa yet. However, it may be burned for fuel and research is being conducted to determine the potential benefits of its essential oil. Many other plants of the genus Lippia have also been found to produce essential oils. In fact, Lippia alba, Lippia dulcis, and Lippia gravolens are used in traditional medicine in Guatemala. The latter two Lippia species have been used to treat colds, coughs, asthma and bronchitis. L. substrigosa has a high concentration of various sesquiterpenes, some of which are found frequently in the oils of other Lippia species. Therefore, although the essential oils of Lippia species vary from each other in concentration and composition of chemical compounds, L. substrigosa may produce an oil that has medicinal benefit or a cosmetic use due to genetic similarities among species in the genus Lippia.

It is a member of the genus Notholaena, which is part of the subfamily Cheilanthoideae of family Pteridaceae. It is distinguished by the pentagonal shape formed by the blades of its frond, a property other members of Notholaena do not possess. Taxonomy Notholaena standleyi was named after Paul C. Standley, Assistant Curator of the United States National Herbarium, who studied plants in southwestern United States. First described as Notholaena candida var. quinquefidopalmata in 1864, it was elevated to a species as Notholaena hookeri in 1879 by D. C. Eaton. However, this name had already been used to describe another fern, and it was renamed by William R. Maxon in 1915. He named it after Standley, who had engaged in a great deal of field study in the southwestern United States. Standley was also collaborating with E. O. Wooton to develop a comprehensive Flora of New Mexico at the time. Distribution Notholaena standleyi is indigenous to southwestern United States and parts of north and central Mexico. It specifically grows in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas in the USA. Map of Notholaena standleyi distribution in the US Habitat and Ecology Notholaena standleyi is a perennial species that typically grows in desert regions at elevations from 300 to 2100 m. It is found on rocky hillsides, usually in the crevices created by limestone and granite boulders that provide the partial shade the plant prefers. During periods of drought, the frond may curl and become brown until water is available, an adaptation to the semi-arid environments it inhabits. At lower elevations, it sometimes grows alongside Notholaena californica. It takes 13 days to germinate and sporulates from late spring to fall. It has the same life cycle as a typical fern, the sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis, which grows into a haploid gametophyte. The gametophyte produce gametes by mitosis. The fertilized egg when develop into the sporophyte by mitosis. The spore is transported by air and water. Morphology Individuals of this species have brown petioles and green fronds. The ferns are erect and grow to a height of . The petioles grow to a length of . The individual fronds are usually wide as well as long. The frond is light green when young, becoming darker green as it matures, and usually contains five blades arranged in a pentagonal fashion. The blades are bipinnately or tripinnately compound, and each of them is triangular and pointed. The abaxial side of the frond is covered by powdery farina, with a function that is still unclear. The color of the farina differs between species growing in different geographic locations. These are referred to as chemotypes, of which there are four. These chemotypes also have different number of complete chromosome sets. Gold and yellow farina are diploids, pallid and yellow/green are tetraploids. Its prothallus contains glandular trichomes. It usually has 32 spores per sporangium, but many with only 16 have been observed, produced from eight 2n mother cells. It is diploid and has 60 chromosomes in its root tip cells. Usage The Seri Indians made tea from the fronds to promote fertility in women. The species was also believed to have supernatural value; the Seri carried in a small cloth bag to bring good luck to the bearer. It has been studied in potential herpes treatments, because of its antiviral activity. Notholaenic acid, isolated from the species, has shown anti-HSV-1 activity at high concentrations (25 Œºg/disk).

It is part of the permanent collection of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Description Bernard most likely painted this painting from memory, modeled after a trip he took with Paul Gauguin in 1888 to Brittany. The painting has five Breton women and one man gathering around a wall. Their faces are pointed down toward the cobblestone wall. Their heads are covered in traditional Pont-Aven coiffes and they are in traditional Brittany wear. The painting is proliferated with bright cobalts, yellows, greens, and reds, and are chosen for effect, rather than accuracy in representation. The women all have slight facial features, but they are indistinguishable. Bernard uses harsh, graphic outlines to help define the features on the women's outfits and faces. The man is dressed in all green, and facing the rest of the women. The characters are boldly flat, recalling Bernard's love of Japanese prints. The placement of the figures shows Bernard's disregard to traditional rules, including scale or perspective. Historical information A young Bernard, together with Gauguin, took a trip to Pont-Aven, a remote location in France, and began creating a new, postimpressionist style of painting that defined the Pont-Aven School and Cloisonnism during the summer of 1888. Along with Gauguin, Bernard cherished Brittany and the Breton people, and Breton Women at a Wall reflects his fascination with their customs, which, in contemporary French society, was often seen as a way to get back to the past. Bernard would draw on his experiences in Brittany throughout his life. =Acquisition= The painting went through many private hands between 1893 and 1959, before landing in the hands of Swiss art collector Samuel Josefowitz. In 1998, the Indianapolis Museum of Art purchased the painting, along with 30 Gauguins, as a partial gift from Josefowitz.

The plant has three pistils that are bifurcated from the base and has six clavate scars. The plant's seeds are oblong and the surface is reticulated. When the plant becomes old, its leaves become patent. A feature of its leaves is the oblong blades with distinct petioles. The plant also contains filament trichomes on the abaxial leaf surface, and inflorescence with filamentous trichomes.[Regina dos Santos Silva Tania, Mire- ya D. Corr ea: Peruensis Drosera (Droseraceae), a New Species from Peru, in: Nov on, 12:4, 2002, pp. 543-545] South America, Peru highlighted Distribution The species is found in the Pasco region (Oxapampa, Cordillera Yanachaga) of Peru where it grows in scrub land on white sandstone, covered by shrubs and associated peat moss. The cover ceiling can reach up to 2 meters in thickness. Morphology Representatives of this species grow as a rosette herbaceous plant that spans from 10 to 29 centimeters. The stem axis alone reaches a length of approximately 2 to 4 centimeters. Its leaves are red, and in the plant's drooping age, the length of the leaves can be 10 to 12 centimeters. The petioles can be 6 to 7 centimeters in length and 1 mm in width. The leaf has a different texture on each side; the abaxial (top) side of the leaf is hairy while the adaxial (bottom) side is smooth. The leaf's blade has an inversely-ovate to oblong-round shape and is approximately 4 to 7 centimeters long and approximately 1 millimeter wide. The upper sides of the leaves have a hairy, shaggy texture with glandular hairs, while the undersides of the leaves have thread-like trichomes that measure 2 to 2.5 millimeters long and are of golden color. The stipules are rectangular and have membranous schlitzbl√§ttrig with the slit measuring up to 7 millimeters long and about 6 millimeters wide. Flowers and fruit The Drosera peruensis plant begins to blossom during the fall season, around October. Flower heads, 10 to 18 centimeters long, can grow two to four flowers which feature red, thread-like trichomes. The inflorescence axis is 3.5 to 6 centimeters long, attached to a reddish pedicel. Its sepals are also light red in color and are fused together. Each of its lobes is oblong-round in shape and measures 4 millimeters long and 1.5 millimeters wide, filled with reddish trichomes. The petals may be either white or red in color, and its ovary is composed of three carpels. The plant has three pistils that are bifurcated from the base and has six scars that clavate. The seeds from the plant are an oblong-round shape, and the surface is reticulated. Carnivory The Drosera could be considered the 'master of sticky fly paper' because it relies on glandular hairs to trap its prey, then rolls up the edges of the leaf to consume it. These hairs act as a kind of glue that ensnares the prey. This mechanism is comparable to those of other carnivorous plants such as the Venus flytrap (Dionaea), though the entrapment occurs at a relatively slower rate, and the movement of the enfolding leaves differs. After the prey has been pinned down by the glandular hairs, the stalked glands produce digestive enzymes, including protease and phosphatase to break down the prey. The digestive fluids work on breaking down the fleshy internal part of the prey into a ‚Äúnutrient soup‚Äù which is then absorbed by the plant. After the digestion and absorption of the prey are complete, the leaf returns to its ready state. The exoskeleton of the prey remains on the leaf unless the rainfall washes it away.Walker, Rick. 2008. Drosera ‚Äì Sundews. http://www.thecps.org.uk/content/view/49/25/ (May 1st, 2012) Comparison to other Drosera species The main characteristics used to describe the taxonomy of Drosera species include traits such as the shape of the leaf, the style number, morphology, and the presence or absence of stipules, or specialized organs (i.e. tubers or gemmae). Over many years, new Drosera species have been identified by examining characteristics including chromosome numbers, pollen morphology, secondary compounds, and seed germination types. Drosera peruensis is relatively recently characterised. Medicinal Similar to other species, Drosera peruensis contains medicinally-active compounds that are found in other sundews.Wichtl M.; Herbal Drugs and Phytopharmaceuticals; Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 1994, 178;81 Ornamental Drosera peruensis can be used as an ornamental plant because of its aesthetic qualities.

The plant part of the family Lauraceae, which contains about 45 genera and 2000-2500 species, and is related to the culinary cinnamon, sassafras, and bay tree. The plant is indigenous to the Philippines, where it grows best in forests at low and medium altitudes that sometimes ascend to . C. mercadoi is unusual in the cinnamon family in that its essential oil consists large amounts of safrol, whereas other oils of cinnamon contain cinnamaldehyde. It is currently listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List as \\"vulnerable\\" due to the overharvesting and the continuous loss of the Philippine forests. Distribution Cinnamomum mercadoi is only found in the Philippines, from the Babuyan Islands and northern Luzon to Mindanao. Habitat and ecology C. mercadoi plants are monoecious and are variable in the height, shape, size, and texture of the leaves. They typically grow in primary and secondary forests with altitudes of about but are able to ascend to . They grow best in subtropical and mild temperate forest conditions where high humidity and relatively stable, mild temperatures are found. They also grow best in pH levels of about 4 to 5 and their seeds are mainly dispersed via birds such as the fruit-specialized hornbills which account for the scattered distribution and regeneration of the tree species across the island. Description The leaves of the C. mercadoi are simple, opposite or subopposite, smooth, pale green, ovately-oblong or broadly lanceolate. The leaves are also sometimes subelliptic, usually 8 to 20 centimeters long and 4 to 6 centimeters wide, and are pointed at both ends, with petioles 5 to 15 millimeters long. The inflorescence is erect and grows from the uppermost leaf axils, about 10 centimeters long. The petals are smooth and rarely exerted. The calyx is canescent and turbinate. Finally, the bark is gray and does not have any fissures or cracks. It is covered irregularly with corky pustules and thus giving the bark a slightly rough appearance. Flowers and fruit The flowers of the C. mercadoi are greenish-yellow and include in terminal or subterminal panicles up to 15 centimeters long. The fruits are smooth, shiny, steel blue, elliptic-shaped, seated on a bowl-shaped perianth cup, and are usually 12 x 8 millimeters in dimension. The seeds are smooth and are narrow to elliptic-shaped. Use =Food= The sassafras aroma and taste that the leaves and bark of the C. mercadoi may be added to root beers to give them flavor. Kalingag.Kalingag, Stuartxchange.com. Retrieved 26 April 2012. =Medicinal= There are several medicinal properties of C. mercadoi including its usage as a(n) diaphoretic, parasiticide, antispasmodic, aphrodisiac, analgesic, and diuretic. The bark of C. mercadoi has traditionally been used in medicine in the Philippines. In 1668, the Jesuit Ignatio Francisco Alzina reported that eating it aided digestion and since then, it has been employed to treat digestive troubles. It was also employed as a treatment for headaches and rheumatism and has been used as a rubefacient. Furthermore, the bark is used as a(n) carminative, stimulant, astringent, antiseptic, antifungal, and antiviral property. Finally, the decocotion of the leaves is a remedy for flatulence and menstrual problems in women. =Chemistry= In a study by Bacon (1909), one of the earliest chemical studies on the C. mercadoi reported the presence of essential oil, oleoresin, and resin. It was discovered that the oil primarily contained safrole and a further study conducted by Concha (1966), showed that the volatile oil and safrole were found in the leaves, bark, and roots of the plant. Sapogenin was also found to be present in the leaves and seeds of the C. mercadoi, as was reported by Anzaldo (1958). Phytochemical screening of the crude methanol extract of the plant indicated the presence of saponins, condensed tannins, an unsaturated lactone ring, and leucoanthocyanins.

Times News Service. 23 July 1984: 18. Lawrence Journal-World. Web. 27 Feb. 2011. was an American author, best known for his novel, Famous All Over Town, about Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles. He published the novel under his pseudonym, Danny Santiago, and during most of his professional career, he kept his identity a secret. James's own agent Carl Brandt did not know his real name until it was revealed by fellow author and friend, John Gregory Dunne. Some critics call this use of a Latino pseudonym a literary fraud, while others appreciate his contributions to literature, regardless of his race. Although he was white, he was able to convey an accurate portrait of the Chicano culture. Biography The son of a wealthy Kansas City businessman, James grew up in Kansas City, Missouri and graduated from Andover Academy and Yale. He majored in classical Greek and was the only one to do so from the Yale Class of 1933. James was an assistant director on the movie The Great Dictator with Charlie Chaplin in 1940. It was his association with Chaplin, as well as his time in Hollywood, that brought him to the attention of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Both he and his wife Lilith were called to testify and refused to self-incriminate under their Fifth Amendment rights. In 1942 he released Winter Soldiers, a play presented at the New School of Social Research on the efforts of the underground to impede the Nazi advance toward Moscow.Hischack, Thomas S., Enter the Playmakers: Directors and Choreographers on the New York Stage He and his wife, Lilith, wrote the book for Bloomer Girl, a successful 1944 Broadway musical. Then he kept out of sight as an author for some time. For the next 20 years, he and his wife worked as volunteers in Hispanic neighborhoods in East Los Angeles . During the 1950s he continued to work under the name Daniel Hyatt. The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms was released in 1953. It was listed as one of the primary inspirations for Godzilla. The Giant Behemoth was released in 1959, and Gorgo was released in 1961. He gained notice under the pseudonym Danny Santiago, after the publication of \\"The Somebody\\" in Redbook in 1970. In order to keep his identity a secret, he kept in contact with his New York agent through a post office box in Pacific Grove, California. According to interviews, James apparently \\"lost confidence in [his] writing ability\\" after being blacklisted and used the name as a way to circumvent the blacklist. He published the novel, Famous All Over Town, in 1983. In 1984, he was awarded the Richard and Hilda Rosenthal Foundation Award, a prize of $5,000, awarded by the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters for his novel, but he did not show up to accept it. His publisher, Simon & Schuster, wanted to submit the novel for the Pulitzer Prize, but James refused to supply personal information. The Jameses rented their house to writer John Gregory Dunne and his wife, Joan Didion, for several years beginning in 1966. They soon became good friends. Dunne disliked pseudonyms, and he encouraged James to write under his own name. His real identity came to light when Dunne wrote an article for the August 16, 1984, issue of The New York Review of Books. Daniel James died at the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula in Monterey, California at the age of 77. He is survived by his two daughters: Barbara James of Carmel, California, and Catherine McWilliams of Westchester County, New York. Controversy Famous All Over Town was published in 1983. It tells the story of a Mexican-American family in East Los Angeles, California. It was initially considered a \\"highly regarded contribution to Chicano literature\\". The book was recognized and awarded as an outstanding work of fiction. Hispanic youths found the novel inspiring and considered the main character a role model; they believed in Danny Santiago as a man who had endured situations like their own and had become the author of a best seller. The book became controversial when an article in the New York Review of Books revealed that the author was Daniel Lewis James from Kansas City, Missouri, and not Mexican-American Danny Santiago who was writing from his personal experience growing up Hispanic in Los Angeles, as his readers believed. It is now debated whether the novel can be taken as a straightforward document of the Hispanic experience. Reasons for pseudonyms For two decades, James wrote screenplays as \\"Daniel Hyatt\\", and he began using the name \\"Daniel Santiago\\" in 1965. James took a pseudonym because \\"...he had been blacklisted after he was identified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1951 as having been a member of the Communist Party.\\" His friends had advised him not to use a pseudonym which implied a different ethnicity, but he argued that use of a pseudonym was well understood‚ÄîMark Twain and other authors did it‚Äîand no harm would come from it. A few of his fellow writers remarked that the pseudonym would not matter if the book was good. His new name was both defended and denounced by Hispanic- American writers. Laura Browder suggests that Danny Santiago was an alter ego through which James was able to forge a new, strong public identity and to avenge himself against the repressive America that had wrecked his life. Opinions Views differed on the significance of his novel after his public learned that Santiago was not Hispanic. Some who had been inspired by the book became hostile. They believed that, because he was not actually Hispanic, his work no longer mattered. \\"The problem of how to respond to Famous All Over Town now that it can no longer be taken as a straightforward document of the Hispanic experience has become enmeshed ‚Ä¶\\". Others had a different perspective. \\"There is some suggestion that James felt himself to be so close to the members of the Hispanic community that he felt that he could speak from their vantage point\\".

A concoction could also be made from the flower to treat congestion from the cold or the flu.accessdate August 12th, 2011 The seeds can also be used as an emetic to induce vomiting or as a laxative or even as a mild sedative. The entire plant can also be used to treat bladder infection, prostate pain, or to help the throbbing pain of a migraine. A wash made from the tea can also be used to help heal sunburns or scraped skin. The plant is also smoked during some important ceremonies to induce a euphoric and mild sedating effect. However, if not used properly, the plant can be very toxic.

It is an endangered species. Description =Leaves= Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of G. angustifolia is its leaves. G. angustifolia has an abaxial leaf surface that is covered in short, fine velvety hairs which is an uncommon trait among the genus Gustavia. In general the leaves are sessile but they can have petioles up to 30 mm long. The leaf blades tend to be narrow, having an oblong to oblanceolate shape, while the leaf bases are attenuate to acute in shape. =Flowers and reproduction= Gustavia angustifolia has a gametic chromosome number of n=17. The inflorescence of G. angustifolia is racemose and terminal, occurring at the end of the branches. Each raceme typically has 4‚Äì10 flowers and each flower has 8 petals. The pedicels of the flowers range from 35 to 100 mm in length. The buds of G.angustifolia are tomentose with a gray coloration. These flowers can grow to be 10‚Äì14.5 cm in diameter. The petals have an elliptical shape and are 50‚Äì65 mm long and 20‚Äì25 mm wide. The androecium of G.angustifolia is fused. The fruit are globe shaped with a flat summit. Habitat and ecology Gustavia angustifolia is native to the dry deciduous forests of the coastal plain of Ecuador and Colombia. Pubescent leaves are beneficial in hot, dry environments such as these. The tiny hairs help to keep the leaves cool by reflecting light and casting tiny shadows on the leaf surface. In addition the hairs also provide a barrier between the leaf and the air thereby reducing the amount of exposed surface. Deflecting sunlight and decreasing exposed surface area of the leaf are both adaptations for preventing water loss in the plant. The flowers of this plant bloom in October and begin fruiting in November. Synonyms and common names While Gustavia angustifolia is the official scientific name, in the past it has been called Japarandiba angustifolia, Japarandiba ruizana, Gustavia angusta, Gustavia ruiziana, and Gustavia corymbosa. Its common names are Membrillo de Monte and Membrillo de Monta√±a (Mountain quince).

Its common name corresponds with its ability to grow in shady areas of rock walls. This fern species is a familiar ornamental plant grown in home gardens. Distribution 200px The geographic origin of P. tsus-simense is the East Asian countries, such as China, Korea, Japan, Thailand, and the Indochina region. The specific epithet tsus-simense (often written as tsussimense) refers to Tsushima Island. Although it is not native to the United States, the Korean rock fern has been introduced to the country through Florida and Louisiana. Habitat and Ecology Polystichum tsus-simense flourishes in shady areas with partial to no sun exposure in fertile and well-drained soil with high moisture. It can grow in acid, alkaline, and neutral soil, in part shade or full sun. It inhabits slopes and rocky places of forests and shores of streams. It can also grow in indoor pots and in shady areas of a garden. It has a clump-forming habit with many basal shoots forming open groups or clusters. Morphology Individuals of P. tsus-simense are herbaceous with no persistent woody stem above ground. A mature plant can range from 20 to 50 cm tall and approximately 40 cm wide with evergreen foliage. As vascular land plants, they contain four or more bundles in an arc. They have dark green bipinnate fronds, which include crenate blades with pinnate venation within the pinnately arranged fronds. Black veins run through the glossy lanceolate blades. The grooved stipe of the plant is blackish brown with rhizome-like scales at the base. The rhizome is short and erect with broadly lanceolate scales. It is brown in color with blackish central portions. Reproduction Polystichum tsus- simense uses spores to propagate. As an early vascular plant, a fern is not able to reproduce through seeds. Wind plays a major role in the dispersal mechanism of the spores. The Korean rock ferns sow their spores in the summer, and divide in the spring. The sporangia, dark brown vessels, contain spores, and are grouped into round clusters called sori. The sori are aligned in a row between the margin and the midrib, and are covered with a peltate indusium. Usage Polystichum tsus-simense is mainly used as an ornamental plant, for both indoors and outdoors. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. With little sunlight required, it is a suitable candidate for a potted plant indoors, on a deck, or the porch. The contrast of the dark stems with the green fronds makes this an attractive adornment in homes. The plant‚Äôs ability to stay green throughout the year contributes to its value to a gardener. It is also commonly offered as a house gift in certain Asian cultures.

Description Liquidambar formosana is a large, native, deciduous tree that grows up to 30-40m tall. The leaves are 10~15 cm wide., and are three-lobed unlike five- to seven-lobed leaves of most American Liquidambar species. The foliage of the L. formosana turns a very attractive red color in autumn. Leaves grow in an alternate arrangement, and are simple, palmately-veined, with serrated margins. Roots can be aggressive and branches are usually covered with corky projections. The individual flowers of L. formosana are monoecious. However, both sexes can be found in the same plant. Male flowers are in catkins, female flowers form dense spherical heads, and the fruit is burr-like because of the persistent styles. Distribution and habitat Liquidambar formosana grow mostly in woodland in warm temperate zones. It requires moist soil and can grow in light to no shade areas. It is usually found in East Asia in Central and Southern China, Taiwan, and Indochina. Uses =Medicinal= Liquidambar formosana has many medicinal uses. The leaves and roots are used in the treatment of cancerous growths. The stem bark is used in the treatment of fluxes and skin diseases. The fruits used in the treatment of arthritis, lumbago, oedema, oliguria, and decreased milk production and skin diseases. The resin from the stems is used to treat bleeding boils, carbuncles, toothache and tuberculosis. The trunk of this tree can be used for aromatic resin. The extract of this resin is used to promote blood circulation and relieve pain. =Other uses= Liquidambar formosana is rare in cultivation but in its native regions the wood is used for making tea chests and the leaves to feed silk worms.

S. macrocarpon is a tropical perennial plant that is closely related to the eggplant. S. macrocarpon originated from West Africa, but is now widely distributed in Central and East Africa. Through an introduction from West Africa, the plant also grows in the Caribbean, South America, and some parts of Southeast Asia. S. macrocarpon is widely cultivated for its use as a food, its medicinal purposes, and as an ornamental plant.  Description  The fruit of S. macrocarpon Solanum macrocarpon can grow to a height of 1-1.5 m. It has an alternate leaf pattern with the blade width of 4‚Äì15 cm and a height of 10‚Äì30 cm. The shapes of the leaves are oval and lobed with a wavy margin. Both sides of the leaves are hairy with stellate or simple hairs. Prickles may or may not be present on the leaves depending on the cultivar. When prickles are present they are found more along the midrib and lateral veins. The prickles are straight and can grow up to a length of 13 mm. The flowers have a diameter of 3‚Äì8 cm and are located on short stalked inflorescence that can contain 2 to 7 flowers. The lower portion of the plant carries bisexual flowers while the upper portion contains male flowers. The flowers are 2-3.5 cm in length and usually have a purple or pale purple color, on rare occasions there are white flowers. The fruits are round, the top and the bottom are flattened out and have grooved portions with a length of 5‚Äì7 cm and a width of 7‚Äì8 cm. The stalk of the fruit is 1‚Äì4 cm long and is either de-curved or erect. At a young stage the color of the fruit is green, ivory, or a purple and white color with dark stripes. When ripe, the fruit turns yellow or a yellow-brown. The fruit contains many seeds and it is partly covered by the calyx lobes. The seeds have a length of 3-4.5 mm, a width of 2-3.5 mm, and are shaped in an obivoid or reniform. Cultivars in Vietnam have fruit of 1.5 inches in diameter, looking similar to a golf ball with a stem. The color can be medium green, pale green, or white with green stripes.  Ecology  Solanum macrocarpon has a large variety of cultivars. It grows in areas of high rainfall found in the tropical and humid regions of West and Central Africa, South-East Asia, South America and the Caribbean. Some cultivars can be found in the savanna and semi-arid region of Northern Ghana, Burkina Faso and their neighboring countries. The cultivars grown there consist of plants with small leaves and fruit. The fruit cultivars are only able to grow in humid coastal areas. S. macrocarpon can occasionally be found at higher altitudes but have a slower growth rate and are more robust. S. macrocarpon reproduces mostly by self- pollination. Out crossing occurs by bees and other insects, but at low frequencies. The flowers open early in the morning, while still dark. The stigma becomes receptive a few hours before the flower opens, and remains open for two days. The fruits are ready for picking 3‚Äì4 weeks after the fruit has set, but it takes about 10 weeks for the fruits to ripen. Germination typically begins a week after sowing. Flowering does not occur until 2‚Äì3 months after germination. S. macrocarpon that resides in the savannahs have an earlier flowering period compared to plants that reside in areas with high amounts of rainfall. The savannah cultivars are also more resistant to drought.  Consumption  = Nutrition = Solanum macrocarpon is consumed in the various regions of the world where it is found. The parts of the plant that is consumed are the fruits and its young leaves. While taste of both the leaves and the fruit are very bitter they have a high nutrient yield. The fruit's crunchy texture and mild flavor make it unique. It can be consumed raw without removing the skin. Typically, the Vietnamese eggplant has a slightly bitter taste, but the bitterness may become stronger when the eggplant is over-ripe. The Vietnamese eggplant is very neutral smelling when raw, and develops an earthy scent when cooked. Vietnamese eggplants are used in Vietnamese cuisine in stir fries, soups and salads. They are also eaten raw or pickled. = Medicinal = The roots, leaves, and fruit of S. macrocarpon contain medicinal qualities. In Nigeria, the fruit is used as a laxative, and as a means to treat cardiac diseases. The flowers are chewed on to clean teeth. In Sierra Leone the leaves are heated and then are chewed to ease throat pain. In Kenya the roots are boiled and the juice is then consumed to kill any hookworms in the stomach. The root is also used for bronchitis, body aches, asthma, and speed up the process of healing wounds. The seeds of S. macrocarpon crushed to treat toothaches. Promising molluscicidal and schistosomicidal activities were displayed for the S. macrocarpon extracts and fractions which are attributed to the glycoalkaloid content. = Toxicity = Aside from the fruit, every other part of S. macrocarpon has been reported to cause heart failure, digestive problems, and lethargy in dogs. Because S. macrocarpon is part of the family Solanaceae, it contains alkaloids, giving the plant and fruit its bitter taste. Consuming the plant in large frequencies may potentially be poisonous. S. macrocarpon contains glycoalkaloids and the levels found in the fruit were 5-10 times higher than what is considered safe, and may not be safe for humans to eat.

Taxonomy The names Sclerocactus sileri and Pediocactus sileri have a confused relationship in the literature. (Sclerocactus was included in Pediocactus by Arp in 1972, but this was not accepted by authorities well conversant in the Cactaceae.), in According to the treatment in the Flora of North America,, in the taxon described here was first named by L.D. Benson (in 1969) as the variety sileri of Sclerocactus pubispinus. It was raised to a full species under the name Sclerocactus sileri by K.D. Heil and J.M. Porter in 1994. Quite separately, Echinocactus sileri was first described in 1896 and transferred to Pediocactus sileri by L.D. Benson in 1961., in The two taxa are treated as two separate species in the Flora of North America, which has entries for: * Sclerocactus sileri (L.D. Benson) K.D. Heil & J M.

During his time in the United States Army, he took many famous images including MacArthur wading ashore during the landing on Leyte, MacArthur with Emperor Hirohito, and the cover photo for MacArthur's book Reminiscences of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. Early life Gaetano Faillace was born September 17, 1904, in New York City to Marcello and Francesca (Sciacca) Faillace. MacArthur's photographer alt=Accompanied by General MacArthur is Philippine President Sergio Osmena and other US and Philippines Generals. =Rank= When photographers were assigned to highly ranked individuals like General MacArthur, they had to be officers, as they would be present alongside many other highly ranked men. Faillace was a sergeant before being promoted to captain when assigned to the general. After he left MacArthur's service he went back to the rank of sergeant but his war commission had progressed during the war and when he retired he jumped ranks to major. =Landing at Leyte= On 20 October 1944, troops of Krueger's Sixth Army landed on Leyte while MacArthur watched from the light cruiser . That afternoon he arrived off the beach. The advance had not progressed far; snipers were still active and the area was under sporadic mortar fire. When his craft grounded in knee-deep water, MacArthur requested a landing craft, but the beachmaster was too busy to grant his request and MacArthur was compelled to wade ashore. It has often been claimed that the picture is posed but William J. Dunn who was present during the landing (the only one in the picture not wearing a helmet or hat) says that rumor \\"is one of the most ludicrous misconceptions to come out of that war.\\" After landing on the beach, MacArthur gave his prepared speech, saying: =MacArthur and the Emperor= After the surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945, America occupied the home islands of Japan. As MacArthur took residence in Tokyo, he decided on a strategy of continuity for the Japanese people. Even though many Japanese and most of America wanted the Emperor put on trial (70% of Americans wanted him hanged) MacArthur thought that keeping the Emperor in his position would offer a symbol for the Japanese people to rally around. If the Japanese people could rally around Hirohito and he could be controlled by the Americans, then fewer troops would be required to keep the peace in Japan. MacArthur and Emperor Hirohito's staff set up a meeting for 10 am on September 27, 1945, to discuss how to save the Emperor's throne. When the Emperor and his entourage arrived, American officers offered to take his hat. This seemed to alarm Hirohito, as he was the God Emperor and his normal Japanese staff never took things from him. As the Emperor handed over his hat, MacArthur burst into the room, saying \\"You are very, very welcome, sir!\\" For the officers present, it was the first time they heard the general call anyone \\"sir\\". MacArthur then moved to shake his hand, and Hirohito bowed so deeply that because of the Emperor's small stature the handshake took place above his head. During the meeting Gaetano Faillace took three photos of the two men. One was ruined from MacArthur closing his eyes and another from the Emperor's mouth gaping open, and the final one was approved and published in Japanese and international papers. When the picture was published in Japanese papers, the Japanese censors were horrified at the image, which showed a towering and informal MacArthur and a small and very formal Emperor Hirohito. To the Japanese, the God Emperor should always be the most prominent person in a picture, and to have an American standing in his company with an air of power went against all their training. The Americans, however, who had forced the Japanese censors to publish the photo, were very pleased as the picture seemed to encapsulate the change that their occupation of Japan represented. Retirement and death In 1983 Faillace released a Japanese book with photographs he took from the occupation. On December 31, 1991 he died from complications of cancer in Fayetteville, North Carolina.North Carolina State Center for Health Statistics. North Carolina Deaths, 1997-2004 (Raleigh, NC: North Carolina State Center for Health Statistics). At the time of his death he had family throughout America including brothers, Joseph Faillace, and Antonio Faillace in Seattle, sisters Grace Mauro of Miami, Florida and Angela Buscemi of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. His children, including his daughters Dr. Deon Faillace, Denise Danaher, and Donna Faillace and his son, Douglas Faillace, lived in Detroit. He also had two grandchildren.

C. virginianum is a member of the family Fabaceae, it is identified by its trailing and twining vine and showy flowers. C. virginianum habitats are in sunny areas within pine lands, and coastal uplands. Description Centrosema virginianum is a perennial herbaceous vine growing procumbently or twining to a height approaching two meters. It has alternate pinnately divided leaves, 3 to 10 centimeters long. Leaflets are lanceolate or ovate, 1 to 4 cm long, Stipules are often deciduous, and mostly setaceous. There is a wide range of leaflet forms, from linear to ovate to oblong or lanceolate-oblong, acute or acuminate at the apex. Flowering occurs in the spring and summer. Flowers of Centrosema virginianum, are highly specialized, with an inverted (resupinate) banner to accommodate pollinators (bees). The inflorescence consists of one to four bisexual flowers on an axillary peduncle; the calyx is deeply five-lobed, and the acute lobes are longer than the tube. The corolla is purplish or lavender- blue to nearly white; the fruit contains four to ten dark brown seeds. The diversity of leaflet shapes and corolla size and color can lead to confusion with C. pubescens. C. virginianum's roots are capable of nitrogen fixation.

It is distributed in meadows and borders of swamps and coastal regions from Los Angeles County and Mendocino County to Oregon and Washington. ;Habitat and ecology Juncus phaeocephalus grows along the coast in sand dunes, marshes and sloughs. Some of them also grow inland in wet grassy meadows, bogs, and along lakes and streams, such as in the Peninsular Ranges and Transverse Ranges of Southern California.Calflora . 2.12.2013 Its creeping rhizomes can spread across moist soil. This perennial plant can grow in elevations less than high. Description Juncus phaeocephalus is perennial with creeping rhizomes. It has flattened stems that are two-edged and can grow up to tall. Its leaves are shorter than its flowering stems. Brown-head Rush can be easily mistaken from sedges or irises because of its stems and leaves. These plants have many flowers that exhibit a brownish color with one to several spherical heads at the ends of the stem. ;Morphology This plant is perennial and can grow up to tall. They appear as herbs and erect. Its stems are flat, erect and leafy. They arise from stout elongated rootstocks. Its leaves are 0.5 to 1.5 lines wide and are ribbed by transverse septa. The septa of the leaf-blades are not complete. It does not have any ligule. The bases of the leaves are overlapping. The blades are flat with edges towards the stem. Their tips are often fine-pointed. ;Inflorescence Its inflorescence appears terminal, having the lowest bract of the inflorescence not appearing as a continuation of the stem. The flowers of this plant are in heads. The flower's heads can have one or many. It has 6 stamens. Its perianth is dark brown in color, and is about 4 to 6 mm long, with anthers longer than the filaments. The flowers are widely lanceolate. Its style is long and the stigmata are exserted. This plant produces many seeds. These ovoid seeds are about 0.6 mm in size. =Varieties= Juncus phaeocephalus is a variable species in which several subspecific varieties have been characterized mainly on its branching patterns of the inflorescences. Named varieties include: *J. phaeocephalus var. phaeocephalus ‚Äî plants with few, many-flowered heads. *J. phaeocephalus var. paniculatus‚Äî plants with many, few-flowered heads. *J. phaeocephalus var. glomeratus ‚Äî plants with many, many-flowered heads. Poisonous plant According to the tests made on the plants at the Chemistry Laboratory of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, Juncus phaeocephalus has as much as 30 ppm of hydrocyanic acid present in the plants. Due to its volatile nature, the concentration of this chemical might be greater before the actual testing was made. One actual case of hydrocyanic acid poisoning from a common rush occurred in California. In December 1958, two dairy heifers were found dead on a farm land near Petaluma, Sonoma County. The heifers died due to consumption of Juncus phaeocephalus plants. Juncus phaeocephalus grows with Verbena spp., Mimulus guttatus, Eleocharis macrostachya and Agrostis densiflora.

Henri Joseph Depelchin, SJ (also Henry Depelchin) (24 January 1822, Russeignies, East Flanders, Netherlands ‚Äì 26 May 1900, Calcutta, District of West Bengal, British India), was a Belgian Jesuit priest and missionary in India and Africa. As a missionary, he was the first superior of the failed Zambesi Mission in Africa and the founder and first superior of the West Bengal Mission in India. As an educator, he was the founder and first director of three major colleges in India. Life Depelchin's biographies show 24 January 1822 as the date of his birth but the civil registers of Russignies show that Henri Joseph Depelchin was actually born on 28 January 1822. He was the son of Almable Fran√ßois Joseph Depelchin, the innkeeper, and his wife, Marie Anne Matroye. Henri Joseph Depelchin, Birth Certificate No. 2, filed 28 January 1822, Register of Births for the Year 1822, Russeignies, East Flanders, Belgium; in: FamilySearch, \\"Belgium, Hainaut, Civil Registration, 1600‚Äì1911\\"; Russeignies, Geboorten, huwelijken, overladen [Dutch, \\"Births, Marriages, Deaths\\"] 1811‚Äì1870; Image 145, Item 2. The titles and columns were in Dutch but the actual birth certificate was in French. Although it was filed under Hainaut, it clearly stated that the birth occurred in East Flanders. Russeignies did not switch the provinces until 1963. At that time, his birthplace, Russignies, a farming village near Renaix, was a part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, in the province of East Flanders but today it is a part of the city of Mont-de-l'Enclus in the province of Hainaut in the Kingdom of Belgium. \\"Historie de la commune\\", Belgique ‚Äì Russeignies (Rozenaken), Geneawiki, retrieved 13 December 2013. Russignies sits on the historic border between the two provinces, Flanders and Hainaut. After Flanders was split into two in 1815, Russignies stayed with East Flanders until 1 September 1963, when it was allowed to join Hainaut. On 25 September 1842, he was admitted to the Society of Jesus at the former Norbertine Abbey of Tronchiennes (now Drongen) for the novitiate. After taking his first vows in 1844, he spent the next five years in his Juniorate teaching in Jesuit schools in Tournai and Aalst. Then he studied philosophy at the University of Namur (1849‚Äì1851) and theology at the Catholic University of Louvain (1851‚Äì1854). On 14 September 1854, in Liege, he was ordained as a priest. Afterwards, Depelchin spent the following year in his Third Year, the final stage of the Jesuit formation. Then he was sent to Antwerp and Namur to teach in the Jesuit schools and to serve as a superior. It seemed that he was destined to spend his life in education. Belgium had just been freed from the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Catholic Church was now free to celebrate Mass and teach catechism in peace. So the Jesuits were opening new schools across the new Kingdom of Belgium. Missionary years But, in 1859, a call for help came out of British India, from the Vicar Apostolic of the West Bengal. The Catholics of Calcutta had sent their request to Pope Pius IX for a Jesuit college to be established in their city for the natives. He, in turn, asked the then Superior General of the Society of Jesus, Peter Jan Beckx, for the help. A native of Belgium, the Superior General, in turn, chose the Jesuit Province of Belgium to supply the men for the mission. =Calcutta= Father Depelchin, then 37, was one of the men who was asked to come to India and help. He accepted, and he was appointed as the Superior of the new Mission. He and his group sailed from Antwerp and arrived at Calcutta on 29 November 1859. They, along with the local Catholics, immediately set to gather the funds and build the new school. 12 days later, Depelchin announced in the newspapers that College of St. Francis Xavier would be opening on 6 January 1860. A prospectus had already been published and distributed. Designed by a Brother Koppes, S.J., the school opened eight days later than planned, with Father Jean Devos, S.J., as its first Rector. By that time, Depelchin had become so ill with cholera that he was not expected to live. But he did recover. During his period of convalescence, he served as the military chaplain of the British troops at Fort William in Calcutta. He also served as the Rector of St. Xavier's College from 1864 to 1871. During these years, the enrolment of the College grew from 100 students to 500. To develop the science curriculum of the College, Depelchin recruited a young Belgian Jesuit priest, Eug√®ne Lafont, S.J., the future leading figure in the scientific community of India. =Bombay= After brief stints as a pastor in Midnapore (1871‚Äì1872) and Poona (1872‚Äì1873), in 1873, Depelchin was sent by the Superior General to Bombay (now Mumbai) to answer the appeal for help from the Apostolic Vicar of Bombay, Leo Meurin, S.J. Meurin had grouped four little school, including a seminary, to form a Catholic institution worthy of the growing power and prestige of the new metropolis of western India. But he felt they needed a dynamic and experienced Rector. So he asked the Superior General, Pierre Beckx, who promptly sent Depelchin. Under his administration, the new school became St. Xavier's College of Bombay. He also lectured in philosophy, exegesis, dogmatics and Church history at the College's seminary. When he finally left, a local columnist commented, \\"Father Depelchin left the Bombay Saint Xavier's in even a more prosperous state than the St Xavier's of Calcutta.\\" =Zambezia= In 1878 Depelchin was recalled to Europe by Beckx, who assigned him to organise and head the Zambesi Mission in southeastern Africa. The Mission was to cover, in today's maps, all of Zimbabwe, most of Zambia and some of Mozambique. At that time, very few Europeans knew anything about that part of Africa. But finding funds and volunteers were not a problem. In 1879, Depelchin sailed for Cape Town in the Cape Colony with an international team of five other priests and five lay brothers from various Jesuit provinces. They then went to the Zambezia bush to establish a mission base in Bulawayo in Matabeleland (now western Zimbabwe). The journey took almost six months. It was the first of three successive expeditions, taken between 1879 and 1882, Each of them began in the town of Grahamstown (about from the coast), also in the Cape Colony, and involved hundreds of miles (kilometers) in ox-carts in a painful climate and through a hostile environment. The goal was always the same ‚Äì to ask the natives for the permission to open a mission station in their land. But, each time, they said no. Each time, Depelchin and his men were dogged by misfortunes, trails, diseases, accidents and even probably poison. His letters sent \\"from the lands of the Matabeles\\", \\"in the huts of the Batongas\\" and from \\"the valley of the Barotses\\", were published in Brussels as a two-volume set in 1882 and 1883. Under the title of Trois ans dans l'Afrique australe [Three Years in Southern Africa], the collection was an immediate best-seller, drawing more missionary vocations to the Church. But, in the end, the Zambesi Mission was a fiasco. It was cancelled in April 1883 by the superiors of the orders of the surviving missionaries. Ten missionaries, aged between 29 and 50, lost their lives. Depelchin himself was out with a broken leg from an ox-wagon accident. Depelchin was recalled to Belgium in 1883 to regain his health and to allow his leg to heal. It took him four years to completely recover. He was assigned light duties at the schools in Aalst and Mons but his heart was still in the missions. So he went to the local parishes to speak about life in the missions, to encourage financial support for them and to recruit future missionaries. Like his books, his appearances were popular and successful. His letters and reports from India were also presented in numerous missionary periodicals in Europe. =Darjeeling= St. Joseph's School in Darjeeling In 1887 Depelchin was sent back to India. This time, his mission was the establishment of a high school in Darjeeling, a town in the foothills in the Himalayas in the North Bengal. He was already 67 years old. But, with characteristic punctuality and efficiency, he began on 10 January 1888, the day he arrived in Darjeelling ‚Äì and only six days after he came to Calcutta from Antwerp. He found a bungalow to temporarily house the new school in a place called Sunny Banks and it opened on 13 February with the name of St. Joseph's School. The first class had 25 students, with Father Depelchin as their first Rector. He also served as the pastor for the town. But Depelchin wanted newer, bigger and better buildings for his new school. To get them, he had to find land for the construction so he went out in search of it. In spite of apparently insurmountable obstacles, he used his powers of persuasion, sheer audacity and innate tact to find it at a place called \\"North Point\\" outside Darjeeling. The land was levelled and the largest of the buildings was finished in four years. The primary designer was Brother Eug√®ne Rotsaert, S.J. Most of the costs were covered by Belgian benefactors as well as members of the Anglo-Indian Catholic community, and even the civil authorities. The new building was blessed on 8 December 1891 by Depelchin himself. Classes began there in February 1892 but with a new Rector ‚Äì Alfred Neut. Last years At the age of 69, already known as the \\"Grand Old Man\\", Depelchin had been sent up the hills to Kurseong, where he was given the task of forming young Jesuit missionaries who were studying philosophy there. He also lectured them on logic and metaphysics. in 1894, he was transferred to Ranchi, where he was named in 1896 an instructor to the Third Years. In the meantime, His letters and reports from India continued to be in numerous missionary periodicals across Europe. But Depelchin's health was finally going into decline. In 1898 he was given an easier position in the parish of Serampore. But, in December 1899, he was sent to Calcutta to stay at the Archbishop's House, where he died a few months later, at the age of 78, on 26 May 1900.

When blooming, the flower is said to resemble the head of a turtle. Description Chelone obliqua is an herbaceous perennial plant, that grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and can spread out in 1 to 2 feet. The central stem is light green, smooth and hairless, and cylindrical; there are pairs of opposite leaves along the sides that tend to droop. Its leaf blades are lanceolate to broadly lanceolate, hairless, and serrated along their margins. The upper blade exhibits a dark green surface, while the lower blade surface is a paler green. A petiole is arising from the base of each leaf blade. It blooms later than some herbaceous perennials, in mid to late summer. The flowers are tubular 2-lipped blooms, with a small yellow beard inside each lower lip. There is no floral scent and are cross pollinated by bees and attracted to butterflies. An ovoid seed capsules evolves subsequent to the corollas of the flowers turning brown and falling off. The seeds capsules are initially light green and uncovered (no coating), and later turns brown and splits open to release the seeds.

University of Georgia Press, Athens It is found as tetraploid in the Blue Ridge Mountains; or as hexaploid in areas such as Tennessee to Arkansas and Michigan, and on the Atlantic coastal plain from South Carolina to Maryland. It has arisen several times from diploid ancestors of the other three species of the genus Chelone (Chelone glabra, Chelone lyonii and Chelone cuthbertii). Conservation The plant has become a rare wildflower and is threatened and endangered in some states, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. The Rose turtlehead is endangered in the state of Arkansas and is a special concern in Kentucky. The Red turtlehead is endangered in Kentucky and threatened in Maryland. Lastly, the Purple turtlehead is endangered in Michigan. Cultivation Chelone obliqua is cultivated as an ornamental plant. Optimal bloom period is within the months of July and August. Dispersal of seeds can occur in the early spring, then divide in mid-spring and produce root soft-tip cuttings in the early summer. It is best grown in moist to wet, rich, humusy soils in full sun to partly shaded regions. With an immense amount of sunlight during the summer time, it's wet and moist, or clay soil is essential for growth. It can also grow in any pH conditions (neutral, alkaline, or acidic). Hence, mainly grown in moist woods, swampy areas and along streams. Some problems that may arise would be these turtleheads have a disposition to powdery mildew, rust, fungal leaf spots, and damage from slugs and snails.

Description Sarsaparilla is a perennial woody climber with tendrils, thin branches and extended ovate leaves that grows about 4 to 5 meters vertically. Its paper-like leaves are pinnate veined, leathery and alternatively arranged. The leaves' width ranges from 10 to 30 cm and the petioles' length is about 5 cm. It is known for its small red berries with 2 or 3 seeds and small green flowers. The flowers are radially symmetrical, dioecious and have umbel inflorescence of 12 flowers. The berries are produced in the fall or in the late summer and stays intact through the winter for animals and birds to eat. Thus the pollination occurs as the unharmed seeds are found in the feces. The surface of the stem is smooth; it also is bent and have thorns at the joints. The hairy roots of sarsaparilla are fibrous and may have few rootlets growing out. They have stiff surface and are deep-rooted, which grows from 2 to 2.5 meters. The color of the roots ranges from brownish gray to black. Sarsaparilla is a persistent plant; even when most roots are cut off from the stem, roots will grow few years later but will be slender and less starchy. Habitat Sarsaparilla is common in wooded areas because it uses its tendrils to climb up the trees. It is widely found in temperate, swampy and warm areas. Sarsaparilla is also found in high elevations; in Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico, it is found at elevation of 1760 meters, in Oaxaca at 100 meters, in Hacienda San Jos√©, Santa Ana at 850 to 1100 meters. Distribution Smilax aristolochiifolia is native to Mexico and Central America. Sarsaparilla is native to the Mesoamerica region, especially in Belize, El Salvador and Guatemala. In North America, sarsaparilla originates in Southern Mexico, being found primarily in the states of Tabasco, Veracruz, Yucat√°n, Nuevo Le√≥n, Puebla, Oaxaca, and Quintana Roo. In El Salvador, sarsaparilla is located in Hacienda San Jos√©, Santa Ana. Usage =Food= Its roots are extracted to be used in flavoring beverages, dairy desserts, baked goods and candies. Sarsaparilla was once a main ingredient for flavoring root beer. However, the taste of the root extract itself is sweet and bitter. =Medicinal= Smilax aristolochiifolia root has extensive medicinal uses. As the traditional medicine, it is used to treat leprosy, tumors, cancer, psoriasis and rheumatism. It is also used as tonic for anemia and skin diseases. It is reported to have anti-inflammatory, testosterogenic, aphrodisiac and progesterogenic effects. Therefore, sarsaparilla roots are often promoted as male rejuvenator. Not only that but it was used to build lean body mass by some gym enthusiasts. Also it is believed to improve digestion and arouse appetite. Natives in New Guinea use the stem of sarsaparilla as treatment for toothache. However, no definite scientific evidence is given to the medicinal effects of sarsaparilla and in excessive doses, it can be harmful. Active chemicals Sarsaparilla roots has saponins which are used to synthesize cortisone and other steroids. Saponins which are known to help the body absorb other drugs more effectively. However, they are plant steroids and it is believed they cannot be absorbed or used in human body. It also has organic acids, flavonoids, sitosterol and stigmasterol. Main chemicals of sarsaparilla are acetyl-parigenin, astilbin, beta-sitosterol, caffeoyl-shikimic acids, dihydroquercetin, diosgenin, engeletin, essential oils, epsilon-sitosterol, eucryphin, eurryphin, ferulic acid, glucopyranosides, isoastilbin, isoengetitin, kaempferol, parigenin, parillin, pollinastanol, resveratrol, rhamnose, saponin, sarasaponin, sarsaparilloside, sarsaponin, sarsasapogenin, shikimic acid, sitosterol-d-glucoside, smilagenin, smilasaponin, smilax saponins A-C, smiglaside A-E, smitilbin, stigmasterol, taxifolin, and titogenin. Name It is also known as Smilax medica and Smilax aristolochiaefolia. Spanish common names include zarzaparilla, cocolmeca and alambrilla. The name Sarsaparilla means a small bushed vine, from Spanish words zarza (bramble or bush), parra (vine), and illa (small).

Eskimos and Explorers. Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1999.) or Bergen Company (BergenkompagnietCulture Greenland. \\"Preliminary Studies in KGH's Photo-Archive .\\" Sisimiut Museum. Accessed 2 May 2012.) was a Dano-Norwegian private corporation charged with founding and administering Danish-Norwegian colonies and trade in Greenland, as well as searching for any survivors from the former Norse settlements on the island. It operated from 1721 until its bankruptcy in 1727. Although the Bergen Company failed as a concern and both its settlements were destroyed and abandoned, it was ultimately successful in re-establishing sovereignty over Greenland. History The Norwegian Lutheran minister Hans Egede established the company with $9,000 in capital from the Bergen merchants, $200 from the Danish-Norwegian king Frederick IV, and a $300 annual grant from the Royal Mission College.Doody, Richard. The World at War: \\"GREENLAND 1721 - 1953\\". The merchants hoped to find easily accessible mineral wealth or at least a Norwegian-like environment for agricultural production. Aid from the Mission College was aimed at spreading the Reformation among the long-lost Norsemen, who were presumed to still be Catholic or to have lapsed from Christianity altogether. The company was granted broad powers to govern the peninsula (as it was then considered to be), to raise its own army and navy, to collect taxes, and to administer justice; the king and his council, however, refused to grant it monopoly rights to whaling and trade in Greenland out of a fear of antagonizing the Dutch.Marquardt, Ole. \\"Change and Continuity in Denmark's Greenland Policy\\" in The Oldenburg Monarchy: An Underestimated Empire?.

Univ. of Chicago Press, 1998. to Baal's River (the modern Nuup Kangerlua) and, on July 3, established Hope Colony (') on the Island of Hope (', modern Kangeq) with his family and a few dozen colonists. His settlers were devastated by scurvy and most of the colonists returned home as quickly as they could; only Egede, his family, and a few others remained to welcome two supply ships in 1722. Egede's (now ship-borne) explorations found no Norse survivors along the western shore and future work was hampered by the two mistaken beliefs both prevalent at the time that the Eastern Settlement would be located on Greenland's east coast (it was later established it had been among the fjords of the island's extreme southwest) and that a strait existed nearby communicating with the western half of the island. In fact, his 1723 expedition found the churches and ruins of the Eastern Settlement, but he considered them to be those of the Western. At the end of the year, having found no Norse survivors after months of searching, he turned north to establish a whaling station on Nipisat Island and begin a mission among the Inuit. The whaling station was quickly burnt by the Dutch, whose better quality and lower-priced goods made the Bergen Company's trading operations impossible. The mission proved more successful and in 1724 Egede baptized his first child converts. The Bergen Company went bankrupt in 1727. King Frederick attempted to replace it with a royal colony by sending Major Claus Paarss and several dozen soldiers and convicts to erect a fortress for the colony in 1728, but this new settlement of Good Hope (Godthaab) also failed due to scurvy and the group was recalled in 1730. Subsequent corporate-led administrations of Greenland learned from the Bergen Company's failure and received both trading monopolies over the island and enough naval support to generally maintain them.

(Persian: ÿÆÿ®Ÿëÿßÿ≤€åÿå ŸæŸÜ€åÿ±⁄©) Distribution Malva pusilla is native to temperate and Mediterranean Europe, Turkey, Caucasia, and northwest Iran. It is invasive to North America, Europe, and Korea. In the United States, in can specifically be found in the states of California, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. rightthumb\\"Invasive distribution of Malva pusilla in North America \\" Habitat and ecology Malva pusilla can be found widely in wastelands, grasslands, pastures, and by roadsides. It is easy to grow in ordinary garden conditions in moist, fertile soil and a sunny setting. It is prone to predation by rabbits and infestation by rust fungus. Invasiveness Mallows can be used as garden flowers. However, some species are considered weeds, especially in areas where they are not native. Malva pusilla grows rapidly as a weed in gardens and farmlands. It is considered hard to get rid of because of its long and tough taproots. Among cultivated crops, it can be very competitive and it can spread very quickly. Herbicide control options of this mallow are limited and not highly effective. Morphology Malva pusilla stems can grow to a height of 4-20 inches. Malva pusilla leaves are attached alternately to the stem. Leaves have orbicular shape (widely triangular) with palmate venation and serrate margins. In the past, mallows were often referred to as cheesepants because the carpel is shaped similarly to a triangular wedge of cheese. Flowers and seeds The Malva pusilla flower consists of five petals of white, sometimes pale pink, color with pink venation. Petals and calyx are about the same length. It has many stamens and the filaments are fused. Flowering begins in June and July and ends in September and October. Flowers bloom in groups of 2 to 5 at the base of the leaf stalks. The flower‚Äôs nectar is located near the upper surface of the sepals. It is self-pollinating with the aid of insects. The flowers are hermaphrodite, consisting of both female and male parts. There are usually 8 to 12 seeds per flower that are arranged in a ring. The tough seed coat enables it to remain dormant in the soil for up to 100 years. Seeds tend to germinate late in the springtime during temperatures of 15-20 degrees C (60-68 degrees F). Uses =Dyes= Dyes can be obtained from the Malva pusilla plant and seed heads, such as cream, yellow, and green. The root can also be used as a toothbrush. =Food= Some species of mallows are eaten as a leaf vegetable. The leaves and seeds of Malva pusilla are edible. They have a mild and pleasant flavor that can be used in salads. =Medicinal= Malva pusilla has medicinal uses. The leaves are demulcent, which can be used as a soothing agent to relieve minor pain and membrane inflammation. They can be used to treat inflammation of the digestive and urinary systems. The seed of the Malva pusilla can be used in the treatment of coughs, bronchitis, ulcers, and hemorrhoids. It can also be applied externally to treat diseases of the skin. Although there have been no indications of dangerous toxicity, the leaves of Malva pusilla can be highly concentrated in nitrates, which can be dangerous to animals. Cross hybridization Extensive hybridization can be done within the Mallow genus Malva. A cross between Malva pusilla and Malva neglecta is Malva √óhenningii. A cross between Malva pusilla and Malva sylvestris is Malva √ólittoralis.

It is a premium-category product, and has won several awards. For producing the blends available as of 2010, more than 30 whiskies were used in the mix, including some that were aged more than 30 years and some that were aged in old umeshu casks. A bamboo charcoal filtering step has also been used. The company said the process \\"Gives it a very sweet and gentle flavor\\". In 2015, it was reported that at least 10 malt and grain whiskies were used from three distilleries (Yamazaki, Hakushu, and Chita), aged in five different cask types, with some elements aged up to approximately 20 years or longer.

(In the convention for whisky age statements, the age stated is the age of the youngest whisky in the blend.) A 30-year expression was introduced in 1997, and a 12-year expression was introduced in 2009.

Leaves are ovate to lanceolate, cordate at the base and acuminate at the apex, pubescent especially beneath and on the veins of the lower surface; by maturing, hairs remain only on the veins and along the margin. Flowers and fruit Flowers are grouped in reduced terminal or axillary inflorescences, each cyme consisting of 1, rarely 2, flowers. The flower is funnel-shaped. Its color is white or cream. It has a greenish or cream calyx supporting the spreading white corolla. The stamens are enclosed in its throat. The flower can have either globose or elongated fruit capsule, which is narrowly ovate and contains four dark reddish-brown seeds. Each seed contains a fringe of white or yellow silky hairs. Flowers of I. arborescens are major nectar sources for lesser long nosed bats, hummingbirds, and bees. Deer feed on the fallen flowers. Diseases If contact is made with the fungi Fusarium oxysporum, stem rot disease can easily occur in humid conditions. When there are high levels of moisture or irrigation, the fungi releases spores that cause the plant to swell, damaging its vascular system. Some symptoms are stunted growth, flowers growing less, and yellow foliage. If it is not treated, the plant may die.

Naturalist and botanist Thomas Nuttall was the first to describe the prairie sunflower in 1821.Nuttall, Thomas 1821. Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 2(1): 115‚Äì116 diagnosis in Latin, description and commentary in English The word petiolaris in Latin means, ‚Äúhaving a petiole‚Äù. The species originated in Western United States, but has since expanded east. The prairie sunflower is sometimes considered a weed. Distribution H. petiolaris originated in the dry prairies of Minnesota, Oregon, Texas, the Dakotas, California, and other states in Western and Central United States. It has since expanded its distribution to throughout the Eastern United States and into central and western Canada. It is now the most widely distributed species of sunflower besides H. annuus. Habitat and ecology Prairie sunflowers are commonly found growing in sandy areas. They can also be found in heavy clay soil and in dry prairies. They are unable to grow in shady areas; they need to be in direct sunlight. Prairie sunflowers require dry to moist soil. This species of sunflower is an annual flower, blooming between June and September. Morphology Prairie sunflower is a taprooted annual. It grows up to 4 ft (120 cm) tall. The leaves appear alternate and the flowers have a close resemblance to the traditional sunflower. The flowers are hermaphrodites, which means the flowers contain both male and female parts. The stem of the flower is erect and hairy. The leaves are alternate, have a lanceolate shape, are rough in texture, are bluish-green in color, and have a length between 2 and 5 in. Flowers Prairie Sunflower H. petiolaris has flower heads reminiscent of those of a common sunflower, H. annuus. The fruits of the flowers are known as achenes. The flower head contains 10-30 yellow ray florets, surrounding 50-100 dark red-brown disc florets, and green, lanceolate phyllaries (bracts). The center of the flower has hints of white due to the presence of white hairs on the chaff. The flowers attract butterflies and bees for pollination. =Food= The seeds in the plant are edible and can be ground up into an oily meal or into a butter. =Medicinal= Powdered leaves of the prairie sunflower are said to work well with the healing of sores and swellings. ;Varieties *H. p. var. canescens A.Gray \\\\- Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Chihuahua *H. p. var. var. fallax (Heiser) B.L.Turner \\\\- Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah *H. p. var. var. petiolaris - most of species range References petiolaris Category:Plants described in 1821 Category:Flora of North America ","title":"Helianthus petiolaris"},{"id":"35693855","text":"Meconopsis bella is commonly known as the pretty blue poppy.

The United States Shipping Board took control of the ship from Southern Pacific Steamship Company in 1917. Conversion She was fitted out for United States Navy service at Tietjen & Lang's shipyard at Hoboken, New Jersey. Work began on 16 November 1917. Gun platforms were added for two anti-aircraft guns forward and a 5\\"/51 caliber gun aft. The minelaying conversion enabled her to carry mines on three decks, and included six Otis elevators individually capable of transferring two mines every 20 seconds from the storage decks to the launching deck. Stern ports were cut for launching the mines and the rudder quadrant was raised to give adequate clearance. Watertight subdivision was improved by strengthening existing bulkheads and building two new bulkheads to divide the largest compartments so the ship might stay afloat if only one compartment were flooded. Quarters were enlarged to accommodate messing and berthing arrangements for a crew of about 400. The main machinery was overhauled and auxiliary machinery was added for the elevators, for heating the berthing spaces, for refrigerated food storage, for additional fresh water distilling capacity, for magazine sprinklers and galley and washroom plumbing, and enlarged electric generators for lighting and radio communications. Existing coal bunkers on the third deck were replaced with a bunker in the hold forward of the boiler room with chutes to load coal over the mines.

The hybrid notion of blurring the real and the virtual is expanded in the third space through distributed presence, in which the participants of the third space are in distributed physical spaces, essentially, referring to a shared electronic social space. The third space extends the notion of the real and the virtual by suggesting a hybrid space that allows remote participants to engage in social relations with one another at a distance. In discourse of dissent, the Third Space has come to have two interpretations: * that space where the oppressed plot their liberation: the whispering corners of the tavern or the bazaar * that space where oppressed and oppressor are able to come together, free (maybe only momentarily) of oppression itself, embodied in their particularity. In educational studies, ManiotesManiotes, L. K. (2005). The transformative power of literary third space. Doctoral dissertation, School of Education, University of Colorado, Boulder. examined literary Third Space in a classroom where students' cultural capital merged with content of the curriculum as students backed up their arguments in literature discussions. Skerrett associates it with a multiliteracies approach. Pre- school: Third Space Theory has been applied to the prespace within which children learn to read, bringing domestic and school literacy practices into their own constructions of literacy. Another contemporary construction of three \\"spaces\\" is that one space is the domestic sphere: the family and the home; a second space is the sphere of civic engagement including school, work and other forms of public participation; and set against these is a Third Space where individual, sometimes professional, and sometimes transgressive acts are played out: where people let their \\"real\\" selves show. Sporting associations may be labeled as Third Space. Often bars and nightclubs are so labeled (Law 2000, 46‚Äì47). Latterly the term Third Space has been appropriated into brand marketing where domestic spaces and workforce-engagement spaces are set against recreational retail space: shopping malls as third spaces (see Third place, Postrel 2006; and see also Davis 2008). Bill Thompson (2007) offers an opposite conceptualisation of Third Space as public, civic space in the built environment under pressure from shopping malls and corporate enterprises, transforming public space into an extension of the market. Explanatory and predictive use Third Space Theory can explain some of the complexity of poverty, social exclusion and social inclusion, and might help predict what sort of initiatives would more effectively ameliorate poverty and exclusion. Bonds of affinity (class, kin, location: e.g. neighbourhood, etc.) can function as \\"poverty traps\\".Hoff, Karla, and Arjit Sen. 2005. The Kin System as A Poverty Trap? World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3575. World Bank Third Space Theory suggests that every person is a hybrid of their unique set of affinities (identity factors). Conditions and locations of social and cultural exclusion have their reflection in symbolic conditions and locations of cultural exchange. It appears to be accepted in policy that neither social capital nor cultural capital, alone or together, are sufficient to overcome social exclusion. Third Space Theory suggests that policies of remediation based in models of the Other are likely to be inadequate.

The plant often appears stemless. The leaves are densely covered with silvery hairs, and are narrowly oblanceolate with acute tips. The flowers are bright blue and showy (5 to 9 mm wide), with a yellow center or eye. The flowers are borne in dense clusters at the tip of the stems. The fruit consists of one to four hairy nutlets.Hitchcock, C.L., A. Cronquist, M. Ownbey, and J.W. Thompson. 1959. Vascular plants of the Pacific northwest. The New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, NY.{Dorn, R.D. 1992. Vascular plants of Wyoming. Second edition. Mountain West Publishing, Cheyenne, WY} Management The environment described in the Wyoming survey that was done indicates that this plant is most likely quite stress tolerant. It occurs in windswept areas in rough gravely substrate. Potential specific risks that this plant faces are not well understood but, due to its environment, the United States Department of Agriculture assumes that risks may include off-road vehicle recreation, road development, impacts of hikers and pack animals, grazing, and fire. Other potential threats to the species include air pollution (acid rain, nitrogen deposition), extreme weather conditions, and global warming. Eritrichum howardii may also be subject to genetic risk due to the small size and isolated nature of occurrences. Small populations of rare plants may be subject to the deleterious effects of inbreeding or the founder effect. At this time however it does not seem that reliable data on population trends exist for this species, and more study, of this species and others in this climate zone, is needed.

This rare and native species strictly grows on an alpine habitat, hence the name acraeus, meaning ‚Äúon high‚Äù. The plant grows about in width, and is covered in beautiful, bright yellow flowers. It may be mistaken for R. piliferus but research has shown R. acraeus to be its own distinctive species. Discovery R. acraeus was first discovered in 1940 but it was mistaken for a subspecies of R. haastii. In 1998, a gardener saw the plant during a hike in Mount St. Mary in North Otago and took it to a botanist. The botanist validated that it is a new species. Distribution R. acraeus is endemic, therefore it is isolated to a specific geographic location. It is found only in South Island, North Otago, New Zealand - more specifically, Barrier Range, St Marys Range, St Bathans Range, Kakanui Mountains, Ida Range, and the Waitaki Valley regions of South Island, North Otago. It is also found in Hall Range and Godley River valley regions of southwest Canterbury. It occurs in small, scattered subpopulations. The largest population of about 200 plants has been found on Mount St. Mary in St. Mary's Range. The smallest population of about three to four plants has been found on mountains around the Ohau skifield and near Tekapo. Current abundance and distribution information show that R. acraeus is nationally critical and acutely threatened. Known threats include introduced herbivores such as chamois, hare, and thar. Domestic sheep in the high alpine basin are also potential threats to R. acraeus during summer grazing. These are a threat to other alpine plant species as well. Habitat and ecology R. acraeus is specific to high alpine environments. It grows in stable, coarse rock fields of non-foliated schist and greywacke. The rocks have been fractured into coarse and angular rocks of different sizes and shapes. The rocks are about 10‚Äì30 cm in diameter. They are found on boulder fields of mountains with an upward height of 1500 meters. These buttercups do not grow well at lower altitudes and will die. Morphology R. acraeus has been mistaken for R. piliferus but minute morphological differences distinguish each plant as its own species. R. acraeus has finely crenate (wavy-toothed) leaves and bract margins. The plant also has a glabrous peduncle and 6 to 7 sepals that are glabrous on the adaxial surface and hairy on the abaxial surface. Glabrous means that it is smooth, glossy, and not hairy. More specifically, the abaxial surface of the sepal is moderately to densely covered in fine, pilose hair. The adaxial surface of the sepal is glabrous on the proximal part and sparely hairy to glabrous near the distal part. The stems hold one flower apiece. These features distinguish it from the R. piliferus. R. piliferus on the other hand has sepals that are hairy on both the adaxial and abaxial surfaces. It is a robust, summer-green, rhizomatous plant. The plant has numerous branched rhizomes. The rhizomes are fleshy, stout, and 10‚Äì12 mm in diameter. They are also regularly branched with numerous long and fleshy roots that are 2‚Äì5 mm in diameter. The plant itself forms dense and large clumps that are up to 1 metre across. Sometimes it may be larger than 1 metre. The shoots may rise up to 40 cm. The hairs on the R. acraeus are weak, soft, thin, and separated. The petioles are 5‚Äì25 cm in length and 5‚Äì9 mm in diameter. The scape is 8‚Äì40 cm in length and 5‚Äì14 mm in diameter. They are green or yellow-green and a flushed red toward the base. Flowers and fruits The R. acraeus has spectacular yellow blooms that are 4‚Äì5 cm across. Some flowers may also be green. The flowers are subtended by a leafy bract. There are 6 to 7 sepals that are yellow-green to light-green in colour. The nectary is a simple pit. The plant flowers between November and January and fruiting is between December and January. Usage There are no known usages of the plant. They would not survive if they were outside of their high-altitude alpine environmental. They would make a great ornamental plant if they were able to survive elsewhere.

The species occurs in East and Southern Africa (except in South Africa). Acanthopale pubescensis also known as Herayye in Ethiopia.  Description  Acanthopale pubescens is an erect, soft-wooded shrub or a shrubbery herb that can grow up to 2.5 m tall. The leaves are oppositely arranged and the largest leaves are 8‚Äì24 cm long, ovate to elliptic with distinct drip-tip and are narrow at the base and apex. The Flowers are hermaphroditic and have radial symmetry and the Inflorescences are lateral with terminal racemose heads and hairy on the inside. The flower is white with purple marking and the corolla is hairy on the outside. Corollas can be up to 3 cm long and vary in size. The corolla consists of the whorl of petals. The capsule is 11‚Äì14 mm long and seeds are ellipsoid to circular, and range from 3‚Äì4 mm.  Taxonomical history  The species was first but incorrectly described by Gustav Lindau as Dischistocalyx pubescens in 1895. Adolf Engler later validly published the species (ex Engler). In 1899 C.B.Clarke transferred the species to the genus Acanthopale and published this in the Flora of Tropical Africa. prologue of Acanthopale pubescens  Distribution  Acanthopale pubescens is located in the moist Afrotropic region, like Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. The Altitude range is 275-1150m and is found along the forest trails and in forest gaps.  Morphology  Acanthopale pubescens can be herbs or shrubs and can grow up to 2.5 m tall. They have adventitious roots, called stilt roots. Stilt roots develop from the basal nodes of the stem near the soil, which supports the plant against wind. The leaves with petiole are 2-6.5 cm long with hair on the edges. The leaf shapes vary from lamina ovate to elliptic. The apex of the leaf also vary from acuminate to cuspidate and base of the leaf is attenuate with broad glossy hairs along midrib and veins. Flower are arranged in racemoid head that are 3 cm long, peduncle is 0.5‚Äì23 mm long, winged, and vary from being hairy to hairless. The bracts of the flower are purplish, pedicles are 1 mm long. The Calyx is 5‚Äì10 mm long and can be found in different variety. Most of the flowers are usually white-hairy pubescent, the lobes are linear-lanceolate, and vary from acute to obtuse. The corolla is white with purple lines near the racemoid head. Also, the corolla is pubescent with glossy hairs. The stamen is 8‚Äì15 mm long, and can be acute or bifid at the apex. Lastly, the A. Pubescens have four ovules, which enables them produce maximum amount of seeds.  Food  In Ethiopia, Acanthopale pubescens is found in the Sheka forest. The plant is used as food for goats. They are also found in another forest of Ethiopia, called the Odobulla forest, the local name for Acanthopale pubescens is Herayye and are eaten by Bale Monkey.  References  Clarke, C. B.

Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company launched El Siglo at Newport News, Virginia in May 1901 for service between New York City and Gulf of Mexico seaports of New Orleans and Galveston, Texas. The United States Shipping Board took control of the ship from Southern Pacific Steamship Company in 1917. Conversion She was fitted out for United States Navy service by Morse Dry Dock and Repair Company at Brooklyn, New York. Work began on 20 November 1917. Gun platforms were added for two anti-aircraft guns forward and a 5\\"/51 caliber gun aft. The minelaying conversion enabled her to carry mines on three decks, and included six Otis elevators individually capable of transferring two mines every 20 seconds from the storage decks to the launching deck. Stern ports were cut for launching the mines and the rudder quadrant was raised to give adequate clearance. Watertight subdivision was improved by strengthening existing bulkheads and building two new bulkheads to divide the largest compartments so the ship might stay afloat if only one compartment were flooded. Quarters were enlarged to accommodate messing and berthing arrangements for a crew of about 400. The main machinery was overhauled and auxiliary machinery was added for the elevators, for heating the berthing spaces, for refrigerated food storage, for additional fresh water distilling capacity, for magazine sprinklers and galley and washroom plumbing, and enlarged electric generators for lighting and radio communications. Existing coal bunkers on the third deck were replaced with a bunker in the hold forward of the boiler room with chutes to load coal over the mines. Larger boats and heavier anchors required larger davits and anchor windlass, and the mines required specialized handling machinery.Daniels, Josephus The Northern Barrage and Other Mining Activities (1920) Government Printing Office pp.70-71 Wartime service USS Canandaigua was commissioned on 2 March 1918 with Captain W. H. Reynolds, USN, in command. While operating as part of Mine Squadron 1 out of Inverness, Scotland, from 7 June until the close of the war on 11 November 1918, Canandaigua a total of 8,829 mines: * planted 775 mines during the 1st minelaying excursion on 7 June, * planted 710 mines during the 2nd minelaying excursion on 30 June, * planted 760 mines during the 3rd minelaying excursion on 14 July, * planted 779 mines during the 4th minelaying excursion on 29 July, * planted 170 mines during the 5th minelaying excursion on 8 August, * planted 640 mines during the 6th minelaying excursion on 18 August, * planted 810 mines during the 7th minelaying excursion on 26 August, * planted 820 mines during the 8th minelaying excursion on 7 September, * planted 830 mines during the 9th minelaying excursion on 20 September, * planted 840 mines during the 10th minelaying excursion on 27 September, * planted 840 mines during the 11th minelaying excursion on 4 October, and * planted 855 mines during the 12th minelaying excursion on 13 October. Canandaigua then made three trips returning soldiers of the American Expeditionary Forces to the United States before decommissioning and return to Southern Pacific Steamship Company in 1919. Big Four In the words of British Rear Admiral Lewis Clinton-Baker, the North Sea mine barrage was the \\"biggest mine planting stunt in the world's history.\\" The United States converted eight civilian steamships as minelayers for the 100,000 mines manufactured for the barrage.

It is native to regions in Spain and Africa, but can be grown as an ornamental flower around the world. It is a perennial woody plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. (Along with the other foxgloves it used to be placed in the figwort family, Scrophulariaceae; however, recent genetic research has moved the genus Digitalis to a larger family.) The sunset foxglove is similar to many of the foxglove species in its high toxicity and medicinal use as a source for the heart-regulating drug digoxin. Its strikingly distinctive amber- to copper- colored flowers give the species its name and help distinguish it from other members of the genus. Description and habitat Digitalis obscura is native to eastern to southern Spain and northern Africa. It occurs in both the mountains and the lowlands near the coast. However, it can be grown in many non-native areas as an ornamental plant. Digitalis obscura naturally grows well in dry climates and in high altitudes. Unlike many other foxgloves, it is drought-tolerant when it is deeply rooted and established. It thrives in average, well-drained soil with pH levels of 5.8‚Äì7.2. It may die if left in wet soil over winter. Digitalis obscura grows in either full or partial sun. It blooms during late spring from May to June and spreads over the ground about 0.75‚Äì1.5 feet. Once established, it is perennial and grows at a rather moderate to fast pace. It is non-invasive and attracts hummingbirds. It is naturally resistant to deer and rabbits. artist depiction of Digitalis obscura Morphology Digitalis obscura is a shrub that grows about tall. The stems are smooth and erect. The long leaves are basal and form in a rosette fashion growing outward closer to the ground. Smaller leaves grow alternately along the stem. The thick, glossy leaves are lanceolate in shape, with acute tips. The leaves have a blue-green color and a leathery texture that gives them a shine. Flowers The many flowers of the plant are large and tubular, opening into a funnel shape. They droop from the point of attachment to the stem, occurring in clusters on the same side of the floral axis. The flowers are approximately long and have an appearance of dropping bells or snipped-off fingers as the common name of the genus, foxglove, suggests. The sunset foxglove is noted for its rusty dark-orange to green-yellow colored flowers that distinguishes it from the other foxgloves. Inside the flowers, red venation and spotting can also be seen as well as tiny hairs at the tips. The arrangement of the flowers in respect to the stalk is racemes and the flowers droop downward. Digitalis obscura flowers close-up Usage =Medicinal= Digitalis obscura, like many of the other foxgloves, has been used in medicine as a diuretic and to treat heart conditions. For people suffering from heart disease or other heart-related conditions, it can be used to regulate heart rate. In human folk medicine, Digitalis obscura was used for many purposes, such as treating wounds and toothaches. However, the use of herbal medicinal remedies using Digitalis obscura has lessened to a great degree because of the knowledge of its high toxicity. In ethnoveterinary medicine, the flowering stems of Digitalis obscura were traditionally used to promote wound healing and treat toothaches in animals. It is one of twenty-three species traditionally used in Granada to treat trauma or poisoning in animals. =Toxicity = All parts of Digitalis obscura are poisonous if ingested raw, including the roots and seeds. The most potent parts of the plant are the upper leaves. All foxgloves are highly toxic if eaten because they contain various cardiac glycosides such as digitoxin, digitalin, digitonin, digitalosmin, gitoxin and gitalonin. During digestion, aglycones and a sugar are released by the breakdown of these glycosides. The aglycones directly affect heart muscles and may slow the heart rate until cardiac arrest occurs.

D. poeticum is a species of the genus Dodecatheon which is native to the states of Oregon and Washington in western North America. The genus Dodecatheon contains herbaceous flowering plants and is also a part of the primrose family Primulaceae. This plant has basal clumps of leaves and drooping flowers that occur at the apex of tall stems that rise from where the leaves join. History D. poeticum was discovered by Dr. Louis F. Henderson of the University of Oregon in 1930. The discovery of this flower was made shortly after the discovery and identification of another plant from the same genus, Dodecatheon dentatum. During the initial classification of the white colored D. dentataum, botanists must have overlooked the purple pink D. poeticum. Unlike the other species, information regarding the classification of D. poeticum was rare and many botanists claimed texts describing the diversity of flora in northwestern America rarely mentioned its abundance. Due to recent research and classification efforts, D. poeticum now has volumes of information regarding its features and is commonly found in nature and nurseries alike. pedicel are glandular and covered by fine short hairs The rugose connective of the stamens is not present in the otherwise similar Dodecatheon pulchellum var. cusickii Morphology D. poeticum has erect stems and leaves. It arises from a root with many fibrous fibers which become fleshy during flowering time. All the flower parts above ground except the corolla are glandular and are covered by fine short hairs. The leaves are grouped in alternate, opposite or whorled distributions. The leaves are entire to lobed in shape and are 5 to 12 centimeters in length. The leaves vary from narrowly egg shaped with the widest section below the middle to narrowly lance shaped. The leaf margins on D. poeticum are more finely toothed than on Dodecatheon dentatum. D. poeticum has petioles that are about the same length as the leaves or shorter. The petals are unusual and curved often in bright hues of pink to lavender. The corolla is five lobed similar to Dodecatheon dentatum while many other species of Dodecatheon only contain four. The flower, composed of both stamens and pistils is deep purple. The corolla is yellow in color at the base and dark purple at the top. The flowers droop slightly. As the plant continues to age and eventually die, the seed capsules turn completely erect, ripen and discharge their seeds for new plants during the next growing season. Distribution Dodecatheon poeticum is native to the dryer areas near the lower Columbia River in Washington and Oregon. Other sources do not include Josephine County in southern Oregon. D. poeticum is mainly found in the Northwestern region of the United States mainly in the arid transition zone in Washington and Oregon. Compared to other members of its genus, D. poeticum is found in more open, sunny areas and in drier woodlands. Occasionally it is found under the shade of Ponderosa pines but is more commonly found in open meadows with ample sunshine. In addition, this plant is also found widely distributed along petroleum seep sites. These flowers flourish in areas that provide abundant springtime moisture followed by dry conditions in the summer. D. poeticum prefers to grow in a region where the soil is composed of rich humus and fine sand that has been deposited by the winds through the Columbia River Gorge. They are typically found at an altitude of 0 to 1,677 meters. Propagation D. poeticum blooms in a perennial manner. Meaning, as opposed to annual flowers which complete their lifecycle in just one growing season, perennial flowers grow for three or more years at a time. D. poeticum first emerges in the springtime as a small, unassuming basal clump of oval, soft green leaves. After this growth a slender flower stalk rises from a few inches to over a foot above the foliage. This flower generally booms from March to April, however in the region of the Columbia River Gorge the season can vary by as much as a month or more. Pests and diseases D. poeticum is virtually pest and disease free. If grown properly, D. poeticum will gradually spread and colonize from self- seeding.

Corydalis micrantha ssp. australis is currently an endangered species in Illinois. Regions Where C. micrantha ssp. australis is found Regions Where C. micrantha ssp. texensis is found Morphology Corydalis micrantha subsp. micrantha consists of a rosette of basal leaves that are about 8‚Äù across and also has several flowering stalks that are around 8‚Äù in length.Corydalis, April 16, 2012 The blades of the basal leaves can be up to 3‚Äù long and 2‚Äù across. These basal leaves are pinnately compound and have colors ranging from dull green to greyish blue, and they are also hairless. Each flowering stalk terminates in a raceme of flowers that can be up to 3‚Äù long. The flowers have short pedicles and are small bracted The normal flowered racemes do not greatly exceed the leaves and are often short. The spurs of the flower are spherical at the tips of the flowers. The fruits are frequently firm and are usually 10‚Äì15 mm. long. Each of the flowers has a corolla that consists of two outer petals that range in color from yellow to pale yellow and two inner petals that are whiter and membranous. The C. micrantha ssp. australis racemes are normal flowered that often greatly exceeds the leaves. The spurs are not globose at the tip of the flower and have slender fruits that are 15‚Äì30 mm. long. The pedicels are erect and are usually 2‚Äì5 mm long and 1‚Äì3 mm wide. The corolla of the flower are light yellow and have spurred petals that are 9‚Äì15 mm long The fruit capsule is erect and the body is cylindrical around 15‚Äì20 mm long. The seeds are about 1.5‚Äì2 mm broad and they do not contain a marginal ring.

It is an endangered species that grows in high altitudes. The height of the plant varies from 20 cm to 1m. It is a monocarpic, dicot plant. Morphology Meconopsis horridula flower with spiny capsules Meconopsis horridula is a species with many variations in leaf structure and inflorescence. In the wild, the flowers are solitary or arranged in a raceme. The plant is monocarpic (it produces seeds and dies) with a plump taproot. The stem and pedicels have straw-colored spines on their surface. The plant has basal leaves (about 25 cm) arranged in a rosette. The leaves are elliptical or narrow-oblong shaped, tapering into the petiole. The leaf margin is entire or slightly lobed or toothed. The leaves have a base attenuate to petiole and an obtuse or acute apex. The adaxial and abaxial surface of the leaf is covered with yellowish or purplish spines that grow from purple wart-like structures. In some cases they are covered with bristles. The upper leaves are smaller and bract-like. \\"Meconopsis horridula\\" has deciduous leaves. The open-faced flowers are usually in shades of blue or reddish blue, but rarely white. The flowers are 5-7.5 cm in size. The stalk is usually less than 22 cm long. The stalk that bears the flower is bent, so the flower is not held upright and is droopy. The overlapping petals are arranged in a broad cup shape. The 4-8 petals are oval. The sepals have bristles on the adaxial surface. When solitary, flowers are arranged on scape. In some cases, the flowers are gathered together (agglomerated) in the lower half of the stem. The stamens (10-14mm) hold greyish-black anthers and the pollen is yellow or orange- yellow. The filaments and petals are similar color usually. The pistil consists of a style (6-7mm) with yellow stigma. The ovary is conical and has compressed spines on the outer surface. The seeds are reniform, small, dark brown and have pointed ends. They are contained within a pod covered with spines (spines have thickened base). This pod is called a capsule, which is a domed cylinder tapering towards one end. The capsule is about 1.5 cm to 2 cm long and 0.6 cm to 1.1 cm wide. Since \\"Meconopsis horridula\\" is a dicot plant, the seeds have two cotyledons.Meconopsis horridula in Flora of China Distribution Meconopsis horridula can be found from as far west as western Nepal, through the central and eastern Himalayas, to southeastern Tibet (Xizang) and western China (western Kansu to Sichuan and northwestern Yunnan). Habitat and ecology Meconopsis horridula grows in rocky areas and grass slopes at altitudes from 3100 to almost 6000m, close to the limit for vegetation at these altitudes. These plants can be grown in slightly shaded or sunny, cool areas, in meadows and rocky regions. They can also grow with other shrubs such as the rhododendron. They require plenty of moisture while growing and do not need protection from winter. Since they grow on high altitudes, they can tolerate temperatures as low as -10 degrees F. The flower color is not affected by the alkalinity of the soil. Usage Meconopsis horridula is used for ornamental and horticultural purposes but considering the monocarpic nature of the plant, it is difficult to cultivate. It has been cultivated from 1904, mostly coming from China and Tibet. When cultivated, the basal leaves die and a dormant bud is left behind along with a tap root. The new saplings have few leaves and are vulnerable to strong winds. The plants take about two years (2-3 seasons after the seed) to reach the flowering stage. They are fairly resistant to droughts. They are tolerant and robust when it comes to growing in gardens. When the flowers are in a raceme, the flowers at the top bloom first and turn into fruits by the time the lower flowers have bloomed. The seeds germinate when sown in mild heat conditions or a warm bright spot under the sun. Germination of seeds is slow but reliable when sown in a cool place during spring. Plants like well-drained neutral soil. The young seedling has heart-shaped leaves. Traditional medicine Meconopsis horridula is used in Chinese traditional herbal medicine because of its anti-inflammatory and analgesic qualities. As such, they are widely extracted thereby making this species endangered. Although one plant produces many seeds, germination is low in natural and laboratory settings. As the demand for this plant increases, more and more plants are likely to be uprooted.

The earliest, \\"The Bold Canadian\\", was written in 1812.  Canadian anthems  = National anthem = \\"O Canada\\" is the national anthem of Canada. Calixa Lavall√©e wrote the music in 1880 as a setting of a French Canadian patriotic poem composed by poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. \\"O Canada\\" served as one of two de facto national anthems after 1939, officially becoming Canada's singular national anthem in 1980, when the Act of Parliament making it so received Royal Assent and became effective on July 1 as part of that year's Dominion Day celebrations. The national anthem is routinely played before sporting events involving Canadian teams. = Royal anthem = \\"God Save the Queen\\" is the royal anthem of Canada. There are various claims of authorship and several previous songs of similar style, but the first published version of what is almost the present tune appeared in 1744 in Thesaurus Musicus. The song has been used in Canada since the era when it was a collection of British colonies and \\"God Save the King\\" (or \\"God Save the Queen\\" during the reign of Queen Victoria) was played in honour of the British monarch. It has remained in use through Canada's progression to independence, becoming eventually one of the country's two de facto national anthems. After \\"O Canada\\" was in 1980 proclaimed the national anthem, \\"God Save The Queen\\" has been performed as the royal anthem, in the presence of the Canadian monarch, other members of the Royal Family, and as part of the salute accorded to the Governor General of Canada and provincial lieutenant governors, as well as on other occasions.  Provincial anthems  \\"Alberta\\" is the official provincial song of Alberta, adopted in preparation for the province's centennial celebrations in 2005. The song was selected following a competition mandated by the Alberta Official Song Act, introduced in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in May 2001 and passed in November. Lucy Maud Montgomery ca. 1935 \\"The Island Hymn\\" is a provincial anthem of Prince Edward Island. The hymn's lyrics were written in 1908 by Lucy Maud Montgomery, with music written by Lawrence W. Watson. It was performed for the first time in public on May 22, 1908. The manuscript music, dated October 27, 1908, and correspondence relating to it are displayed at Green Gables House, Cavendish. The Island Hymn was adopted as the provincial anthem by the legislative assembly on May 7, 2010. The Provincial Anthem Act includes a French version of the Island Hymn, adapted by Raymond J. Arsenault of Abram- Village and called L'hymne de l'√éle. \\"Ode to Newfoundland\\" is the official provincial anthem of Newfoundland and Labrador. Governor Sir Cavendish Boyle composed it in 1902 as a four-verse poem entitled Newfoundland.Volume four, p. 168, Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, . It was set to the music of British composer Sir Hubert Parry, a personal friend of Boyle, who composed two settings. On May 20, 1904, it was chosen as Newfoundland's official national anthem (national being understood as a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire on par with Canada). This distinction was dropped when Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949. Three decades later, in 1980, the province re-adopted the song as an official provincial anthem. \\"A Place to Stand, a Place to Grow (Ontari-ari-ari-o!)\\" is an unofficial anthem of Ontario. The song was written by Dolores Claman, with English lyrics by Richard Morris, French lyrics by Larry Trudel, and orchestrations by Jerry Toth. It was commissioned by the Progressive Conservative government of John Robarts as the signature tune for a movie of the same name that was featured at the Ontario pavilion at Expo 67, the World's Fair held in Montreal, Quebec, in Canada's Centennial year. It was used again in the Ontario's segment of the short film A Place to Stand, which won the 1967 Academy Award for Live Action Short Film. George-√âtienne Cartier ca. 1871 \\"√î Canada! mon pays, mes amours\\" is a French- Canadian song, written by George-√âtienne Cartier first sung in 1834, during a patriotic banquet of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society held in Montreal. The words were first published in the June 29, 1835, edition of La Minerve and its music in Le Chansonnier des coll√®ges in 1850; it is uncertain when the lyrics and music were put together, probably by Ernest Gagnon sometime between 1850 and 1868. The music currently used was composed by Jean-Baptiste Labelle. \\"Gens du pays\\" has been called the unofficial national anthem of Quebec. Written by poet, songwriter, and avowed Quebec nationalist Gilles Vigneault (with music co-written by Gaston Rochon), it was first performed by Vigneault on June 24, 1975, during a concert on Montreal's Mount Royal at that year's F√™te nationale du Qu√©bec ceremony. It quickly became a folk classic, and it has been played frequently at F√™te nationale ceremonies since then. The chorus is by far the most famous part of the song: Gens du pays, c'est votre tour / De vous laisser parler d'amour, which, translated, says, \\"Folks of the land, it is your turn to let yourselves talk of love.\\" At this time, Vigneault invited Quebecers to use this song when someone celebrate a birthday, changing \\"Gens du pays\\" by \\"Mon cher (name)...\\". In many families, this song can be heard when the cake approaches.  Early patriotic songs  \\"The Bold Canadian\\", also known as \\"Come all ye bold Canadians\\", is a Canadian patriotic song that originated during the War of 1812. The lyrics celebrate the Canadian conquest of Detroit in the Michigan Territory. It is believed that the song was written by a private from the Third York Militia's First Flank Company named Cornelius Flummerfelt. Until 1907, the song was only passed on in oral traditions, with a few different versions gaining popularity. Full versions of the song were not published until 1927 when the Ontario Historical Society published two different versions of the song. A third version was published in 1960. All three varied, with different stanzas and order of stanzas.Hickey p.351 \\"The Maple Leaf Forever\\" is an older but unofficial national anthem written by Alexander Muir in 1867. It was in consideration for official national anthem; however, as no French version was ever written, it was never popular with Francophones.  Popular patriotic songs  \\"Canada\\", also known as \\"Ca-na-da\\", \\"The Centennial Song\\", or \\"Une chanson du centenaire\\" in French, was written by Bobby Gimby in 1967 to celebrate Canada's centennial and Expo 67. It was commissioned by the Centennial Commission (a special Federal Government agency), and written in both of Canada's official languages, English and French. The song's recording was performed by the Young Canada Singers, two groups of children ‚Äì one that sang the French lyrics, led by Montreal conductor Raymond Berthiaume, and another that sang in English, under conductor Laurie Bower in Toronto. The musical score was composed by Ben McPeek. The single went on to be the most successful single in Canada in 1967, selling a then unprecedented 270,000 copies. Gordon Lightfoot ca. 2008 \\"Something to Sing About\\" is a patriotic song written by folk singer Oscar Brand in 1963 that sings the praises of the many different regions of Canada. It was used as the theme for Let's Sing Out, a folk music show that aired on CTV and CBC and was the theme song for the Canadian pavilion at Expo 67, and there was once a movement for it to chosen as Canada's national anthem in 1965. \\"Canadian Railroad Trilogy\\" is a song by Gordon Lightfoot that describes the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway. This song was commissioned by the CBC for a special broadcast on January 1, 1967, to start Canada's Centennial year. It appeared on Lightfoot's The Way I Feel album later in the same year. Lightfoot re-recorded the track on his 1975 compilation album, Gord's Gold, with full orchestration (arranged by Lee Holdridge). A live version also appears on his 1969 album Sunday Concert. Additionally, the song was covered by John Mellencamp, George Hamilton IV, and James Keelaghan who performed the song on the Lightfoot tribute album, Beautiful. In 2001, Gordon Lightfoot's \\"Canadian Railroad Trilogy\\" was honoured as one of the Canadian MasterWorks by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada. \\"The Hockey Theme\\" is a Canadian theme song written in 1968 by Dolores Claman and orchestrated by Jerry Toth. The theme is popularly associated with Canada's national winter sport: hockey. It gained popularity through associated with CBC Television's Hockey Night in Canada, and T√©l√©vision de Radio-Canada's La Soir√©e du hockey from 1968 until 2008. In 2008 the CBC announced that the negotiations to renew their licence or purchase the theme had been unsuccessful and that they would run a national contest to find a new theme song. The rights were then purchased by rival broadcaster CTV in perpetuity.

Persecution of Hazara people in Quetta, Pakistan. The Hazara community in Quetta, in Pakistan, has been the target of persecution and violence. Terrorist organisations like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi have often accepted responsibility for conducting attacks on Hazaras in Pakistan. Hazaras have been living in Afghanistan before partition since 1880s. Almost all migrated due to persecution by Abdur Rahman Khan and a good part in 1990's due to ethnic cleansing by the Afghan Taliban. Their ethnicity is easily identifiable due to their physical features.  Perpetrators  Acts of violence involving Sunni Muslims and their Shia counterparts in Pakistan have been evident since the 1980s. They are generally considered to have arisen from attempts by the then national leader, Zia ul-Haq, to legitimise his military dictatorship and from the influx of weapons into the country following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Although the perpetrators often do not claim responsibility for the attacks, expert analysis suggests that in recent times it is the Sunnis who are dominating the aggression and that they are motivated by the ideology of Al-Qaeda. Quetta, which is the capital of the Pakistani province of Balochistan, has seen numerous of these violent incidents. This is in part because of a separatist movement involving militants from the ethnic minority who desire greater autonomy and also because the Pakistani military is engaged in counter-insurgency operations near to the province's border with Afghanistan, where there is tribal strife that involves the Taliban and allied groups. It is widely assumed that the Al- Qaeda-affiliated Sunni Muslim extremist militant group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) and Sipah-e-Sahaba, is behind the attacks on the Hazara community in the region. There are differences of opinion regarding whether LeJ is a breakaway group of a banned former political party, Sipah-e-Sahaba, or simply its armed wing. The LeJ openly issues death threats to Hazaras through newspaper ads and describes them as wajib-ul-qatl (deserving of death). Lashkar-e-Jhangvi operates from sanctuaries in Afghanistan.  Response  Various advocacy groups, such as the Hazara People International Network, have been formed to publicise the situation and promote opposition to it. The Hazara diaspora in Australia, Western Europe and North America have also joined these protests from time to time. Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq, the political leader of the Hazara in Afghanistan, has also expressed solidarity with the Hazara community in Quetta. The persecution carried out against the Hazara have been documented by the United Nations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Asian Human Rights Commission, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission.Retrieved 2.4.2012 Former Balochistan chief minister Aslam Raisani was asked to resign by protesters after Mastung Massacre. Mahmood Khan Achakzai, and Sardar Akhtar Mengal condemned the killings and demanded that the Pakistani security establishment take stern action against those involved in terrorism and acts of violence against civilians. Hazaras have also asked the government to deploy soldiers in Quetta to provide them protection from the attacks. Many Hazaras demanded that Pakistan army should take control of the province. In response, many members and leaders of Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ) have been killed in military operations conducted by the army and the police.

It is a perennial shrub which is native to North America. Synonyms As for its binomial name, C. herbaceus has several vernacular names: narrow-leaved New Jersey tea, inland ceanothus, inland Jersey tea, prairie root, and smaller redroot.Species profile on VASCAN. Retrieved on 14 February 2018. Distribution Ceanothus herbaceus naturally occurs throughout North America. It can be found in Canada from southeastern Manitoba to Quebec. Within the United States, the plant can be found from Montana east to Massachusetts and Virginia. They range south from Rocky Mountains to New Mexico, east to Arkansas and Louisiana. Habitat and ecology The Jersey tea is a drought-tolerant species with roots that can develop up to 15 feet. It grows in well-drained soils and in full sun. The basal shoots grows faster following a fire. It is one of the host plants of the mottled duskywing (Erynnis martialis) in its Eastern-North American distribution. Morphology Ceanothus herbaceus is an erect shrub, ranging between 0.5 and 1 meter in height. The shrub is mainly hemispheric in shape with its branches varying from ascending to spreading. The distal branchlets, which grows from the main stem are flexible and have internodes between 12‚Äì31 mm long. They are usually smooth in texture and green in color. The bark of the stem is grayish brown, and the stipules, which are outgrowths on either side of the base of a leaf stalk, are thin and deciduous. The leaves of the shrub are alternate and deciduous. The petiole, which attaches the leaf blade to the stem, is approximately 3‚Äì5 mm long. The leaf blades vary between 35‚Äì74 mm longitudinally and 10-32 mm laterally and come in a diverse shapes, including wide, narrowly elliptic to lanceolate, eventually narrowing to acute to obtuse point at the apex. Three veins arise unevenly just above the leaf base. The leaves are serrated with rounded teeth around the margin; about 37-71 per leaf. The upper surface of the leaf is dull green and nearly glabrous. The lower surface is dull green with long, soft unmatted hair, often drying rusty brown. The shrub has a terminal inflorescence which is approximately 15‚Äì30 mm long. It is panicle-like and maintains a hemispheric shape. Holding the inflorescence and providing it support is a long stem, known as peduncle. It is typically 26‚Äì48 mm in length, usually with a few reduced leaves near the base. Rachis, which is the main axis of the inflorescence, and peduncles are puberulent to somewhat tomentulose. Pedicel, a stem that attaches single flower the main stem of the inflorescence, is about 5‚Äì11 mm long and often glabrous. Close-up on flowers. =Flowers and fruit= The small, white flowers of C. herbaceus in a dense, rounded cluster are about 0.5 to 0.75 inch wide. It has its disk either dull white or greenish. It has calyces with 5 incurved lobes and 5 petals and sepals. The flower is spoon-shaped and clawed, that consists of 5 stamens. The plant bears a fruit that is 3-4.5 mm wide. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule about inches in diameter that opens at maturity to release seeds. The seeds are usually brown and 2-2.5 mm long, and come in variety of shapes ranging from subglobose to ovoid. The flowering occurs between March and August and fruiting between July and September. The flower attracts insects, which aid in pollination. The fruit attracts birds, including bobwhite quail, that feed on the seeds. It also serves as a host plant to the azure blue butterfly. Usage The Ojibwe take a decoction of the root as a cough remedy.Densmore, Frances, 1928, Uses of Plants by the Chippewa Indians, SI-BAE Annual Report #44:273-379, page 340 The Brul√© Lakota brew the leaves into a tea.

The mega project has three major objectives of strategic research, technology demonstrations and capacity building. Assessment of the impact of climate change simultaneous with formulation of adaptive strategies is the prime approach under strategic research across all sectors of agriculture, dairying and fisheries. Evolving climate resilient agricultural technologies that would increase farm production and productivity vis-√†-vis continuous management of natural and manmade resources constitute an integral part of sustaining agriculture in the era of climate change. The four modules of NICRA ‚Äì natural resource management, improving soil health, crop production and livestock ‚Äì is aimed making the farmers self-reliant.NICRA project launched at Vadavathur Objectives # To enhance the resilience of Indian agriculture covering crops, livestock and fisheries to climatic variability and climate change through development and application of improved production and risk management technologies. # To demonstrate site specific technology packages on farmers' fields for adapting to current climate risks. # To enhance the capacity of scientists and other stakeholders in climate resilient agricultural research and its application. Output # Selection of promising crop genotypes and livestock breeds with greater tolerance to climatic stress. # Existing best bet practices for climate resilience demonstrated in 100 vulnerable districts. # Infrastructure at key research institutes for climatic change research strengthened. # Adequately trained scientific manpower to take up climate change research in the country and empowered farmers to cope with climate variability. Components of the Scheme The Scheme will be implemented for the remaining two years (2010‚Äì11 and 2011‚Äì12) of the XI Plan and likely to continue in the XII Plan with the following four components.NICRA Brochure # Strategic research on adaptation and mitigation. # Technology demonstration to cope with current climate variability in 100 vulnerable districts. # Capacity building # Sponsored competitive research to fill critical gaps Key Features # Critical assessment of different crops/zones in the country for vulnerability to climatic stresses and extreme events, in particular, intra seasonal variability of rainfall # Installation of the state-of-the-art equipment like flux towers for measurement of green house gases in large field areas to understand the impact of management practices and contribute data on emissions as national responsibility. # Rapid and large scale screening of crop germplasm including wild relatives for drought and heat tolerance through phenomics platforms for quick identification of promising lines and early development and release of heat/drought tolerant varieties. # Comprehensive field evaluation of new and emerging approaches of paddy cultivation like aerobic rice and SRI for their contribution to reduce the GHG emissions and water saving. # Special attention to livestock and fishery sectors including aquaculture which have not received enough attention in climate change research in the past. In particular, the documentation of adaptive traits in indigenous breeds is the most useful step. # Thorough understanding of crop- pest/pathogen relationship and emergence of new biotypes due to climate change. # Simultaneous up-scaling of the outputs both through KVKs and the National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture for wider adoption by the farmers # Integrated simulation modeling for research, development and policy support Strategic Research Adaptation to climate variability and climate change requires long term strategic research in the area of Natural Resource Management, Crops, Pests and disease dynamics, Livestock, Fisheries & Energy Efficiency. Focused programmes are taken up on different commodities on adaptation and mitigation. The strategic research is being carried out involving 21 Institutes of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research out of which seven are core institutes where state of the art research infrastructure and equipments will be installed for climate change research on irrigated crops, rainfed crops, horticulture, livestock, fisheries and energy efficiency.

The process of finalizing demonstration consists of the following steps: # Analysis of climatic constraints of village based on long term data # Assessment of the natural resources status of the village # Identification of major production systems # Studying of existing institutional structures and identify gaps Focus group discussion with the community to finalize the interventions The interventions cover the following four modules: Module I : Natural resources This module consists of interventions related to in-situ moisture conservation, water harvesting and recycling for supplemental irrigation, improved drainage in flood prone areas, conservation tillage where appropriate, artificial ground water recharge and water saving irrigation methods. Module II : Crop Production This module consists of introducing drought/temperature tolerant varieties, advancement of planting dates of rabi crops in areas with terminal heat stress, water saving paddy cultivation methods (SRI, aerobic, direct seeding), frost management in horticulture through fumigation, community nurseries for delayed monsoon, custom hiring centres for timely planting, location specific intercropping systems with high sustainable yield index. Module III : Livestock and Fisheries Use of community lands for fodder production during droughts/floods, improved fodder/feed storage methods, preventive vaccination, improved shelters for reducing heat stress in livestock, management of fish ponds/tanks during water scarcity and excess water, etc. Module IV : Institutional Interventions This module consist of institutional interventions either by strengthening the existing ones or initiating new ones relating to seed bank, fodder bank, commodity groups, custom hiring centre, collective marketing, introduction of weather index based insurance and climate literacy through a village level weather station. The Process The KVK team for each district carried out a detailed exercise on the needs of the village, the climatic vulnerability (drought/floods/heat wave/frost/cyclone) and the available technology options from the concerned Zonal Agricultural Research Stations of the SAU. After a careful study of the gaps, specific interventions from each of the modules were to be selected and an integrated package from all modules was be formulated. Majority farmers are to be covered with one or more of the interventions in order to demonstrate a discernible effect. As an outcome of this exercise location specific climate resilient practices and constraints in its adoption would be documented.

As a teenager he traveled to Paris in 1922 to study agronomy, but promptly and against his family's wishes, became involved in the Parisian art world and avant-garde film scene of the era, mingling with: Picasso, ManRay, Gertrude Stein, Coco Chanel, Luis Bu√±uel, Lee Miller, the Viscount de Noailles, among others, that formed the social circle that unfolded for ten years and where he developed his acting career. Later career and retirement Enrique Riveros worked in Europe as a leading man in more than fifteen films, which include Sp√∂kbaronen directed by Gustaf Edgren (1927), Majest√§t schneidet Bubik√∂pfe directed by Ragnar Hylt√©n-Cavallius (1928), Le tournoi dans la cite (1928) and Le bled (1929), directed by Jean Renoir, obtaining the latter film the award of the French Government at the time. In 1930, Riveros appeared as the protagonist of The Blood of a Poet, the first film by the artist and French intellectual Jean Cocteau, this avant- garde film is considered one of the highlights of surrealism. Some of his other roles of the decade were works in films by: Alberto Cavalcanti, Dans une √Æle perdue (1931), √Ä mi-chemin du ciel (1931) and Wine Cellars (1930) directed by Benito Perojo, with the actress and singer Concha Piquer as co-star and Nicole et sa vertu (1932) by Rene Hervil, among others. Before the outbreak of World War II, Enrique Riveros returned to Chile, where he worked on a couple of film projects and starred in the film El hombre que se llevaron (1946) by Jorge \\"Coke\\" Delano, with the role of defendant Alberto Rivero received the prize for Best Actor National Film. Riveros died in 1954, leaving a legacy all but forgotten. His fame and success were so bright at the time, continuously contained in the European film magazine covers, being a gallant comparable with Rudolph Valentino. Rivero transcended fame so much in his native Chile, that in 1927 the newspaper El Mercurio sent a correspondent to interview him in Paris. \\"And 1927 has brought a surprise to Parisians rise always used to seeing European artists.

Agriculture =National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture= NICRA was launched during February 2011 by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) with the funding from Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India. The mega project has three major objectives of strategic research, technology demonstrations and capacity building across all sectors of agriculture, dairying and fisheries. =Mission Milk= The first phase of the National Dairy Plan (‚ÄòMission Milk‚Äô) was set about in April 2012 at National Dairy Development Board (Anand, Gujarat). The first phase with an outlay of Rs. 2242 cr. is part of an ambitious 15-year-long National Dairy Plan with an estimated project cost of Rs. 17,300 crores.Mission milk launched Mission milk to boost milk production by 2021 not to be updated that was not sound good that mission . Education =Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan= Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (The Education for All Movement), is a programme aimed at the universalization of elementary education \\"in a time bound manner\\", as mandated by the 86th amendment to the Constitution of India making free and compulsory education to children of ages 6‚Äì14 (estimated to be 205 million in number in 2001) a fundamental right. =National Translation Mission= National Translation Mission (NTM) is a Government of India initiative to make knowledge texts accessible, in all Indian languages listed in the VIII schedule of the Constitution, through translation. NTM was set up as per National Knowledge Commission's recommendation. The Ministry of Human Resource Development has designated Central Institute of Indian Languages as the nodal organization for the operationalization of NTM. In national translation mission should be provided in free of cost (like demo ) in all over India . = National Mission for Manuscripts = National Mission for Manuscripts (NAMAMI) is an autonomous organisation under Ministry of Culture, Government of India, established to survey, locate and conserve Indian manuscripts, with an aim to create national resource base for manuscripts, for enhancing their access, awareness and use for educational purposes. Electricity =National Solar Mission= Healthcare =National Rural Health Mission= NRHM is a health program for improving health care delivery across rural India. The mission, initially mooted for 7 years (2005-2012), is run by the Ministry of Health. The scheme proposes a number of new mechanisms for healthcare delivery including training local residents as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA), and the Janani Surakshay Yojana (motherhood protection program). It also aims at improving hygiene and sanitation infrastructure. Noted economists Ajay Mahal and Bibek Debroy have called it \\"the most ambitious rural health initiative ever\\". Under the mission, health funding had increased from 27,700 crores in 2004-05 to 39,000 crores in 2005-06 (from 0.95% of GDP to 1.05%). As of 2009, economists noted that \\"the mid-term appraisal of the NRHM has found that there has been a significant improvement in health indicators even in this short period\\". However, in many situations, the state level apparatus have not been able to deploy the additional funds, often owing to inadequacies in the Panchayati Raj functioning. Fund utilization in many states is around 70%. =Total Sanitation Campaign= Total Sanitation Campaign is aimed at ensuring sanitation facilities in rural areas. The main goal of Total Sanitation Campaign is to eradicate the practice of open defecation by 2017. To give fillip to this endeavour, Government of India has launched Nirmal Gram Puraskar. Communities are facilitated to conduct their own appraisal and analysis of open defecation (OD) and take their own action to become ODF (open defecation free). CLTS (Community-Led Total Sanitation) focuses on the behavioural change needed to ensure real and sustainable improvements. It invests in community mobilisation instead of hardware, and shifting the focus from toilet construction for individual households to the creation of ‚Äôopen defecation-free‚Äô villages. Union Rural Development Minister Mr Jairam Ramesh says that new Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan will ensure the extension of the sanitation scheme to both Above Poverty Line and Below Poverty Line families. Subsidy amount for the sanitation scheme is also being raised from the present level of 3,000 rupees. Urban Planning =Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission= JNNURM is a massive city modernisation scheme launched by the Ministry of Urban Development. It envisages a total investment of over $20 billion over seven years. It is named after Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of independent India. The scheme was officially inaugurated by the prime minister, Manmohan Singh on 3 December 2005 as a programme meant to improve the quality of life and infrastructure in the cities. JNNURM aims at creating ‚Äòeconomically productive, efficient, equitable and responsive Cities‚Äô by a strategy of upgrading the social and economic infrastructure in cities, provision of Basic Services to Urban Poor (BSUP)Sub-missions:JNNURM Sub- Missions and wide-ranging urban sector reforms to strengthen municipal governance in accordance with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992. Rural development =Swabhimaan= It is a campaign of the Government of India which aims to bring banking services to large rural areas without banking services in the country. It was launched on 10 February 2011. This campaign is to be operated by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India and the Indian Banks' Association (IBA). An initiative which seeks better financial inclusion within India will strive for rolling out banking services in 20,000 villages without banking services with a population of 2000 by March 2012 as to improve participation of rural folks in different plans launched by government for them. Under this plan, Banks will select business correspondents (bank saathi). They will act as intermediaries between the rural people and the banks. The government has targeted to cover at least 73,000 new habitations with a population of 2,000 and above and open at least 50 million new accounts by March 2012. =Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas (PURA= PURA is a strategy for rural development in India. The concept was given by former president Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. PURA proposes that urban infrastructure and services be provided in rural hubs to create economic opportunities outside of cities. Physical connectivity by providing roads, electronic connectivity by providing communication network and knowledge connectivity by establishing professional and Technical institutions will have to be done in an integrated way so that economic connectivity will emanate. The Indian government aims at developing of compact areas around a potential growth centre in a Gram Panchayat (or a group of Gram Panchayats) through Public Private Partnership (PPP). The government has been running pilot PURA programs in several states since 2004.

Pho Hlaing was an accomplished writer and wrote a number of important treatises throughout his lifetime, on politics, mathematics and Buddhist philosophy. Names and titles Bo Hlaing was known by a number of titles and names, including the Yaw Atwinwun (), Shwepyi Atwinwun (), Wetmasut Myoza (), Magwe Myoza () and posthumously called the Yaw Mingyi () and Shwepyi Mingyi (). Atwinwun is roughly analogous to 'Minister of the Interior', Myoza is roughly 'Duke', and Mingyi is a title reserved for the monarch or high-ranking ministers. Early life Pho Hlaing was born in Ywapale, a small village in Myingyan District in Upper Burma to Thado Minhlakyawhtin (father) and Me Nyein (mother). His father, a royal official (the Lord of Yenangyaung and Minister of Yindaw) at the Konbaung court, had been a minister under King Tharrawaddy, but was killed during a Hluttaw session by the king for alleged disloyalty. Pho Hlaing's great- grandfather was the Minister of Shwepyi (). During his early formative years, he joined a local monastery, then led by the Kyabo Sayadaw, as a novice monk (samanera). After the assassination of his father in 1845, Pho Hlaing was given up by his widowed mother to Prince Mindon. He was subsequently adopted by King Tharrawaddy's daughter, Mahadevi. He rejoined the monkhood at his patrons' request, and was educated at royal monasteries and spent some time studying under the Supreme Patriarch, the Bagaya Sayadaw. In the aftermath of the 1852 Second Anglo-Burmese War, Princes Mindon and Kanaung fled Amarapura to overthrow their brother, Pagan. Pho Hlaing, then 22, followed them to Shwebo. That same year, King Pagan abdicated the throne. After this time, Pho Hlaing became a close adviser of the now King Mindon. Reign of King Mindon In 1853, Bo Hlaing married Khin Phyu (b. 1833), the daughter of Kyaw U, the Lord of Magwe, who had a distinguished career in the royal service. Bo Hlaing was first appointed as upanissaya (personal assistant) to his father-in-law, who was responsible for the kingdom's foreign affairs. He was also conferred the title Minhlasithu and became the Lord of Yaw (or Yaw Myoza). At the age of 28, Pho Hlaing was promoted to become the Atwinwun of Yaw. After the assassination of Mindon's heir apparent, Prince Kanaung, Pho Hlaing was put charge of managing industrial projects in the kingdom, including 50 factories and workshops and operating the royal mint, as well as disseminating Western technologies. In 1868, he translated a Sanskrit mathematical text, LilƒÅvati into Burmese. The following year, he compiled Lipidipika, which included a Burmese language system of the telegraphy code, innovated by Pho Hlaing himself. By 1872, he had been awarded to a salwe of 12 strings. During King Mindon's reign, Pho Hlaing was one of the few officials at the royal court to be allowed to dissent with the king. Despite Pho Hlaing's close relationship with Mindon (who treated him like a son) in 1871, Pho Hlaing was stripped of his offices as the Shwepyi Wun and Lord of Wetmasut and placed under house arrest, because he was accused of drinking alcohol (specifically beer) and claiming alcohol consumption was not a sin unless imbibed to the point of drunkenness. During his time in house arrest, he wrote Vimuttirasa (, The Taste of Freedom), a comparative religion treatise and philosophical critique of world religions. However, he was reinstated less than 6 months afterward, at the intervention of the Khinmagan Sayadaw. That same year, Pho Hlaing wrote a defining work, a political treatise entitled Mahasamatavinicchaya (, An Analysis of the Head of State), which delineated a social contract between the king and his subjects, as the king did not rule by divine right, but by birthright. In 1875, he wrote Kayanupassana (, Contemplation of the Body), a treatise on anatomy, commissioned by the Princess Lord of Salin. In 1877, he wrote Ten Kinds of Vipassana Insight (), commissioned by a high-ranking Buddhist monk. Pho Hlaing also directed the construction of the Atumashi Monastery. In the days leading up to King Mindon's death in 1877, the royal court was in disarray. Rajadhammasangaha and the reign of Thibaw In 1878, soon after the coronation of King Thibaw, Mindon's son, Pho Hlaing published a revolutionary work, a three-part political treatise called the Rajadhammasangaha (, variously rendered Companion of Dhamma for Royalty, A Collection of Norms for Kingship, or Civil Society under Monarchy). This work was heavily influenced by Buddhist teachings, particularly the Seven Aparihaniya Principles, a sermon given by the Gautama Buddha on proper governance and summarised as follows: #Consultation of a body #Action by consensus #Behaviour in accordance with the law #Respect for admonishments of superiors #No oppression of women #Respect for the rites of towns' and villages' spirit guardians #Protection of the monkhood Pho Hlaing's treatise essentially proposed a variety of major political and economic reforms to preserve Burmese sovereignty. These included transforming the kingdom's government system into a constitutional monarchy, whereby the king ruled indirectly by social contract, through a bicameral parliament that was represented by both the aristocracy and commoners, and the king had a cabinet of ministers. These proposals were influenced by England's system of government. The economic reforms suggested by Pho Hlaing included restrictions on royal expenditures, salaries for the royal family and aristocracy, establishment of a national banking system, economic incentives for farmers and traders. Pho Hlaing also analyzed the decline of the Burmese population in the kingdom, coming to the conclusion that excessive taxation was forcing many Burmese to migrate to British-occupied Lower Burma. However, Pho Hlaing's treatise was ignored and rejected. Within 50 days of submitting it to Byedaik (Privy Council), Pho Hlaing was summarily dismissed from his offices. The first Burmese lottery was introduced during the Konbaung Dynasty. A national state lottery was first established in 1878 during the reign of King Thibaw Min, in an attempt to raise state revenues. The lottery was the brainchild of Pho Hlaing, who had played the French lottery in Paris. Following ongoing issues with the administration of the lottery, including conflicts of interest, decreased revenues, condemnation against gambling by Buddhist monks, the lottery was ended in 1880. On the sixth waning day of Wagaung, BE 1235 (1885 CE), Pho Hlaing died, at the age of 53. At his death, Pho Hlaing had the title Thado Mingyi Minhla Mahamingaung Thihathu.

This is a description of the tendency that species show to be climbers. Description Clematis orientalis mature flower: yellow sepals curled back Clematis orientalis is a deciduous scrambling shrub that grows to attach to its environment by means of tendril-like stems. It grows densely at a rate of least a meter per year. =Stem= The stems are slender and tendril-like. It grows to heights of about 2‚Äì8 meters, with a thickness up to 7 cm. The stems are covered with gray-brown bark, with the inner bark being green. The vines twine to rocks, other plants, and other things in its environment as it climbs. =Flower= C. orientalis flowers can be solitary or grow in clusters in a cyme inflorescence. Most noticeable about the flower is the four yellow to yellow-orange sepals, which are often mistaken for its petals. The sepals are ovate-lanceolate to elliptic, wide-spreading and tend to curl back at its maturity. The sepals reaches widths of 2‚Äì3 cm and lengths of 6‚Äì9 cm.Riedl, Harald, and Yasin J.

Clematis orientalis seedhead =Leaf= The leaves are pinnately compound, with 3 to 7 leaflets per leaf. The leaflets are coarsely-toothed to entire or ovate to linear-lanceolate and 1‚Äì5 cm long. The leaves have a gray-green color. The leaves have an opposite arrangement on the stem. =Root= C. orientalis roots are weak and flexible with branching finer roots of tan to orange-tan coloring. Ecology Clematis orientalis prefers well-drained soils. There is no preference of soil texture though does well on chalky soil. Can tolerate a range of alkaline or acidic soils.Colorado. Colorado Department of Agriculture. Chinese Clematis. Web. . It has a preference for sunny habitats but has shown a tolerance for partially shaded areas. In the United States, it is found in shrublands, riverbanks, gullies, sand depressions, riparian forests in hot, dry valleys and desert and semidesert areas. It can grow at elevations of 400 to 3,800 meters. Distribution Distribution of Clematis orientalis in the United States and Canada Clematis orientalis is native to Asia and Central Europe, specifically from Turkey through West Asia to the Korean Peninsula, south to Iran, and Northwest India. Originally planted in the United States as an ornamental plant, it escaped from cultivation and became naturalized to Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, and Ontario (Canada). Reproduction Multiple Clematis orientalis seedheads C. orientalis flowers appear from August to late September. The flowers and fruits are present at the same time. Pollination is carried out by flies and bees. Seedheads are rounded clusters of fluffy winged seeds, resembling pom poms that disperse over winter and early spring. The seeds are primarily dispersed by the wind. Impact on habitat Since C. orientalis is a vine, it grows over rocks, fences, and other plants. It has escaped cultivation and naturalized. It is classified as a noxious weed by some states. C. orientalis can cover young trees and bushes, killing them. It has the ability to out- compete native shrubby or herbaceous species. Uses Clematis orientalis is grown as an ornamental plant. It is also used as an antiseptic and refrigerant.

In 2002, Michael John Grosb√∏l took over the daily management of the company from his father John, who became Chairman of the Board of Mascot International. In 2003, the company had revenue of DKK 260 million, and was the fourth largest producer of workwear in Europe. There were approximately 160 employees in Denmark, while the rest worked in sewing factories in the Far East. In 2007, the company made nearly DKK 55 million, the largest earnings in MASCOT's history. In 2010, this result was beaten, as the profit before taxes was just over 55 million. Company milestones in recent years include the establishment of its own SA8000 certified factory in Vietnam in 2008. and the purchase of a large piece of land in P√•rup, Denmark, where they will build a new headquarters bringing together all of MASCOT's Danish activities. The new headquarters is expected to be completed in 2017. In 2018, MASCOT built its production facilities in Vietnam and Laos.

These tough plants live primarily in and around mine sites and thrive in soils contaminated with high concentrations of heavy metals, such as zinc, cadmium, lead, and copper. A. yokoscense is indigenous to Japan, Korea, eastern Siberia and northeastern China and has been known for centuries to tolerate phytotoxic mining sites. The predominance and concentration of this fern species at a particular region was used to identify potential mining sites. The primary potential of A. yokoscense is in its phytoremediative ability to accumulate toxic metals from soils contaminated with heavy metals, so it may have some long-term commercial importance. No medicinal or culinary values of this fern species have been studied or confirmed. Morphology A. yokoscense is similar to other species in the genus, Athyrium, and family, Athyriaceae. The plant typically grows to more than high and can tolerate high levels of heavy metals (arsenic, lead, cadmium, zinc, copper), which under many circumstances would kill other plants. This fern leaves resemble typical fern leaves. Not many publications and research have been made on the reproductive cycle of this fern species, but it is similar to the other ferns in the same genus. According to mygarden.net.au, these ferns \\"grow in heavy clay soils and prefer a moist sheltered site with moderately high atmosphere\\". Some ferns have been reported to contain carcinogens and others contain thiaminase, which robs the body of its vitamin B. This fern is generally not edible. Distribution and habitat Athyrium yokoscense is found in and near mining sites across Japan, Korea, northeastern China, and eastern Siberia. It grows in metalliferous mining slag heaps, damp grounds, flat plains, as well as in thick woodlands and mountains. The abundance of this plant is an indicator of potential heavy metal-rich mines. Phytoremediation The past decades of research into contaminated soil clean-up led scientists to adopt a greener way to solve this problem. Phytoremediation is a relatively new theory and practice to use plants to clean up soil contaminated with heavy metals instead of the need for heavy (and potentially toxic) chemicals. Athyrium yokoscense has been known for centuries to survive and thrive in and near mining sites in Japan. These mining sites contain soils with high concentrations of metal, including copper, cadmium, lead, arsenic, and zinc. No one knew the mechanism of how this fern species survive a toxic environment like this. Recently, with the green movements and environmental concerns for revitalizing mining sites and heavily contaminated fields, more researchers and industrialists are moving into a greener way of cleaning up the soil. Many papers have been published about the effects of heavy metals on the growth and reproduction of this fern, as well as the mechanism involved in its survival in these toxic environments. Traditional toxic metal clean-ups are expensive and painstaking processes involving even more dangerous chemicals, but using plants to clean up the environment is greener, cheaper and may be more efficient, as well. A. yokoscense has the ability to not only survive the toxic heavy-lead environments, but also accumulate these heavy metals as well. This is extremely useful because harvesting these hyperaccumulator ferns will also detoxify the soil they live in. Studies have shown that this fern species accumulates heavy metal in its rhizoidal tissues (the fern's stem, which also acts like the plant's roots) during its sporophyte stage and in its prothallial tissues in its gametophyte stage. It is believed that A. yokoscense's proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) have a potential ability to chelate heavy metals, but this has not been confirmed yet. High levels of proanthocyanidins were found in both the leaves, as well as the rhizoids, yet only the rhizoids accumulate extremely high levels of heavy metals. Some researchers have found that these ferns do not accumulate heavy metal in the cells, but rather, in the cell walls.

The plant includes a double layer; green, leaf-like structures surround the understory, and purple- pink flowers outgrow them from the bottom up. The plant is a warm-season grass, meaning that leaves begin growth in the summer. During the summer, the leaves stay green, but they morph during the fall to produce a more copper color. The seasonal changes also include the flowers, as they grow out during the fall and stay healthy till the end of autumn. The muhly grows along the border of roads and on plain prairies. The grass clumps into herds, causing bush-like establishments in the area the hairawn muhly inhabits. The flowers are very feathery and add a cloudlike appearance to the top of the grass. It is native to eastern North America and can be used for a multitude of purposes, including ornamental gardening and farming. It was voted 2012 plant of the year by the Garden Club of America. Taxonomy Jean-Baptiste Lamarck described this species in 1791 as Stipa capillaris before it gained its current name from Carl Bernhard von Trinius in 1824. Description Individuals of this species are grouped into shrubs of ‚Äúcapillary‚Äù-like branching pattern with green leaves covering the understory and pink flowers outgrowing them. The muhly grass is a cespitose perennial that grows to be tall and wide. The blades are rolled, flat to involute during maturity and are about 15‚Äì35 cm long and 1.3‚Äì3.5 mm wide at the base with tapering or filiform tips. The sterns are erect or decumbent at the base of the shrub. The leaves are inflorescence and narrow with a contracted or open panicle of small spikelets, each spikelet being 1-flowered and rarely 2-flowered.McGregor, Ronald L., and T. M. Barkley. \\"Poaceae Grass Family.\\" Flora of the Great Plains. Lawrence, Kan.: University of Kansas, 1986. 1191-194. Print. The wiry, thin leaves are simple and alternating from the stem; they grow to be about 18‚Äì36 inches long. The flowers of the grass are grouped together, forming long, airy clusters along a stem that rises above the leaves to a length of about and width of . Flowers of M. capillaris are perfect with each having about two or three stamens and anthers that are about 1-1.8 mm long. Spikelets are found on the long, hair-like pedicels that are clavate-thickened at the apex and are slightly scabrous.Britton, Nathaniel L. \\"Gramineae Grass Family.\\" An Illustrated Flora of the Northern United States and Canada. New York: Dover Publ., 1970. 184-89. Print. The glumes are found to be unequal, and are either longer or shorter than the lemma. The lemma is obtuse to acuminate or awned, while the membranous lemma is narrow, acute, mucronate, or awned, and usually pilose at the base.Magee, Dennis W., and Harry E. Ahles. \\"Poaceae.\\" Flora of the Northeast: A Manual of the Vascular Flora of New England and Adjacent New York. Amherst: University of Massachusetts, 1999. 219-22. Print. The flowers grow during the fall season, especially from September to October, and are usually colored pink or purplish-red. They mature from the bottom up. The plant is a ‚Äúwarm-season‚Äù plant, so it starts growing during the summer and is in full bloom during the autumn. The seed stalks are tall. The flowers produce oblong tan or brown seeds that are less than half an inch long. The plants grow in clumps, but do not spread through above-ground or underground stems. Distribution and habitat Muhlenbergia capillaris can be found in sandy or rocky woods and clearings originating from a range of host states, which include Florida to East Texas, north to Massachusetts, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, Kentucky, southern Indiana, Missouri, and Kansas.Gray, Asa, Merritt Lyndon Fernald, and Asa Gray. \\"Gramineae Grass Family.\\" Gray's Manual of Botany; a Handbook of the Flowering Plants and Ferns of the Central and Northeastern United States and Adjacent Canada.

Usage Muhlenbergia capillaris is a perennial plant that can live for an indeterminate time (based on maintenance). Muhly grass prefers a mildly acidic (pH range of 5.5 to 6.8), organic soil. Its advantages for cultivation include being disease resistant, tolerant of shade, and easy to maintain with annual pruning. Although tolerant of dry spells, it appreciates extra water in cultivation. Its hardiness and drought-tolerant properties make it a useful native ornamental grass in land reclamation, and it also has potential as fine fuel for burn management programs to reduce understory. It is a known attractant for beneficial insects such as ladybug beetles, and is an excellent garden plant because of its low maintenance and general beauty. The clumping habit makes it excellent for use as wildlife cover, such as nests and shelter for native birds.

Built between 1939 and 1941, it remained operational until 1958. Construction Around were requisitioned, principally from the Swynnerton and Cotes estates. Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, Consultant Engineers to the Ministry of Supply, were appointed to supervise construction. Plans were drawn up by A.P.I.Cotterell & Son, Chartered Engineers, on behalf of Gibb. The Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, as the long-established principal Royal Ordnance Factory, designed the various processes and layout of buildings. The Engineer-in-Chief, appointed to oversee the construction was Wilfrid Cracroft Ash. Site work was divided into areas under divisional superintendents who were directly responsible to Ash. ROF Swynnerton, being a 'filling' factory was the most dangerous of the various types of munitions factories; bomb and shell-casings were filled with highly combustible explosive materials. It was planned that the factory should provide at least some production while construction continued. Swynnerton became operational in stages, from the middle of 1940. The factory was completed in two years, a task which, in peace-time, would have taken five years. It consisted of over 1,700 small buildings, each surrounded by earth banks to contain accidental blasts; if one building was destroyed the adjacent buildings would be unaffected. Five large boiler-houses were built strategically around the perimeter of the site so that, if one or two were bombed, production could still be maintained. Roadways between buildings were of smooth, grit-free asphalt and were called ‚Äòcleanways‚Äô because they had to be kept clean at all times, to avoid any possibility of sparks. In addition to the factory itself, seven residential hostels were built, along with houses and flats, for munitions workers and almost 500 families of specialist staff. Railway connections By mid 1942, ROF Swynnerton had become fully operational and the number of people working at the site had grown to approximately 18,500. To meet the need of getting the factory workers to and from the factory the Ministry of Supply asked the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) to construct a station. The site already had an extensive rail network served from the West Coast Main Line between and but the LMS chose to build a new branch line running to the site from the North Staffordshire Railway line between and . The branch line, which was double track throughout, ran for just under from Swynnerton Junction to Cold Meece railway station. The station was for passenger traffic only and no goods facilities were ever provided, all freight movements for the factory were dealt with via the link to the Crewe branch of the West Coast Main Line at Badnall Wharf. After the war ended the factory and station both continued in use until 1958. The factory closed in May 1958 and although the last scheduled train ran in June 1958, the station did not officially close until August 1959. The branch had been lifted by September 1963. During the war the factory worked 24 hours a day and the passenger service to Cold Meece reflected this with nineteen trains a day, Monday to Saturday, serving the station in time for the shift changes at 5:35 am, 1:35 pm and 8:35 pm. Services ran to and from three main destinations; , Silverdale and picking up at all stations en route except those between and . In addition there was one service each way classed as a recreational service for people who lived on the site to get into Stoke. Sunday services comprised two trains each way to Silverdale and Blythe Bridge and three each way to Newchapel and Goldenhill. Post-war use After the war the site was converted for military training use and became known as Swynnerton Training Camp. In 2019, proposals were revealed for a 'Garden village' on the site.

International Convergence of Accounting Standards‚ÄîOverview. Retrieved on April 27, 2012. Convergence in some form has been taking place for several decades, and efforts today include projects that aim to reduce the differences between accounting standards. Convergence is driven by several factors, including the belief that having a single set of accounting requirements would increase the comparability of different entities' accounting numbers, which will contribute to the flow of international investment and benefit a variety of stakeholders. Criticisms of convergence include its cost and pace, and the idea that the link between convergence and comparability may not be strong. Overview The international convergence of accounting standards refers to the goal of establishing a single set of high-quality accounting standards to be used internationally, and the efforts of standard-setters towards achieving that goal. Convergence is taking place in various countries, with over 100 countries having made public commitments supporting convergence towards the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Efforts towards convergence include projects that aim to improve the respective accounting standards, and those that aim to reduce the differences between them. = European Union = In the European Union (EU), the European parliament passed a regulation in July 2002 requiring companies listed in EU based stock exchanges to prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with the IFRS from 2005. Countries within the EU were allowed to make IFRS adoption optional for unlisted companies and for unconsolidated holding company financial statements, and were allowed to make several exceptions to IFRS adoption in 2005, for example for companies whose only listed securities were debt securities. = United Kingdom = In the United Kingdom, the IFRS was adopted beginning 2005, and, as of 2011, public companies are required to use the IFRS for their consolidated accounts. Other companies are also allowed to use the IFRS, but most have chosen not to do so, and continue to use the UK accounting standards largely developed prior to 2005. Companies deemed small under the UK Companies Act are allowed to use the Financial Reporting Standard for Smaller Entities (FRSSE). For medium-sized entities that are not public companies, the Accounting Standards Board has proposed replacing the UK's generally accepted accounting principles (UK GAAP) with the Financial Reporting Standard for Medium-sized Entities (FRSME), which is based on the IFRS for Small and Medium-sized Entities. = United States = In the United States, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is working with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to reduce or eliminate the differences between United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) and the IFRS, in particular according to the convergence programme laid out by a 2006 memorandum of understanding, which was updated in 2008.IASB & FASB, 2012. IASB-FASB Update Report to the FSB Plenary on Accounting Convergence. Retrieved on May 2, 2012. Short-term projects towards convergence between US GAAP and the IFRS involve the amendment of one of the boards' standards to better align them with the other board's, jointly issuing new standards. Some short-term projects and the corresponding actions taken are listed below. # Segment reporting: a new standard, IFRS 8 Segment Reporting, was issued in 2006. # Fair value option: US GAAP was amended to include the fair value option in 2007. # Joint ventures: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements was issued in 2011. # Income tax: A joint exposure draft was published in 2009. An update to the memorandum of understanding in 2008 introduced long-term convergence projects, including the following. # Derecognition: both boards issued amendments to their accounting standards. # Fair value measurement: FASB Statement No. 257 and IFRS 13 were issued in 2011. # Financial instruments with the characteristics of equity: a joint discussion paper was released. # Revenue recognition: the boards issued joint proposals in 2010. In a joint report published in 2012, the IASB and FASB stated that most of the short-term projects outlined in the memorandum of understanding had been completed, and that greater priority was now being placed on long-term projects. Motivation Motivations for convergence include the belief that it will result in increased comparability between financial statements, which will benefit a variety of stakeholders. For example, the FASB believes that \\"investors, companies, auditors, and other participants in the U.S. financial reporting system\\" will benefit from converged standards because it will result in increased comparability between the financial statements of different firms. A 2008 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) stated that convergence of accounting standards would contribute to the flow of international investment and benefit \\"all capital markets stakeholders\\" because it: #renders international investments more comparable to investors; #reduces the cost of complying with accounting requirements for global businesses; #potentially establishes a more transparent accounting system with greater accountability; #reduces \\"operational challenges\\" for accounting firms; and #gives standard- setters the opportunity to \\"improve the reporting model\\".PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2007. ViewPoint ‚Äì April 2007. Retrieved May 1, 2012. Additionally, a survey conducted by the International Federation of Accountants found that 89% of accounting profession leaders who responded expressed that convergence was either very important or important for economic growth for their respective countries. Criticisms The goal of and various proposed steps to achieve convergence of accounting standards has been criticised by various individuals and organizations. For example, in 2006 senior partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) called for convergence to be \\"shelved indefinitely\\" in a draft paper, calling for the IASB to focus instead on improving its own set of standards.Jopson B, 2006.

History =1950s and 1960s= The idea of convergence has roots in the 1950s, and was a response to greater economic integration and international capital flows after World War II .

International Convergence of Accounting Standards‚ÄîA Brief History. Retrieved on April 30, 2012. At the 8th International Congress of Accountants hosted by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in 1962, many participants expressed the need for the development of accounting standards on an international basis; in the same year the AICPA reactivated the Committee on International Relations, that aimed to improve cooperation among accountants globally. =1970s and 1990s= The International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), the predecessor to the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) was established in 1973 with the goal of developing accounting standards and promoting them internationally; by 1987 the IASC had issued 25 standards, and by the late 1980s there was \\"worldwide interest\\" in the need for convergence. In 1991 the FASB formally set out the goal of developing an internationally used set of accounting standards, and in subsequent years the FASB and IASC undertook various projects to lay the groundwork for convergence. In 1996, the National Securities Markets Improvement Act became law; the act expressed support for convergence efforts and required the SEC to report to congress on progress towards convergence. =2000s= The IASC was reconstituted into the IASB in 2001, and the FASB and IASB began working towards convergence in 2002, expressing their commitment to convergence in the Norwalk agreement and pledging to make their respective standards \\"compatible as soon as is practicable\\" and to maintain compatibility by coordinating future programs.AICPA, 2008.

Taintignies (Belgium), 1762 ‚Äì d. Madrid, 1831) was a military officer born in Belgium in the service of the Spanish Crown. He served in the Peninsula War or the war of Spanish Independence and was known for commanding the Spanish forces during the Battle of Valencia.  Military career  Saint-Marcq entered the Spanish army when he was 14 years old as a member of the Walloon Guards, a unit recruited in contemporary Spanish Belgium or Wallonia. By the time the Peninsula War broke out, he was a gazetted company Captain and was able to escape from Madrid when it was occupied by the invading French Army. He made his way to Valencia with his army where he was able to help lift the French siege led by Marshal Bon- Adrien Jeannot de Moncey. For this action, he was promoted to the rank of Mariscal de Campo. Saint-Marcq was later crucial in the lifting of the Siege of Zaragoza where he came to the aid of Jos√© de Palafox y Melzi and routed the besieging forces of French General Verdier. Immediately thereafter, Saint- Marcq remained under the orders of Palafox in Zaragoza and actively participated in the defense of the city for which he was promoted to Lt. General. When the city eventually surrendered to the French, he was taken prisoner and sent to Nancy where he would remain until the end of the war in 1814. When Ferdinand VII of Spain returned to the throne, Saint-Marcq returned to Spain. He was promoted to Captain General of Galicia, Valencia and of Aragon until 1830.  Death  Saint-Marcq died in Madrid, Spain in 1831 from one of the cholera epidemics that plagued Spain in the mid to late 1800s.

History  Leon Deloge steered the company toward the production of traffic lights and supplement products. He continued the business of his father, who founded the company Deloge and Dufresne in 1919, whose business was winding transformers and electric motors. The new company was named SEA Deloge and was officially registered in 1947. The following year SEA Deloge develops a new range of equipment. A controller on a technological base \\"Dasphot\\" marked the starting point for SEA in the business of traffic regulation. Specializing in traffic signaling, the company launched in 1960 electromechanical controllers under the trade name of BC \\"Block Chalier\\" that were sold in multiple copies throughout France. In the 1970s, electronics enters the safety equipment. SEA Deloge creates and produces a family of controllers based on CMOS technology, an innovation for its time. Horizon signals that were created in 1976 from a ball of dough, are long remained the best known brand of SEA. The AR 2000, a programmable logic controller is placed on the market. Made in SEA Deloge, this controller has responded to the new traffic requirements (green wave two- way operation acyclic ...) In 1986, AES became Deloge SEA signaling [ref. required] . In that year, the controller becomes AR 2000 LP 2200. The following year, the LEDs are emerging on the market. SEA signaling produces signals 100 and R12 with the new technology. SEA signaling is the first manufacturer to offer a coherent solution with very low voltage sources TBT . Certainly, this technology has not sold in its infancy because of a strong lobbying imposing the optical source fluorescent (1988‚Äì1989). In 1993, SEA Launches Signaling Controller CLP 700 - the first controller in France based on an industrial PC card based on Intel 286, with a user-friendly programming software for multi-window . This programming mode allowed to apply a new methodology for the operation controllers of traffic lights . Two years later, the company built a new plant in Vaulx-en-Velin and brings to market a new product line antivandalismes to address the problem of damage to the furniture. Between 1997 and 1999, 'SEA Signaling' develops the controller CLP 7700 by adding a CPU, built around an Intel 386 EX associated with flash memory. The operating system TOPS has been updated without changing components. In the period 1998-2004, SEA signaling continues to develop optical TBT . During this period the company is working on T1 and T2 tramway in Lyon . In 2000-2001, SEA brings to market two new product lines: AXEL and AGATHE. In 2007, the start of a line of prestige: NIXEA a new concept. The prestigious line NIXEA appears in 2007, it was specially developed to provide luxury and design of light-signaling.  Scope of application  Light signals have an important role in managing the movement in urban space. 'SEA Signalisation' produces light signals intersection, programmable controllers, and provide expertise in areas such as: 1\\\\. Traffic control: * in urban areas; * in rural areas. 2\\\\. Transit (Ex. TCSP - transit in dedicated lanes): * Tram ; * Bus (e.g. BRT - Bus Rapid service); 3\\\\. Accessibility for people with visual impairments. 4\\\\.

Statutory protection of trademark is administered by the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, a government agency which reports to the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The law of trademark deals with the mechanism of registration, protection of trademark and prevention of fraudulent trademark.Preamble, Trade Marks Act, 1999 The law also provides for the rights acquired by registration of trademark, modes of transfer and assignment of the rights, nature of infringements, penalties for such infringement and remedies available to the owner in case of such infringement. History The law of trademark in India before 1940 was based on the common law principles of passing off and equity as followed in England before the enactment of the first Registration Act, 1875.Narayanan, p. 3 The first statutory law related to trademark in India was the Trade Marks Act, 1940 which had similar provision like the UK Trade Marks Act, 1938. In 1958, the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 was enacted which consolidated the provisions related to trademarks contained in other statutes like, the Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and the Sea Customs Act. The Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 was repealed by the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and is the current governing law related to registered trademarks. The 1999 Act was enacted to comply with the provisions of the TRIPS. Though some aspects of the unregistered trade marks have been enacted into the 1999 Act, but they are primarily governed by the common law rules based on the principles evolved out of the judgments of the Courts. Where the law is ambiguous, the principles evolved and interpretation made by the Courts in England have been applied in India taking into consideration the context of the legal procedure, laws and realities of India.Narayanan, pp. 4-5 Trademark Trademark defined under Section 2 (zb) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 as, \\"trade mark means a mark capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of others and may include shape of goods, their packaging and combination of colours.\\" A mark can include a device, brand, heading, label, ticket, name, signature, word, letter, numeral, shape of goods, packaging or combination of colors or any such combinations. Trademark rules With effect from 6 March 2017, the new trademark rules came into existence. The intention is to simplify the whole trademark registration process and make it hassle-free and quick. Some of the features of the new rules are sound marks are made registrable; 3D marks are made registrable; e-filing is promoted; provisions pertaining to well-known mark; separate fees structure for an individual/startup/small enterprise and for others; expedited processing of application; hearing via video conferencing; and the number of forms has been cut down to 8 from the existing around 75 forms.

Painter of genre, portraitist and landscape artist, he travels both in America and Europe during his life.  Biography  Henri Royer:Paysanne au tombeau Henri Royer is the son of Jules Royer (1845-1900), creator of one of the most important lithographic printing works established in Nancy, rue de la Salp√™tri√®re. Raised in the art world from a young age, Royer joined the Nancy School of Fine Arts where he met √âmile Friant. He attended the classes of Antoine Vierling and Louis-Th√©odore Devilly and exhibited his first works at the Salon de Nancy, including Fight between two young typos and Young plasterer. These early successes prompt his parents and teachers to encourage a study trip to Holland with Friant, who would then influence Royer. At his return in 1888, and after attending the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, in 1890 he continued his studies at the Acad√©mie Julian under Jules Joseph Lefebvre and Fran√ßois Flameng. He exhibited regularly at the Paris Salon, specializing in genre paintings and portraits. As a portraitist, he encountered many famous figures from the aristocracy, politics, diplomacy, science and the arts. As a result, his critics described him as one of Ingres' disciples. \\"La collection municipale\\", Ville d'Audierne. Retrieved 2 May 2012.

Statement In 1972, McMullen proposed the following problem:D. G. Larman (1972), \\"On Sets Projectively Equivalent to the Vertices of a Convex Polytope\\", Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society 4, pp.6-12 : Determine the largest number u(d) such that for any given u(d) points in general position in affine d-space Rd there is a projective transformation mapping these points into convex position (so they form the vertices of a convex polytope). Equivalent formulations =Gale transform= Using the Gale transform, this problem can be reformulated as: : Determine the smallest number \\\\mu(d) such that for every set of \\\\mu(d) points X = {x1, x2, ..., xŒº(d)} in linearly general position on Sd ‚àí 1 it is possible to choose a set Y = {Œµ1x1, Œµ2x2, ..., ŒµŒº(d)xŒº(d)} where Œµi = ¬±1 for i = 1, 2, ..., Œº(d), such that every open hemisphere of Sd ‚àí 1 contains at least two members of Y. The number \\\\mu(k), u(d) are connected by the relationships : \\\\mu(k)=\\\\min\\\\\\\\{w \\\\mid w\\\\leq u(w-k-1)\\\\\\\\} \\\\, : u(d)=\\\\max\\\\\\\\{w \\\\mid w\\\\geq\\\\mu(w-d-1)\\\\\\\\} \\\\, =Partition into nearly-disjoint hulls= Also, by simple geometric observation, it can be reformulated as: : Determine the smallest number \\\\lambda(d) such that for every set X of \\\\lambda(d) points in Rd there exists a partition of X into two sets A and B with :: \\\\operatorname{conv}(A\\\\backslash \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\})\\\\cap \\\\operatorname{conv}(B\\\\backslash \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}) ot=\\\\varnothing,\\\\forall x\\\\in X. \\\\, The relation between \\\\mu and \\\\lambda is : \\\\mu(d+1)=\\\\lambda(d),\\\\qquad d\\\\geq1 \\\\, =Projective duality= An arrangement of lines dual to the regular pentagon. Every five-line projective arrangement, like this one, has a cell touched by all five lines. However, adding the line at infinity produces a six-line arrangement with six pentagon faces and ten triangle faces; no face is touched by all of the lines. Therefore, the solution to the McMullen problem for d = 2 is ŒΩ = 5\\\\. The equivalent projective dual statement to the McMullen problem is to determine the largest number u(d) such that every set of u(d) hyperplanes in general position in d-dimensional real projective space form an arrangement of hyperplanes in which one of the cells is bounded by all of the hyperplanes. Results This problem is still open. However, the bounds of u(d) are in the following results: *David Larman proved that 2d+1\\\\leq u(d)\\\\leq(d+1)^2.

The ship was identified and torpedoed by the German U-boat , took on a heavy starboard list, and sank in 18 minutes. The vessel went down off the Old Head of Kinsale,Preston, D. (2003) Wilful Murder. The Sinking of the Lusitania. London : Black Swan. . Ireland, killing 1,198 and leaving 761 survivors. The sinking turned public opinion in many countries against Germany, contributed to the American entry into World War I and became an iconic symbol in military recruiting campaigns of why the war was being fought. Lusitania fell victim to torpedo attack relatively early in the First World War, before tactics for evading submarines were properly implemented or understood. The contemporary investigations in both the United Kingdom and the United States into the precise causes of the ship's loss were obstructed by the needs of wartime secrecy and a propaganda campaign to ensure all blame fell upon Germany. Argument over whether the ship was a legitimate military target raged back and forth throughout the war as both sides made misleading claims about the ship. At the time she was sunk, she was carrying over 4 million rounds of small-arms ammunition (.303 caliber), almost 5,000 shrapnel shell casings (for a total of some 50 tons), and 3,240 brass percussion fuses, in addition to 1,266 passengers and a crew of 696.\\"The Lusitania, therefore, carried over 4 million rounds of small-arms ammunition (.303 caliber), almost 5,000 shrapnel shell casings, and 3,240 brass percussion fuses.\\" Choosing War: Presidential Decisions in the Maine, Lusitania, and Panay Incidents, by Douglas Carl Peifer, Oxford University Press, 1 June 2016, pg 269:\\"More lethal cargo loaded into the forward holds between the bow and bridge included 4,2 million rounds of Remington .303 rifle ammunition consigned to the British Royal Arsenal at Woolwich; 1,248 cases of shrapnel-filled artillery shells from the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, each case containing four 3-inch shells for a total of some fifty tons; eighteen cases of percussion fuses; and forty-six tons of volatile aluminum powder used to manufacture explosives.\\" Lusitania: Triumph, Tragedy, and the End of the Edwardian Age, by Greg King, Penny Wilson, St. Martin's Press, 24 Feb 2015 ‚Äì page 5 Several attempts have been made over the years since the sinking to dive to the wreck seeking information about precisely how the ship sank, and argument continues to the present day. Background Lusitania in 1909 When Lusitania was built, her construction and operating expenses were subsidized by the British government, with the provision that she could be converted to an Armed Merchant Cruiser if need be. At the outbreak of the First World War, the British Admiralty considered her for requisition as an armed merchant cruiser, and she was put on the official list of AMCs. The Admiralty then canceled their earlier decision and decided not to use her as an AMC after all; large liners such as Lusitania consumed enormous quantities of coal (910 tons/day, or 37.6 tons/hour) and became a serious drain on the Admiralty's fuel reserves, so express liners were deemed inappropriate for the role when smaller cruisers would do. They were also very distinctive; so smaller liners were used as transports instead. Lusitania remained on the official AMC list and was listed as an auxiliary cruiser in the 1914 edition of Jane's All the World's Fighting Ships, along with Mauretania. At the outbreak of hostilities, fears for the safety of Lusitania and other great liners ran high. During the ship's first eastbound crossing after the war started, she was painted in a drab grey colour scheme in an attempt to mask her identity and make her more difficult to detect visually. When it turned out that the German Navy was kept in check by the Royal Navy, and their commerce threat almost entirely evaporated, it very soon seemed that the Atlantic was safe for ships like Lusitania, if the bookings justified the expense of keeping them in service. Germany's declared exclusion zone of February 1915. Allied ships within this area were liable to search and attack Many of the large liners were laid up over the autumn and winter of 1914‚Äì1915, in part due to falling demand for passenger travel across the Atlantic, and in part to protect them from damage due to mines or other dangers. Among the most recognizable of these liners, some were eventually used as troop transports, while others became hospital ships. Lusitania remained in commercial service; although bookings aboard her were by no means strong during that autumn and winter, demand was strong enough to keep her in civilian service. Economizing measures were taken, however. One of these was the shutting down of her No. 4 boiler room to conserve coal and crew costs; this reduced her maximum speed from over . Even so, she was the fastest first-class passenger liner left in commercial service. With apparent dangers evaporating, the ship's disguised paint scheme was also dropped and she was returned to civilian colors. Her name was picked out in gilt, her funnels were repainted in their usual Cunard livery, and her superstructure was painted white again. One alteration was the addition of a bronze/gold colored band around the base of the superstructure just above the black paint.Layton, J. Kent. Lusitania: An Illustrated Biography (2010, Amberley Books) =1915= By early 1915, a new threat to British shipping began to materialise: U-boats (submarines). At first, the Germans used them only to attack naval vessels, and they achieved only occasional--but sometimes spectacular--successes. U-boats then began to attack merchant vessels at times, although almost always in accordance with the old cruiser rules. Desperate to gain an advantage on the Atlantic, the German government decided to step up its submarine campaign. On 4 February 1915, Germany declared the seas around the British Isles a war zone: from 18 February, Allied ships in the area would be sunk without warning. This was not wholly unrestricted submarine warfare, since efforts would be taken to avoid sinking neutral ships.Germany's second submarine campaign against the Allies during the First World War was unrestricted in scope, as was submarine warfare during the Second World War. Lusitania was scheduled to arrive in Liverpool on 6 March 1915. The Admiralty issued her specific instructions on how to avoid submarines. Despite a severe shortage of destroyers, Admiral Henry Oliver ordered HMS and to escort Lusitania, and took the further precaution of sending the Q ship to patrol Liverpool Bay.Referred to in Lusitania, by Diana Preston, and Lusitania: An Illustrated Biography by J. Kent Layton (2010, Amberley Books). One of the destroyers' commanders attempted to discover the whereabouts of Lusitania by telephoning Cunard, who refused to give out any information and referred him to the Admiralty. At sea, the ships contacted Lusitania by radio, but did not have the codes used to communicate with merchant ships. Captain Daniel Dow of Lusitania refused to give his own position except in code, and since he was, in any case, some distance from the positions he gave, continued to Liverpool unescorted.Beesly, p.95Preston, D. (2002) Lusitania: An Epic Tragedy. New York: Walker & Company. It seems that, in response to this new submarine threat, some alterations were made to Lusitania and her operation. She was ordered not to fly any flags in the war zone; a number of warnings, plus advice, were sent to the ship's commander to help him decide how to best protect his ship against the new threat and it also seems that her funnels were most likely painted a dark grey to help make her less visible to enemy submarines. Clearly, there was no hope of disguising her actual identity, since her profile was so well known, and no attempt was made to paint out the ship's name at the prow.New photographic evidence presented in Lusitania: An Illustrated Biography, by J. Kent Layton (2010, Amberley Books) The official warning issued by the Imperial German Embassy about travelling on Lusitania. Captain Dow, apparently suffering from stress from operating his ship in the war zone, and after a significant \\"false flag\\" controversy left the ship; Cunard later explained that he was \\"tired and really ill.\\"Testimony of A.A. Booth at the Mersey Inquiry. He was replaced with a new commander, Captain William Thomas Turner, who had previously commanded Lusitania, Mauretania, and Aquitania in the years before the war. On 17 April 1915, Lusitania left Liverpool on her 201st transatlantic voyage, arriving in New York on 24 April. A group of German‚ÄìAmericans, hoping to avoid controversy if Lusitania were attacked by a U-boat, discussed their concerns with a representative of the German Embassy. The embassy decided to warn passengers before her next crossing not to sail aboard Lusitania, and on 22 April placed a warning advertisement in 50 American newspapers, including those in New York:https://fas.org/irp/ops/ci/docs/ci1/notice.jpg > ! > intending to embark on the Atlantic voyage are reminded that a state of war > exists between Germany and her allies and Great Britain and her allies; that > the zone of war includes the waters adjacent to the British Isles; that, in > accordance with formal notice given by the Imperial German Government, > vessels flying the flag of Great Britain, or any of her allies, are liable > to destruction in those waters and that travellers sailing in the war zone > on the ships of Great Britain or her allies do so at their own risk. > > Washington, D.C. 22 April 1915 This warning was printed adjacent to an advertisement for Lusitanias return voyage. The warning led to some agitation in the press and worried the ship's passengers and crew. Final voyage =Departure= While many British passenger ships had been called into duty for the war effort, Lusitania remained on her regular route between Liverpool and New York. She departed Pier 54 in New York on 1 May 1915 on her return trip to Liverpool with 1,959 people aboard. In addition to her crew of 694, she carried 1,265 passengers, mostly British nationals as well as a large number of Canadians, along with 128 Americans. Her First Class accommodations, for which she was well regarded on the North Atlantic run, were booked at just over half capacity at 290. Second Class was severely overbooked with 601 passengers, far exceeding the maximum capacity of 460. While a large number of small children and infants helped reduce the squeeze into the limited number of two- and four-berth cabins, the situation was ultimately rectified by allowing some Second Class passengers to occupy empty First Class cabins. In Third Class, the situation was considered to be the norm for an eastbound crossing, with only 373 travelling in accommodations designed for 1,186.Layton, J. Kent. Lusitania: an illustrated biography of the Ship of Splendor, p. 177. Captain Turner, known as \\"Bowler Bill\\" for his favourite shoreside headgear, had returned to his old command of Lusitania. He was commodore of the Cunard Line and a highly experienced master mariner, and had relieved Daniel Dow, the ship's regular captain. Dow had been instructed by his chairman, Alfred Booth, to take some leave, due to the stress of captaining the ship in U-boat infested sea lanes and for his protestations that the ship should not become an armed merchant cruiser, making her a prime target for German forces. Turner tried to calm the passengers by explaining that the ship's speed made her safe from attack by submarine.The Lusitania Saga & Myth: 100 Years On p. 53 However, Cunard shut down one of the ship's four boiler rooms to reduce costs on sparsely subscribed wartime voyages, reducing her top speed from 25.5 to around 22 knots.Simpson p.60 Lusitania steamed out of New York at noon on 1 May, two hours behind schedule, because of a last-minute transfer of forty-one passengers and crew from the recently requisitioned Cameronia. Shortly after departure three German-speaking men were found on board hiding in a steward's pantry. Detective Inspector William Pierpoint of the Liverpool police, who was travelling in the guise of a first-class passenger, interrogated them before locking them in the cells for further questioning when the ship reached Liverpool. Also among the crew was an Englishman, Neal Leach, who had been working as a tutor in Germany before the war. Leach had been interned but later released by Germany. The German embassy in Washington was notified about Leach's arrival in America, where he met known German agents. Leach and the three German stowaways went down with the ship. They had probably been tasked with spying on Lusitania and her cargo. Most probably, Pierpoint, who survived the sinking, would already have been informed about Leach. =Submarine activity= Lusitania entering the left As the liner steamed across the ocean, the British Admiralty had been tracking the movements of , commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Walther Schwieger, through wireless intercepts and radio direction finding. The submarine left Borkum on 30 April, heading north-west across the North Sea. On 2 May, she had reached Peterhead and proceeded around the north of Scotland and Ireland, and then along the western and southern coasts of Ireland, to enter the Irish Sea from the south. Although the submarine's departure, destination, and expected arrival time were known to Room 40 in the Admiralty, the activities of the decoding department were considered so secret that they were unknown even to the normal intelligence division which tracked enemy ships or to the trade division responsible for warning merchant vessels. Only the very highest officers in the Admiralty saw the information and passed on warnings only when they felt it essential.Beesly, p.101 On 27 March, Room 40 had intercepted a message which clearly demonstrated that the Germans had broken the code used to pass messages to British merchant ships. Cruisers protecting merchant ships were warned not to use the code to give directions to shipping because it could just as easily attract enemy submarines as steer ships away from them. However, Queenstown (now Cobh) was not given this warning and continued to give directions in the compromised code, which was not changed until after Lusitanias sinking. At this time, the Royal Navy was significantly involved with operations leading up to the landings at Gallipoli, and the intelligence department had been undertaking a program of misinformation to convince Germany to expect an attack on her northern coast. As part of this, ordinary cross-channel traffic to the Netherlands was halted from 19 April and false reports were leaked about troop ship movements from ports on Britain's western and southern coasts. This led to a demand from the German army for offensive action against the expected troop movements and consequently, a surge in German submarine activity on the British west coast. The fleet was warned to expect additional submarines, but this warning was not passed on to those sections of the navy dealing with merchant vessels. The return of the battleship Orion from Devonport to Scotland was delayed until 4 May and she was given orders to stay from the Irish coast.Beesly p.99-100 U-20 (second from left) and sister ships rafted in harbour at left On 5 May, U-20 stopped a merchant schooner, Earl of Lathom, off the Old Head of Kinsale, examined her papers, then ordered her crew to leave before sinking the schooner with gunfire. On 6 May, U-20 fired a torpedo at Cayo Romano from Cuba, a British steamer flying a neutral flag, off Fastnet Rock narrowly missing by a few feet. At 22:30 on 5 May, the Royal Navy sent an uncoded warning to all ships ‚Äì \\"Submarines active off the south coast of Ireland\\" ‚Äì and at midnight an addition was made to the regular nightly warnings, \\"submarine off Fastnet\\".Beesly p.103 On 6 May U-20 sank the 6,000 ton steamer Candidate. It then failed to get off a shot at the 16,000 ton liner Arabic, because although she kept a straight course the liner was too fast, but then sank another 6,000 ton British cargo ship flying no flag, Centurion, all in the region of the Coningbeg light ship. The specific mention of a submarine was dropped from the midnight broadcast on 6‚Äì7 May as news of the new sinkings had not yet reached the navy at Queenstown, and it was correctly assumed that there was no longer a submarine at Fastnet.Beesly p.103-104 Captain Turner of Lusitania was given a warning message twice on the evening of 6 May, and took what he felt were prudent precautions. That evening a Seamen's Charities fund concert took place throughout the ship and the captain was obliged to attend the event in the first-class lounge. At about 11:00 on 7 May, the Admiralty radioed another warning to all ships, probably as a result of a request by Alfred Booth, who was concerned about Lusitania: \\"U-boats active in southern part of Irish Channel. Last heard of twenty miles south of Coningbeg Light Vessel\\". Booth and all of Liverpool had received news of the sinkings, which the admiralty had known about by at least 3:00 that morning.Beesly p. 106 Turner adjusted his heading northeast, not knowing that this report related to events of the previous day and apparently thinking submarines would be more likely to keep to the open sea, so that Lusitania would be safer close to land. At 13:00 another message was received, \\"Submarine five miles south of Cape Clear proceeding west when sighted at 10:00 am\\". This report was entirely inaccurate as no submarine had been at that location, but gave the impression that at least one submarine had been safely passed.Ramsay p.79 U-20 was low on fuel and had only three torpedoes left. On the morning of 7 May, visibility was poor and Schwieger decided to head for home. He submerged at 11:00 after sighting a fishing boat which he believed might be a British patrol and shortly after was passed while still submerged by a ship at high speed. This was the cruiser Juno returning to Queenstown, travelling fast and zig-zagging having received warning of submarine activity off Queenstown at 07:45. The Admiralty considered these old cruisers highly vulnerable to submarines, and indeed Schwieger attempted to target the ship.Beesly p.108 =Sinking= Illustration of the sinking by Norman Wilkinson On the morning of 6 May, Lusitania was west of southern Ireland. By 05:00 on 7 May, she reached a point west south west of Fastnet Rock (off the southern tip of Ireland), where she met the patrolling boarding vessel Partridge.Beesly p.104-105 By 06:00, heavy fog had arrived and extra lookouts were posted. As the ship came closer to Ireland, Captain Turner ordered depth soundings to be made and at 08:00 for speed to be reduced to eighteen knots, then to 15 knots and for the foghorn to be sounded. Some of the passengers were disturbed that the ship appeared to be advertising her presence. By 10:00, the fog began to lift, by noon it had been replaced by bright sunshine over a clear smooth sea and speed increased to 18 knots. U-20 surfaced again at 12:45 as visibility was now excellent. At 13:20, something was sighted and Schwieger was summoned to the conning tower: at first it appeared to be several ships because of the number of funnels and masts, but this resolved into one large steamer appearing over the horizon. At 13:25, the submarine submerged to periscope depth of 11 metres and set a course to intercept the liner at her maximum submerged speed of 9 knots. When the ships had closed to Lusitania turned away, Schwieger feared he had lost his target, but she turned again, this time onto a near ideal course to bring her into position for an attack. At 14:10, with the target at 700m range he ordered one gyroscopic torpedo to be fired, set to run at a depth of three metres.Beesly p.84-85 (U-20 log entry transcript. Log first published in L'illustration in 1920) In Schwieger's own words, recorded in the log of U-20: U-20s torpedo officer, Raimund Weisbach, viewed the destruction through the vessel's periscope and felt the explosion was unusually severe. Within six minutes, Lusitanias forecastle began to submerge. On board the Lusitania, Leslie Morton, an eighteen-year-old lookout at the bow, had spotted thin lines of foam racing toward the ship. He shouted, \\"Torpedoes coming on the starboard side!\\" through a megaphone, thinking the bubbles came from two projectiles. The torpedo struck Lusitania under the bridge, sending a plume of debris, steel plating, and water upward and knocking lifeboat number five off its davits. \\"It sounded like a million-ton hammer hitting a steam boiler a hundred feet high,\\" one passenger said. A second, more powerful explosion followed, sending a geyser of water, coal, dust, and debris high above the deck. Schwieger's log entries attest that he launched only one torpedo. Some doubt the validity of this claim, contending that the German government subsequently altered the published fair copy of Schwieger's log, but accounts from other U-20 crew members corroborate it. The entries were also consistent with intercepted radio reports sent to Germany by U-20 once she had returned to the North Sea, before any possibility of an official coverup.Beesly Image:Lusitania2.jpgGerman drawing of Lusitania being torpedoed. Incorrectly depicts the torpedo hitting the port side of ship. Image:Torpedoed Lusitania.jpgBritish drawing of Lusitania being torpedoed; shows disputed \\"second torpedo\\". Image:Doomed Lusitania.jpgLusitania is shown sinking as Irish fishermen race to the rescue. In fact, the launching of the lifeboats was more chaotic. At 14:12, Captain Turner ordered Quartermaster Johnston stationed at the ship's wheel to steer 'hard-a-starboard' towards the Irish coast, which Johnston confirmed, but the ship could not be steadied on the course and rapidly ceased to respond to the wheel. Turner signalled for the engines to be reversed to halt the ship, but although the signal was received in the engine room, nothing could be done. Steam pressure had collapsed from 195 psi before the explosion, to 50 psi and falling afterwards. Lusitanias wireless operator sent out an immediate SOS, which was acknowledged by a coastal wireless station. Shortly afterward he transmitted the ship's position, south of the Old Head of Kinsale. At 14:14, electrical power failed, plunging the cavernous interior of the ship into darkness. Radio signals continued on emergency batteries, but electric lifts failed, trapping passengers and crew; bulkhead doors, that were closed as a precaution before the attack, could not be reopened to release trapped men. About one minute after the electrical power failed, Captain Turner gave the order to abandon ship. Water had flooded the ship's starboard longitudinal compartments, causing a 15-degree list to starboard. Lusitanias severe starboard list complicated the launch of her lifeboats. Ten minutes after the torpedoing, when she had slowed enough to start putting boats in the water, the lifeboats on the starboard side swung out too far to step aboard safely. While it was still possible to board the lifeboats on the port side, lowering them presented a different problem. As was typical for the period, the hull plates of Lusitania were riveted, and as the lifeboats were lowered they dragged on the inch high rivets, which threatened to seriously damage the boats before they landed in the water. 1914 picture showing additional collapsible lifeboats added to the ship Many lifeboats overturned while loading or lowering, spilling passengers into the sea; others were overturned by the ship's motion when they hit the water. It has been claimed that some boats, because of the negligence of some officers, crashed down onto the deck, crushing other passengers, and sliding down towards the bridge. This has been disputed by passenger and crew testimony. Some crewmen would lose their grip on ropes used to lower the lifeboats while trying to lower the boats into the ocean, and this caused the passengers to spill into the sea. Others tipped on launch as some panicking people jumped into the boat. Lusitania had 48 lifeboats, more than enough for all the crew and passengers, but only six were successfully lowered, all from the starboard side. Lifeboat 1 overturned as it was being lowered, spilling its original occupants into the sea, but it managed to right itself shortly afterwards and was later filled with people from in the water. Lifeboats 9 (5 people on board) and 11 (7 people on board) managed to reach the water safely with a few people, but both later picked up many swimmers. Lifeboats 13 and 15 also safely reached the water, overloaded with around 150 people. Finally, Lifeboat 21 (52 people on board) reached the water safely and cleared the ship moments before her final plunge. A few of her collapsible lifeboats washed off her decks as she sank and provided flotation for some survivors. Two lifeboats on the port side cleared the ship as well. Lifeboat 14 (11 people on board) was lowered and launched safely, but because the boat plug was not in place, it filled with seawater and sank almost immediately after reaching the water. Later, Lifeboat 2 floated away from the ship with new occupants (its previous ones having been spilled into the sea when they upset the boat) after they removed a rope and one of the ship's \\"tentacle-like\\" funnel stays. They rowed away shortly before the ship sank. There was panic and disorder on the decks. Schwieger had been observing this through U-20 periscope, and by 14:25, he dropped the periscope and headed out to sea.The Sinking of the Lusitania: Terror at Sea or (\\"Lusitania: Murder on the Atlantic\\") puts this at 14:30, two minutes after Lusitania sank. Later in the war, Schwieger was killed in action when, as he commanded the vessel struck a British mine and sank on 5 September 1917, north of Terschelling. There were no survivors from U-88 sinking.

Captain Turner was on the deck near the bridge clutching the ship's logbook and charts when a wave swept upward towards the bridge and the rest of the ship's forward superstructure, knocking him overboard into the sea. He managed to swim and find a chair floating in the water which he clung to. He survived, having been pulled unconscious from the water after spending three hours there. Lusitanias bow slammed into the bottom about below at a shallow angle because of her forward momentum as she sank. Along the way, some boilers exploded, including one that caused the third funnel to collapse; the remaining funnels collapsed soon after. As he had taken the ship's logbook and charts with him, Turner's last navigational fix had been only two minutes before the torpedoing, and he was able to remember the ship's speed and bearing at the moment of the sinking. This was accurate enough to locate the wreck after the war. The ship travelled about from the time of the torpedoing to her final resting place, leaving a trail of debris and people behind. After her bow sank completely, Lusitanias stern rose out of the water, enough for her propellers to be seen, and went under. Lusitania sank in only 18 minutes, off the Old Head of Kinsale. It took several hours for help to arrive from the Irish coast, but by the time help had arrived, many in the water had succumbed to the cold. By the days' end, 764 passengers and crew from Lusitania had been rescued and landed at Queenstown. Eventually, the final death toll for the disaster came to a catastrophic number. Of the 1,959 passengers and crew aboard Lusitania at the time of her sinking, 1,195 had been lost.Robert Ballard, Exploring the Lusitania. This number is cited, probably to include the German spies detained below decks. In the days following the disaster, the Cunard line offered local fishermen and sea merchants a cash reward for the bodies floating all throughout the Irish Sea, some floating as far away as the Welsh coast. In all, only 289 bodies were recovered, 65 of which were never identified. The bodies of many of the victims were buried at either Queenstown, where 148 bodies were interred in the Old Church Cemetery,Molony, p123 or the Church of St. Multose in Kinsale, but the bodies of the remaining 885 victims were never recovered. Two days before, U-20 had sunk Earl of Lathom, but first allowed the crew to escape in boats. According to international maritime law, any military vessel stopping an unarmed civilian ship was required to allow those on board time to escape before sinking it. The conventions had been drawn up in a time before the invention of the submarine and took no account of the severe risk a small vessel, such as a submarine, faced if it gave up the advantage of a surprise attack. Schwieger could have allowed the crew and passengers of Lusitania to take to the boats, but he considered the danger of being rammed or fired upon by deck guns too great. Merchant ships had, in fact, been advised to steer directly at any U-boat that surfaced. A cash bonus had been offered for any that were sunk, though the advice was carefully worded so as not to amount to an order to ram.Beesly p.94 This feat would be accomplished only once during the war by a commercial vessel when in 1918 the White Star Liner RMS Olympic, sister ship to the Titanic, rammed into SM U-103 in the English Channel, sinking the submarine. According to Bailey and Ryan, Lusitania was travelling without any flag and her name painted over with darkish dye.Thomas A. Bailey/Paul B. Ryan: The Lusitania Disaster: An Episode in Modern Warfare and Diplomacy., Free Press/Collier Macmillan, New York/London 1975 One story‚Äîan urban legend‚Äîstates that when Lieutenant Schwieger of U-20 gave the order to fire, his quartermaster, Charles Voegele, would not take part in an attack on women and children, and refused to pass on the order to the torpedo room ‚Äì a decision for which he was court-martialed and imprisoned at Kiel until the end of the war.Des Hickey and Gus Smith, Seven Days to Disaster: The Sinking of the Lusitania, 1981, William Collins, This rumour persisted from 1972, when the French daily paper Le Monde published a letter to the editor.Bernd Langensiepen: Die Legende von Karl V√∂geles \\"Meuterei\\" auf U 20.

American genealogist, historian and book editor Official inquiries into the sinking Immediately following the sinking, on 8 May, the local county coroner John Hogan opened an inquest in Kinsale into the deaths of two males and three females whose bodies had been brought ashore by a local boat, Heron. Most of the survivors (and dead) had been taken to Queenstown instead of Kinsale, which was closer. On 10 May Captain Turner gave evidence as to the events of the sinking where he described that the ship had been struck by one torpedo between the third and fourth funnels. This had been followed immediately by a second explosion. He acknowledged receiving general warnings about submarines, but had not been informed of the sinking of Earl of Lathom. He stated that he had received other instructions from the Admiralty which he had carried out but was not permitted to discuss. The coroner brought in a verdict that the deceased had drowned following an attack on an unarmed non-combatant vessel contrary to international law. Half an hour after the inquest had concluded and its results given to the press, the Crown Solicitor for Cork, Harry Wynne, arrived with instructions to halt it. Captain Turner was not to give evidence and no statements should be made about any instructions given to shipping about avoiding submarines. =Board of Trade investigation= A survivor the sinking. Pictured 25 May 1915 The formal Board of Trade investigation into the sinking was presided over by Wreck Commissioner Lord Mersey and took place in the Westminster Central Hall from 15‚Äì18 June 1915 with further sessions at the Westminster Palace Hotel on 1 July and Caxton Hall on 17 July. Lord Mersey had a background in commercial rather than maritime law but had presided over a number of important maritime investigations, including that into the loss of Titanic. He was assisted by four assessors, Admiral Sir Frederick Samuel Inglefield, Lieutenant Commander Hearn and two merchant navy captains, D. Davies and J. Spedding. The Attorney General, Sir Edward Carson, represented the Board of Trade, assisted by the Solicitor General, F. E. Smith. Butler Aspinall, who had previously represented the Board of Trade at the Titanic inquiry, was retained to represent Cunard. A total of 36 witnesses were called, Lord Mersey querying why more of the survivors would not be giving evidence. Most of the sessions were public but two on 15 and 18 June were held in camera when evidence regarding navigation of the ship was presented.Ramsay p.126-128 Statements were collected from all the crew. These were all written out for presentation to the inquiry on standard forms in identical handwriting with similar phrasing. Quartermaster Johnston later described that pressure had been placed upon him to be loyal to the company, and that it had been suggested to him it would help the case if two torpedoes had struck the ship, rather than the one which he described. Giving evidence to the tribunal he was not asked about torpedoes. Other witnesses who claimed that only one torpedo had been involved were refused permission to testify. In contrast to his statement at the inquest, Captain Turner stated that two torpedoes had struck the ship, not one. In an interview in 1933, Turner reverted to his original statement that there had been only one torpedo. Most witnesses said there had been two, but a couple said three, possibly involving a second submarine. Clem Edwards, representing the seamen's union, attempted to introduce evidence about which watertight compartments had been involved but was prevented from doing so by Lord Mersey. Churchill and Fisher It was during the closed hearings that the Admiralty tried to lay the blame on Captain Turner, their intended line being that Turner had been negligent. The roots of this view began in the first reports about the sinking from Vice-Admiral Coke commanding the navy at Queenstown. He reported that \\"ship was especially warned that submarines were active on south coast and to keep mid-channel course avoiding headlands also position of submarine off Cape Clear at 10:00 was communicated by W/T to her\\". Captain Webb, Director of the Trade Division, began to prepare a dossier of signals sent to Lusitania which Turner may have failed to observe. First Sea Lord Fisher noted on one document submitted by Webb for review: \\"As the Cunard company would not have employed an incompetent man its a certainty that Captain Turner is not a fool but a knave. I hope that Turner will be arrested immediately after the enquiry whatever the verdict\\". First Lord Winston Churchill noted: \\"I consider the Admiralty's case against Turner should be pressed by a skilful counsel and that Captain Webb should attend as a witness, if not employed as an assessor. We will pursue the captain without check\\". In the event, both Churchill and Fisher were replaced in their positions before the enquiry because of the failures of the Gallipoli campaign.Beesly p.111 Edward Carson Part of the proceedings turned on the question of proper evasive tactics against submarines. It was put to Captain Turner that he had failed to comply with Admiralty instructions to travel at high speed, maintain a zig-zag course and keep away from shore. Naval instructions about zig-zag were read to the captain, who confirmed that he had received them, though later added that they did not appear to be as he recollected. This was unsurprising, since the regulations quoted had been approved only on 25 April, after Lusitanias last arrival in New York, and started distribution on 13 May, after she sank.Beesly p.97 Lusitania had slowed to 15 knots at one point because of fog, but had otherwise maintained 18 knots passing Ireland. 18 knots was faster than all but nine other ships in the British merchant fleet could achieve and was comfortably faster than the submarine. Although he might have achieved 21 knots and had given orders to raise steam ready to do so, he was also under orders to time his arrival at Liverpool for high tide so that the ship would not have to wait to enter port. Thus, he chose to travel more slowly. At the time, no ship had been torpedoed travelling at more than 15 knots. Although the Admiralty instructed ships to keep well offshore and it was claimed that Turner had only been away, his actual distance when hit was . As a matter of established procedure, only ships travelling closer than from shore were ordinarily being censured for being too close.Beesly p.116-117 Turner stated that he had discussed the matter of what course the ship should take with his two most senior officers, Captain Anderson and Chief Officer Piper, neither of whom survived. The three had agreed that the Admiralty warning of \\"submarine activity south of Coningbeg\\" effectively overrode other Admiralty advice to keep to 'mid channel', which was precisely where the submarine had been reported. He had, therefore, ordered the change of course at 12:40, intending to bring the ship closer to land and then take a course north of the reported submarine.Ramsay p.140-146 At one point in the proceedings, Smith attempted to press a point he was making, by quoting from a signal sent to British ships. Lord Mersey queried which message this was, and it transpired that the message in question existed in the version of evidence given to Smith by the Board of Trade Solicitor, Sir Ellis Cunliffe, but not in versions given to others. Cunliffe explained the discrepancy by saying that different versions of the papers had been prepared for use, depending whether the enquiry had been in camera or not, but the message quoted appeared never to have existed. Lord Mersey observed that it was his job to get at the truth, and thereafter became more critical of Admiralty evidence.Ramsay p.147-149 F. E. Smith On 10 June, just before the hearing, significant changes were made to the Defence of the Realm Act, which made it an offence to collect or publish information about the nature, use, or carriage of \\"war materials\\" for any reason. Previously, this had only been an offence if the information was collected to aid the enemy. This was used to prohibit discussion about the ship's cargo. The rifle cartridges carried by Lusitania were mentioned during the case, Lord Mersey stating that \\"the 5,000 cases of ammunition on board were 50 yards away from where the torpedo struck the ship\\". (quoted by Schreiner, p. 314) An additional hearing took place on 1 July, at the insistence of Joseph Marichal, who was threatening to sue Cunard for their poor handling of the disaster. He testified that the second explosion had sounded to him like the rattling of machine gun fire and appeared to be below the second class dining room at the rear of the ship where he had been seated. Information about Marechal's background was sought out by the British government and leaked to the press so as to discredit him. Captain Turner, the Cunard Company, and the Royal Navy were absolved of any negligence, and all blame was placed on the German government. Lord Mersey found that Turner \\"exercised his judgment for the best\\" and that the blame for the disaster \\"must rest solely with those who plotted and with those who committed the crime\\". Two days after he closed the inquiry, Lord Mersey waived his fees for the case and formally resigned. His last words on the subject were: \\"The Lusitania case was a damned, dirty business!\\" The full report has never been made available to the public. A copy was thought to exist amongst Lord Mersey's private papers after his death, but has since proved untraceable. =American court proceedings= In the United States, 67 claims for compensation were lodged against Cunard, which were all heard together in 1918 before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Julius Mayer, presided over the case: he had previously presided over the case brought following the loss of the Titanic, where he had ruled in favour of the shipping company. Mayer was a conservative who was considered a safe pair of hands with matters of national interest, and whose favourite remark to lawyers was to \\"come to the point\\". The case was to be heard without a jury. The two sides agreed beforehand that no question would be raised regarding whether Lusitania had been armed or carrying troops or ammunition. Thirty-three witnesses who could not travel to the US gave statements in England to Commissioner R. V. Wynne. Evidence produced in open court for the Mersey investigation was considered, but evidence from the British closed sessions was not. The Defence of the Realm Act was invoked so that British witnesses could not give evidence on any subject it covered. Statements had been collected in Queenstown immediately after the sinking by the American Consul, Wesley Frost, but these were not produced. Captain Turner gave evidence in Britain and now gave a more spirited defence of his actions. He argued that up until the time of the sinking he had no reason to think that zig-zagging in a fast ship would help. Indeed, that he had since commanded another ship which was sunk while zig-zagging. His position was supported by evidence from other captains, who said that prior to the sinking of Lusitania no merchant ships zig-zagged. Turner had argued that maintaining a steady course for 30 minutes was necessary to take a four-point bearing and precisely confirm the ship's position, but on this point he received less support, with other captains arguing a two-point bearing could have been taken in five minutes and would have been sufficiently accurate. Many witnesses testified that portholes across the ship had been open at the time of the sinking, and an expert witness confirmed that such a porthole three feet under water would let in four tons of water per minute. Testimony varied on how many torpedoes there had been, and whether the strike occurred between the first and second funnel, or third and fourth. The nature of the official cargo was considered, but experts considered that under no conditions could the cargo have exploded. A record exists that Crewman Jack Roper wrote to Cunard in 1919 requesting expenses for his testimony in accord with the line indicated by Cunard. The decision was rendered on 23 August 1918. Mayer's judgement was that \\"the cause of the sinking was the illegal act of the Imperial German Government\\", that two torpedoes had been involved, that the captain had acted properly and emergency procedures had been up to the standard then expected. He ruled that further claims for compensation should be addressed to the German government (which eventually paid $2.5 million in 1925).  International reaction  =German reaction= German postcard depicting the sinking On 8 May Dr. Bernhard Dernburg, the former German Colonial Secretary, made a statement in Cleveland, Ohio, in which he attempted to justify the sinking of Lusitania. At the time Dernburg was recognised as the official spokesman of the Imperial German government in the United States. Dernburg said that because Lusitania \\"carried contraband of war\\" and also because she \\"was classed as an auxiliary cruiser\\" Germany had had a right to destroy her regardless of any passengers aboard. Dernburg further said that the warnings given by the German Embassy before her sailing, plus the 18 February note declaring the existence of \\"war zones\\" relieved Germany of any responsibility for the deaths of the American citizens aboard. He referred to the ammunition and military goods declared on Lusitanias manifest and said that \\"vessels of that kind\\" could be seized and destroyed under the Hague rules without any respect to a war zone. The following day the German government issued an official communication regarding the sinking in which it said that the Cunard liner Lusitania \\"was yesterday torpedoed by a German submarine and sank\\", that Lusitania \\"was naturally armed with guns, as were recently most of the English mercantile steamers\\" and that \\"as is well known here, she had large quantities of war material in her cargo\\". Dudley Field Malone, Collector of the Port of New York, issued an official denial to the German charges, saying that Lusitania had been inspected before her departure and no guns were found, mounted or unmounted. Malone stated that no merchant ship would have been allowed to arm itself in the Port and leave the harbour. Assistant Manager of the Cunard Line, Herman Winter, denied the charge that she carried munitions: > She had aboard 4,200 cases of cartridges, but they were cartridges for small > arms, packed in separate cases... they certainly do not come under the > classification of ammunition. The United States authorities would not permit > us to carry ammunition, classified as such by the military authorities, on a > passenger liner. For years we have been sending small-arms cartridges abroad > on the Lusitania. The fact that Lusitania had been carrying shell casings and rifle cartridges was not made known to the British public at the time, as it was felt that, although allowed under the regulations of the time, it would be used in German propaganda. The sinking was severely criticised by and met with disapproval in Turkey and Austria-Hungary, while in the German press, the sinking was deplored by Vorw√§rts, the daily newspaper of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, and also by Captain Persius, an outspoken naval critic who wrote for the Berliner Tageblatt. One Catholic Centre Party newspaper, the ', stated: \\"The sinking of the giant English steamship is a success of moral significance which is still greater than material success. With joyful pride we contemplate this latest deed of our Navy. It will not be the last. The English wish to abandon the German people to death by starvation. We are more humane. We simply sank an English ship with passengers who, at their own risk and responsibility, entered the zone of operations.\\"Gilbert, Martin First World War (1994) p. 157-158 In the aftermath of the sinking, the German government tried to justify it by claiming in an official statement that she had been armed with guns, and had \\"large quantities of war material\\" in her cargo. They also stated that since she was classed as an auxiliary cruiser, Germany had had a right to destroy her regardless of any passengers aboard, and that the warnings issued by the German Embassy before her sailing plus 18 February note declaring the existence of \\"war zones\\", relieved Germany of any responsibility for the deaths of American citizens aboard. While it was true that Lusitania had been fitted with gun mounts as part of government loan requirements during her construction, to enable rapid conversion into an Armed Merchant Cruiser (AMC) in the event of war, the guns themselves were never fitted. However, she was still listed officially as an AMC. Her cargo had included an estimated 4,200,000 rifle cartridges, 1,250 empty shell cases, and 18 cases of non- explosive fuses, all of which were listed in her manifest, but the cartridges were not officially classed as ammunition by the Cunard Line. =British and American actions= Take Up the Sword of Justice, a UK propaganda poster with Lusitania in the background British WWI propaganda poster Schwieger was condemned in the Allied press as a war criminal. Of the 139 US citizens aboard Lusitania, 128 lost their lives, and there was massive outrage in Britain and America, The Nation calling it \\"a deed for which a Hun would blush, a Turk be ashamed, and a Barbary pirate apologize\\" and the British felt that the Americans had to declare war on Germany. However, US President Woodrow Wilson refused to over-react. He said at Philadelphia on 10 May 1915: When Germany began its submarine campaign against Britain, Wilson had warned that the US would hold the German government strictly accountable for any violations of American rights. On 1 May he stated that \\"no warning that an unlawful and inhumane act will be committed\\" could be accepted as a legitimate excuse for that act.Gilbert, Martin First World War (1994) p. 157 During the weeks after the sinking, the issue was hotly debated within the administration. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan urged compromise and restraint. The US, he believed, should try to persuade the British to abandon their interdiction of foodstuffs and limit their mine-laying operations at the same time as the Germans were persuaded to curtail their submarine campaign. He also suggested that the US government issue an explicit warning against US citizens travelling on any belligerent ships. Despite being sympathetic to Bryan's antiwar feelings, Wilson insisted that the German government must apologise for the sinking, compensate US victims, and promise to avoid any similar occurrence in the future. =Wilson notes= \\"A letter from the president of the United States\\". Contemporary US political cartoon Backed by State Department second-in-command Robert Lansing, Wilson made his position clear in three notes to the German government issued on 13 May, 9 June, and 21 July. The first note affirmed the right of Americans to travel as passengers on merchant ships and called for the Germans to abandon submarine warfare against commercial vessels, whatever flag they sailed under (including 3 other ships: the Falaba, the Cushing, and the Gulflight). In the second note, Wilson rejected the German arguments that the British blockade was illegal, and was a cruel and deadly attack on innocent civilians, and their charge that Lusitania had been carrying munitions. William Jennings Bryan considered Wilson's second note too provocative and resigned in protest after failing to moderate it, to be replaced by Robert Lansing who later said in his memoirs that following the tragedy he always had the \\"conviction that we [the United States] would ultimately become the ally of Britain\\". The third note, of 21 July, issued an ultimatum, to the effect that the US would regard any subsequent sinkings as \\"deliberately unfriendly\\". While the American public and leadership were not ready for war, the path to an eventual declaration of war had been set as a result of the sinking of Lusitania. On 19 August U-24 sank the White Star liner Arabic, with the loss of 44 passengers and crew, three of whom were American. The German government, while insisting on the legitimacy of its campaign against Allied shipping, disavowed the sinking of Arabic; it offered an indemnity and pledged to order submarine commanders to abandon unannounced attacks on merchant and passenger vessels. The British public, press, and government in general were upset at Wilson's actions ‚Äì not realising it reflected general US opinion at the time. They sneered \\"too proud or too scared?\\". Shells that did not explode at the front were called \\"Wilsons\\". Germany, however, continued to sink merchant vessels bound for Britain, particularly after the Battle of Jutland in late May 1916. =German policy reversal= German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg persuaded the Kaiser to forbid action against ships flying neutral flags and the U-boat war was postponed once again on 27 August, as it was realised that British ships could easily fly neutral flags. There was disagreement over this move between the navy's admirals (headed by Alfred von Tirpitz) and Bethman-Hollweg. Backed by Army Chief of Staff Erich von Falkenhayn, Kaiser Wilhelm II endorsed the Chancellor's solution, and Tirpitz and the Admiralty backed down. The German restriction order of 9 September 1915 stated that attacks were allowed only on ships that were definitely British, while neutral ships were to be treated under the Prize Law rules, and no attacks on passenger liners were to be permitted at all. The war situation demanded that there could be no possibility of orders being misinterpreted, and on 18 September Henning von Holtzendorff, the new head of the German Admiralty, issued a secret order: all U-boats operating in the English Channel and off the west coast of the United Kingdom were recalled, and the U-boat war would continue only in the North sea, where it would be conducted under the Prize Law rules. In January 1917 the German Government announced it would now conduct full unrestricted submarine warfare. Once again, Woodrow Wilson was furious and on 6 April 1917 the United States Congress followed Wilson's request to declare war on Germany. US buildup of participation was at first slow, but during the German Spring Offensive in March 1918, which at first went well for the Germans with the Allies barely holding the lines, was reversed with the arrival by April 1918 of two million American troops.Protasio, John. (2011). The Day the World was Shocked; The Lusitania Disaster and Its Influence on the Course of World War I pp.200‚Äì201, Casemate Publications (US) =British propaganda= World War I propaganda stamp It was in the interests of the British to keep US citizens aware of German actions and attitudes. One over-enthusiastic propagandist's fabricated story was circulated that in some regions of Germany, schoolchildren were given a holiday to celebrate the sinking of Lusitania. This story was based on the popular reception given the Goetz medal (see below) and was so effective that James W. Gerard, the US ambassador to Germany, recounted it being told in his memoir of his time in Germany, Face to Face with Kaiserism (1918), though without vouching for its validity. Goetz medal German commemorative medal by Ludwig Gies In August 1915, the Munich medallist and sculptor Karl X. Goetz (1875‚Äì1950),http://www.karlgoetz.com Art of Karl Goetz who had produced a series of propagandist and satirical medals as a running commentary on the war, privately struck a small run of medals as a limited-circulation satirical attack (fewer than 500 were struck) on the Cunard Line for trying to continue business as usual during wartime. Goetz blamed both the British government and the Cunard Line for allowing Lusitania to sail despite the German embassy's warnings. Popular demand led to many unauthorised copies being made. One side of the popular medal showed Lusitania sinking laden with guns (incorrectly depicted sinking stern first) with the motto \\"KEINE BANNWARE!\\" (\\"NO CONTRABAND!\\"), while the reverse showed a skeleton selling Cunard tickets with the motto \\"Gesch√§ft √úber Alles\\" (\\"Business Above All\\"). Goetz had put an incorrect date for the sinking on the medal, an error he later blamed on a mistake in a newspaper story about the sinking: instead of 7 May, he had put \\"5. Mai\\", two days before the actual sinking. Not realising his error, Goetz made copies of the medal and sold them in Munich and also to some numismatic dealers with whom he conducted business. The British Foreign Office obtained a copy of the medal, photographed it, and sent copies to the United States where it was published in the New York Times on 5 May 1916. [sic‚Äîauthor misspelled Schrecklichkeit] Many popular magazines ran photographs of the medal, and it was falsely claimed that it had been awarded to the crew of the U-boat. Emile Henry Lacombe wrote a letter to the New York Times advancing a conspiracy theory about the German sinking of the Lusitania in 1915. His letter was published Monday 22 October 1917 on page 14 titled \\"A NEW THEORY OF THE LUSITANIA SINKING. The Evidence of the German Medal Dated May 5 and the Report of the Explosive \\"Cigars\\" on Board.\\" British replica of Goetz medal British replica of the Goetz Lusitania medal. The Goetz medal attracted so much attention that Lord Newton, who was in charge of Propaganda at the Foreign Office in 1916, decided to develop the anti-German feelings aroused by it for propaganda purposes and asked department store entrepreneur Harry Gordon Selfridge to reproduce the medal again. The replica medals were produced in an attractive case and were an exact copy of the German medal, and were sold for a shilling apiece. On the cases it was stated that the medals had been distributed in Germany \\"to commemorate the sinking of Lusitania\\" and they came with a propaganda leaflet which strongly denounced the Germans and used the medal's incorrect date (5 May) to incorrectly claim that the sinking of Lusitania was premeditated, rather than just being incident to Germany's larger plan to sink any ship in a combat zone without warning. The head of the Lusitania Souvenir Medal Committee later estimated that 250,000 were sold, proceeds being given to the Red Cross and St. Dunstan's Blinded Soldiers and Sailors Hostel. (Original propaganda leaflet) Unlike the original Goetz medals which were sand-cast from bronze, the British copies were of diecast iron and were of poorer quality. However, a few original medals were also made in iron. Originals usually have \\"KGoetz\\" on the edge. Over the years various other copies have been made. Belatedly realising his mistake, Goetz issued a corrected medal with the date of \\"7. Mai\\". The Bavarian government, alarmed at the strong worldwide reaction to Goetz's work, suppressed the medal and ordered confiscation in April 1917. The original German medals can easily be distinguished from the English copies because the date is in German, i.e. with a dot behind the numeral; the English version was altered to read 'May' rather than 'Mai'. After the war Goetz expressed his regret that his work had been the cause of increasing anti-German feelings, but it remains a celebrated propaganda act. = Baudichon medal = Reverse of the Baudichon medal Circa 1920 the French medallist Ren√© Baudichon created a counterblast to the Goetz medal.

Last survivors Young Barbara McDermott with Assistant Purser ‚Äì William Harkness The last survivor was Audrey Warren Lawson-Johnston (n√©e Pearl), who was born in New York City on 15 February 1915. She was the fourth of six children (the youngest two born after the disaster) born to Major Frederic \\"Frank\\" Warren Pearl (26 August 1869 ‚Äì 2 January 1952) and Amy Lea (n√©e Duncan; 12 November 1880 ‚Äì 1 February 1964). She was only three months old when she boarded Lusitania in New York with her parents, three siblings, and two nurses ‚Äì and due to her age had no first hand recollection of the disaster. She and her brother Stuart (age 5) were saved by their British nursemaid Alice Maud Lines, then 18 years old, who jumped off the boat deck and escaped in a lifeboat. Her parents also survived, but her sisters Amy (age 3) and Susan (age 14 months) died. Pearl married Hugh de Beauchamp Lawson-Johnston, second son of George Lawson Johnston, 1st Baron Luke, on 18 July 1946. They had three children and lived in Melchbourne, Bedfordshire. Hugh was High Sheriff of Bedfordshire in 1961. Johnston gifted an inshore lifeboat, Amy Lea, to New Quay Lifeboat Station in 2004 in memory of her mother. Johnston died on 11 January 2011. The last American survivor was Barbara McDermott (born Barbara Winifred Anderson in Connecticut on 15 June 1912, to Roland Anderson and Emily Pybus). She was three years old at the time of the sinking. Her father worked as a draftsman for an ammunitions factory in south-western Connecticut.Barbara Winifred Anderson McDermott: Visit on a Sunday Afternoon, 21 July 2002 Journeys in Time Web site He was unable to accompany his wife and daughter on Lusitania as the First World War had created high demands for ammunition manufacturing at the factory where he worked. Barbara recalled being in the ship's dining room eating dessert when the torpedo hit. She remembered holding onto her spoon as she saw fellow passengers running about the badly damaged ship. In the midst of chaos, Barbara was separated from her mother and loaded into Lifeboat No. 15. Barbara later learned that her mother fell into the sea but was rescued and placed into the same lifeboat as her daughter. Neither Barbara nor her mother was seriously injured. After their rescue, Barbara and her mother travelled to Darlington, County Durham, England, to live with Barbara's maternal grandmother. Barbara's mother died on 22 March 1917 at the age of 28. Two years later, Barbara left Britain and travelled back to the United States aboard Mauretania and arrived in New York City on 26 December 1919. Barbara died on 12 April 2008 in Wallingford, Connecticut, at the age of 95.

Controversies The Selfridge replica of the German medal in its case *See also RMS Lusitania#Conspiracy theories =Cruiser rules and exclusion zones= The \\"Prize rules\\" or \\"Cruiser rules\\", laid down by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, governed the seizure of vessels at sea during wartime, although changes in technology such as radio and the submarine eventually made parts of them irrelevant. Merchant ships were to be warned by warships, and their passengers and crew allowed to abandon ship before they were sunk, unless the ship resisted or tried to escape, or was in a convoy protected by warships. Limited armament on a merchant ship, such as one or two guns, did not necessarily affect the ship's immunity to attack without warning, and neither did a cargo of munitions or materiel. In November 1914 the British announced that the entire North Sea was now a War Zone, and issued orders restricting the passage of neutral shipping into and through the North Sea to special channels where supervision would be possible (the other approaches having been mined). It was in response to this, and to the British Admiralty's order of 31 January 1915 that British merchant ships should fly neutral colours as a ruse de guerre, that Admiral Hugo von Pohl, commander of the German High Seas Fleet, published a warning in the Deutscher Reichsanzeiger (Imperial German Gazette) on 4 February 1915: In response, the Admiralty issued orders on 10 February 1915 which directed merchant ships to escape from hostile U-boats when possible, but \\"if a submarine comes up suddenly close ahead of you with obvious hostile intention, steer straight for her at your utmost speed...\\" Further instructions ten days later advised armed steamers to open fire on a submarine even if it had not yet fired. Given the extreme vulnerability of a submarine to ramming or even small-caliber shellfire, a U-boat that surfaced and gave warning against a merchantman which had been given such instructions was putting itself in great danger. The Germans knew of these orders, even though they were intended to be secret, copies having been obtained from captured ships and from wireless intercepts; Bailey and Ryan in their \\"The Lusitania Disaster\\", put much emphasis on these Admiralty orders to merchantmen, arguing it was unreasonable to expect a submarine to surface and give warning under such circumstances. In their opinion this, rather than the munitions, the nonexistent armament, or any other suggested reason, is the best rationale for the Germans' actions in the sinking. =Contraband and second explosion= The cargo included 4,200,000 rounds of Remington .303 rifle/machine-gun cartridges, 1,250 cases of empty fragmentation shell casings and eighteen cases of percussion fuses, all of which were listed on the ship's two-page manifest, filed with US Customs after she departed New York on 1 May. However, these munitions were classed as small arms ammunition, were non-explosive in bulk, and were clearly marked as such. It was perfectly legal under American shipping regulations for the liner to carry these; experts agreed they were not to blame for the second explosion. Allegations the ship was carrying more controversial cargo, such as fine aluminium powder, concealed as cheese on her cargo manifests, or guncotton (pyroxylene) disguised as casks of beef, have never been proven. In the 1960s, American diver John Light did several dives on the wreck, trying to prove the existence of contraband explosives in Lusitania 's cargo hold, ignited by the torpedo. Light claimed to have found a large hole on Lusitania port side, opposite of where the torpedo had struck, though later expeditions disproved his findings. A propeller recovered from Lusitania In 1993, Dr. Robert Ballard, the famous explorer who discovered Titanic and Bismarck, conducted an in-depth exploration of the wreck of Lusitania. Ballard tried to confirm John Light's findings of a large hole on the port side of the wreck, and he didn't find anything. During his investigation, Ballard noted a large quantity of coal on the sea bed near the wreck, and after consulting an explosives expert advanced the theory of a coal dust explosion. He believed dust in the bunkers would have been thrown into the air by the vibration from the explosion; the resulting cloud would have been ignited by a spark, causing the second explosion. In the years since he first advanced this theory, it has been argued that this is nearly impossible. Critics of the theory say coal dust would have been too damp to have been stirred into the air by the torpedo impact in explosive concentrations; additionally, the coal bunker where the torpedo struck would have been flooded almost immediately by seawater flowing through the damaged hull plates. In 2007, marine forensic investigators considered that an explosion in the ship's steam-generating plant could be a plausible explanation for the second explosion. However, accounts from the few survivors who managed to escape from the forward two boiler rooms reported that the ship's boilers did not explode. Leading Fireman Albert Martin later testified he thought the torpedo actually entered the boiler room and exploded between a group of boilers, which was a physical impossibility.Layton, J. Kent (2007). Lusitania: An Illustrated Biography of the Ship of Splendor. pp.194 It is also known the forward boiler room filled with steam, and steam pressure feeding the turbines dropped dramatically following the second explosion. These point toward a failure, of one sort or another, in the ship's steam- generating plant. It is possible the failure came, not directly from one of the boilers in boiler room no. 1, but rather in the high-pressure steam lines to the turbines. The original torpedo damage alone, striking the ship on the starboard coal bunker of boiler room no. 1, would probably have sunk the ship without a second explosion. This first blast was enough to cause, on its own, serious off-centre flooding, although the sinking would possibly have been slower. The deficiencies of the ship's original watertight bulkhead design exacerbated the situation, as did the many portholes which had been left open for ventilation.  Wreck site  ship's telegraph on the wreck of Lusitania The wreck of Lusitania lies on her starboard side at an approximately 30-degree angle in of sea water. She is severely collapsed onto her starboard side as a result of the force with which she slammed into the sea floor, and over decades, Lusitania has deteriorated significantly faster than Titanic because of the corrosion in the winter tides. The keel has an \\"unusual curvature\\", in a boomerang shape, which may be related to a lack of strength from the loss of her superstructure. The beam is reduced with the funnels missing presumably to deterioration. The bow is the most prominent portion of the wreck with the stern damaged from depth charging in the Second World War as well as the removal of three of the four propellers by Oceaneering International in 1982 for display. Some of the prominent features on Lusitania include her still-legible name, some bollards with the ropes still intact, pieces of the ruined promenade deck, some portholes, the prow and the remaining propeller. Recent expeditions to the wreck have revealed that Lusitania is in surprisingly poor condition compared to Titanic, as her hull has already started to collapse.

The name \\"Kadijken\\" is the plural form of Kadijk and refers to the two main streets that traverse the neighbourhood, Hoogte Kadijk (\\"Upper Kadijk\\") and Laagte Kadijk (\\"Lower Kadijk\\").\\"De Kadijken\\", Wijkcentrum Oostelijke Binnenstad (Dutch)  Description  Entrepotdok viewed from the Nijlpaardenbrug bridge Southwestern point of the Kadijken, with Nieuwe Herengracht canal (left), the Scharrebiersluis sluice gates (centre) and Entrepotdok (right) The Kadijken, a rectangular area measuring 900 by 170 metres, is bordered by Entrepotdok canal to the south, Nieuwe Herengracht to the west, Nieuwe Vaart canal to the west, and Sarphatistraat street to the east. The neighbourhood is cut into two halves, a larger western part and a smaller western part, by a former complex of sluice gates that forms a canal between the Nieuwe Vaart and Entrepotdok canals. This canal isolates the western part of the neighbourhood from the rest of the city, making it a de facto island. Connecting the two main streets, Hoogte en Laagte Kadijk, is a small street appropriately named Tussen Kadijken (\\"Between the Kadijken\\"). The small street Buiten Kadijken (\\"Outer Kadijken\\") runs from Hoogte Kadijk to Nieuwe Vaart canal. At the corner of Hoogte Kadijk and Buiten Kadijken is a pillar topped with a sculpture of a falcon with a crown on its head. This is a replica of a cast-iron sculpture that stood here for many years as a trademark of the beer brewery De Gekroonde Valk (\\"The Crowned Falcon\\"), which has been located here since the 18th century. The western edge of the neighbourhood is formed by Kadijkenplein square with the Zeemanshuis (\\"Seamen's House\\") and the gate building of the Algemeen Rijksentrepot, both dating to the 19th century. From the square, a cast-iron bridge leads across Nieuwe Herengracht canal. Behind the bridge are the Scharrebiersluis sluice gates. Both the bridge and the sluice gates were constructed in 1906. The neighbourhood has about 3,000 inhabitants. There about 1,700 residences, primarily in the western part of the neighbourhood. Of those, 70% is rented (60% government-subsidised apartments and 10% private rental), and the remaining 30% is privately owned. The eastern part of the neighbourhood is less residential; this area is dominated by offices and workshops. The many former warehouses and shipyards in the Kadijken are a reminder of the neighbourhood's past as an area of town dominated by shipping and industry. Werfmuseum 't Kromhout and Koning William, both on Hoogte Kadijk, are still in use as shipyards. The eastern hall of Werfmuseum 't Kromhout is now a museum. The neighbourhood has a large number of rijksmonumenten (national monuments), including the warehouses on Entrepotdok, the Sibbelwoningen on Hoogte Kadijk and a series of 17th- and 18th-century houses. History The Kadijken were created during the fourth 17th-century expansion of Amsterdam, completed in 1663, in which an area of land beyond the dikes protecting the eastern side of Amsterdam was added to the city. In this area, a kadijk-type dike, the Nieuwe Zeedijk, had been constructed beyond the original Sint Antoniesdijk dike. A kadijk is the outer, lower dike (levee) within a set of two dikes to keep a river (or, in this instance, the IJ bay), from flooding. During the city expansion, the Nieuwe Zeedijk was raised and the higher part was called Hoogte Kadijk, while the lower part lying behind the dike came to be called Laagte Kadijk. The Kadijken rapidly developed into an area dominated by shipyards. The south side was originally used for recreation, but from the early part of the 18th century this part of the neighbourhood was filled with warehouses and other buildings for storage of goods. In 1827 the Rapenburgergracht, as the canal along the southern edge of the neighbourhood was called, was taken over by the Dutch national government. The government established the Algemeen Rijksentrepot there, which allowed goods in transit to be temporarily stored and transferred from one ship to another without the need to pay excise duties. With a total of 96 warehouses stretching 800 metres, this was one of the largest complexes of warehouses in Europe. The Rapenburgergracht was renamed Entrepotdok. The industrial character of the neighbourhood did not start to fade until the 20th century. From the 1970s onwards, hundreds of government-subsidised apartments were built, both in former warehouses and in newly constructed buildings. The museum EnergeticA was located in a former power station from 1903 on Hoogte Kadijk. The museum closed in 2007, and the collection was taken over by science centre NEMO.

The company existed from 1747 to 1774 and managed the government of Greenland from 1749. History The General Trade Company was founded on 4 September 1747. Learning from the mistakes of the earlier Bergen Greenland Company and the relative success of Jacob Severin's operation on the island, the company received a full monopoly on trade around its settlements and armed ships flying the Danebrog to prevent better-armed, lower-priced, and better-quality Dutch goods from bankrupting the enterprise. It focused its operations on getting seal skins and whale oil from the native hunters for resale in Europe.Marquardt, Ole. \\"Change and Continuity in Denmark's Greenland Policy\\" in The Oldenburg Monarchy: An Underestimated Empire?.

The GTC received Hans Egede's Godthaab; the Moravian missions Neu- Herrnhut and Lichtenfels; and Severin's trading stations at Christianshaab, Jakobshavn, and Frederikshaab. The General Trade Company was granted a monopoly only within a certain radius around its settlements and therefore undertook a campaign to expand the number of trading posts along the west coastThe east coast of Greenland was inaccessible throughout this period owing to icebergs. as swiftly as it could profitably do so: Claushavn in 1752, Fisken√¶sset in 1754, Ritenbenck and Egedesminde and Sukkertoppen in 1755, Holsteinsborg in 1756, Umanak in 1758, Upernavik in 1771, Godhavn in 1773, and Julianehaab in 1774. The same year as the foundation of Julianehaab, 1774, the [General Trade Company] folded, although for reasons unrelated to the profitability of its operations in the colony. It was replaced by the Royal Greenland Trade Department (Kongelige Gr√∏nlandske Handel, KGH), a state company which maintained control of the colony for the next century and a half.

It was developed by WayForward Technologies and Gearbox Software. It is a tie-in to the Alien franchise. The cover art as well as the character designs and avatars were drawn by renowned comic-book artist Chris Bachalo.  Gameplay  Gameplay of Aliens: Infestation is comparable to the Metroid and Castlevania video games, where players are encouraged to search and backtrack for weapons, upgrades, and keys. The player controls one of a party of four marines and explores the U.S.S. Sulaco as well as LV-426 and Phobos in order to investigate the Union of Progressive Peoples (UPP) and Weyland-Yutani's involvement in Xenomorph development. The game incorporates a permadeath mechanic. If a marine falls in battle, another in the party will take their place. The player loses if the entire party is wiped out. Fallen characters can be replaced with any of fifteen displaced marines found throughout the game, each with their own unique dialog. Plot The USS Sephora has discovered the USS Sulaco adrift in space after the events of Aliens and Alien 3. The Colonial Marines are sent aboard the Sulaco to investigate and recover the life form detected aboard the ship.  Development  Aliens: Infestation was developed by WayForward Technologies and Gearbox Software and was originally intended to be a tie-in to the PC and console Aliens: Colonial Marines game. When doing their research, Game Director, Adam Tierney, focused heavily on Ridley Scott's Alien and James Cameron's Aliens as inspiration. To capture the films' slasher appeal, while still keeping you emotionally invested, the development team created 20 unique characters, with the game's dialogue carefully re-written 20 times, to make sure it offered the biggest 'gut-punch' when one dies. In conjunction with the game's 'party of four' mechanic, the developers wanted players to grow attached to their favorites, which in-turn, increased the likelihood of getting one killed.  Reception  Aliens: Infestation received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The A.V. Club gave it a B+, saying, \\"It's a shame that Aliens: Infestation peters out by the end. In the push toward the conclusion, the upgraded weapons you've collected lessen the threat, and the thin plot culminates in a boring fight against a big alien queen.\\" Digital Spy gave it four stars out of five, saying, \\"In many ways, it feels like the Aliens game we should have been given back in the 16-bit era when the movie series was still relatively new. Whether it has been worth the wait is debatable, but this is certainly a worthy addition to the DS library.\\" However, The Digital Fix gave it seven out of ten, saying that \\"It can be uneven at times in terms of quality but it is highly enjoyable, especially if you are fan of either the franchise or even if you are just a fan of 'MetroidVania' games.\\"  References   External links  * Category:2011 video games Category:Alien (franchise) games Category:Phobos (moon) in fiction Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:Sega video games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Gearbox Software games Category:Metroidvania games Category:Single- player video games ","title":"Aliens Infestation"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function P(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your wikipediaü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(B,[["render",P]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/64.md","filePath":"glossary/64.md"}'),x={name:"glossary/64.md"},F=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{H as __pageData,F as default};
