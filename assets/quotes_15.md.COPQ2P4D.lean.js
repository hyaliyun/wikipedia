The leopard reportedly claimed a victim once every 2‚Äì3 days, each time in a different area to the last, with the killings sometimes taking place 20‚Äì30 miles apart. The leopard caused such panic that the native communities in its range rarely left their homes alone or unarmed. Hunt for the leopard An unnamed British hunter set up headquarters in a large village, where he compiled information on the leopard's depredations with the local thana. Ten days later, a man entered the hunter's camp one morning, and claimed that the leopard had entered a hut in a village a mile from the camp, and had unsuccessfully attempted to carry off a small girl the previous night. The hunter dressed the girl's wounds and she recovered. The leopard struck again two days later in another village. The hunter searched for the leopard from his camp for three weeks without success. With the body count rising, the hunter considered moving camp, until a boy from a village four miles away came to him, and stated that the leopard had dragged off his brother when they were driving cattle. At 14:00, the hunter set himself on a tree overlooking the boy's corpse, in the hope that the leopard would return for it. The leopard came at night, though the hunter was unable to get a clear shot due to the darkness, and the canopy of dense creeper vine. The hunter attempted to startle the leopard into coming out for a clear shot, but all attempts failed to intimidate the leopard, even firing in the air had no effect. The shots got the attention of the villagers, but the hunter called at them to clear the area. After a few hours, the hunter fell asleep at 1:00, and upon waking, found the leopard clawing at the foot of the tree. The leopard left after a few moments, but returned three hours later to finish its meal. By sunrise, all that remained of the boy's body were hands, feet and a few bones. The hunter attempted to track down the leopard in case it was still in the area, but after a search spanning one mile, he gave up. A few days later, the hunter moved camp ten miles away, hoping for more success. On the second night of his arrival, the hunter was awoken from his sleep by the leopard scratching outside his tent, though it was driven off by the shouting of the villagers. Death and post mortem Three days later, the leopard attacked the goats of a Gond farmer, but was driven off. Upon shortly returning however, it was fatally shot with a projectile propelled from a gas pipe five yards away from it. The Gond presented the hunter with the leopard's skin and stomach contents, among which was a ball of human hair, thus confirming it as the man- eater. The hunter purchased the hide for 10 rupees, later noting that the fur and claws were in fine condition, not what was to be expected from an old, infirm animal. There were no signs of past injuries which could have prevented it from hunting, thus leaving the hunter to conclude that the leopard had probably been fed human flesh as a cub by its mother, a likely man-eater herself.

It is located in the commune of Domeyrat, in the Haute-Loire department of central France. It has been listed since 1983 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.M√©rim√©e database, French Ministry of Culture: Ch√¢teau de Domeyrat, accessed 1 June 2008 History A first mention of the castle was in the inventory of Alphonse de Poitiers' vassals, done between 1250 and 1260. It was then a property of the Papabeuf family. The lineage seems to have been extinct in 1348, probably due to the plague; the castle went from hand to hand and may have been abandoned during the Hundred Years' War. Adhemar Jori/Jory, was the Lord of Domeyrat in 1375. In 1387 the new lord of Domeyrat was Pons de Langheac, seneschal of Auvergne. His son inherited of the title in 1421; he has deeply restructured the castle and is considered as the second builder, hence confusions about the date of construction. The de Langheac family kept the castle until 1656. The edifice was less and less maintained by its successive owners, and began to be dismantled during the French Revolution. Bought by the Conseil g√©n√©ral of Haute-Loire, it was listed as a Historical monument in 1983. The castle is now managed by an association, ¬´Et Tant d'Arts...¬ª, performing entertainment on Medieval theme. Architecture On the slope of a small hill, the Ch√¢teau de Domeyrat overlooks the village and the valley of the Senouire River. A rectangular curtain with a round tower at each angle protects the main building and the keep, without courtyard; it is surrounded by a second enceinte. Two of the angle towers are decorated with paintings of the 16th century (hunting scenes in the north-western tower, religious scenes in the south-eastern tower, where the chapel wasM√©rim√©e database, French Ministry of Culture: Pictures of Domeyrat, accessed 1 June 2008).

As an amateur he represented his native country at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. He is a former WBU International featherweight, WBO Inter- Continental super featherweight, Hungarian and IBC lightweight champion. Professional career Bognar turned professional in October 1994 at Szeksz√°rd, Hungary. In his debut he defeated Romanian's Radu Petricon points over six rounds. Michael Gomez fights Bognar fought Irish fighter Michael Gomez on his first fight of 2001 on 10 February for the WBO Intercontinental super featherweight title, in Widnes, Cheshire, England. Gomez had Bognar on the canvas in the fifth round after landing a crushing left hook. Although Bognar was shaken Gomez was unable to make his power count. Bognar recovered from his knockdown and kept Gomez at bay with his southpaw jab. In the ninth round Gomez was stopped after referee Dave Paris stepped in following a double left from Bognar, which had Gomez stricken against the ropes. Gomez felt the fight had been stopped prematurely and that he should have been allowed to continue. Gomez later stated that he was suffering from flu and should not have taken the fight. John Munroe, who was sitting ringside, was called over by Ian Darke, at Gomez's request to verify his theory. This turned into a war of words, with the promoter Frank Warren and John Munroe regarding Brian Hughes, with Frank Warren promising Gomez the rematch, and Gomez stating that he was leaving Brian Hughes' gym to team up with Billy Graham. However, others pointed to his well publicised troubles out of the ring. There had been reports in the press that Gomez was not training regularly, that he had not stuck to his diet and had been out drinking and clubbing. Reports also circulated that Gomez was having trouble in his private life and that he had been stabbed in a street fight. Gomez rematch Gomez wanted to rematch against Bognar, and five months later and a victory over John Munroe, in July 2001, the pair had a rematch in Manchester in what turned out to be a short and explosive encounter. The fight started badly for Gomez when he suffered a flash knockdown in the first round and was down again in the second. Gomez came back to put Bognar down near the end of the second round. Gomez came out firing at the start of the third round and finished the fight with a fourth and final knockdown to avenge his earlier defeat.

() is a Bermuda-incorporated insurance provider, listed on the London Stock Exchange. An underwriter at Lloyd's of London, the company largely specialises in niche areas of the market, offering property and casualty insurance aimed at companies and high-net-worth individuals, as well as cover against such risks as hacking, kidnapping and satellite damage. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. History The roots of the company lie with the Roberts agency, which commenced underwriting marine insurance at the Lloyd's market in 1901. In 1946 Ralph Hiscox, who had joined the agency as an underwriter of non-marine insurance eight years earlier, formed the Roberts & Hiscox partnership for the purposes of managing syndicates at Lloyd's. Hiscox was elected chairman of Lloyd's in 1967, the same year his son Robert joined the group's Syndicate 33 as an underwriter of fine art and personal accident insurance. Robert Hiscox subsequently took over as head of the partnership in 1970 after the death of his father, and set about growing the size of the business. In 1987 the firm reorganised ‚Äì a holding company, Hiscox Holdings Ltd, was established for the group, which comprised the subsidiaries Hiscox Syndicates (for managing syndicates) and Roberts & Hiscox (for introducing and advising members of the Lloyd's market). Expansion beyond the London market followed in 1989 with the formation of a third subsidiary, Hiscox Underwriting, specifically for this purpose. Roberts & Hiscox and related interests were demerged in 1994, leaving the company as merely an underwriter and manager of syndicates. Having previously listed on the Alternative Investment Market, Hiscox plc transferred to the main market of the London Stock Exchange in July 1997. Following the purchase of a 28% stake in the company by Chubb Corporation in 1998, the company fought to remain independent, successfully rebuffing two takeover offers by 2001. Chubb subsequently sold off its interest in Hiscox in 2004. In 2005, the company opened a Bermuda office, writing a mix of worldwide reinsurance and retail business. The following year Hiscox plc moved its country of domicile from the United Kingdom to Bermuda, adopting the new name Hiscox Ltd. For 2009, the company increased its marketing budget from ¬£400,000 to ¬£10 million and launched a mass media campaign with the strap line \\"as good as our word\\".Hiscox hands SEO account to VCCP Search.

It is situated at a distance of about 5 km from Dabra town, on Gwalior-Jhansi Road, in Gwalior district.  Magrora fort  Magrora fort is situated on Naun River near the confluence of Naun and Sindh Rivers. The Magrora fort is seen on west of the road while one passes from Dabra to Jhansi. It is a beautiful site to see the surrounding area from Magrora fort. There are two huge tanks in the fort for sustained water supply. There are three temples in the fort where regular worship takes place. The festival of holi starts from here.  History  Magrora fort was built by Maharaja Hamirjoodeo. Magrora state has been known for kind hearted rulers very popular amongst the public. Before the war with Mahadji Sindhia they were the rulers of Pichhore (Dabra).Raja Padm Singh: \\"Magrora Durg\\", Jat-Veer Smarika, Gwalior. 1992, p. 70 The Magrora state included Lohagarh, Magrora, Salvai, Patha, Ajaygarh and Simaria garhis (forts). There were 25 garhis and 400 villages in this state. All these forts were built on high hillocks and well protected. After war with Mahadji Sindhia there was a treaty in which Pichhore ruler Maharaja Pahar Singh was given the Magrora fort along with the title of Bahadur Joodeo. It was a free Jagir. The rulers of Magrora were later Swarup Singh, Jai Singh, Hem Singh, Bhagwat Singh, Ram Singh. Raja Ram Singh had no issue and adopted the eldest, (Raja SurendraPal Singh) of the 3 sons of his younger brother Mirendra Singh Joodeo. Raja Surendra Singh JuDev was married to Rani Shrimant Mithlesh Kanwar Raje, d/o Raja Gulzar singhji with his 3rd wife Rani Chandra Kanwar of Pisawa. The present gadi is with their eldest son Raja Dhananjai Singh Judev Magrora fort was occupied till 1954 after which Raja Surendra Singhji shifted to Dabra.  The Jatwara Tract  The 'Jatwara' Tract of the Trans-Chambal plain, the Hindi appellation of 'Jatwara'-literally the \\"Abode of Jats\\"-is succinctly descriptive of the past political dominance of the Trans-Chambal Jats in the area of Bhind and Gwalior rather than of their numerical strength, which now as in the past remains very meager in proportion to other ethnic groups in that Region. Whereas, the past association of the Jat Ranas of Dholpur with the Gohad and Gwalior Tract is generally known. What came as a surprise, however, was the contemporaneous existence of two other Jat principalities during medieval times in areas contiguous to Gohad. The ethnic pattern in the Trans-Chambal Valley is similar to that obtaining in the contiguous tract of the Agra plain except that the population of the Jats tapers off to an insignificant proportion. The approximate axis of the \\"Jatwara Tract\\" could be taken to comprise the general line represented by Bhind, Gohad and Indargarh, overlapping the modern districts of Bhind, Gwalior and Datia in the present day Madhya Pradesh. Astride this axis and in a fan-like direction from it, there is a scattered population of Jats: to the East, it extends towards the lower reaches of the Chambal and Sind Rivers: to the West towards Gwalior, Shivpuri, Dabra, Magrora, and Bhitarwar. As a rule exclusive Jat habitations are few. More often the Jat is to be found in solitary homesteads in composite ethnic villages, his remote ancestor probably having been assigned the custody of the local Jat garhi (minor fortification), still precariously perched atop the neighboring hillock. The Jats of Gohad According to local tradition, the Bambrolia Jats of Gohad had migrated from Taxila in Western Punjab. In the 16th century the Bambrolia Jats sent an armed contingent to the confederate army mustered by Rana Sangram Singh of Mewar for challenging the supremacy of Babur. They must have suffered heavy losses. By a coincidence some two hundred and more years later, the Bambrolia Jats, under the Rana of Gohad, fought against Slabat Khan as allies of Badan Singh, the then ruler of Bharatpur. Badan Singh in turn gave them patronage, which ensured their political survival Badan Singh. A much-married prince also contracted matrimonial alliance with the Trans Chambal Jat rulers, which subsequently proved to be an enduring bond. The high tide of the soaring ambition of the Bambrolia Jats coincided with the capture of Gwalior. Twice they dared and succeeded in capturing that naturally formidable fortress, once in 1771 and again in 1780, but in neither case did the acquisition endure for long. Mahadji Sindhia by some repostes recaptured Gwalior in 1766 and 1783 respectively. The Rana of Gohad was defeated by Mahadji in 1784 and was rendered homeless. The Rana was politically resurrected when in 1803 when the East India Company defeated Daulat Rao Sindhia. He was allowed to retain the territory of Nimrol in the Trans-Chambal region, as it contained the ancestral Bambrolia Samadhis, (monuments) which incidentally still adorn that arid landscape. Much to his disappointment Gohad passed out of the hands of the Rana, but in lieu of his hereditary kingdom, he was assigned instead a principality in Dholpur. The Jats of Pichor Like their Bambrolia Kinsmen in Gohad the Doderiyan Jats of Pichor were also reluctant emigrants from the Punjab. About the year 1340 AD Raja Bhagirath founded a settlement around the village of Keo some 35 miles South East of Gwalior, which subsequently became famous as Pichor. Raja Bhargirath had four sons. namely Chandermani, Sinhmani, Akshamani and Mado Singh. Chandermani the eldest succeeded his father. On Chandermani's death, his only on Dhruve Angad became the ruler of Pichor. He started the building of Pichor fort in 1448 which was completed by his son Raja Hamir Deo the First, whose reign partly coincided and probably overlapped the reign of the famous Tomar chief Raja Man Singh. Hamir Deo the First saw hard days in his conflicts with the chiefs of Narwar and Orcha. But by the very able stratagem of his wife Ganga Kumari he was able to over come his problems and continued to rule Pichor for many years and was probably still alive when Babar appeared on the Indian scene. After that there is a hiatus in the Doderiyan tradition. During the rule of Hamir Deo the second, a contemporary of Shah Jahan I (1628-58 AD), the Pichor principality grew into a modest size. His just rule and martial exploits are to this day extolled by the itinerant bards of Northern Bundhel Khand. Hamir's sense of Justice is reputed to have led him to sentence his own beloved son to death for an unintentional misdemeanor in a hunting field. Hamir Deo was succeeded by Raja Padam Singh, who ruled Pichor during The greater part of Aurangzeb's reign. Padam Singh had two sons. Hindupati and Prithvipati. Hindupati was a reputed scholar and poet. He wrote a religions tract called Tattva-Bodha which is still extant. Hindupati was succeeded by his son Pahar Singh. During 1767, Pahar Singh had joined forces with Jawahar Singh or expelling the Maratha troops from the Bhind area and in the latter's expedition to Ajmer and Pushkar. However, about the year 1783-84 Pahar Singh had accepted a feudatory status under Mahadji Sindhia. Chhattar Singh the successor of Pahar Singh was treacherously deprived of Pichor by Daulat Rao Sindhia. His wife's blood stained palm impression in the citadel at Pichor still commemorates her exile from that ancient fortress. The Jats of Indargarh Raja Balwant Singh in about 1650 AD founded the Jat State of Indargarh. He is reputed to have had an ancestral patrimony around Shivpuri, some 65 miles West of Gwalior. Whether he emigrated under duress from Shivpuri or brighter prospect abroad beckoned him, or was enticed away from his native Shivpuri by promise of a larger patrimony by the Bundela Chiefs of Orchha and Datia, still remains an enigma. What however is unambiguous is that. Raja Balwan Singh's new principality in the Trans-Sind Region initially comprised some 40 villages along the South Bank of the Sind in the intervening tract between Datia and Seondha. As the principality of Datia was relatively weaker than that of Pichor, it is to be inferred that the principality of Indargarh may have been utilized as a convenient buffer by the Bundela chiefs to constrict Pichor's expansion South of the Sind. This stratagem might even have had the tacit acquiescence of the neighboring Kushwaha ruler of Narwar, who was actuated by a similar design towards Pichhor. Whether the tale is true or apocryphal is however difficult to discern. There is on the other hand no tradition of any enduring internecine feud between the neighboring Jat principalities of Pichhor and Indargarh. It is however probable that with the interposition of kindred Jat principality as a buffer, the subsequent expansion of Pichhor was deflected Westwards beyond Bhitarwar in the Narwar territory and southeastwards towards Lahar and Daboh. Raja Balwant Singh was succeeded by his son Indar Singh who further enlarged his patrimony and built a stone fort, still extant, which even now perpetuates his name and memory. The principality of Indargarh remained unimpaired during Aurangzeb's and some of the later Mughals' reigns, but had rather a precarious existence during the ascendancy of the Marathas in the 18th century AD. During this period, the ruler of Indargarh was sometimes constrained to side with the Marathas, the allies of the Bundela Chief, but when left uncoerced joined forces with the neighboring Jat Chiefs of Pichhor and Gohad to resist the Southern intruders. After the demise of Pichhor in 1816 AD the Jat principality of Indargarh was also obliterated by the connivance of the Marathas in the beginning of 1817 AD and its ruler like his kinsmen of Pichhor and Gohad forced into exile. After the fall of Indargarh all the Jat forts have remained untenanted in this region; staggered in a line between Bhind and Jhansi, they are now like a row of avenging ghosts rather than abodes of patricians of yesteryears. CONCLUSION An oral tradition is inevitably compounded by hiatuses, vagueness and interpolations. In consequence, some historical inexactitudes have probably imperceptibly crept into this narrative, but they are unintended. If this narrative gratifies a passing curiosity, or arouses a more enduring Interest by sparking further research In the annals of the Trans- Chambal Jats, then the kindly shepherd's rustic eloquence has been more than worthwhile. In retrospect the extinction of the Trans-Chambal Jat principalities of Gohad Pichhor and Indargarh in the late 18th and 19th century AD was inevitable in that they strategically straddled the Maratha lines of communication to the North. The Marathas were perforce constrained to secure the Gwalior tract as an essential strategic requisite before they could make a bid for domination in Hindustan. It was however defiance of a few against many, though aggravated by the Natural racial propensities of the contestants, the Maratha rapacity and greed being matched by the unyielding and uncompromising Jat obstinacy till the bitter end. The resources of the Trans-Chambal Jats were too meager for their resistance against the Marathas, their resolutions pitched too high for their slender means and their defiance, though heroic and worthy of emulation, left them no escape route for retreat and survival and for recouping their strength. To them struggle was a familiar avocation, defiance a vital military virtue, sieges, a repeated occurrence, Defeat a frequent desert and exile an inexorable fate. Their splendidly sustained defiance could, however, be greeted with approbation, and some times even with applause.  References  2\\\\.

Life Based in Antioch during the 7th century, Trithyrius was a Greek Christian treasurer working for the Byzantine authority of Emperor Heraclius and extremely loyal to the emperor himself. He enjoyed supremacy under his title of sacellarius, usually appointed to the state treasurer. In 634, the emperor sent his brother Theodore to fighting the invading armies of Arabs in Ajnadayn where he was decisively defeated. On his retreat, Theodore blamed his brother's incestuous marriage to their niece Martina for the defeat of the Byzantine empire and delved into an argument with him. Heraclius stripped him of his command and sent him to Constantinople. With Theodore gone, Heraclius appointed Trithyrius to take lead as the commander of his brother's army. Historians cite that Heraclius wanted to give the reigns to Theodore not because he was loyal but because he shared his brother's name and that the force would not feel much about the replacement of his brother. In 635, however, things were beginning to take a serious toll when the Byzantine armies failed considerably at other battles. This partly due to financial setbacks and the Byzantine empire failing to provide salaries for the troops, Trithyrius found himself in another role. For most times, Trithyrius's role with the army served as a constant reassurance. A certain lassitude had filled the air and Heraclius had to disband many regiments for economy's sake. There was no enthusiasm towards joining the army, however the presence of the imperial paymaster encouraged mercenary recruitment. The Muslim conquest of Syria appeared a significant threat to the Byzantine empire and Heraclius thus ordered Trithyrius to lead an army to counter the attacks. His real role with the army is questionable, but his involvement brought reassurance nonetheless. In August 636, he charged down to the Yarmouk River, an eastern tributary of the Jordan River, to fight the Rashidun army at the Battle of Yarmouk. Against the opposing military leader Khalid ibn al-Walid, Trithyrius decided to give the command to Vahan, an Armenian prince, as he felt he was not a formidable army commander. This was to no avail and he died on 20 August 636 on the battlefield at Yarmouk.

This can occur both on consonants and in vowels. A word like educate is one that may exhibit fusion, e.g. or . A merger between two segments can also occur between word boundaries, an example being the phrase got ya being pronounced like gotcha . Most cases of fusion lead to allophonic variation, though some sequences of segments may lead to wholly distinct phonemes. A common form of fusion is found in the development of nasal vowels, which frequently become phonemic when final nasal consonants are lost from a language. This occurred in French and Portuguese. Compare the French words un vin blanc \\"a white wine\\" with their English cognates, one, wine, blank, which retain the n's. Often the resulting sound has the place of articulation of one of the source sounds and the manner of articulation of the other, as in Malay. Vowel coalescence is extremely common. The resulting vowel is often long, and either between the two original vowels in vowel space, as in ‚Üí ‚Üí and ‚Üí ‚Üí in French (compare English day and law ), in Hindi (with ), and in some varieties of Arabic; or combines features of the vowels, as in ‚Üí ‚Üí and ‚Üí ‚Üí . Compensatory lengthening may be considered an extreme form of fusion. Examples Indo-European languages =English= Historically, the alveolar plosives and fricatives have fused with , in a process referred to as yod coalescence. Words like nature and omission have had such consonant clusters, being pronounced like and . Words ending in the Latin-derived suffixes -tion and -sion, such as fiction and mission, are examples that exhibit yod coalescence. This sound change was not, however, distributed evenly. Words like module may be realised as either or . Words that did not experience universal yod coalescence, are always realised as two segments in accents like Received Pronunciation. Most other dialects do pronounce them as one segment, however, like American English. Words with primary stress on a syllable with such a cluster did not experience coalescence either. Examples include tune and assume . Some dialects exhibit coalescence in these cases, where some coalesce only and , while others also coalesce and . In General American, elides entirely when following alveolar consonants, in a process called yod dropping. The previous examples end up as and . Words that have already coalesced are not affect by this. Australian English exhibits yod coalescence to an extreme degree, even when the cluster is in a stressed syllable, though there is some sociolectal variation. In an accent with full yod coalescence, tune and assume are pronounced like and . This can result in homophony between previously distinct words, as between dune and June, which are both pronounced . =Romance languages= Most Romance languages have coalesced sequences of consonants followed by . Sequences of plosives followed by most often became affricates, often being intermediary stages to other manners of articulation. Sonorants in such a sequence (except bilabial consonants) mostly became palatalized. =Greek= During the development of Ancient Greek from Proto-Greek, the labiovelar , , and became , , and . Although the labiovelars were already a single consonant, they had two places of articulation, a velar articulation and labial secondary articulation (). However, the development of labiovelars varies from dialect to dialect, and some may have become dental instead. An example is the word ' \\"cow\\" from Proto-Greek '. A vowel coalescence from Ancient Greek to Koine Greek fused many diphthongs, especially those including . E.g. > ; > ; and > and > . =Celtic languages= Several consonant clusters in Proto-Celtic underwent fusion, most prominently /*…°/ to the following consonant in coda position. Examples include to and to in Old Irish. =North Germanic languages= In Norwegian and Swedish, this process occurs whenever the phoneme is followed by an alveolar consonant. The articulation of the resulting fusion becomes retroflex. Examples include the Norwegian and Swedish . This even occurs across word boundaries, as in the sentence \\"g√•r det bra?\\" becoming . This process will continue for as long as there are more alveolar consonants, though when this amount exceeds four, people usually try to break it up or shorten it, usually by replacing with , or eliding . An extreme example of this would be the word ordensstraff , having six retroflex consonants in a row. In colloquial Norwegian, the sequence /rt/ may even coalesce over non- alveolar phonemes, changing their place of articulation to retroflex, even if /r/ normally wouldn't trigger it. Examples include , , and . This process does not occur across word boundaries, e.g. sterk tann is pronounced and not Solhaug, Tor H. (2010) Retroflexion in Norwegian. University of Troms√∏.

Biography Born in Ashland City, Tennessee. While still a child, his family moved to Louisville, Kentucky. At an early age, he learned to play several musical instruments such as the banjo, piano, fiddle and guitar. He changed his first name to Redd because of his red hair and complexion. His talent was not only as a musician but also as a songwriter beginning by writing a little jingle for a Louisville car dealer's commercial. In 1937, he joined the Golden West Cowboys band headed by Pee Wee King with lead singer Eddy Arnold. Stewart served in the South Pacific in World War II attaining the rank of sergeant. He wrote \\"Soldier's Last Letter\\" while in still in the South Pacific, which became a hit record in 1944 for Ernest Tubb. After he returned to the U.S. he again hooked up with King's band, this time as the lead singer since Arnold went solo. Stewart teamed up with King in writing many top 10 country hits starting with \\"The Tennessee Waltz\\", proclaimed by Governor Frank Clement in 1965 as the Tennessee state song; and \\"You Belong To Me\\". He appeared in several movies with Pee Wee King, including Gold Mine in the Sky (1938), Ridin' the Outlaw Trail (1951) and The Rough, Tough West (1952), the last two starring Charles Starrett as the Durango Kid. In 1961, Redd and King appeared in the movie, Hoedown. In 1950‚Äì51, Stewart signed with King Records as a solo vocalist, though none of his singles were successful. Stewart also wrote songs that would be made famous by other artists. He provided Jim Reeves with \\"That's a Sad Affair\\" (Reeves also did \\"You Belong to Me\\") and Moon Mullican with \\"Downstream\\" and \\"When Love Dies Where Does it Go\\" in the mid 1950s. \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" went on to be a massive hit for Patti Page and was also covered by Roy Acuff, the Louvin Brothers, Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley and many others. \\"You Belong to Me\\" also went on to become a major standard. The lesser known \\"Slow Poke\\" was covered by Hawkshaw Hawkins. In 1972, he was inducted as a charter member into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. On August 2, 2003, Stewart died at 80 at Baptist Hospital East in Louisville from complications of injuries due to a fall in the early 1990s. Legacy In 2004, \\"The Tennessee Waltz\\" was awarded BMI's 3,000,000 Airplay Award. (equivalent to 17.1 years of continuous playing), an honor shared with Barry Manilow's \\"I Write the Songs\\", Frank Sinatra's \\"My Way\\", Hank Williams's \\"Your Cheatin' Heart\\", Elvis Presley's \\"Love Me Tender\\" and Roger Miller's \\"King of the Road\\". In 2004, he was inducted into Country Legends Hall of Fame and the Traditional Country Music Hall of Fame; and in 2005, Tennessee Waltz Parkway opened in his birthplace, Ashland City.

It reaches 6 m in height, has fragrant white flowers, and large green prominently-veined leaves. It grows in sand above the high tide mark. Taxonomy and naming Alternate names in the Cook Islands include Ano, Hano, Fano, and Puapua. The last is also used in Samoa, and the similar Puopua in Tonga. It is known as ' in the Marshall Islands.http://www.trussel2.com/MOD/MED2U.htm#utilomar It was originally described by Carl Linnaeus. The genus was named in honour of the 18th century French naturalist Jean-√âtienne Guettard, while the specific epithet is derived from the Latin speciosus 'showy'. Description It is a perennial shrub or small tree tall by wide with smooth creamy grey bark. The large oval-shaped leaves are long by wide. Dark green and smooth above with prominent paler veins, they are finely hairy underneath. Flowering is from October to May, the fragrant white flowers are long with 4‚Äì9 lobes. These are followed by sweet- smelling globular hard fruit, measuring , which mature September to March. Distribution and habitat Guettarda speciosa is found in coastal habitats in tropical areas around the Pacific Ocean, including the coastline of central and northern Queensland and Northern Territory in Australia, and Pacific Islands, including Micronesia, French Polynesia and Fiji, Malaysia and Indonesia, Maldives and the east coast of Africa. As its name suggests, the beach gardenia grows on beaches and sandy places above the high tide level. Ecology The Mariana Fruit Bat (Pteropus mariannus) feeds on the fruit and flowers, acting as a vector for the dispersal of seeds. Human use Use by indigenous cultures The large leaves were used in various ways by the indigenous people of northern Australia; they could hold food, and when heated, they were given to relieve headaches and aches in limbs. The stems could be used to make Macassan pipes. The flowers were used to scent coconut oil on the Cook Islands, and the wood for dwellings and canoes. Cultivation A very useful plant for seaside planting in tropical climates, it needs a sunny aspect and well-drained soil. It has proven difficult to propagate, as this must be done by seed which may take months to germinate.

It is a rare variety that is restricted to the extreme south-west corner of Western Australia. Description This variety is similar to other varieties of B. sessilis, but has larger leaves; these may be up to six centimetres long and four centimetres wide in this variety, whereas in B. sessilis var. sessilis they are commonly two to three centimetres long. The leaves of this variety are also a darker green than the other varieties, and its flower heads are generally larger. Taxonomy This painting of Dryandra floribunda, which appeared in Curtis's Botanical Magazine in 1813, was attributed to D. floribunda var. major (syn. B. sessilis var. cordata) by George Bentham in 1870. This variety was first published as a variety of Dryandra floribunda (now B. sessilis) by Carl Meissner in the second volume of Plantae Preissianae, published in 1848. It was based on a type specimen collected by James Drummond; this specimen was said to have been collected at the Swan River, where this variety does not now occur. Meissner did not explicitly give an etymology for the varietal epithet, but referred to the leaves as cordatis, Latin for \\"heart-shaped\\", and this is now universally recognised as the source of the name. In 1870, George Bentham published what is now recognised as a synonym of this variety, as D. floribunda var. major. Bentham's taxon was based on a specimen collected at Cape Naturaliste by Augustus Oldfield. He also attributed to this variety a painting of D. floribunda that appeared in Curtis's Botanical Magazine in 1813. Dryandra floribunda having been overturned in favour of Dryandra sessilis in 1924, in 1996 Alex George transferred var. cordata from the former to the latter species. The current name changed again in 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia; thus the variety's current full name is Banksia sessilis var. cordata (Meisn.) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele. Distribution and habitat B. sessilis var. cordata occurs only in the Warren region of the Southwest Botanical Province of Western Australia. It occurs in two disjoint areas: along the west coast between Cape Naturaliste and Cape Leeuwin; and along the south coast between Point D'Entrecasteaux and Denmark. It grows in sand over limestone, amongst coastal heath. Cultivation This variety is little known in cultivation. It is suggested that cultivation requirements would be similar to the better-known B. sessilis var. sessilis, but that this variety would be better suited to cooler, wetter areas. Conservation On the Department of Environment and Conservation's Declared Rare and Priority Flora List, B. sessilis var. cordata is rated \\"Priority 4 - Rare\\", meaning that it has been adequately surveyed, and does not appear to be threatened, even though it is rare.

Harris, p. 250, 2013 reprint, Courier Corporation, , \\"The framing of a door or window by a head composed of a triple keystone and by jambs that are bordered by protruding blocks of stone\\", with that of the Illustrated Dictionary of Building, by Peter Brett: \\"A door surround in the style of the architect James Gibb. It consists of large blocks of stone interrupting the architrave.\\" Some definitions extend to including arches or square openings merely with alternate blocked elements that continue round the top in the same manner as the sides, as in the rectangular windows of the White House's north front basement level.Chitham, 126, who uses this wide definition Though intended for masonry in stone, the motif can be executed in other materials, especially brick, often masked in stucco, wood, or just paint. British vernacular housing of the late 19th century often uses alternating coloured blocks, with little or no projection from the main wall plane, but emphasized by a different colour from the main wall. These can be seen even on small terraced houses, often using cast stone, and used on both the door and ground floor windows. History Gibbs surround is named after the architect James Gibbs, who often used it and popularized it in England, for example at St Martin-in-the-Fields in London. Here the side doors have surrounds with all the details including pediments, while the round-topped windows along the sides have Gibbs surrounds if the broadest definition is used. However, Gibbs certainly did not invent it. The formula can be found in Ancient Roman architecture, and became popular in Renaissance architecture from the early 16th century. Gibbs illustrated a version in his pattern-book A Book of Architecture (1728), though there the blocking stopped at the edge of the architrave. More often the blocking overlies it. This was swiftly plagiarized by rival books such as William Salmon's Palladio Londinensis (1734), which credits Andrea Palladio (d. 1580) with the origin of what Salmon calls a \\"Rustick Window and door\\". The name is mainly used in Britain and other English-speaking countries, where the type was also most popular and long-lasting. As a relatively simple but effective way of ornamenting an opening it was widely used for minor doors or windows in grand buildings, and the main door of more modest ones. The front door of Gibbs' medium-sized country house, Ditchley House, uses the device, which he also used in the Fellows' Building of King's College, Cambridge and Wimpole Hall, Cambridgeshire. A version with columns rather than a moulded architrave was illustrated by Sebastiano Serlio in 1537, where the voussoirs but not the keystone push up past the bottom edge of the pediment. Variations of this style are seen, for example, in the upper-floor windows of Palazzo Thiene in Vicenza (apparently part of the additions by Palladio), where only the keystone breaks into the pediment. The effect of a Gibbs surround is achieved round the doors of the south front of the Petit Trianon by stopping the horizontally banded rustication short in alternate levels. Early examples in America, derived from the many English pattern-books used there, include the Aquia Church in Virginia of the 1750s and St. Paul's Chapel in Manhattan, completed in 1766.

It is located directly at the shores of Lake Wannsee in Berlin. It has been open to public since April 30, 2006 and shows a collection of Liebermann's paintings of his villa and its garden.  History  The Liebermann Villa in summer Garden looking out towards Wannsee In memory of Liebermann at his Berlin villa Max Liebermann Max Liebermann (1847‚Äì1935) was co-founder and head of the Berlin Secession and head of the Prussian Academy of Arts (Preu√üische Akademie der K√ºnste). He was dismissed by the Nazis in 1933 and banned. He painted about 200 paintings of the garden at his villa, some of which are exhibited in his former studio on the upper floor. Villa In 1909, he bought a narrow piece of land with direct access to the shores of Lake Wannsee to escape from the city noise of Berlin. He lived there during the summer, from 1910 on. The villa was built by the architect Paul Otto Baumgarten. Liebermann called it his \\"little castle by the lake\\". It was completed in April, 1910. Garden The lengthy garden is divided in two by the villa itself. From the center of the villa, there is a view over the grass to Lake Wannsee. There is a garden terrace in front of the house, looking toward Wannsee. On one side of the grass, there is the famous birch path, with birch trees growing wherever they sprout. On the other side, there are three hedged gardens. In the rear of the villa, is the garden house and a vegetable plot. Museum Permanent exhibition In the former studio, on the upper floor, there are about 40 paintings related to the garden and the villa. On the ground floor, the history of the Liebermann family and the house are documented, including of how the Nazis forced Liebermann's wife, Martha to sell the villa. The selling price was highly undervalued and in the end, she didn't even get that. Hours before she was due to be deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp, she committed suicide rather than risk death at the hands of the Nazis. Museum's concept The Max-Liebermann- Gesellschaft Berlin e. V. assists the museum in care of the villa and garden and in restoring them to their original state at the time of the Liebermanns' occupancy. Paintings of the garden and villa are presented continuously. A Multimedia Installation by Heiko Daxl and Ingeborg F√ºlepp opens a broader view with historical documents, photographs, sound recordings and films into the 100 years turbulent history of the house and the garden. Visitors can experience the serenity and spirit of the villa as Liebermann did when he lived and painted there.\\"Max Liebermann Villa am Wannsee Berlin\\" in Die Neuen Architekturf√ºhrer, No. 82. 20-page broschure about the museum.

Background  Li Guangbi was born in 708, during the second reign of Emperor Zhongzong. His father, Li Kailuo (ÊùéÊ•∑Ê¥õ), was a general of Khitan ancestry, whose achievements during the Kaiyuan era (713‚Äì741) of Emperor Zhongzong's nephew Emperor Xuanzong eventually led to his creation as the Duke of Ji Commandery. Li Guangbi's mother was Lady Li. Li Guangbi was said to be careful in his behavior when young. He was capable in horsemanship and archery, and also studied the Book of Han. He started his army service when young, and was said to be decisive, strict, and full of strategies. After his father died, he inherited the title of the Duke of Ji, and was praised for not entering his wife's room (i.e., abstaining from sexual relations) during the observation of the mourning period. At the start of Emperor Xuanzong's Tianbao era (742-756), Li Guangbi became the discipline officer at Shuofang Circuit (ÊúîÊñπ, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia). In 746, the military governor (jiedushi) of Shuofang and Hexi (Ê≤≥Ë•ø, headquartered in modern Wuwei, Gansu) Circuits, Wang Zhongsi, made him a commanding general for Hexi Circuit, as well as the commander of Chishui Base (Ëµ§Ê∞¥Ëªç, in modern Wuwei). Li and Geshu Han became the two key generals under Wang, while he was in command of Shuofang and Hexi. Wang often commented, \\"One day, Li Guangbi will have my command,\\" and Li gained a reputation for being a good general. In 747, Li unsuccessfully tried to stop Wang from interfering with a campaign against the Tibetan Empire commanded by the general Dong Yanguang (Ëë£Âª∂ÂÖâ), and when Dong failed, Wang was removed from his post. In 749, he was made the deputy military governor of Hexi, serving under Geshu, and was created the title of Duke of Su Commandery in his own right. In 752, was made the deputy protectorate general at Chanyu (ÂñÆ‰∫é, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). In 755, An Sishun, then the military governor of Shuofang, requested him as deputy. An was impressed by him and wanted to give a daughter to him in marriage, but Li declined and feigned an illness in order to resign and return to the capital Chang'an under Geshu's assistance.  During Anshi Rebellion  In winter 755, An Lushan, the military governor of Fanyang Circuit (ËåÉÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Beijing), rebelled, and quickly proceeded south toward the Tang eastern capital Luoyang. Emperor Xuanzong recalled An Sishun, who was An Lushan's cousin, to Chang'an, and gave the military governorship of Shuofang to Guo Ziyi. He also asked Guo's recommendation on whom to entrust Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and Guo recommended Li Guangbi. In spring 756, Emperor Xuanzong made Li the military governor of Hedong and had him and Guo advance from Shuofang east, intending to capture An Lushan's territory north of the Yellow River. Li quickly advanced and captured most of Changshan Commandery (Â∏∏Â±±, roughly modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). When An's general Shi Siming counterattacked, Guo rendezvoused with him and together, they fought Shi off, and subsequently, they cut off the communications between Luoyang (which An had captured and where he had declared himself emperor of a new state of Yan) and Fanyang. An, fearing that his army's morale would be destroyed, considered leaving Luoyang and returning north to battle Li and Guo himself. Map of An Shi Rebellion with Li Guangbi's military movement Meanwhile, though, another Yan army, commanded by his general Cui Qianyou (Â¥î‰πæÁ•ê), approached Tong Pass, defended by Geshu Han, and was pretending to be weak in order to draw an attack from Geshu. Geshu, Li, and Guo all recommended to Emperor Xuanzong that the forces under him continue to hold at Tong Pass and not attack Cui, while waiting for Li and Guo to capture Fanyang first to destroy Yan forces' morale. However, the chancellor Yang Guozhong, fearing that Geshu's intentions were actually to start a coup and overthrow him, recommended that Emperor Xuanzong order Geshu to attack Cui. Emperor Xuanzong did so over Geshu's objections, and Geshu was defeated by Cui, who captured Geshu and then Tong Pass. He then approached Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to abandon it and flee to Chengdu and Emperor Xuanzong's crown prince Li Heng to flee to Lingwu (the headquarters of Shuofang), where he was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong). Meanwhile, Li and Guo heard only of the news that Tong Pass had fallen, but did not know what had happened afterwards, and they decided to withdraw back west of the Taihang Mountains. Later, when Emperor Suzong sent emissaries to call them to Lingwu, they went to Lingwu. Emperor Suzong gave him the additional honorary chancellorAs Li Guangbi never assumed the responsibilities of chancellor at the central imperial administration, he was not usually considered an actual chancellor by traditional historians. See, e.g., New Book of Tang, vol. 62 [table of chancellors, part 2]. title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã) and had him return to Taiyuan (the headquarters of Hedong) with 5,000 soldiers, leaving the rest of his soldiers at Lingwu in anticipation of a campaign to recapture Chang'an. When Li arrived at Taiyuan, he, who was angry that the official Cui Zhong (Â¥îÁúæ) had disrespected the prior military governor Wang Chengye (ÁéãÊâøÊ•≠) when relieving Wang, found an excuse to kill Cui, and this shocked the army, causing the entire army to be fearful of him. In spring 757, Shi, knowing that Li had left most of his troops at Lingwu and believing that Taiyuan's defenses were weak, took 100,000 men to Taiyuan and put it under siege. Li, however, defended the city capably and repeatedly repelled assaults on the city's defenses. Around the same time, An Lushan was assassinated and succeeded by his son An Qingxu, who ordered Shi to return to Fanyang and leave Cai Xide (Ëî°Â∏åÂæ∑) to continue to siege Taiyuan, although Li was then able to defeat Cai, forcing Cai to lift the siege and retreat. After this victory, Emperor Suzong created him the Duke of Wei, and later changed the title to Duke of Zheng. Around the new year 758, after Emperor Suzong recaptured Chang'an from Yan forces, he gave Li the title of Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫), one of the Three Excellencies. Meanwhile, Tang and Huige forces had also captured Luoyang, forcing An Qingxu to flee to Yecheng, but most of his generals submitted to Tang, leaving him only with control of the region around Yecheng. Shi, in control of Fanyang and surrounding regions, also submitted to Tang, and was made a Tang general. However, Li believed that Shi would eventually rebel again anyway, and persuaded Emperor Suzong to have Shi's associate Wu Cheng'en (ÁÉèÊâøÊÅ©) assassinate him and take over the region himself. When Shi realized this, he killed Wu and submitted a petition demanding that Emperor Suzong kill Li. Emperor Suzong disavowed any knowledge on his part or Li's and tried to placate Shi, but Shi then rebelled again.The Song dynasty historian Hu Sanxing, however, doubted that Emperor Suzong and Li actually were plotting to kill Shi, pointing out that there were a number of implausibilities in the alleged plot by Wu -- including an alleged order from Li that, after Wu succeeds, he should execute all of Shi's main generals. He thus believed that Shi made up the plot as an excuse to rebel and forged the order to get the other generals to go along with him. See Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 53. In fall 758, Li went to Chang'an to visit Emperor Suzong and was given the additional title of Shizhong (‰æç‰∏≠) as honorary chancellor. Soon thereafter, he and several other key commanders, including Guo, Lu Jiong (È≠ØÁÇÖ), Li Huan (ÊùéÂ•ê), Xu Shuji (Ë®±ÂèîÂÜÄ), Li Siye, Ji Guangchen (Â≠£Âª£Áêõ), Cui Guangyuan (Â¥îÂÖâÈÅ†), Dong Qin, and Wang Sili (ÁéãÊÄùÁ¶Æ), rendezvoused at Yecheng to put An Qingxu under siege. Because both Li Guangbi and Guo had great contributions, Emperor Suzong did not make either of them the overall commander of the forces, but commissioned the eunuch Yu Chao'en to serve as the surveyor of the troops. During the siege, Li Guangbi suggested launching an all-out assault on Yecheng's defenses, but Yu opposed, and such an assault was not carried out. Faced with a siege that he could not fight out of, An Qingxu sought aid from Shi Siming, who led an army south from Fanyang and engaged Tang forces in spring 759, and during the middle of the battle, both Tang forces and Shi's forces panicked and scattered‚Äîwith most of Tang forces completely scattering and pillaging the surrounding areas before fleeing back to their own circuits, with the exception of Li Guangbi and Wang, who were able to gather their forces and withdraw. In fall 759, with Yu blaming Guo for the collapse, Emperor Suzong transferred the command of the Shuofang troops that Guo commanded to Li Guangbi. With Guo's command style being far more relaxed than Li Guangbi's strict style, the Shuofang army was initially displeased, and the general Zhang Yongji (ÂºµÁî®Êøü) considered forcibly ejecting Li Guangbi and demanding Guo's restoration; when Li Guangbi found out, he arrested and executed Zhang. Li Guangbi was also made the deputy supreme commander of the armed forces and in effect in command of the entire Tang army command structure, as the supreme commander was Emperor Suzong's son Li Xi (Êùé‰øÇ) the Prince of Zhao, whose title was honorary. Soon thereafter, Shi, who had killed An Qingxu and declared himself the new emperor of Yan, advanced south. Li Guangbi, judging that Luoyang was not defendable, ordered that Luoyang be evacuated, instead taking position in the Heyang (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ) area, near Luoyang. Shi entered Luoyang, but subsequently with Li Guangbi defending Heyang, was unable to advance for some time toward Chang'an, as Li Guangbi repeatedly defeated his attacking forces, and was continuing to bog Li Guangbi's forces down in the Heyang region. In spring 760, Emperor Suzong gave Li Guangbi the honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§) and the title of Taiwei (Â§™Â∞â), also one of the Three Excellencies. By spring 761, however, Yu and Pugu Huai'en, now in command of the Shuofang forces, were advocating that a campaign be launched to recapture Luoyang, and despite Li Guangbi's opposition, Emperor Suzong ordered Li Guangbi to attack Luoyang. Li Guangbi, despite his reluctance, thus advanced toward Chang'an with Pugu, Yu, and Wei Boyu (Ë°õ‰ºØÁéâ). He and Pugu, however, disagreed in regards to camp formation, with him wanting to put the camp in the hills and Pugu wanting to do so in the plains. Yan forces thus took advantage and launched a major attack on them, thoroughly routing Tang forces. All of the Tang generals, including Li Guangbi, Pugu, Yu, and Wei all fled. Li Baoyu (ÊùéÊä±Áéâ), whom Li Guangbi had left at Heyang, also abandoned Heyang, and Heyang fell into Yan hands. (Soon after the Yan victory, however, Shi was assassinated and succeeded by his own son Shi Chaoyi, and Yan forces were unable to take advantage of the victory over Tang forces.) Li Guangbi requested a demotion, and he was demoted to the honorary title of Kaifu Yitong Sansi (ÈñãÂ∫úÂÑÄÂêå‰∏âÂè∏) and the honorary chancellor of title of Shizhong, and was made the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), but almost immediately again made Taiwei again and made the deputy supreme commander, but only of the Henan region (i.e., area south of the Yellow River). Emperor Suzong also had him take over the commands of the expeditionary forces from the Huai River and Yangtze River region, taking up position at Linhuai (Ëá®Ê∑Æ, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), with Shi Chaoyi seeking to expand toward the southeast. Once he arrived at his post, Li Guangbi was able to lift the siege that Yan forces were putting on Songzhou, stopping Yan advances in the region. Moreover, several Tang generals who had been staying in the region and not reporting to their proper posts‚ÄîTian Shengong (Áî∞Á•ûÂäü), Shang Heng (Â∞öË°°), and Yin Zhongqing (ÊÆ∑‰ª≤Âçø), fearing LI Guangbi, soon reported to their posts. Emperor Suzong created Li Guangbi the Prince of Linhuai. Li Guangbi himself took up position at Xu Prefecture (ÂæêÂ∑û, roughly modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) and made it his headquarters. He also sent an army to defeat the rebellion of Yuan Chao (Ë¢ÅÊôÅ), who had captured Tai Prefecture (Ëá∫Â∑û, roughly modern Taizhou, Zhejiang) and surrounding prefectures. In winter 762, by which time Emperor Suzong had died and had been succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong, with Tang forces converging on Luoyang to try to recapture it from Shi Chaoyi, Li Guangbi headed toward Luoyang, with Pugu and Huige forces heading east as well, joined by the generals Guo Ying'ai (ÈÉ≠Ëã±‰πÇ) and Li Baoyu. The joint Tang and Huige forces defeated Shi Chaoyi, forcing him to abandon Luoyang and flee north. Shi Chaoyi committed suicide in flight in spring 763, ending the Anshi Rebellion.  After Anshi Rebellion  Meanwhile, though, because Li Guangbi feared false accusations from Yu Chao'en and another eunuch, Cheng Yuanzhen, he was refusing to visit Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Daizong. His fears grew after another general, Lai Tian (‰æÜÁë±), was ordered to commit suicide due to Cheng's accusations. Even when Tibetan forces attacked Chang'an in fall 763, causing Emperor Daizong to briefly abandon Chang'an, Li Guangbi refused to come to the aid of the emperor. In order to try to please Li Guangbi, Emperor Daizong had Li Guangbi's stepmother, to whom he was very devoted, brought to Chang'an and treated with great respect, while giving Li Guangbi's brother Li Guangjin (ÊùéÂÖâÈÄ≤) partial command of the imperial guards and creating Li Guangjin the Duke of Liang, but these actions did not affect Li Guangbi. When Emperor Daizong put him in charge of Luoyang in summer 764, he declined to go to Luoyang, but continued to stay in Xu Prefecture. Li Guangbi had been well known for his military discipline, but after he repeatedly declined to follow imperial directives, his reputation fell, and many subordinate generals in the region began to disobey Li Guangbi as well, causing him to be embarrassed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 223. He grew ill and died in fall 764. His casket was returned to Chang'an and buried with great honors. The Song dynasty historian Ouyang Xiu, in his New Book of Tang, commented about Li Guangbi:New Book of Tang, vol. 136 .

Zion returnees) refers to the event in the biblical books of Ezra‚ÄìNehemiah in which the Jews returned to the Land of Israel from the Babylonian exile following the decree by the emperor Cyrus the Great, the conqueror of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BCE, also known as Cyrus's edict. The term was first coined after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. The biblical meaning of the return to Zion, aliyah, was borrowed later from the ancient event and was adopted as the definition of all the immigration events of Jews to the Land of Israel and the State of Israel in modern times. Babylonian exile The Neo-Babylonian Empire under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar II occupied the Kingdom of Judah between 597‚Äì586 BCE. The Babylonian army, under the command of Nebuzaradan,Jewish Virtual Library, Nebuzaradan, Retrieved 3 March 2010 had destroyed the first temple in Jerusalem. According to the Hebrew Bible, the king of Judah, Zedekiah, was forced to watch his own two sons being slaughtered, and thereafter, his own eyes were put out and he was exiled to Babylon (2 Kings 25).2 Kings 25 at chabad.org The population of the middle class and above was also deported alongside king Zedekiah, whereas the kingdom of Judah was left only with the poor ones. (2 Kings 24:14) The deportees were led by Sheshbazzar, also named the prince of Judah, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, a descendant of King David. Sheshbazzar, who was probably Shenazzar the son of Jeconiah, king of Judah (), was picked by Cyrus to lead the deportees, but Zerubbabel was appointed shortly afterwards as a representative of the Achaemenid Empire in the Land of Israel (although some claim Zerubbabel and Sheshbazzar were the same person).

Initially, around 50,000 Jews made aliyah to the land of Israel following the decree of Cyrus as described in Ezra, whereas most remained in Babylon.Ezra 2:64‚Äì65http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/jews.htm , the \\"population\\" section of this article estimates a pre-exilic population of 1.8 million in Israel and Judah combined. referenced on 6/26/2018. Later, an unknown number of exiles returned from Babylon with Ezra himself.Ezra 8:1‚Äì32 The return of the deportees to Judah during the next 110 years is known as the return to Zion, an event by which Jews ever since have been inspired. Yehud Medinata The returnees settled in what became known as Yehud Medinata or Yehud. Yehud Medinata was a self-governing Jewish province under the rule of the Achaemenid Empire which even issued their own Yehud coinage inscribed with the three letters Y-H-D. The autonomy of Yehud Medinata inspired future generations of Jews, their notion of their own national identity and aspirations, the need to end 2000 years of exile since the Babylon captivity, and to continue to make aliyah to the Land of Israel. The ancient name Yehud Medinata also resembles the name of modern Hebrew name Medinat Yisrael (the State of Israel). Biblical account According to the books of Ezra‚ÄìNehemiah in the Hebrew Bible, the return to Zion occurred in several waves of aliyah.  Sheshbazzar's Aliyah Cyrus restoring the vessels of the temple, by Gustave Dor√© Sheshbazzar's aliyah (those claiming that Zerubbabel and Sheshbazzar were the same person, associate Sheshbazzar's aliyah with Zerubbabel's Aliyah), had occurred near after Cyrus's Decree, in 538 BCE. Approximately 1,000 young Jews made aliya in what became known as Sheshbazzar's Aliyah, out of the notion to redeem the land of Israel from its ruins and to re-establish the holy temple on the Temple Mount. This aliyah was named after its leader Sheshbazzar because most scholars have agreed that he is a descendant of the house of Jeconiah, king of Judah. The Book of Ezra depicts Sheshbazzar's Aliyah as a consent and encouragement of the Persian King Cyrus:  Zerubbabel's Aliyah  The second wave of aliyah, known as Zerubbabel's Aliyah, was led by Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, the grandson of Jeconiah, king of Judah, and a descendant of the house of David as well as Joshua the son of Jehozadak who was appointed as high priest (Kohen Gadol), in 538 BCE. According to the account in the Book of Ezra, 42,360, not including servants or handmaids, made aliyah in this wave to Jerusalem and Judah. Among them, there were 24,144 ordinary men (57.12%) and 12,452 women and children (29.46%). There were also 4,289 priests (10.15%), 74 generic Levites (0.18%), 128 Singers (0.3%), 139 Gatekeepers (0.33%) (Singers and gatekeepers were specific roles of Levites in the holy temple in Jerusalem that had been passed from one generation to another), 392 Nethinim (0.93%), and 652 people who could not tell their fathers' houses and their ancestry (1.54%). 90 other people (0.21%) appear to have joined in, to complete that count of 42,360. In addition 7,337 servants and handmaids joined in, boosting the population to 49,697. They also brought up their working animals: 736 horses (one for about every 68 people), 246 mules (one for every 202 people), 435 camels (one per 114 people), and 6,720 donkeys (one for every 7 people). A smaller portion of this wave of aliyah was well-born, possibly one-sixth of the returnees, whereas the rest were of a lower class and poor. The returnees in this aliyah were of the Tribe of Judah, Tribe of Levi and the Tribe of Benjamin, and settled in their cities and places from before the destruction of the first temple, Solomon's Temple, as many of them kept scribed documents indicating their land tenure status of land ownership in various places. Due to the return of many single men, and the lack of Jewish single women, a phenomenon of mixed marriages with alien women developed. This wave of aliyah had been on good terms with the Persian government, which allowed them religious autonomy. However, the economic situation was not well ‚Äì there was a lack of infrastructures due to the consecutive ruins in the aftermath of the destruction of the First Temple, taxes and many housing needs, as well as consecutive years of harsh drought and other natural disasters that hit the land of Israel. At those times the Jews reinstituted the sacrificial offerings to God with the re-establishment of the altar in 538 BCE (◊õ\\"◊î ◊ë◊õ◊°◊ú◊ï, ◊©◊†◊™ ◊í'◊®◊õ\\"◊ë). This event was prior to the reconstruction of the newly emerging temple in Jerusalem, which restored the status of Jerusalem as the heart and soul of the Jewish people. The Samaritans made proposals for co-operation in the work, but their proposals were declined. Consequently the Jews suffered some harassment at the hands of the Samaritans. Despite the disruptions and delays the returnees managed to complete the construction of the holy temple in Jerusalem in 516 BCE. Ezra's Aliyah The third aliyah was led by Ezra the scribe, in 458 BCE. Around 5,000 Jews were in this wave of returnees. The Talmud mentions that Ezra was delayed in making aliyah to the Land of Israel because he had to stay alongside his Rabbi, Baruch ben Neriah, a disciple of Jeremiah and one of the leading figures among Jews, but too old and weak to travel to the Land of Israel.Babylonian Talmud: Order Moed, Tractate Megillah 16b Megilah PDF in English on page 65 of 127, (last paragraph before footnotes), see last footnote on next page also. The situation was not easy at the time in the Land of Israel in many ways. The economic burden of heavy taxes was tough for the Jews there. Politically the harassment from various enemies had increased, and they even managed to influence the Persian government to order the stopping of the construction works of refortification of Jerusalem's city walls. Religiously, the mixed marriage was a spreading phenomenon that was perceived as a major threat to the culture and the future of the Jews as a nation. Ezra made aliyah in order to improve the situation for the Jews in the Land of Israel, and indeed began a series of initiatives upon his arrival in Jerusalem, that was to influence the life of the Jews there and the days of the Second Temple. Ezra made aliyah with an official approval of the Persian government and license to take out all donated money from exiled Jews and government officials to the holy temple and Jews living in Israel. He was also permitted to transfer holy vessels to the Temple in Jerusalem, and a decree was given to the government treasurers to allocate them with money, wheat, wine and oil. In addition, all which served in the holy temple, the priests, Levites and Nethinims were given tax exemption, and Ezra was authorized to appoint magistrates and judges and to teach the law of God to the people of Israel, as well as the authority to impose penalties of confiscation, banishment or execution, if needed. Along with other scholars, Ezra established the Great Assembly, which served as the highest authority of deciders on the Halakha in cases of religious laws and as a body of leaders to the nation of Israel. In addition, he served in the temple as the high priest. Ezra decided on many regulations of the religious laws, Takanat Chachamim, with the purpose of resuming public order in the aftermath of the destruction of the First Temple and the Babylonian exile. Notably, strengthening Jewish relationship to Torah, strengthening Jewish identity, and preventing assimilation. In that conjunction, he revolutionized the usage of the Hebrew alphabet.  Nehemiah's Aliyah The fourth aliyah was led by Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah, in 445 BCE. Prior to that, he served as the royal cupbearer to the king of Persia and as Man of the Great Assembly. It is not clear how many returnees joined him, but the Book of Nehemiah depicts a strong army escort supplied by the king. Nehemiah requested a temporary leave of absence to go to Judah in order to rebuild Jerusalem and repair its city walls and his request was approved by the king. For this purpose, he was given permission to cut down woods and was escorted by the army. Nehemiah divided the construction work into 42 groups of families; each was responsible for its own district. Since Nehemiah found out in advance about the plan of Judah's enemies to come together and wage war against Jerusalem and to wreak destruction, each group would be building and watching at the same time; and thus he managed to prevent it, \\"The builders of the wall and the carriers of the loads were loading, with one hand doing the work and one holding the sword\\" (Nehemiah 4:11). In order to ensure the security of Jerusalem, he ordered the builders to lodge overnight in Jerusalem and to blow the horns immediately, when needed. Due to the economic distress that the people of Israel were under, Nehemiah faced a public crisis during the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem. Nehemiah heard the Jewish people's complaints and got angry at the Jewish nobles and officials for taking advantage of the crisis to make money off the poor Jews, especially those serving in the holy temple that were tax exempt, whereas the rest of the people of Israel were feeling the economic burden of heavy taxes by the Persian government. Nehemiah assembled a public hearing and contended with the nobles of Judah. He urged them to restore to the poor their fields and houses and relinquish their loans, and in order to set a personal example, he was the first to follow his own steps, proclaiming that he and his close associates would forgo their debts. He managed to get their assurances on this matter, but did not settle with their assurances and put them under oath that they should do according to this promise. On the twenty-fifth day of the month of Elul, 52 days after the work began, the whole wall was completed. Jews from all classes had taken part in the reconstruction work that provided the poor Jews with livelihood and payments. After twelve years in the Land of Israel, he kept his promise and returned to Persia to the service of his royal master, but due to the deteriorating security, religious and social conditions in the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem in 431 BCE, escorted by the army. He acted with decisiveness upon his return. He ousted Tobiah the Ammonite who settled himself inside the holy temple and placed back the Levites. He stopped commerce on the sabbath day and acted against mixed marriage that evolved during his absence. In that conjunction, he drove out the grandson of the high priest for his own mixed marriage. In Nehemiah's time, Jerusalem's Jewish population had grown considerably. Cyrus cylinder The biblical Book of Ezra includes two texts said to be decrees of Cyrus the Great allowing the deported Jews to return to their homeland after decades and ordering the Temple rebuilt. The differences in content and tone of the two decrees, one in Hebrew and one in Aramaic, have caused some scholars to question their authenticity. The Cyrus Cylinder, an ancient tablet on which is written a declaration in the name of Cyrus referring to restoration of temples and repatriation of exiled peoples, has often been taken as corroboration of the authenticity of the biblical decrees attributed to Cyrus, but other scholars point out that the cylinder's text is specific to Babylon and Mesopotamia and makes no mention of Judah or Jerusalem. Professor Lester L Grabbe asserted that the \\"alleged decree of Cyrus\\" regarding Judah, \\"cannot be considered authentic\\", but that there was a \\"general policy of allowing deportees to return and to re-establish cult sites\\". He also stated that archaeology suggests that the return was a \\"trickle\\" taking place over decades, rather than a single event.

Population  =Official censuses= According to the French census there was 8,000 Turks living in France in 1968, this had increased to 51,000 in 1975, 123,000 in 1982, 198,000 in 1990, and 208,000 in 1999.. The French censuses only collect data based on the country of birth, therefore, these figures only identify the number of Turkish immigrants from Turkey and does not include the children of immigrants born in France who are recorded as \\"French\\" rather than \\"Turkish\\".. Furthermore, the Turkish population would be greater if naturalised citizens and illegal emigrants were also taken into account.. Turkish communities who have emigrated to France from other countries, such as Algeria (Turco-Algerians), Bulgaria (Bulgarian Turks), Cyprus (Turkish Cypriots) and Tunisia (Turco-Tunisians), are recorded according to their country of origin rather than their Turkish ethnicity. =Estimated population= In the early 2000s academics placed the Turkish population at approximately 500,000.. Since the 2010s, immigration flows from Turkey have been increasing faster than flows from Algeria and Morocco. The Turkish population increases by approximately 20,000 each year, although in 2013 it increased a further 35,000. In 2014 the L'Express estimated that there was 800,000 Turks living in France. The Fransa Diyanet ƒ∞≈üleri T√ºrk ƒ∞slam Birliƒüi suggests that the actual Turkish population in France is about 1 million, including descendants. The Armenian Weekly has also stated that \\"there are also about a million French people of Turkish origin\\". There is also a minority of Algerian Turks living in France who number in their thousands.  Birth rates  Although the birth rates among Turks living in France has declined over the years they remain substantially higher than the French population. In 1982, the average number of children for Turks was 5.2, compared with 1.8 for the French population. By 1990, the average number of births for Turks was 3.7 compared to 1.7 for the French population..  Culture  Language In 2000, Akƒ±ncƒ± and Jisa found that Turkish is spoken exclusively at home by 77% of families, while 68% of children speak French to one another.. Turkish children are monolingual in the Turkish language until they start school at the age of 2 or 3; thus, they find themselves in everyday situations in which they have to speak French with their peers.. By the age of 10, most children become dominant in the French language.. Nonetheless, even for those who use French more than Turkish in their daily lives, numerous studies have shown that they still emphasize the importance of Turkish as the language of the family, particularly for raising children.. Thus, there is a high degree of language maintenance in the Turkish community; frequent holidays to Turkey, the easy access and use of Turkish media, and the density of social networks help maintain their language.. A Turkish mosque in Nantes. Religion The majority of Turks adhere to Islam and focus on creating their own mosques and schools, most of which are tightly linked to Turkey. Thus, Turks worship their religion mainly with others within their community.. Due to Turkish immigrants having a strong link to the Turkish state and much less knowledge of the French language, compared to other Muslim immigrants who have emigrated from French-speaking countries, Turks tend to build mosques where sermons are given in Turkish rather than French or Arabic.. The Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs (Dƒ∞Tƒ∞B), which is a branch of the Turkish state Bureau of Religious Affairs (the Diyanet), promotes a \\"Turkish Islam\\" which is based upon a moderate, rational Islam of a secular state.. The Diyanet has organic links to the \\"Coordination Committee of Muslim Turks in France\\", or CCMTF, (). which brings under its umbrella a total of 210 mosques.. Its major competing network of mosques is run by the Mill√Æ G√∂r√º≈ü movement () which emphasizes the importance of solidarity of the community over integration into French society. The Mill√Æ G√∂r√º≈ü has an estimated 70 mosques in France. Integration A Turkish kebab shop in Paris The Turkish community is considered to be the least integrated immigrant community in France, largely due to their strong attachment to their country of origin.. However, there is increasing recognition by Turkish officials that without successful integration the immigrant community cannot lobby for the home country. For example, in 2010, the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan stressed that assimilation is different from integration and urged the Turkish community in France to integrate by applying for French citizenship.  Naturalisation  Discrimination Discrimination against Turks in French society is seen particularly within the labour market when they are looking for jobs. Given a choice between a Turkish and a French with the same qualifications, French employers tend not to choose the immigrant applicant...  Organisations and associations  *Comit√© de coordination des musulmans turcs de France, the coordination committee for Turkish Muslims in France is linked to Turkey. *\\"Fransa T√ºrk Federasyonu\\", the French Turks Federation. *\\"Migrations et cultures de Turquie\\" (ELELE), promote knowledge of Turkish immigration and helps to assist the integration of Turkish migrants into French society. *\\"Le Groupement des Entrepreneurs Franco-Turcs\\" (FATIAD), the leading business association created by Turks living in France. *R√©seau Pro'Actif, A professional network created by second and third generations of Turks in France. It gathers graduates of the country's leading universities.  Notable people  Notable French Turks  Notable French Algerian-Turks Some Algerians with Turkish origins have contributed to the arts, sports and politics in France. For example, Nafissa Sid-Cara, who was the first female minister to serve in the French Fifth Republic as well as the first ever Muslim woman to serve as a minister in a French government,. was born into a family of Turkish origin which had been established in Algeria;. her brother Ch√©rif Sid Cara was also a notable politician and doctor. Other notable French politicians of Algerian-Turkish origin include Mourad Kaouah. who served as the deputy of Algiers from 1958 to 1962 - being the only French Muslim deputy at the time. Notable writers include Moroccan-born Le√Øla Chellabi whose father was an Algerian Turk who obtained French citizenship;. Mustapha Haciane was born in Algeria into a Turkish family and currently resides in Paris;. and Le√Øla Sebbar is paternally of Turkish origin through her grandmother. There are also several notable sportsman of Algerian-Turkish origin, including the former pole vaulter and Olympian Patrick Abada. as well as footballers Benjamin Stambouli and Mustapha Stambouli. Numerous sources claim that the actress Isabelle Adjani is paternally of Algerian-Turkish origin.

The village is in the civil parish of West Drayton. Markham Moor lies on the junction between the A1, A638 and A57 roads. The village was on the route of the old Great North Road and was also traditionally part of the East Markham parish.  Markham Moor junction  Markham Moor has a junction in the middle of the village which links the A1 between London and Edinburgh, the A638 to Retford and the A57 to Lincoln. Previously, this junction was a simple roundabout, but as part of junction improvements by the Highways Agency between Blyth in Nottinghamshire and Peterborough, the junction changed to the current two level junction, with one roundabout at the north end for the A57 and A638, and another roundabout on the south side for the B1164 Great North Road to Tuxford. Both roundabouts are connected by a flyover. A public inquiry was launched into the improvements in 2006 after a number of objections, the majority from the nearby village of Elkesley. The objectors were concerned with the timing of the improvements and increased traffic flow on the A1 which bypasses Elkesley. The upgraded junction was completed in October 2008.

The first Olympia‚Äôs Tour was in 1909, with three stages and one rest day. The second in 1910 went to Maastricht and Groningen. It was 17 years before the third race, partly because races on public roads were forbidden in the Netherlands during the First World War. An international field with 16 Germans, the champions of Switzerland and Luxembourg and around 40 Dutch riders left the Rembrandtplein on 17 August 1927. The Dutch were mainly amateurs, the Germans sponsored riders who rode for bicycle manufacturers such as Opel and Diamant which provided material and a support team. The German Rudolf Wolke won after four stages and 800 kilometres ahead of Janus Braspennincx. It was the last race until 1955. The race resumed on 17 June 1955, with 93 riders leaving Stadionplein in Amsterdam South for a stage of 212 km to Hoogeveen. The race was a battle until the end, when 26-year-old Piet Kooyman won. After 1955 the race was held every year except 2001, when it was stopped by a foot-and-mouth disease crisis. Some winners have become successful professionals.

The Gerechtigkeitsgasse and its buildings are a heritage site of national significanceSwiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance (1995), p. 103. and part of the UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site that encompasses the Old City.

It is the eastern half and the oldest part of the central East-West axis of the city's oldest neighbourhood, the Z√§hringerstadt, built right after the founding of the city in 1191.Hofer, 66, Caviezel et al., 163. It continues to the west as the Kramgasse after being crossed by the Kreuzgasse. In the west, the Gerechtigkeitsgasse bifurcates as it enters the Nydegg neighbourhood: the Nydeggstalden leads to the Untertorbr√ºcke, and the Nydeggasse to the more recent Nydeggbr√ºcke. Several narrow alleys and passageways connect the Kramgasse to the parallel Postgasse in the north and the Junkerngasse in the south. The Gerechtigkeitsgasse cannot be reached by car without a special permit. It is accessible by foot or bike or by means of the Bernmobil bus line no. 12 that runs through it and stops at either end of the street (Rathaus and Nydegg). Both sides of the street are covered with Lauben, stone arcades that protect pedestrians from inclement weather. History The Gerechtigkeitsgasse was the main street of the town at the time of its founding. With its original width of around , reduced to after the construction of the arcades, it also served as the central marketplace of medieval Bern.Hofer, 66; Caviezel et al., 163. For this reason, the Gerechtigkeitsgasse and the Kramgasse together were called the M√§ritgasse (Swiss German for \\"Market Alley\\") until the 16th century.Caviezel et al., 163. After that time, the markets moved west towards the Zytglogge, and the street came to be called by der Gerechtigkeit (\\"near [Lady] Justice\\"), in reference to the fountain installed in 1543.Hofer, 67 Only in 1798 was the street officially renamed Gerechtigkeitsgasse.Caviezel et al., 163 The meat and bread stalls, the tannery and most guilds also moved out of the street between 1450 and 1550 as it gradually became a residential area mainly for the ruling noble families.Hofer, 68 The urban tribunal with its pillory and judge's chair made of stone remained located in the street near the Kreuzgasse significantly longer. On the eastern end, the streetscape was altered by the slighting of Nydegg Castle in 1270, the demolition of other fortifications until 1405 and several excavations of the roadbed until 1764 to reduce the street's downward slope.Hofer, 69‚Äì70; Caviezel et al., 163. In 2005, the street was thoroughly renovated and its cobblestone pavement replaced. The city ditch (Stadtbach) running through the middle of the street since medieval times is now visible again through metal gratings.Caviezel et al., 163‚Äì4. Buildings No. 52 No. 40; the floor of the arcades is at the level of the original roadbed. The architectural history of the Gerechtigkeitsgasse is mostly not recorded until 1600.Hofer, 72 The oldest dated house is no. 60, built in 1531 by Hans Franz N√§geli. Roughly half the buildings bear the imprint of the late 16th century. Renaissance architecture and the early Baroque touched the outside of the buildings only lightly. As in the Kramgasse, two thirds of the houses received new fa√ßades until 1780, reshaping most of the eastern and central part of the street in the image of the late Baroque. Unlike other streets, no substantial changes were made to the streetscape since; a project to demolish five houses in 1954 was prevented by exceptionally broad public opposition, receiving international support.Hofer, 72‚Äì73 House no. 7, the Goldener Adler (\\"Golden Eagle\\"), is Bern's oldest hostel and tavern. It was first recorded in 1489 as Weisses Kreuz; the building is a 1764 construction by N. Hebler. The eagle head holding the inn sign is one of the chief works of this type in Switzerland.Caviezel et al., 164. No. 40 is Bern's most expansive urban palais; it is exemplary for the insertion of a French h√¥tel in the medieval cityscape.Caviezel et al., 165. It was built in 1743 by Albrecht St√ºrler for Alexander von Wattenwyl and was the site of the surrender of the Helvetic government to French troops on 18 September 1802. No. 42 is the first certain work of St√ºrler, who was 28 years old when designing it in 1734 for Niklaus Jenner.Berchtold Weber: Historisch-Topografisches Lexikon der Stadt Bern, Bern, 2016 House no. 33 is significant as a principal work of Bernese manierism with one of the best R√©gence fa√ßades and Louis XV interior.Caviezel et al., 166. It was built in 1608 by Andres Widmer and the exterior was reshaped by T√ºrler in 1740. No. 52, built 1730, is considered to be Niklaus Spr√ºngli's best town house. No. 56, a rather simple 1730 R√©gence house, is noted for its exceptional door knocker. No. 62 houses the Kl√∂tzlikeller restaurant. Established in 1632, it is the last of originally more than 200 cellar taverns of Bern.Caviezel et al., 168. No. 79, the Gesellschaftshaus zum Distelzwang, built 1703 by Samuel Jenner, is a principal work of early Baroque architecture in Bern.Caviezel et al., 169.

History  Located midway between the stations at Woodford & Hinton and Helmdon near the village of Moreton Pinkney, this name could not be used because there was already a station with this name by the village served by the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway, built 26 years earlier, in 1873. Instead, the name of the next nearest significant village was chosen, \\"Culworth\\". A year after opening, a branch was built between nearby Woodford Halse and Banbury and in 1913, a small station was added on the western edge of Culworth, which had to be named \\"Eydon Road Halt\\".  Services  The two stations near Culworth and the surrounding villages and hamlets lay on different lines and served different purposes. And it has to be said, that with such obliquely given names, there were mix-ups. Culworth station only catered for the smaller stations on the north‚Äìsouth axis, including the neighbouring town of Brackley: for more distant destinations, a change had to be made at Woodford & Hinton or Brackley. Eydon Road Halt station on the Banbury Branch was used to reach the larger town of Banbury or the village of Woodford Halse - at either of which a connection could be made with trains running further afield. Operationally, the traffic at Culworth was of the rural kind and relatively light. For passengers, only the Ordinary Passenger trains called; expresses passed through non-stop. The goods traffic was handled by pick-up trains between Woodford & Hinton and Quainton Road or Marylebone. As both traffics declined, Culworth became one of the first stations on the GC Extension to be closed to passenger traffic, on 24 September 1958, and finally to all traffic on 6 June 1962, after which the site reverted to agricultural use.

It consists of a circle of upright stones, made into a low chamber by a very large roof slab estimated at 25 tonnes. Excavation in 1909 found the remains of some 15 to 30 people, and pottery suggesting a late Neolithic date. Close to the village of Moelfre, the site is within a few metres of the road, where there is room to leave a single car for short periods. Burial chamber Lligwy Burial Chamber is a very robust, neolithic chamber. The eight uprights which support the massive capstone are larger than they at first appear, because half of their height is buried in the ground. The capstone is about long and wide, with a thickness of around . It is estimated to weigh about and is in contact with only three of the uprights. A gap between the uprights on the eastern side probably indicates where an entrance passage stood, with a way out of the mound; It is unclear whether this chambered tomb was covered by a cairn, but if it was, no trace remains today. Deep grooves in the limestone capstone imply that erosion by rainfall has taken place, further evidence that the structure may not have been covered by a cairn. Excavations in 1909 discovered artefacts in two separate layers, indicating that the site was used during two separate periods. The bones from up to thirty people have been found in the chamber, as well as shellfish (mussels and limpets) and many animal bones. Fragments of pottery from the two different settlements periods are present; grooved ware dating to the Neolithic period and beaker ware from the early Bronze Age. Some to the west lies the well-preserved Din Lligwy hut circle, but this is not a contemporary structure, probably dating from the second to fourth centuries AD. Lligwy Burial Chamber is a scheduled ancient monument. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales curates the archaeological, architectural and historic records for this site. Included in the archives are many digital images of the site, a DOE photographic collection, NMR site files, Cadw guardianship records, colour photographs, black and white photographs, aerial photographs and an extract from the June 1933 edition of Archaeologia Cambrensis with the title \\"The Pottery from the Lligwy Burial Chamber, Anglesey\\".

Originally consisting of small crofting communities, Waternish now has a growing population and is home to various arts and crafts enterprises. Whilst the main industry on Waternish is tourism, there has also been a revival in recent years of crofting or small-scale agriculture. The local school is called Knockbreck.

The game was released in January 1992, and was Matchbox's first video game. Motor City Patrol was one in a line of video games that tied into the Matchbox brand of die-cast model vehicles, like police cars, ambulances, fire trucks, and earth-moving construction machines. Gameplay Motor City Patrol start screen The player controls an officer of the law whose job it is to patrol one of five precincts for a week at a time. As the player gets farther and farther into the week, a larger area is permitted to be patrolled, in addition to a longer shift (time limit) to accomplish each of the mission goals. Players get to drive around all day looking for speeders, robbers, and public enemies, while avoiding hurting innocent civilians. When a criminal (speeder, robber, or public enemy) appears on the precinct map, the player must either pull over or shoot the offender's vehicle. The game ends when players fail in a mission, receive five or more warnings, shoot a civilian, or total their vehicle. After going through all five precincts (at seven days apiece), players start over again in precinct 1, on day 1, with all of their points, merits, warnings, and car upgrades intact. The game cycles indefinitely until the player loses. Reception Skyler Miller of AllGame gave Motor City Patrol two stars out of a possible five, calling it an \\"interesting but ultimately disappointing game\\". Miller praised the game's \\"sharp, detailed rendition\\" of city streets, but wrote that the execution of the game's \\"promising\\" concept \\"is derailed by repetitive objectives that never change, a difficult-to-control car and the necessity of constantly having to switch to a map screen to see the location of buildings and criminals.\\" References External links *Motor City Patrol at MobyGames Category:1992 video games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System-only games Category:North America- exclusive video games Category:Racing video games Category:Top-down video games Category:Video games about police officers Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Motor City Patrol"},{"id":"17718246","text":"Blind Date is a 2007 drama film directed by Stanley Tucci, who also stars and co-wrote the screenplay with David Schechter.Sundance Film festival - 2008 Online Film Guide The film premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.

While working in a hotel, he met Ian Wright, who later got him an audition. Once Rod got the audition he had to go through a variety of tests, including role play. People who had audition were dropping easily, meaning that to be a Gladiator one not only needed to be musculous, but also very athletic. In the first series of Gladiators, Kirsty Gallagher nicknamed Rod as the \\"Flirt In a Skirt\\" and Rod was also nicknamed the \\"Duel King\\" due to his near perfect record with a pugil stick in the game \\"Duel\\".

Despite, some differences, the scripts used for the Telugu and Kannada languages remain quite similar. History The Dravidian family comprises about 73 languages including Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam. Saatavaahanas introduced the Brahmi to present day Telugu and Kannada speaking regions. During the 5th to 7th centuries CE the early BƒÅdƒÅmi ChƒÅlukyƒÅs and Early Banavasi KadambƒÅs used early form of the Kannada script in inscriptions, called the Kadamba script. The Kadamba script evolved into the Telugu-Kannada (old Kannada) script, which was used between the 7th and 11th centuries CE. Kannada became a written language ahead of Telugu. Both Kannada and Telugu produced poetry during the eighth century. Full-fledged literary works in Kannada appeared in the ninth century, two centuries before they became available in Telugu. The earliest known Telugu inscriptions date to the 6th century CE. Telugu poetry began to appear in the 11th century. Telugu writers waited until the 11th century because of socio-political factors (royal patronage, the influence of Buddhism and Jainism). Between 1100 CE and 1400 CE the Kannada and Telugu scripts separated from Old Kannada. The Chalukya dynasty influenced the modern form of Telugu script and its similarity with modern Kannada script.

For primary school level, a score of 65 is good enough to pass, while in high school and further levels the pass grade is 70/100. Students who attain between 60 and the passing grade get the chance to take an extra test that reviews the whole year's curriculum, and in which a 70 is needed to achieve a passing score. Often high schools will raise the pass grade to 75 in order to push their students to achieve a higher grade. This only applies to the highest high school grades, which are 10th and 11th grade. This method is primarily focused on improving grades by encouraging a higher cumulative grade point average throughout both years, leading towards a set of final exams in which this average grade becomes critically important.

Wolf Hilbertz developed the process and patented it in 1979. The building process, popularly called accretion, is not to be confused with Biorock sewage treatment. The biorock building process grows cement-like engineering structures and marine ecosystems, often for mariculture of corals, oysters, clams, lobsters and fish in salt water. It works by passing a small electric current through electrodes in the water. The structure grows more or less without limit as long as current flows.  History  Aragonite in tube Artificial reefs have been built since the 1950s using materials including sunken ships, concrete blocks and discarded tires. However, most of these plans failed to provide coral habitat. Most notoriously, tires were strapped down off the shore of Fort Lauderdale and became an environmental disaster. Some artificial reefs succeeded, but most remain relatively barren compared with natural reefs. Biorock technology arose from experiments in the 1970s when Hilbertz was studying how seashells and reefs grow, by passing electric currents through salt water. In 1974, he found that as the salt water electrolyzes, calcium carbonate (aragonite) combines with magnesium, chloride and hydroxyl ions to slowly accrete around the cathode, eventually coating the electrode with a material similar in composition to magnesium oxychloride cements and as strong as concrete. Over time cathodic protection replaces the negative chloride ion (Cl-) with dissolved bicarbonate (HCO3-) to harden the coating to a hydromagnesite- aragonite mixture with gaseous oxygen evolving through the porous structure. Later experiments showed that the coatings can thicken at the rate of 5 cm per year. As long as current flows, the structure continues to grow and strengthen. It can heal itself if damaged, making it particularly useful as a replacement for concrete in hard-to-access locations. High levels of dissolved oxygen make it particularly attractive to marine organisms, particularly fin fish. Hilbertz originally called his invention, on which he obtained several patents, underwater mineral accretion or accretion for short. Hilbertz‚Äôs original plan was to use this technology to grow low-cost structures in the ocean for developing countries. He also envisioned accreting large aquadynamic OTEC ocean thermal energy conversion plants, both for generating power and for producing hydrogen, ammonia, and magnesium hydroxide. This appeared to result in a building process largely independent of land-based resources. His focus shifted to coral reefs after meeting Thomas J. Goreau in the 1980s. They formed a partnership. Goreau continued work on biorock technologies and coral reef restoration after Hilbertz' death in 2007. Because the biorock process uses such simple materials, electrode forms can be constructed in to mimic natural reefs. Since the combined hydrated magnesium oxychloride, brucite (magnesium hydroxide) - later hydromagnesite (magnesium chlorocarbonate) and aragonite (calcium carbonate) coating that forms is so similar to natural reef substrate, corals readily take to biorock reefs. Coral thrive on the electrified and oxygenated reef environment. One prominent example was in the Maldives during the 1998 warming, during which fewer than 5% of the natural reef corals survived. On biorock reefs there, 80% of corals flourished.Goreau, T. J, A Solution for Corals in Peril, A GCRA Overview, GCRA website, April 2002 With others, Hilbertz and Goreau made two expeditions to the Saya de Malha bank in 1997 and 2002. Using Biorock technology, they attempted to grow an artificial island around steel structures that were anchored to the sea floor. As \\"Seacrete\\" the process was publicised in a 1992 book of futurology, The Millennial Project. Author Marshall Savage reiterated Hilbertz' earlier proposal that the conductive metal magnesium be extracted from ocean water, and that the process use electricity from ocean thermal energy conversion. In 2012, both Goreau and Robert K. Trench, writing together with Goreau, published works on how Biorock could generate building materials as well as restoring damaged ecosystems.  Process  Applying a low voltage electric current (safe for swimmers and marine life) to a submerged, conductive structure causes dissolved minerals in seawater, principally calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate to precipitate and adhere to that structure. The result is a composite of brucite hydromagnesite and limestone with mechanical strength similar to concrete. Derived from seawater, this material is similar to the composition of natural coral reefs and sand beaches.  Constructing a reef  A newly constructed Biorock reef set up by Gili Eco Trust in Indonesia. To build a biorock reef, a welded, electrically conductive frame, often made from construction grade rebar or wire mesh, is submerged and attached to the sea bottom. A low voltage direct current is applied. This initiates an electrolytic reaction that precipitates mineral crystals naturally found in seawater, mainly calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide, on the structure. Within days, the structure takes on a whitish appearance as it becomes encrusted with precipitated minerals that add rigidity and strength. Electric fields, plus the shade and protection offered by the metal/limestone frame, attract colonizing marine life, including fish, crabs, clams, octopus, lobster and sea urchins. Once the structure is in place and minerals begin to coat the surface, the next phase of reef construction begins. Divers transplant coral fragments from other reefs, attaching them to the ark‚Äôs frame. Immediately, these coral pieces begin to bond to the accreted mineral substrate and because of evolved oxygen and the electrochemically facilitated accretion of dissolved ions, such as bicarbonate - start to grow‚Äîtypically three to five times faster than normal. Soon the reef takes on the appearance and utility of a natural reef ecosystem rather than a man-made one.  Technical specifications  Biorock samples range in compressive strength from 3720 to 5350 lbf/in¬≤ (26 to 37MPa) - for comparison, the concrete typically used in sidewalks has a strength of about 3500 lbf/in¬≤ (24 MPa). Main components of biorock include magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate. This composition is chiefly the result of the ionic composition of seawater. One kilowatt hour of electricity accretes about 0.4 to 1.5 kg (0.9 to 3.3 lb) of biorock, depending on parameters such as depth, electric current, salinity and water temperature. no. 243 In one study, Porites development was compared between colonies with and without an electric field for 6 months. The electric field was eliminated after the sixth month. Longitudinal growth was relatively high in the presence of the field, but dropped thereafter. Growth differences were significant only during the first 4 months. Girth growth differences were significant in the early months. The treatment corals survived at a higher rate.  Benefits  Biorock accelerates growth on coral reefs by as much as fivefold and restoration of physical damage by as much as 20 times. The rate of growth can be varied by altering the amount of current flowing into the structure. Biorock can enable coral growth and regrowth even in the presence of environmental stress such as rising ocean temperatures, diseases, and nutrient, sediment, and other types of pollution. When mixed with construction aggregates, it can build components on the sea floor or on land. Biorock represents the only known method that can sustain and grow natural coral species using only basic conducting elements, typically of a common metal such as steel. Electrolysis of biorock reefs enhances coral growth, reproduction and ability to resist environmental stress. Coral species typically found on healthy reefs gain a major advantage over the weedy organisms that often overgrow them on stressed reefs. Biorock reefs grow rapidly and strengthen as they age. They thus have great potential for many applications, such as making breakwaters. If waves or colliding ships cause damage, renewed accretion makes them, to an extent, self-repairing. Biorock is cost-effective, requiring only metal bars or equivalent and electricity. While electricity provided from fossil fuels generates CO2, biorock projects often use renewable solar power, wind power, tidal power, or wave power. The resulting material is cheaper than concrete blocks in many places, depending on electricity and cement transport costs. Biorock structures can be built in any size or shape depending only on the physical makeup of the sea bottom, wave, current energies and construction materials. They are well suited for remote, third world sites where exotic building materials, construction equipment and appropriately skilled labor are not available.  Potential to grow back eroded beaches  Biorock structures are extremely effective at preventing beach erosion and restoring already eroded beaches. Shorelines are highly susceptible to beach recession and loss due to climate change bringing about rising sea levels and increasingly frequent and powerful storms. Conventional methods of combatting this employ large structures such as breakwaters that are designed to reflect waves, thus preventing erosion. However, this method is problematic and actually contributes to beach erosion. As each wave crashes, the force it exerts on the structure is doubled due to the reversal of the wave direction vector. This reflected wave then carries the sand at the structure's base back out to sea. This repeats until the structure is dug out and falls, or breaks. Natural reefs prevent erosion by dissipating around 97% of wave energy, and grow beaches by depositing skeletons of dead coral and algae. Biorock Anti-Wave (BAW) structures mimic these natural reefs, reaping their benefits and solving some of the challenges they have in storm dissipation. BAW structures can be built in the shape of an upside-down wave to provide optimal wave dissipation. Additionally, the self-healing quality of Biorock ensures structures will survive even the most devastating storms. BAW structures in Turks and Caicos survived the two worst hurricanes in the history of the islands, which occurred three days apart and damaged or destroyed 80% of the buildings on the island. Sand was observed to build up around the bases of Biorock reef structures. In Maldives in 1997, BAW structures helped save several buildings, including a hotel, that had risked washing away due to severe beach erosion. A 50 meter long BAW structure was built which stabilized and ultimately reversed erosion in several years, even allowing the beach to survive a tsunami in 2004  Drawbacks  While Biorock structures produce wonderful results, they require constant power to maintain them. In Maldives, several Biorock reefs successfully survived a 1998 bleaching event that killed off nearly all wild coral, but were then taken off power. They survived until 2016 when another bleaching event killed them all. The electric field that Biorock produces is so far known to be safe to wildlife, however this doesn't mean that it doesn't affect wildlife. A study conducted in the Bahamas in 2015 showed that the electric field deterred sharks, specifically the bull shark and the Caribbean reef shark, from swimming and feeding in the area. The electric field is believed to affect sharks because of their electroreception abilities, however species with similar capabilities such as the bar jack and Bermuda chub did not appear to be affected by the electric field.  Distribution  As of 2011, biorock coral reef projects had been installed in over 20 countries, in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Pacific and Southeast Asia. One project is located on one of the most remote and unexplored reef areas of the world, the Saya de Malha Bank in the Indian Ocean.Gutzeit, Frank + Hilbertz, W. H. + Goreau, T. J., Saya de Malha Expedition, March 2002, Sun&Sea; e.V. Hamburg, August 2002 Other biorock projects are located in French Polynesia, Indonesia, Maldives, Mexico, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Seychelles, the Philippines and Thailand. Indonesia has the most biorock projects, with sites near over half a dozen islands, including the world's two largest reef restoration projects: Pemuteran with the Karang Lestari and the Gili islands with the Gili Eco Trust.Goreau, T. J, comments quoted in Independent Study Project on Biorock, GCRA website, February 2011 Non-coral biorock projects have been conducted in places such as Barataria Bay, Galveston, seagrasses in the Mediterranean, oyster reefs and salt marshes in New York City, in Port Aransas, and in St. Croix.  Maldives  On Vabbinfaru island in the Maldives, a 12-meter, 2 ton steel cage called the Lotus was secured on the sea floor. As of 2012, coral was so abundant on the structure that the cage is difficult to discern. The 1998 El Nino killed 98% of the reef around Vabbinfaru. Abdul Azeez, who led the Vabbinfaru project, said coral growth on the structure is up to five times that of elsewhere. A smaller prototype device was in place during the 1998 warming event and more than 80% of its corals survived, compared to just 2% elsewhere. However, power is no longer supplied to the project, leaving it vulnerable to the next round of bleaching.  References   Published works  * Hilbertz, W.

It was founded as Hutchesons Boys' Grammar School by the brothers George Hutcheson and Thomas Hutcheson in 1641 and was opened originally to educate orphans, starting with \\"twelve male children, indigent orphans\\". For much of its early life the boys' school was situated at Crown Street in the Gorbals. In 1876 a girls' school was opened in the former Gorbals Youth School in Elgin Street, moving to Kingarth Street in Pollokshields in 1912. The Boys' and Girls' schools amalgamated in 1976 at Beaton Road where the Boys' school had moved to in 1957. Kingarth Street became the co-ed primary school. In 2001, the school expanded into Glasgow's West End when it merged with Laurel Bank School and created a nursery and primary school on Lilybank Terrace, although this has since closed. The building suffered heavy damage in a fire in November 2008, and again in early 2019. Today, \\"Hutchie\\", as the school is known informally, has around 1,300 pupils at Kingarth Street and Beaton Road. The current Rector is Colin Gambles. History Thomas Hutcheson (1590‚Äì1641).Thomas Hutcheson. University of Glasgow George and Thomas Hutcheson set aside money for their school in 1641. The brothers originally intended the School to be for orphans. Archibald Edmiston, an orphan himself, became the School's first pupil in 1643 and, seven years later, the School had \\"12 boys on the roll\\", to whom the school song refers. The brothers built Hutchesons' Hospital Building in the Trongate which survived the fire that destroyed much of the city in 1652. The school required several moves to accommodate its growing number of pupils. It twice changed address before the school moved to Ingram Street in 1802. By 1815 the school had 76 pupils. By 1839 it stood at 120 which prompted the Patrons' decision to build a new school in Crown Street, Gorbals. The new building was opened in 1841 and remained in use until 1960. In 1876, Hutchesons' Girls' School was opened on Elgin Street. It re-located in 1912 to Kingarth Street, Govanhill as Hutchesons' Girls' Grammar School, the present primary school building. Beaton Road in Crossmyloof became the new home to the primary school of Hutchesons' Boys' Grammar School in 1957, with the secondary school moving in 1960. In 1975, Hutchesons' Girls' Grammar School and Hutchesons' Boys' Grammar School were amalgamated to form Hutchesons' Grammar School, the co-educational institution which remains in this form today. The girls' site in Kingarth Street became the mixed primary school and also housed S1 and S2 (the first two years of the secondary school) while the remaining secondary pupils were taught at what had been the boys' school in Beaton Road. Twenty years later additional building at Beaton Road allowed S1 and S2 to move there, leaving Kingarth Street as wholly the primary school. Lilybank Terrace building following fire damage in 2019. In 1991, a 3-storey Science Block was erected in the Beaton Road carpark and in 1994 a new Infant Block at Kingarth Street was constructed. A new Sports Building was developed on the Playing Fields at Beaton Road in 1998, allowing the old gymnasium in the Senior School to be converted into a library the following year. Since 2000 the Fotheringay Centre has been built with a number of new facilities. In 2012 a new building for drama was opened, complete with studios and stage with lighting and sound. A new Gym opened in February 2019 with Cardio and Conditioning suites. Fees range between ¬£7,975 and ¬£10,158 per annum. The school includes a large number of Jews and Muslim pupils who constitute approximately 15% of the senior school roll. There is a Jewish assembly every Thursday and a Muslim assembly one Thursday a month although students of any religion can attend. A new sports track - the Alix Jamieson Stadium - was completed in September 2009 and a purpose built drama complex was officially opened in March 2012 by actor Richard Wilson. Additionally a new gym was opened in February 2019 by former pupil Leon Smith.

The one-lane bridge spans ≈åpaekaa Stream. With steel beams forged in 1890 by the Alexander Findlay & Company in Motherwell, Scotland, this is touted as possibly the only British-built bridge located in the United States. History The steel supports for this bridge were originally forged in 1890 and utilized as part of the Wailua River Bridge. Constructed as a three span, steel truss bridge, its construction was delayed through 1894 due to the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom and the establishment of the Republic of Hawaii. When this span was replaced in 1919, the steel was reused in the construction of the present-day bridge over Opaekaa Stream. Its relocation was carried out by then County Engineer Joseph Moragne. Today, the largest span has a length of , a total length of and a deck width of . Having an average daily traffic of 382 vehicles as of 1986, the bridge is maintained by the Kauai County Division of Roads. With a sufficiency rating of only 14.7 percent and substandard safety railing, this span is listed as structurally deficient and past the point of rehabilitation, necessitating the need for a replacement span for the crossing. As a result of its age and exposure, many of its steel beams are rusted through, with much of its concrete deck cracked in multiple locations. Due to its deteriorating state its rated load was reduced to 5 tons in 2007, then to 3 tons, and is listed to be replaced as part of the Hawaii Department of Transportation's current statewide transportation improvement program.

Historians and theologians generally have regarded Catharinus as a brilliant eccentric. He was frequently accused of teaching false doctrines, yet always kept within the bounds of orthodoxy. Life Politi was born at Siena. At sixteen he became Doctor of Civil and Canon Law (J.U.D.) in the academy of Siena. After visiting many academies in Italy and France he was appointed (1508) a professor at Siena, and had among his pupils Giovanni del Monte, afterwards Pope Julius III, and Sixtus of Siena, a converted Jew who esteemed his master, yet severely criticized some of his writings. About 1513 he entered the Order of St. Dominic in the convent of St. Mark, at Florence. He studied Scripture and theology without a master. This may account for his independence, and his defence of opinions which were singular, especially in regard to predestination, the certitude of possessing grace, the residence of bishops in their dioceses, and the intention required in the minister of a sacrament. He was a strenuous defender of Catholicism against Martin Luther and his followers; and was prominent in the discussions of the Council of Trent, to which he was called by his former pupil, Cardinal del Monte, legate of Paul III. In the third, public, session (4 February 1546), Catharinus, pronounced a notable discourse, later published [\\"Oratio ad Patres Conc. Trid.\\" (Louvain, 1567; Paris, 1672)]. Notwithstanding attacks upon his teaching he was appointed Bishop of Minori in 1546, and, in 1552, Archbishop of Conza, Province of Naples. Pope Julius III, successor of Paul III, called Politi to Rome, intending, says Jacques √âchard, to elevate him to the cardinalate, but he died before reaching Rome. Pallavicini and other authorities declare that the Council of Trent did not condemn his singular opinions. He defended the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin. According to √âchard, he regretted towards the end of his life the vehemence with which he had combatted Cardinal Cajetan and Father Dominic Soto. He died at Naples. Works His principal works (for complete list see Echard) are: * \\"Apologia pro veritate catholic√¶ et apostolic√¶ fldei ac doctrin√¶, adversus impia ac pestifera Martini Lutheri dogmata\\" (Florence, 1520); *\\"Speculum h√¶reticorum\\" (Lyons, 1541), with two opuscula on original sin and justification; *\\"Annotationes in commentaria Cajetani super sacram Scripturam\\" (Lyons, 1542); *\\"Tractatus qu√¶stionis quo jure episcoporum residentia debeatur\\" (Venice, 1547); *\\"Defensio catholicorum pro possibili certitudine grati√¶\\" (ibid., 1547); *\\"Es bonus corripuit editor ad hoc intendere usus invexit errorem.\\" (Rome, 1548); *\\"Summa doctrin√¶ de pr√¶destinatione\\" (Rome, 1550); * \\"Commentaria in omnes D. Pauli epistolas et alias septem canonicas\\" (Venice, 1551); *\\"Disputatio pro veritate immaculat√¶ conceptionis B. Virginis\\" (Rome, 1551). He also published numerous opuscula, e. g., on Providence and predestination, on the state of children dying without baptism; on giving communion to young children; on celibacy; on the Scriptures and their translation into the vernacular.

Printed in 1959, it is the second of two collaborative books by the two men whilst they were both members of the Situationist International. Psychogeography and d√©tournement A page spread in M√©moires The book is a work of psychogeography, detailing a period in Debord's life when he was in the process of leaving the Lettrists, setting up Lettrism International, and showing his 'first masterpiece',Asger Jorn, The Crucial Years 1954-64, Atkins, Lund Humphries, p 57 Hurlements en Faveur de Sade (Howling in Favour of Sade), a film devoid of imagery that played white when people were talking on the soundtrack and black during the lengthy silences between. Credited to Guy-Ernest Debord, with structures portantes ('load- bearing structures') by Asger Jorn, the book contains 64 pages divided into three sections. The first section is called 'June 1952', and starts with a quote from Marx: > Let the dead bury the dead, and mourn them.... our fate will be to become > the first living people to enter the new life. The second section, 'December 1952', quotes Huizinga, and the third, 'September 1953', quotes Soubise. The work contains two separate layers. The first is printed with black ink, reproducing found text and graphics taken from newspapers and magazines. The second layer is printed using coloured inks, splashed across the pages. These sometimes connect images and text, sometimes cover them, and sometimes are seemingly unconnected. The black layer contains fragments of text, maps of Paris and London, illustrations of siege warfare, cheap reproductions of old masters and questions such as 'How do you feel about the world at the moment, Sir?' The coloured layer contains freefloating ink splashes, lines created by a matchstick loaded in ink, and a Rorschach inkblob. Other pages deal with more personal themes, including a cartoon of the first showing of his film Hurlements en Faveur de Sade, with comments for and against, and references to D√©rive, which would become known as Situationist Drift, the habit of walking aimlessly through a city in an attempt to find its spirit. D√©tournement ('diversion' or 'disruption') is also employed in the book to disorient the reader by creating startling collaged juxtapositions. Originally deriving from Dada,Guy Debord, Merrifield, Reaktion, 2005, p 25 d√©tournement would become a key situationist strategy. The last page is an orange swirl, above which reads the single sentence 'I wanted to speak the beautiful language of my century.''Je voulais parler la belle langue de mon si√®cle', M√©moires, p62 Auto-destruction: the sandpaper cover The book is most famous for its cover, a dust jacket made of heavy- grade sandpaper. Usually credited to Debord, the sleeve was actually conceived in a conversation between Jorn and the printer, V.O. Permild: > [Permild:] Long had [Jorn] asked me, if I couldn‚Äôt find an unconventional > material for the book cover. Preferably some sticky asphalt or perhaps glass > wool. Kiddingly, he wanted, that by looking at people, you should be able to > tell whether or not they had had the book in their hands.

The artists' book is credited to Asger Jorn, with Debord listed as \\"Technical Adviser in D√©tournement\\". Also printed by Permild and Rosengreen, Copenhagen, the book was published by Jorn's Edition Bauhaus Imaginiste in May 1957, a few months before this group amalgamated with the Lettrist International to create the Situationists. In many ways very similar to the later book, the colour layers are more exuberant, the text more pointed. One page, for instance, asks in English: > What do you want? Better and cheaper food? Lots of new clothes? A dream home > with all the latest comforts and labour saving devices? A new car . . . a > motor launch . . . a light aircraft of your own? Whatever you want, it's > coming your way - plus greater leisure for enjoying it all.

One page declares, 'There's No Whiteness....Viva Free Algeria!' Each page is then covered with a second layer of coloured ink drops and drips, most of which go right to left, emphasising the direction of the book from beginning to end. The book ends with the text: > Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Tell us in not more than 250 words why your girl is the > sweetest girl in town.'The replies, together with the girl's photograph and > her address written on the back, were to be sent to the Psychogeographical > Committee Of London (especially Debord and Jorn.) ....Nothing is known about > the replies Jorn received...' Taken from Art in Progress-Asger Jorn, Atkins, > Methuen 1964, inside cover Methods of production Having just arrived in Copenhagen, Jorn and Debord rushed into a newsagents, stole a huge amount of magazines and newspapers, and spent a drunken afternoon collaging elements together. The next day they arrived at the printers with 32 collages, which were transferred to lithographic plates. Jorn then sat at the top of a ladder over the zinc plates, dropping cup after cup of Indian ink onto them. The plates were then etched and printed over the black texts and images. The cover was a heavily embossed image of an advertisement for a razor blade. The spectacle The situationist concept of the spectacle runs through both books; represented by the newspapers and magazine collage elements, the collage and ink (d√©tournement) used to disrupt the text represents a strategy to see the city as it really is, rather than as charted in maps and signposts. > 'The spectacle epitomises the prevailing model of social life. It is the > omnipresent celebration of a choice already made in the sphere of > production, and the consummate result of that choice. In form as in content > the spectacle serves as total justification for the conditions and aims of > the existing system.'

It was known locally as the Danes' Road. It was constructed from oak planks in 148‚Äì147 BC. The trackway is situated in an area which is the site of industrial-scale mechanised peat harvesting by the Bord na M√≥na, principally to supply the peat-fired power stations of the Electricity Supply Board. While today a generally flat and open landscape, in the Iron Age it was covered by bog, quicksand, and ponds, surround by dense woodlands of birch, willow, hazel and alder while higher ground was covered by oak and ash. The terrain was dangerous and impassible for much of the year.Raftery, Pagan Celtic Ireland, chapter 5. Part of the recovered trackway In 1984, timbers recovered from Corlea were radiocarbon dated to the Iron Age, rather than the Bronze Age as had been expected, and an archaeological project was established under the leadership of Professor Barry Raftery to investigate the site before it was destroyed by peat-digging. Excavations to 1991 in Corlea bog revealed 59 toghers in an area of around 125 hectares and further work has raised the total to 108 with a further 76 in the nearby Derryoghil bog.Pryor, Britain BC, pp. 381-382. Part of the recovered trackway The majority of these toghers are constructed from woven hurdles laid on heaped brushwood on top of the surface, built to be used by people on foot. Four, including Corlea 1, the Corlea Trackway proper, are corduroy roads, built from split planks laid on top of raised rails and suitable for wheeled traffic. The Corlea Trackway is made from oak planks 3 to 3.5 metres long and around 15 centimetres thick laid on rails around 1.2 metres apart. The road was at least 1 kilometre long. Dendrochronological study suggests that the timber used in construction was felled in late 148 BC or early in 147 BC and the road built then. Raftery estimated that the sleepers alone amount to a 300 large oak trees, or a thousand wagon-loads, with a similar volume of birch for the rails.Pryor, Britain BC, pp. 382-385, fig. 90 & fig. 91; Raftery, Pagan Celtic Ireland, chapter 5. The Corlea Trackway ended on a small island, from which a second trackway, excavated in 1957 and since radiocarbon dated also to 148 BC, again around 1 kilometre long, connected to dry land on the far side of the bog. The construction of the roadway required a great deal of labour, comparable to that used in the construction of ritual monuments such as barrows.O'Sullivan, \\"Exploring\\", pp. 173-174. Wooden planks and nails The purpose of the Corlea Trackway is uncertain. For the smaller toghers, O'Sullivan remarks that \\"there is a growing sense that these were not structures designed to cross the bog, but to get into the bog\\".O'Sullivan, \\"Exploring\\", p. 175. Massive structures such as the Corlea Trackway may also have served to get into the bog, perhaps for ritual purposes, rather than merely to cross it.Pryor, Britain BC, pp. 387-391, argues for a solely ritual purpose. Raftery, Pagan Celtic Ireland, chapter 5, notes that the Corlea Trackway would have served to connect the later significant sites at Cruachan and Uisnech. Whatever its purpose, the roadway was usable for only a few years. Gradually covered by the rising bog and sinking under its own weight, it was covered by the bog within a decade, and perhaps less, where it remained preserved for two millennia.Pryor, Britain BC, p. 386. The Corlea Trackway, seemingly constructed in a single year, has suggested comparisons with the Irish language tale Tochmarc √âta√≠ne (The Wooing of √âta√≠n), where King Eochu Airem sets Midir tasks such as planting a forest and building a road across a bog where none had ever been before at a place called M√≥in L√°mraige.Pryor, Britain BC, pp. 387-388.

It was written by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, and directed by James Burrows. It marks the first appearance of all five main characters in the series, and also guest stars Vern√©e Watson as Althea and Brian Patrick Wade as Kurt. Plot summary Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper are two intelligent young physicists who have a combined IQ of 360 and claim to have \\"beautiful minds\\" that understand how the universe works. However, they are socially awkward, especially around women. After an unsuccessful visit to the high-IQ sperm bank, they return home and meet Penny, an aspiring actress who moves in next door. When Leonard and Sheldon meet Penny, Leonard is immediately infatuated and hopes to date her, which Sheldon finds unlikely to happen. Sheldon is quite content spending his nights playing Klingon Boggle with their socially dysfunctional friends, fellow geeks Howard Wolowitz, a wannabe ladies man, and Rajesh Koothrappali, who has selective mutism, in particular when Penny is around. However, Leonard sees in Penny a whole new universe of possibilities. He is so infatuated with her that after letting her use their shower on account of hers being broken, he agrees to try to retrieve her TV from her ex-boyfriend, a tall kid aptly named Kurt. However, Kurt de-pants Leonard and Sheldon, and they are unable to retrieve the TV. Feeling bad, Penny offers to buy the guys dinner. Sheldon realizes Leonard will continue pursuing Penny when Leonard says \\"Our babies will be smart and beautiful\\" to which Sheldon adds, \\"Not to mention, imaginary.\\" Unaired pilot An earlier pilot was produced which did not include Penny, Howard, or Raj. It instead included the characters Katie (Amanda Walsh) and Gilda (Iris Bahr). Katie, like Penny, is a street-smart foil to book-smart Leonard and Sheldon; however, she is meaner than Penny. She claimed to have slept with her stepfather before her mother married him. Moreover, in the original pilot the character of Sheldon is more sexual and libidinous. In fact, Sheldon is explicitly stated to have had sex with Gilda, his and Leonard's friend, at a Star Trek convention. CBS passed on the original pilot but liked the show enough to ask Lorre and Prady to produce a second one. Reception Jim Chamberlin of IGN praised the episode, calling it \\"a great start for the series\\", and stating that the writing was \\"some of the best we've seen in a standard sitcom in some time\\". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe, however, gave a negative review, saying that the show is \\"one of those laugh-track sitcoms that has exactly one comedy routine and just keeps hammering it home\\". Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club was also very negative towards the episode, giving it a D+ rating and saying: \\"Really bad television shows tend to pander to the mean: In affirming the superiority of Joe and Jane Average, they mock both the egregiously stupid [...] and the hyper- intelligent, who are struck down for the arrogant, unpardonable sin of‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ knowing stuff. The new CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory is a broad example of this principle‚Äîreally broad, like Amazon basin broad.

Childhood  Maximilian William was born on 13 December 1666 at Schloss Iburg near Osnabr√ºck. His parents were Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, and Sophia of the Palatinate, and he was the third of six sons to survive to adulthood. In her memoirs, Duchess Sophia described this childbirth as very difficult; Maximilian William's younger twin brother was stillborn and it was believed that the Duchess would not survive the ordeal for long. The newborn duke was named after the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne Maximilian Henry of Bavaria and the \\"Great\\" Elector of Brandenburg Frederick William. Sophia was a caring mother, but was concerned by Maximilian William's lack of \\"geist\\". Her firstborn, George Louis, suspected that she favoured Maximilian William, especially after the latter lost two fingers in a hunting accident.  Disinheritance and plot  Traditionally, the Welf lands were equally divided among sons. In 1684, however, the family agreed to adopt the principle of primogeniture, allowing the entire inheritance to pass to the eldest son and thus preventing further division of the Duchy of Brunswick- L√ºneburg into insignificant statelets. The seventeen-year-old Maximilian William voiced no objection. On his eighteenth birthday, his father signed a contract with the Republic of Venice, whereby he sent him to the Morean War as general of Brunswick-L√ºneburg troops and nominal commander of 2400 men. Maximilian William, however, was to be under actual command of a more experienced officer, and that officer was to take orders from the future Doge of Venice Francesco Morosini. The war lasted until 1688. Maximilian William's elder brother, Frederick Augustus, the second son, was killed in battle in 1690. His death made Maximilian William the Duke's second son and prompted him to claim the right to inheritance he had been deprived of in favour of his eldest brother, George Louis. Maximilian William and his second-youngest brother, Christian Henry, announced that they would not recognize the adoption of primogeniture. Maximilian William proceeded to plot to set primogeniture aside, assisted primarily by the Master of the Hunt Joachim von Moltke. Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, and the prime minister of Brandenburg Eberhard von Danckelmann were also implicated, and it is believed that Duchess Sophia was aware of the conspiracy but did not wish to estrange herself from her younger sons. His sister, Electress Sophia Charlotte of Brandenburg, informed their father of the plot by letter in 1691. Maximilian William and Moltke were imprisoned at the end of the year and charged with high treason. Moltke was executed, while Maximilian William was exiled the following year. He first sought protection from his paternal uncle, George William, and then went to Vienna to serve Emperor Leopold I.  Imperial service  Serving the Emperor, Maximilian William converted to Roman Catholicism in 1692 and rose to the rank of Field Marshal. He commanded the Hanoverian troops in the War of the Spanish Succession and was in command of the cavalry under Eugene of Savoy at the Battle of Blenheim. The Act of Settlement 1701 established that Maximilian William's mother Sophia, as a Protestant relative of Queen Anne, would succeed to the English throne, and that she would be followed by her Protestant descendants. Having converted to Roman Catholicism, Maximilian William forfeited his succession rights. Anne outlived Sophia by less than two months, both dying in 1714. Anne was thus succeeded by Maximilian William's brother George Louis, who had inherited Brunswick-L√ºneburg on their father's death in 1698. Maximilian William and Ernest Augustus were George Louis's only living brothers at the time, but unlike the latter, Maximilian William received no peerage titles from the new King of Great Britain. Maximilian William was elected Prince-Bishop of Osnabr√ºck in 1715, but the election was declared void because it was the turn of a Lutheran to hold the office; it was thus granted to Ernest Augustus. Maximilian William died in Vienna on 16 July 1726.

Owned by the Fairfax County Park Authority, it is protected with a local conservation easement, and preserves a globally rare natural community known as a \\"northern hardpan basic oak-hickory forest\\". This kind of forest occurs on diabase soil with an underlay of dense plastic clay; such terrain is called \\"shrink-swell soil\\" due to extreme variations in moisture availability exhibited throughout the year. Trees which grow in such an environment are stunted, and their relatively open canopies encourage the growth of a wide variety of grasses and herbs in the understory. Such forests were once common around northern Virginia, but many have been lost due to increasing suburbanization of the area. The forest found within Elklick Woodlands Natural Area Preserve is one of the most diverse upland forests types in Virginia. The forest's overstory is composed of several species of oaks (particularly white oak) and hickories (particularly pignut hickory); other canopy trees include white ash, tulip poplar, eastern red cedar, and Virginia pine. These trees are somewhat stunted and reach heights that are, on average, about shorter than typical forest trees in the region. The understory contains redbud, ironwood, flowering dogwood, and hawthorn. The preserve is owned and maintained by the Fairfax County Park Authority. It does not include improvements for public access, and visitors must make arrangements with the Fairfax County Park Authority prior to visiting. The preserve is part of a larger tract of county-owned parkland known as the Elklick Preserve. It is continuous with other county-owned and privately conserved greenspace, as well as the nearby Manassas National Battlefield Park.

Recording After his previous outlaw movement- hitching concept album Rides Again (its opening track was titled ‚ÄúWillie, Waylon and Me‚Äù and was reprised halfway through the running order of crossfading songs), Coe returned to a straighter country approach on 1977‚Äôs Tattoo, the title a reference to Coe‚Äôs menacingly inked frame. The Ohio-born Coe often wrote songs remembering childhood and family set all over the south, such as ‚ÄúTexas Lullaby‚Äù and ‚ÄúI Still Sing the Old Songs,‚Äù and sang them with such conviction that many listeners assumed they were autobiographical, although his reputation for exaggerating aspects of his own past - such as claiming he‚Äôd done time on death row for murder, a boast eventually disproven ‚Äì did not adhere him to some critics and fellow musicians, who viewed Coe‚Äôs creative liberties as exploitative. A converse view, on the other hand, would be that Coe‚Äôs ability to carry off these songs so authentically speaks to one of his greatest strengths as a vocalist. ‚ÄúDaddy Was a God Fearin‚Äô Man,‚Äù which is set in Harlan, Kentucky, is another one of these compositions where the narrator recalls visiting his grandfather as an eight-year-old boy and reminiscing about his father, who was a poor farmer and ‚Äúcould barely sign his name.‚Äù Although the set opens with the honky tonk bounce of ‚ÄúJust to Prove My Love to You,‚Äù most of Tattoo is dominated by contemplative ballads exploring traditional country themes, as noted by AllMusic critic Thom Jurek, who calls it ‚Äúone of Coe's finest recordings -- it's full of love songs, divorce tunes, cheating songs, and rootsy, gutsy honky tonk playing by a stellar cast of musicians.‚Äù Coe wrote or co-wrote most of the songs on the LP, such as ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll Always Live Inside of Me,‚Äô a collaboration with Bobby Charles, which is a stone country song worthy of George Jones before breaking into a Ray Price shuffle on the chorus. (‚ÄúPlay it pretty,‚Äù Coe urges before the steel guitar break.) ‚ÄúPlay Me a Sad Song,‚Äù is similar to the Tammy Wynette hit ‚ÄúApartment #9‚Äù in structure, and even quotes the line ‚ÄúLoneliness surrounds me‚Äù on the chorus, while the regretful ‚ÄúFace to Face,‚Äù another Coe original, is a cry-in- your-beer tune that laments ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs time to share the pain.\\" Other songs on the album have more complex arrangements without sacrificing this country sound, largely because of Coe‚Äôs soulful delivery. As Jurek writes: Tattoo was Coe's third release of 1977 and would reach number 38 on the country music albums chart.

Founded in 1593 by Father Robert Parsons SJ as the College of Saint- Omer in Artois, France (then part of the Spanish Netherlands),Robert Parsons, Catholic Encyclopaedia (1913). Retrieved 9 July 2008 the school was forced in the 18th c. to relocate twice due to the suppression of the Jesuit order, first to Bruges in 1762 and then Li√®ge in 1773, before migrating a third and final time to Stonyhurst in England where it became Stonyhurst College in 1794. Foundation Fr Robert Parsons SJ During the reign of Elizabeth I religious education for Catholics was subject to penal legislation in England. The English Catholic church had created several colleges in continental Europe to make up for this, at Douai, Rome, and Valladolid, but these primarily addressed the training of priests. Especially the English College, Douai was associated with the faculty of theology of the University of Douai. Robert Parsons (1546‚Äì1610), had been instrumental in founding the English College, Valladolid, but recognised a need for a school for juvenile laymen. Saint-Omer was chosen as a site conveniently close to England, just 24 miles from Calais, and ruled by Spain as part of Flanders. It was also near the University of Douai, where scholars had edited and published the Douay‚ÄìRheims Bible. The college was founded in 1593 as the English Jesuit College at St Omer in Flanders (although an alternative tradition dates the founding to 1592).The Authorities of Stonyhurst College, A Stonyhurst Handbook for Visitors and Others, (Stonyhurst, Lancashire. Third edition 1963) pp.11‚Äì12 In 1599, it gained the direct patronage of King Philip of Spain. After an initial period of growth and prosperity, the unrest caused by the English Civil War, the number of students dropped to as low as 24 in 1645. When stability returned to the English government, the school's effectiveness was also restored. French rule Saint-Omer College English Jesuit chapel St. Omer and much of the province of Artois were formally ceded back to France in 1658. The Catholic French monarchy was as friendly to the school as the Spanish crown had been before. As the eighteenth century began, two fires ravaged the town and the university, but each time it was rebuilt, and even expanded. Buildings from the second reconstruction in the 1720s remained in use into the twentieth century, having served, moreover, as a military hospital in World War I. The college enjoyed its greatest period of prosperity from around 1720 to 1762. During the period when formal sworn affiliation with the Church of England was required to attend Oxford and Cambridge, it provided advanced education for several generations of English Catholics. Since the colleges founded in the American colonies were also Protestant church affiliated, Catholic families from there also sent their young men to St. Omer to be educated. Bruges, Li√®ge, Stonyhurst Bruges In 1762, the Jesuits were formally expelled from France, beginning the college's decline and eventual end. The expulsion split the college. The Jesuit faculty and many of the students fled to the Austrian Netherlands, now part of modern Belgium, moving first to Bruges, and then to Li√®ge, operating under the protection of the Bishop of Li√®ge from 1773. King Louis XV continued the college at St. Omer, under the direction of secular clergy. When the Jesuit order was suppressed everywhere in 1773, the dual system ended, but the college never regained its prominence. Stonyhurst College In 1793, the French Revolution and the United Kingdom's declaration of war on France ended Saint Omer college. The English faculty and students were imprisoned until February 1795. English penal laws and resulting discrimination had changed regarding Catholic education in England, so once released, some of the staff and most of the then about 100 students went to England, to avoid the war on the European continent. A former student, Thomas Weld, donated a mansion and grounds at Stonyhurst, in Lancashire. The modern school, Stonyhurst College continues to this day as a direct lineal descendant of the College of Saint-Omer. The Lyc√©e Alexandre Ribot now stands on the site of the former college in Saint Omer. Heythrop College, University of London, the now defunct specialist Philosophy and Theology constituent College of the University of London, shared its (1614) foundation in Li√®ge with Stonyhurst College.

He was also an Irish Nationalist and Younger Irelander, and was a founding member of the first Irish conference of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. Life He was educated in the day-school of the Jesuit Fathers, Dublin, and in Trinity College, Dublin, graduating in 1842. An advocate of Catholic university education, he contributed to the Dublin Review (1847) an article which the Catholic Truth Society of Ireland reprinted under the title \\"Trinity College No Place for Catholics\\". In 1842 he was called to the Bar and joined the Munster Circuit. In 1861 he was appointed a Commissioner of National Education, and in 1865 he became Q.C. The same year he married Frances, daughter of the first Lord O'Hagan. While in London in the Spring of 1845, O'Hagan, along with John Edward Pigot and Charles Gavan Duffy paid a call on Thomas Carlyle and his wife Jane Carlyle in order to defend the Irish and Irish Nationalism against Carlyle's attacks in On Chartism and other works. In his 1892 Conversations with Carlyle, Duffy recounts this initial meeting and quotes from Jane Carlyle's half-burnt diary that had been rescued from a general fire meant to destroy all of her personal memoirs. Here Jane commented on meeting for the first time \\"real hot and hot live Irishmen\\" such as she had \\"never seen before\\" (J. Carlyle qtd. in Duffy, 1892, p. 1). While \\"no blood was shed\\" during this friendly but combative meeting, O'Hagan's nose began to bleed profusely. Jane Carlyle writes: \\"while they were all three at the loudest defence [sic] of Ireland against the foul aspersions Carlyle had . . . 'scornfully' cast on it, [O'Hagan's nose] . . . burst out bleeding. He let it bleed into his pocket-handkerchief privately til nature was relieved, and was more cautious of exciting himself afterwards\\" (Jane Carlyle qtd. in Duffy,Conversations with Carlyle, 1892, p. 3).

It sits on a man-made island in shallow water on the eastern of the two halves of Cleveland Ledge, which is said to have been named for President Grover Cleveland because he owned the nearby Gray Gables estate and used to fish in the area. It marks the east side of the beginning of the dredged channel leading to the Cape Cod Canal and is the first fixed mark when going northbound through the canal. As it is an important mark in an area subject to fog, it has a racon showing the letter \\"C\\". Structure The lighthouse is built atop a caisson 52 feet in diameter, which also contains the lighthouse's engine room. The first two floors of the lighthouse serve as living and working space, on top of which sits the cylindrical concrete tower which is another 50 feet tall. History The lighthouse was built between 1940 and 1943 after a re-dredging of the Cape Cod Canal in the late 1930s, which allowed larger ships to pass through and necessitated the marking of Cleveland East Ledge, which sits quite close to the path of ships approaching the south entrance to the canal. The state of Massachusetts began the project, but in 1941 turned it over to the Coast Guard, which, after delays caused by the war, completed it in 1943. In 1978, the laying of an underwater cable to the lighthouse allowed its automation, obviating the need for the 4-man Coast Guard crew which had manned the light since its 1943 inauguration. The lighthouse was sealed and would remain unoccupied for much of the next 3 decades, apart from a 3-week renovation by the Coast Guard in 1990. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Cleveland Ledge Light Station in 1987. Without regular maintenance, the lighthouse fell into disrepair. After putting the lighthouse on the market in 2007 generated very little interest, the General Services Administration put the lighthouse up for auction in October 2010. The bidding lasted into December. The winning party purchased the lighthouse for $190,000. It is now owned by the Cleveland Ledge Lighthouse, LLC.

Built in 1797, it is one of the state's few surviving wooden windmills, and also one of the few still in working condition. The windmill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The Chatham Windmill is located southwest of downtown Chatham, in the southern section of Chase Park, between Shattuck and Gristmill Lanes. It is a wood-frame structure, set on a rise overlooking the Mill Pond on Chatham's south shore. It is about three stories in height, with an octagonal shape that tapers to a gabled cap, and is covered in wooden shingles. The cap's side faces are slightly bowed. The wind vanes are attached to one of the gabled ends of the cap. Entrances are located at the northern and southern sides of the structures, and there are small windows on the second level. The mill was built in 1797 by Benjamin Godfrey, and was used to grind corn. It was originally located on Stage Harbor Road, and was moved to its present location in 1955, the year it was given to the town. The methods used in its construction suggest that the builder was from the southeast of England. The mill remained in commercial use until 1907, when it was significantly damaged in a storm. Although it was repaired, it was again damaged by severe weather in 1929. The mill has undergone several phases of rehabilitation, during which worn and rotted parts have been replaced. The mill is operated seasonally as a museum, and the town employs a miller to occasionally use it to grind grain.

As a navigational aid, it marks the southwest edge of the entrance to Provincetown Harbor. The United States Coast Guard Light List describes it simply as a \\"white square tower\\". The light it casts is green, occulting every 4 seconds, and, at a focal height of above mean sea level, has a visible range of . When the weather affords low- visibility, one can hear the station's fog horn ‚Äì sounding a single blast for two seconds, and repeating every 15 seconds ‚Äì as it seems to call out for (and answer calls from) its nearly-identical closest neighbor, the Wood End Light. History By an act of Congress on May 18, 1826, the United States Government earmarked $2,500 to acquire at the extreme tip of Long Point, and to establish a lighthouse to guide mariners into the busy fishing port of Provincetown Harbor. In comparing the relative share of the gross domestic product (GDP), or \\"nominal GDP\\", that's the equivalent of today's Congress allocating $48 million in 2013 dollars. The original \\"Cape Cod style\\" light and keeper's house, c. 1830 Completed in 1827, the original Long Point Light was not a tower structure, but rather consisted of an octagonal lantern centered on the peak of the roof of the wooden keeper's house. Access to the lantern was by a spiral stair from the top floor of the house. That architectural style, common to several of Cape Cod's early 19th century lighthouses, came to be known as the \\"Cape Cod style\\" ‚Äì today, however, \\"classic\\" examples of that style can only be found along the Pacific Coast. The lantern was lit by a sixth-order Fresnel lens in 1856. By 1873, a lighthouse inspector's report noted substantial erosion, exposed wooden pilings, and poor overall condition of the light station, expressing concern that a strong storm could carry it away. Shortly thereafter, the Lighthouse Board decided to replace the entire structure. The present-day tall, square brick lighthouse and a one-and-one-half-story keeper's dwelling to its south were completed in 1875. The lighthouse included a larger, fifth-order Fresnel lens, and a fog bell was installed to the north of the tower. In 1904, the station received an oil house for properly storing flammable materials used for illumination. In 1927, the intensity of the light was reduced to 29,000 candlepower. Long Point Light underwent automation in 1952, and a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. In 1982, Long Point Light became the second lighthouse in Massachusetts to be equipped with solar panels to power the light and fog signal equipment. The abandoned keeper's dwelling and fog signal building were demolished around the same time. The Long Point Light Station was added to the National Historic Register in 1987. The light and its 1904 oil house are the only structures left on Long Point, which is now part of the Cape Cod National Seashore. The village of Long Point From its inception in 1827 until the late 1850s, the lighthouse shared the peninsula with a thriving village of Long Point. By 1830, the lighthouse became the site of Long Point's first school, starting with only three children. The village grew to include the homes of 38 fishing families, a schoolhouse with up to 60 children, a post office, bakery, boat landings, breakwaters, and several saltworks which utilized windmills to pump seawater. For various reasons, the settlement was ultimately disbanded. Most of the families took their houses with them when they left ‚Äî the houses were placed on rafts and floated across the harbor to Provincetown's West End. Several of those historic \\"floater\\" homes are still standing, and can be identified by looking for the distinctive blue and white plaques. The Long Point Battery Around the middle of the American Civil War, in 1863, the Union Army constructed fortifications called the Long Point Battery. It consisted of two earthwork artillery batteries, with a total of nine guns between them, plus a barracks to house a company of 98 soldiers, an officer's quarters, and stables. The base was operational until 1872, but never saw any combat action ‚Äì as a result, local residents took to calling the batteries \\"Fort Useless\\" and \\"Fort Ridiculous\\". Present day Currently the U.S. Coast Guard owns and controls Provincetown's three lighthouses (Long Point Light, Wood End Light, and Race Point Light). It is leased to and maintained by the Cape Cod Chapter of the American Lighthouse Foundation. The grounds are open to the public, and the lighthouse tower is closed. In December 2009, preservationists proposed to rebuild the keeper's house as a bed and breakfast similar to the operation at Race Point. The Coast Guard's lease is due to expire in 2015, and local officials speculate that the property could be turned over to the National Park Service, which maintains and operates the National Seashore. The secluded beach by the lighthouse can be reached by renting a small boat at Land's End or using the Long Point Beach Ferry, a 20-minute shuttle from MacMillian Pier or from the Boatyard dock in the West End. It is also possible to hike out, along the Provincetown Causeway and then along the beach, a three-mile distance each way.https://admiralslanding.com/blog/long-point-provincetown/ Notes References Attribution External links *Maritime History of Massachusetts, a National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary, National Park Service Category:Lighthouses completed in 1827 Category:Lighthouses completed in 1875 Category:Houses completed in 1875 Category:Lighthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Lighthouses in Barnstable County, Massachusetts Category:Provincetown, Massachusetts Category:Houses completed in 1827 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Barnstable County, Massachusetts Category:1827 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Long Point Light"},{"id":"17719025","text":"Doron Sheffer (; born 12 March 1972), is a retired Israeli professional basketball player.

A young woman lives unhappily with her embittered parents in an isolated rural home until an escaped convict changes her dreary existence. It was based on the novel of the same name by Dan Totheroh.. Plot summary A young woman, Libby Saul (Ida Lupino), lives with her parents, who are themselves estranged, on an isolated farm not far from the California coast. Libby is used by her parents as a diplomatic middle-man, since they no longer speak to each other directly. She has developed a stammer over the years, and spends a lot of her spare time wandering around in the nearby woods with her beloved dog, Joe. One day when she is out wandering she bumps into a group of convicts who are building a road along the coastline. She takes an interest in the convicts and their building, so she returns for several days, without her parents knowing, to watch them at a distance. She is particularly interested in one of the handsome young convicts, Barry Burnette (Dane Clark). Eventually the convicts work their way through the hill that stands between them and Libby's parents' farm. They approach the farm in search of fresh water from the farm well. Mr. Saul (Henry Hull), Libby's father, offers to sell water to them, but they turn the offer down. Mr. Saul decides to give them the water for free instead. The foreman (Jack Mower) of the road workers taunts Burnette to the point when he explodes and punches his boss. Burnette is handcuffed and Libby breaks down in tears over the man's unfortunate fate. One of the young men working with the convicts, Jeff Barker (Wayne Morris), is an engineer, who is fresh out of the army. Mr. Saul invites Barker to the farm for dinner one night, and Mrs. Saul (Fay Bainter) wants the engineer to befriend her daughter, hoping that he would take an interest in her and ultimately want to marry her. Libby and Barker strike up a conversation, but since Libby is very interested in the fate of young Burnette, she asks the engineer what is going to happen to him. Barker replies that Burnette will be sent back to San Quentin for the attack on the foreman. Barker asks Libby to come dancing with him, but she is too shy to accept his invitation. Mr. Saul is disappointed in his daughter's reluctance towards Barker, and after the engineer leaves the farm he slaps Libby in her face. This brings Libby over the top and she tells her parents that she won't live like that anymore, with their hatred against each other, and she runs away from home that very night. When Libby has left, Mrs. Saul is forced to get up from her bed and go downstairs to communicate with her husband for the first time in many years. Libby and her dog make camp in a nearby cabin, and not long after they arrive, during a heavy rainstorm, Burnette joins her. He has escaped from the prison transport and comes to the cabin to seek refuge and hide. Libby, who is attracted to him, offers to help him get away. Burnette tells Libby of the reason for his imprisonment: he was arrested for fighting while he was enlisted in the Navy. Later on he committed a robbery while he was drunk, and a man was accidentally killed. After that incident he was sent to San Quentin, convicted for manslaughter. Libby and Burnette make a plan to elope to San Francisco together, but Libby has to go to the farm to get some clothes and supplies on the way. When she comes home she finds, to her surprise, that her parents have reconciled. They tell her that there is a posse out looking for Burnette, to bring him back to prison. The posse arrives at the farm while Libby is there and she has no way of escaping and returning to Burnette in the cabin. When Burnette doesn't hear from her he comes to the farm late at night, looking for her. He finds her and she hides him in the barn, and there, in the night, Libby and Burnette fall hopelessly in love with each other. Libby's parents are not aware that Burnette is hiding in the barn. Later, Burnette is nearly discovered by Barker, who is part of the posse, when he goes out to find a tire pump. Libby intercepts him and saves Burnette at the last second. Because of Libby's strange behavior, Mrs. Saul begins to suspect that something is wrong and eventually confronts the couple. Burnette and Libby run off just as Mr. Saul and Barker come to take Burnett. When Barker tries to stop them, Burnette knocks him down and drives off in the truck, leaving Libby behind. The rest of the posse follows Burnette and he is shot and wounded. Burnette's flight is prevented and he ultimately dies in Libby's arms. Libby and Barker make a new start.

Reception The New York Times reviewer ‚ÄúT.M.P.‚Äù praised the actors but criticized the plot: ‚ÄúIt's just a highly incredible... attempt at tempestuous drama. But the film is very well acted...With a more credibly defined story to support the performances, Deep Valley might easily have become an arresting picture.‚Äù Film critic Dennis Schwartz generally likes the film. He wrote, \\"A slow paced, b&w;, atmospheric melodrama, set in the mountains of northern California, about a farm girl, Libby Saul (Ida Lupino), romanced by an escaped convict, Barry Burnette (Dane Clark) ... The interesting part of the film revolves around the conflict Libby faces of running away with the violent fugitive she has fallen madly in love with or to have a secure marriage with the really nice engineer, someone she doesn't love. Deep Valley offers a melodramatic look at how love can make one feel alive again. The film comes to a boil with its very moving conclusion, after a very slow start.\\"Schwartz, Dennis.

Built about 1830, this half-Cape is a rare surviving example of a small farmstead with period outbuildings. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The Adams-Crocker-Fish House stands in a rural residential area of northwestern Barnstable, on the west side of Willow Street a short way south of its junction with Cedar Street. The property includes a Greek Revival Cape-style cottage and two outbuildings. The cottage is a 1-1/2 story \\"half-Cape\\" (three bays wide), with a gabled roof and wooden clapboard and shingle siding. A modern two-story ell extends to the left at a recess from the main block, and another ell projects to the rear. Across the driveway further to the left are two small rectangular utility buildings that are former farm outbuildings. The main entrance, in the left bay of the main block, has a Greek Revival surround with sidelight windows, simple pilasters, and a corniced entablature. Other buildings on the property The cottage was built before 1830 by Obadiah Adams, and is said by longtime residents to have originally stood at a location now occupied by the Mid-Cape Highway. It was moved to this location in 1831 by John Blossom, who had acquired the Adams estate. He sold the property the following year to Lemuel Crocker, whose widow sold it to Isaac Fish in 1856. It remained in the Fish family until 1903, and has since passed through a number of other private hands. It is historically significant for both the well-preserved form of the original half-Cape, and for the surviving outbuildings.

R. Marsden statue in Woodhouse Moor, Leeds Henry Rowland Marsden (20 July 1823 ‚Äì 19 January 1876) was a philanthropist and (Liberal) Mayor of Leeds for 1873 to 1875, said to be the most popular Victorian mayor of Leeds.M. Hall (1995) Leeds Statues Trail Leeds Civic Trust  Early life  Henry Marsden was born in Holbeck, Leeds on 20 July 1823 to poor parents, headed by an ex- military father. Having survived a potential drowning aged 6, he started work aged 7 making \\"yells\\" for just one shilling and sixpence. It is estimated that, aside from his periods crossing the Atlantic, Marsden was never out of work again, gaining new employment always on the same day he lost it, including several apprenticeships in engineering and a position teaching at the Sweet Street Wesleyan Methodist Sunday School, which he had once attended. Aged 15 Marsden took up one of these apprenticeships and began his lifetime of inventing, culminating with his first original design, a sliver roving machine for the use of flax spinners. By the end of his apprenticeship he had married Sarah Hawling, born on 10 December 1826 to a local butcher.  America  By April 1848 English trade was sufficiently poor that the new Marsden family emigrated to the United States, settling in New York for over a year here he began to build up his long list of engineering patents that would become the basis of his wealth, including but not limited to patents for a ‚Äúcut-off‚Äù for steam engines, several sugar mill \\"improvements\\", one of the best steam pumps in use for the rest of his life and \\"improvements\\" in lathes and planning machines. The family then moved to Newhaven, Connecticut in 1850, where Marsden's inventions and improvements continued to be conceived and produced, and it was here that he began to truly make a name for himself as a great engineer on the highway to fortune. In 1855, after a brief return to Leeds in the previous year, Marsden had made that which would make him world-famous amongst engineers; the Stone Crusher, which made profits far greater than Marsden or any of his colleagues could predict as it quickly sold across the globe. Despite his successes, Marsden's time in America was not without setbacks, and in 1858 a fire broke out in his store, above which the family lived, destroying effectively all their belongings and stock. Marsden and a Mr William Hubbell saved Marsden‚Äôs wife, two daughters and two other children of the family, with Marsden himself very nearly dying from the fumes and sustaining cuts from glass from a window broken by his head, then pushed through with his shoulder to save his four year old son.  Return to England  In spite of the fire, Marsden was able to return a wealthy man to Leeds in 1862, setting up a factory for patent stone-crushing machinery to take advantage of the demand at that time for road building.Leeds Mercury 19 January 1876, page 5 Sudden Death of Ald. Marsden He received 45 first class gold and silver medals and honours for his inventions,which continued to provide him with the wealth to enable him to donate both time and money to public life. His interest in local affairs led him to the Liberal Party and he was elected as local councillor for Holbeck in 1866 with the biggest majority then recorded, becoming an alderman in 1872 and mayor in 1873. He also served as chief magistrate for six years.Leeds Mercury 8 July 1882, page 8, Yorkshire Anecdotes - 193 Alderman Marsden's Generosity It was said that \\"from the beginning he conducted the business of the town and of the Council without consideration of sect, party or denomination, acting with strict impartiality and goodwill to all\\", with \\"prejudice, passion, and personal preference has been concealed by a manly English patriotism‚Äù. Additionally, he is recorded to have donated ¬£2,000 per year to good causes, and each \\"great local movement during 1873-4 and 1974-5 [was] either initiated or spurred on by his judgement, generosity, and energy\\".

It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and included in an expansion of Pittsfield's Park Square Historic District in 1991. It no longer houses a hotel, and has been repurposed for other uses. Description and history The former Allen Hotel building stands in downtown Pittsfield on the west side of Wendell Avenue Extension, just north of East Street (United States Route 7). It is a five-story steel and masonry structure, its exterior finished in buff yellow brick with marble trim. It is crowned by a flat roof with an extended cornice decorated with modillions and dentil moulding. The front facade is divided into three sections. The ground floor functions as a raised basement, with wide segmented-arch housing multipart windows flanking a deeply recessed entrance. A narrow trim string course runs at the base of the windows, with a wider one separating the first and second levels. The second through fourth levels each have paired sash windows in the center, sharing a common lintel, while the side bays have rectangular windows in an inverted Palladian form. Another string course separates the fourth and fifth floors, with three-part windows flanking central paired windows. The hotel was built in 1915 by Louis Larouche to a design by Joseph McArthur Vance, a prominent local architect. The site was originally the home of Pittsfield's first minister, Rev. Thomas Allen, and had remained in his family until 1913. Originally called the Park Hotel, it was renamed the Allen Hotel by new owners in the 1930s, and that name remained with it for some time. In 1991 it was operating as the Wendell House Hotel; it has since been repurposed for other uses.

The building was constructed in 1875 as a memorial to Nathaniel Briggs Borden by his family. It opened its doors on January 6, 1876. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. History The building is located on land once owned by Nathaniel Briggs Borden, an early Fall River businessman and politician who died in 1865. The building was designed as a memorial to him by his widow Lydia and his three adult children, Simeon, Nathaniel, Jr. and Louisa Borden Aldrich. The family obtained the services of noted Boston architects H.W. Hartwell and A.E. Swasey, who had previously designed several notable buildings in Fall River, including the Central Congregational Church on Rock Street and Simeon's mansion on Highland Avenue. Like these other structures, the Borden Block was also designed in the Ruskinian Gothic Revival style, featuring polychrome brick and carved stone details. The four story building was constructed by the Hull Brothers of Providence. Their initial cost estimate was $260,000. However, the cost of the building escalated during construction, largely attributed to foundation problems. Large mortgages were obtained by the Borden family from local banks. Shares in the building were also sold to several local businessmen. By July 1882, the three Borden siblings no longer owned the building.Historic American Buildings Survey At the time of its 1876 opening, the building's theatre boasted the second largest theatre in Massachusetts. The first program, on January 6, 1876, featured the Theodore Thomas Orchestra. Later, the theatre hosted the Boston Symphony Orchestra numerous times during the 1880s. The theatre also hosted various drama and comedy stage acts from the time that it opened well into the early 20th century, the motion pictures began to be shown. The building was also used for grand balls, political rallies and other events. The Academy Building in 2017 In addition to the theatre, the building's original design included commercial shops at street level and numerous offices in its upper levels. The Borden Block contained the city's first telephone exchange from 1879 to 1890, when it was relocated to its own building.Arcadia Publishing, Aug 14, 2003 In 1910, William J. Dunn became the sole owner of the building. In 1946, the Dunn heirs leased the building to Zeitz Theatre Company. It reopened in November 1946 after extensive renovations. During the 1960s and 1970s, the building fell into disrepair. It was acquired by the Fall River Redevelopment Authority in 1973, which had planned to demolish the building.Fall River Herald News, June 1975 Supplement In 1979, the Academy Building was photographed as part of the Historic American Buildings Survey. During the 1980s, the building was restored. The theatre portion of the building was removed.

Built in the early 1870s, it is one of the best preserved buildings on Circuit Ave, and is further locally significant as housing the offices of the Oak Bluffs Land and Wharf Company, which was responsible for much of the early development of the town of Oak Bluffs. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. History Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, located on the northeastern part of the island of Martha's Vineyard, was originally settled as part of Edgartown in the 17th century. In 1835 the Methodist camp known as Wesleyan Grove (now a National Historic Landmark) was established in the area. Development of the area as a summer resort became more formally organized with the establishment of the Oak Bluffs Land and Wharf Company in 1866. The company developed what was then one of the earliest planned communities, guiding the community's growth over the following years. In about 1871 the company constructed what is known as The Arcade. The building, designed by the locally prominent architect Samuel Pratt, is a three-story wood frame construction, originally with gingerbread- decorated balconies in front and back. The lower two floors are both the full width of the building, although the first floor is punctured by a passage connecting Circuit Ave. to Wesleyan Grove. The third floor is significantly smaller than the lower floors. The building has historically served a variety of purposes. At one time it housed the Oak Bluffs post office, and in 1886 it is known to have housed the town's public library. It now occupies a place in the heart of the Oak Bluffs commercial and retail district on Circuit Avenue.

He was the son of Rajchandra Dhar, a doctor, and Sushila Devi.Antaryoga (). Kolkata: Sri Goutam Dharmapal, Haimavati Prakashani, 1997 (Bengali year 1404), 3rd edition. He was a spiritually and intellectually inclined child, who by age 11 had memorised the Astadhyayi of PƒÅ·πáini and the Bhagavad Gita. He was named Baroda Brahmachari after going through the sacred thread ceremony. He also won a state scholarship as a teen and completed university IA and BA degrees at the University of Dhaka and an MA from the Sanskrit College of the University of Calcutta. At 16, he joined the Assam Bangiya Saraswata Math (the ashram), located in the village of Kokilamukh near Jorhat in Assam. He was a disciple of the ashram's founder, Paramahansa Srimat Swami Nigamananda Saraswati Dev, who initiated him into sannyas. Anirvan's new monastic name was Nirvanananda Saraswati. He taught at the ashram school and edited its monthly magazine Aryyadarpan. Scholar and writer Some time after 1930, Nirvanananda changed his name to Anirvan and ceased to wear the ochre swami's robes. He travelled widely in North India, eventually returning to Assam and establishing an ashram in Kamakhya near Guwahati. However, he continued to travel. In the 1940s, he lived in Lohaghat and Almora. Madame Lizelle Reymond documented some of this period in My Life with a Brahmin Family (1958) and To Live Within (1971). During this time, Sri Anirvan translated Sri Aurobindo's The Life Divine into Bengali (as Divya Jeevan Prasanga); this book, his first, was published in two volumes between 1948 and 1951. In 1953, Sri Anirvan moved to Shillong in Assam. His reputation as a Vedic scholar grew; and he wrote both in Bengali (chiefly) and in English (he was also fluent in French) on various aspects of Hindu philosophy (particularly Samkhya, the Upanishads, the Gita and Vedanta) and the parallels between Rigvedic, Puranic, Tantric and Buddhist thought. His magnum opus, Veda Mimamsa, was published in three volumes in 1961, 1965 and 1970. This work won him the Rabindra award. Though Sri Anirvan was a saint, he studied subjects such as Marxism and gardening; yet he called himself a simple baul . Sri Anirvan made his final move, to Kolkata, in 1965.

Probably built in the second half of the 18th century, it is a prominent local example of Georgian, and is also significant for its association with the locally prominent Abbot family. The tavern was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The former Abbot Tavern is located northeast of downtown Andover, on the northwest side of Elm Street a short way north of its junction with Wolcott Street. The street is a busy through street in a residential area. The tavern is a two-story wood frame structure, with a low-pitch hip roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It is five bays wide and three deep, with a center entrance sheltered by a projecting gabled vestibule. The vestibule entry is framed by pilasters, which rise to an entablature that extends around the projecting sides, and is topped by a gabled pediment. Windows are 8-over-6 sash on the first floor and 6-over-6 on the second; the latter are set close to the eave in the Federal style. A two-story hip-roof ell projects to the rear, its southern facade a continuation of the main block. The tavern's construction date is uncertain: it has traditionally been claimed to have been built about 1680, but the structure clearly has Georgian styling, and only first appears in town records in 1776, when Isaac Abbot petitioned to operate a tavern. The building is also notable for hosting George Washington when he visited the area in 1789. The tavern served as the town's first post office, and Isaac Abbot as its first postmaster. Abbot was prominent in local civic affairs, serving as a selectman and town clerk.

Built about 1780, it is one of the town's best surviving examples of an early Federal period farmhouse, built by a prosperous local farmer. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history The Simeon Alexander Jr. House is located in a rural setting south of the town center of Northfield, on the west side of Millers Falls Road (Massachusetts Route 63) about south of Pine Meadow Road. It is a rambling 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with an east-facing main block and a series of ells extending to the west. The main block is five bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a Victorian-era gabled portico. Joined to the main block and extending west is another 2-1/2 story section, with a south-facing entrance sheltered by a shed-roof portico. The interior of the main block has largely original finishes, including paintings executed on the walls of the north parlor. Although its central chimney has been removed, its base survives in the basement. The house, which has both Georgian and Federal features, is said to have been built in 1744 by Simeon Alexander, a military officer, but is more likely to have been built c. 1774 by his son, Simeon Alexander Jr. The younger man was an American Revolutionary War soldier; the property remained in the Alexander family until 1941. The Alexanders were among the town's first settlers, with George Alexander, their progenitor, arriving in 1673. The artwork on the parlor walls has tentatively been attributed to Noah Graves, an itinerant painter from nearby Sunderland, whose definitely attributed works in other buildings of the region it resembles.

Centered on the northern section of the long town common, the area has been the civic and commercial heart of the town since the 18th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991, and slightly enlarged in 2011. Description and history Amherst was originally part of Hadley, settled in 1661, and was itself known to have colonial settlements by 1728. It was incorporated in 1768. Its earliest focal point of settlement was in what is now its commercial business district, at the junction of Main and Pleasant Streets. No buildings surviving from this early date; the oldest house in the area is the Strong House, built in 1774 by Simeon Strong. Only a few buildings predate 1838, when a major fire devastated the downtown area. As a consequence of that and later fires, the character of the commercial buildings in the district is largely that of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Initially an agricultural area, Amherst flourished with the rise of both Amherst College and the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now UMass Amherst) as major institutions. When first listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991, it consisted of a group of mostly brick commercial buildings, built between 1836 and 1930, centered on the junction of South Pleasant, North Pleasant, Amity, and Main Streets, and Boltwood Avenue. The notable non-commercial buildings in the district include the Strong House (separately listed in 1984), the Grace Episcopal Church, the First Baptist Church, and Amherst Town Hall. The district includes the northernmost third of the town common, including a fountain. The district was enlarged in 2011 to include the Lord Jeffery Inn at 30 Boltwood Avenue.

He played one season in the KBO League for the Hyundai Unicorns in 2000. In 2007, he became the first player in Northern League history to bat .400. A journeyman minor leaguer, his one chance at playing in the majors was prevented by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Career Brinkley graduated from Sacred Heart University in 1991, however was not drafted by any Major League Baseball team despite batting .528 in his senior year. Brinkley instead played in the Netherlands and Italy for three years before signing with the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the independent Northern League. Brinkley had an outstanding winter season playing in the Mexican Pacific League in 1996 where he was named Baseball America's Winter Player of the year, as well as MVP of the Caribbean Series. Brinkley's winter success attracted the attention of the San Diego Padres, who signed him for the 1996 season at the age of 27. Assigned to the Single-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, Brinkley batted .363 and was named a California League All- Star. After spending two seasons in the Padres organization, Brinkley was dealt to the Pittsburgh Pirates, where he played for the Triple-A Nashville Sounds, and then the Rochester Red Wings of the Baltimore Orioles organization. It was with the Orioles organization in 2001 that Brinkley nearly reached the major leagues. When he was not recalled by the Orioles when the roster expanded on September 1, 2001, Brinkley flew to Australia at the conclusion of the International League season. The Orioles recalled Brinkley on September 10; however, Brinkley was stranded in Australia due to the September 11, 2001 attacks. By the time Brinkley was able to return to the United States, the Orioles had instead recalled Tim Raines, Jr. in his place. Brinkley would not get another opportunity to play in the majors despite playing in the Triple-A All-Star game in 2002. Brinkley would be granted free agency by the Orioles following the 2002 season. Since 2003, Brinkley has bounced around Independent league baseball, playing in the Northeast League, Atlantic League and Northern League, where he landed with the Calgary Vipers in 2006. Brinkley's greatest success to date came with the Vipers in 2007, where he became the first player in Northern League history to finish the season with a .400 batting average. Brinkley also led the league in runs and on-base percentage, while his 150 hits also set a league record. Brinkley was also named Baseball America's 2007 Independent League Player of the Year. Through 2007, Brinkley is a career .329 hitter, having played in over 1,500 games. Brinkley is in his third season with the Vipers, now playing in the Golden Baseball League for the 2008 season, his 15th professional season.

It consists of six roadways (in seven distinct segments) that provide circulation within the park, and that join the park to two connecting parkways, the Blue Hills Parkway and the Furnace Brook Parkway. The roadway network was designed by Charles Eliot in the 1890s, except for Green Street, which was added to the network in the 1940s. The parkways were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Blue Hill River Road, Segment One, and Hillside Street The first segment of Blue Hill River Road begins at a four-way junction with Washington Street (Massachusetts Route 138) and Royall Street (its western continuation) in Canton. It is about 1/2 mile in length, becoming Hillside Street at the Milton line. Its north side is dense forest with stone outcrops, and rising elevation into the hills. On the south side are a concrete sidewalk and a stone wall. The section of road provides access to Brookwood Farm, like the reservation administered by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). Hillside Street is the major east-west roadway through the western portion of the park, and is where most of its administrative functions are located. It winds for through the heart of the park, passing the park police headquarters among other facilities. Its first major junction is with the second segment of Blue Hill River Road, which exits to the south, just west of Houghton's Pond. After passing the headquarters area, it has junctions with Unquity Road and Chickatawbut Roads before crossing Pine Tree Brook near the reservation's northern border. The parkway ends there, but the roadway continues as a Milton municipal roadway, traveling roughly northeast in a straight line until it meets Randoph Avenue (Massachusetts Route 28). Blue Hill River Road, Segment Two This segment of road consists of two sections, which are roughly at right angles to each other but were historically a single roadway. From its northern junction with Hillside Street, Blue Hill River Road runs south, bordering the reservation to the east and private lands on the west. It soon reaches a three-way junction, where Ponkapoag Trail continues south to an interchange with Interstate 93, and Blue Hill River Road continues east, into the reservation. It ends at a small circular turnaround at the southeastern corner of Houghton's Pond. A nearby parking area provides access to a picnic area and recreational fields. The total length of this segment is . Chickatawbut Road Chickatawbut Road is the longest road in the reservation, running for nearly through Milton, Quincy, and Braintree. It winds through the hills, generally providing only views of dense woods, from its western terminus at Unquity Road and Hillside Street to its eastern end at Granite Street (Massachusetts Route 37) in Braintree. It provides access, however, to the Chickatawbut Observation Tower, which affords some of the best views in the reservation. Green Street Green Street is a road discontinuous from the others, on the western side of the reservation in Milton and Canton. It runs from Royall Street in Canton northeast to a junction with Washington Street in Milton, skirting the westernmost edge of the reservation. This section of the reservation was acquired in the 1940s; the road was originally a municipal street. Unquity Road Unquity Road extends north from its junction with Hillside Street and Chickatawbut Road in the north-central section of the park, running in a curvilinear manner very roughly parallel to Pine Tree Brook, for until it ends at a fourway junction with Canton Street (east-west) and the Blue Hills Parkway (north). It was originally planned as a southern continuation of the Blue Hills Parkway. Wampatuck Road Wampatuck Road runs for about through the far easternmost portion of the park in Quincy. Its western terminus is with Chickawbut Road at a point where the latter turns more southeast, and its eastern terminus is with the Furnace Brook Parkway at a large rotary that spans (and provides ramps on and off from) Interstate 93. The road provides access to the Granite Railway, another DCR property.

Sylvanus Thayer House, also known as the Sylvanus Thayer Birthplace, is an historic house at 786 Washington Street in Braintree, Massachusetts. It is operated by the Braintree Historical Society as the Thayer House Museum, which is open year-round. The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built in 1720 by Nathaniel Thayer and was subsequently expanded in the 1760s and again in the 19th century. General Sylvanus Thayer, known as the \\"father of West Point,\\" was born in the house in 1785 and resided there until 1793. In 1958, the parcel of land on which the house sat was purchased by the Walworth Steel Company; rather than tearing the old house down, it was dismantled and moved approximately one mile down Washington Street to its present location. Roughly 60% of the timbers in the house are original, while the others have been replaced during restoration with materials appropriate to the late 18th century. The house is furnished to represent a middle-class agricultural household, like the Thayer family, in 1785‚Äì1793. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The Braintree Historical Society constructed a reproduction post-and-beam dairy barn to complement the Thayer House Museum in that same year. Both contain exhibit galleries and are open to the public. A cannon that was a gift from the U.S. Military at West Point, is on the front lawn of the House. Both wheels were reconstructed in by a wheel wright and a blacksmith, one for the wood and one for the iron tread, working together in Colonial Williamsburg, using only tools and techniques consistent with the period. The wheels were reinstalled and the cannon was rededicated in a formal Commemoration Ceremony on the front lawn of the Thayer House with the Williamsburg craftsmen present, on June 21, 2015.

History Aida/Web was written in 1996. Its first commercial application was the Gas Billing System of the Slovenia national gas company in 1998. In 2000 Aida/Web was made open-source software and its web server part was merged with Ken Treis'sKen Treis's Something to Talk About Blog Hydrogen to form the basis of SwazooSwazoo Smalltalk Web Server an open-source, vendor-agnostic, Smalltalk web server. In 2003 BiArt/ISOUvod Quality management system was built onto Aida's core document management functionally (which now forms the core of the Scribo CMS). In 2005 BiArt/BPM web-based Business Process Management framework for executing business processes according to standard BPMN was built using Aida/Web. In 2007 the Aida/Web community developed its own mailing list and web site, and in 2008 Scribo has been developed on top of it. Community development Aida/Web is an open source project with a community providing support and development, with tutorials available in English, French and Spanish. Features Aida/Web provides: * Integrated Ajax support * Ajax libraries for Prototype and Scriptaculous * A collection of web components to build web pages programatically * MVC compliant separation of presentation from domain * REST-like bookmarkable url links * Integrated session and security management * Multilingual support * Real-time statistics * Built-in Joomla templates * A built in Swazoo web server * HTML is generated programatically Architecture First developed in 1996 by Janko Mivsek, Aida/Web was designed to integrate distinct object and web philosophies. Viewing the web as essentially a web of objects, Aida/Web declares that each object should have its own URI. This means that web pages can have meaningful, bookmarkable addresses, unlike some other approaches to web design. This idea anticipated a call one year later by Alan Kay at OOPSLA97Alan Kay: The Computer Revolution hasn't happened yet. Keynote OOPSLA 1997 where he suggested every object should have its own URI. Aida/Web aims to simplifying the inherent complexity found within multiple interacting objects, and is designed to reduce the need for difficult and complicated HTML programming. Since Smalltalk objects maintain their own state and respond to requests, Aida/Web uses the Smalltalk language with the aim of simplifying the building of web sites, providing dynamic content with persistent state management. The MVC paradigm is fundamental to Aida/Web because it provides distinction between the object model, the various presentations (views) of the objects and the control of their relationships. This provides clarity between the functional and presentational aspects of a web page and aims to overcome what its designers believe to be design and complexity issues otherwise created by use of HTML, Active Server Pages (ASP) and JavaServer Pages (JSP). This Model- View-Controller principle has been used in Smalltalk since the 1970s and has recently been rediscovered in Java Struts.Objects and the Web (Knight, A.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.  Early history  The district was granted to the town of Cambridge in 1734 as compensation for that town's responsibility in maintaining the first bridge across the Charles River connecting Boston to towns to the north, built in 1662.Isaac Stearns, History of Ashburnham, Massachusetts, 1887. Known as the Cambridge Bridge Farm, it remained unsettled until 1770, when John Adams of Menotomy (West Cambridge Parish) became the first settler with his new bride, Joanna Munroe. He was soon followed by other family members, including his father, Thomas Adams, Sr., a brother, Thomas Adams, Jr., a sister, Lucretia Adams Wetherbee, and a nephew, Thomas Russell. A community of interrelated settlers from the Adams and Russell families of Menotomy evolved. The principal occupation of many of the early settlers was the tanning of goat or sheep skins into Morocco leather. This Adams family had been early settlers in West Cambridge and were not related to the Presidential Adams family of Braintree.Stearns, Ibid.  Revolutionary period  The Adams and Russell families were closely connected to Revolutionary figures in Menotomy and Lexington. Joanna Munroe, wife of first settler John Adams (later known as the Centenarian), was the sister of Ebenezer Munroe, a Minuteman who may have fired the first shot on the British on Lexington green, April 19, 1775 in the Battles of Lexington and Concord.David Hackett Fischer, Paul Revere's Ride, 1994. and of Isaac Munroe, who was slain by the British that day. Ebenezer Munroe later removed to Ashburnham. Early settler Thomas Russell (a nephew of John Adams) was a second cousin of Jason Russell, owner of the Jason Russell House, who was killed in his kitchen in Menotomy by enraged British regulars on their return to Boston following their engagement at Concord.Samuel Abbot Smith, West Cambridge on the Nineteenth of April, 1775. Boston, 1864. Shortly after the Battle of Lexington and Concord, the first settlers were joined by Ethan Wetherbee and his wife, Lucretia Adams, a sister of John Adams the Centenarian.Stearns, Op. cit. Wetherbee had been keeper of the Black Horse Tavern in Menotomy, where the Massachusetts Committee of Safety and Committee of Supplies had met; by locking the tavern door he had saved Charles Lee, Azor Orne and Elbridge Gerry from capture by British troops passing through on their way to Concord on the night of April 18‚Äì19, 1775.Smith, Op. cit.  Twentieth century  Aldrich Bowker In the early twentieth century, the district became an active summer arts community. Home to writers and artists, it was noted for popular outdoor theatrical performances sponsored by the successful stage actor, Aldrich Bowker (1875-1947), one of its summer residents. Bowker succeeded Henry Travers in the role of Grandpa in George S. Kaufman's You Can't Take It with You on Broadway, and played it for over 500 consecutive performances in New York and Chicago. When Kaufman won the Pulitzer Prize for the play in 1937, Bowker was the presenter. He went on to play character roles in 25 motion pictures between 1939 and 1942, including The Major and the Minor and Abe Lincoln in Illinois.International Movie Data Base (IMDB), \\"Aldrich Bowker\\", author Allan F.

Built about 1818, this Federal period house is historically significant as a documented stop on the Underground Railroad, where fugitive slaves were sheltered. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Description and history The Whitmore House is located in a remote part of rural northwestern Ashburnham, at the end of Daniels Lane, a short road off Tuckerman Road. The rambling Federal style wood frame house is estimated to have been built in the second decade of the 19th century, probably after the 1818 marriage of Enoch Whitmore to Clarissa Willard, and the sale of the land on which it stands by Isaac Whitmore to his son. The house consists of a main block, which is a typical Federal period five bays wide and 2-1/2 stories high, and a series of additions on the back of the house. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a modest entablature. The relatively large size of the house is an indication of the status Whitmore had in the community, where he served in a number of civic posts. It is due to Enoch Whitmore's activities as an abolitionist and participant in the Underground Railroad that his house is significant. In this matter Whitmore was influenced by Charles Turner Torrey, who was known to be active in the assistance of fugitive slaves. The only fugitives he is documented to have sheltered are the family of Josiah Thomas, who escaped from Maryland slaveowners and were on his farm in 1847. The Thomases eventually settled in Ashburnham. Whitmore continued to be active in abolitionist circles, joining the Free Soil Party in the 1850s.

It was the town's second Methodist meeting house, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The South Harwich Methodist Church is locate on the north side of Chatham Road, at its junction with Old Country Road. It stands on a parcel of land that includes a cemetery established in 1829. It is a single-story wood frame structure, set on a brick foundation and covered by a gabled roof. Its exterior is clad in wooden clapboards, and has a combination of modest Greek Revival and Gothic Revival features. The corners of the building have pilasters, which rise to an entablature and gable returns at the roof edge. The main facade is symmetrically arranged, with two entrances flanking a central double window. Each of these elements is topped bya lancet-arched louver. The side walls each have three windows, also topped by lancet-arched louvers. A round-arch bay projects from the building rear. The interior is notable for its trompe-l'≈ìil paintings and generally intact original features; the only major modification has been the removal of a balcony at the rear. Oil lamps originally used for lighting have been electrified. Methodism was introduced to Cape Cod in the 1790s by Reverend Jesse Lee. The first Methodist church was built in East Harwich in 1799, and this, the town's second, was built in 1836 on land given to the congregation by John Paine Eldredge. The congregation was initially termed reform Methodist in belief, but underwent a schism over slavery and the nature of its services, and the building was retained by a more conservative faction. In 1878 it was united with the East Harwich Methodist Church, sharing a minister. By the time of the church's listing on the National Register, its congregation had dwindled in size to less than two dozen.

Cave diving is a form of penetration diving, meaning that in an emergency a diver cannot ascend directly to the surface due to the cave's ceilings, and instead may have to swim horizontally. The underwater navigation through the cave system may be difficult and exit routes may be at considerable distance, requiring the diver to have sufficient breathing gas to make the journey, resulting in potential deep diving risks. \\"Cave diving - Hazards.\\" Oneness Commitment. 1 1 . * Graham Balcombe (8 March 1907 ‚Äì 19 March 2000), a founder of the Cave Diving Group * George Benjamin, cave diving pioneer * Jeff Bozanic * Sheck Exley (April 1, 1949 ‚Äì April 6, 1994), cave diving pioneer * Nuno Gomes (born 1951), South African diver, holder of world records for deep diving and deepest cave dive * Jochen Hasenmayer (born 1941), German cave diver * Jarrod Jablonski (born 1969), pioneering technical diver and record setting cave diver * John Mattera (born 1962), technical cave diver mapping many uncharted cave systems in the Dominican Republic * Artur Koz≈Çowski (17 October 1977 ‚Äì 5 September 2011), Polish cave diver who died on a dive in Ireland * Jon Lindbergh (born 1932), oldest surviving son of Charles Lindbergh * Agnes Milowka (23 December 1981 ‚Äì 27 February 2011), Australian technical diver, underwater photographer and author * David Shaw (1954‚Äì2005), Australian cave diver who died attempting to recover the body of another diver from Bushman's Hole in South Africa * Jack Sheppard (31 March 1909 ‚Äì 14 July 2001), pioneer of cave diving in the United Kingdom and a founder of the Cave Diving Group * Don Shirley (born 1957), English cave diver * Wesley C.

He or she must be trained as a scientific diver, be a full member of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences and be an active underwater instructor from an internationally recognized certifying agency. He or she is responsible, for the conduct of the scientific diving program of the institution, including the conduct of training and certification, approval of dive plans, maintenance of diving records, and ensuring compliance with all relevant regulations. This organizational structure goes back to the model developed at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the early 1950s. The model spread from there to the other campuses of the University of California, then to other California institutions and then nationwide. It served as the model accepted by the American Academy of Underwater Sciences and OSHA. Those individuals who were part of the first generation of Diving Officers often had the opportunity to participate in many different undersea exploration programs and made singular contributions to those programs as well as the world of diving and submersibles. * Lloyd Austin - University of California at Berkeley  References  Kurson, Robert (2015).

Built in 1834, it was the only Universalist church built in Orleans, and is architecturally a well- preserved local example of Greek Revival architecture. The Meeting House is now the home of the Orleans Historical Society and is known as the Meeting House Museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history The meetinghouse is set on a short piece of River Road, between Main and School Streets, in the village center of Orleans not far from the town offices. The building is a two-story rectangular wood frame structure, set on a granite foundation, with a gable roof. The roof ridge runs parallel to River Road, which lies to the north, and the main gable-end facade faces roughly east. The walls are finished with painted wooden shingles, with broad paneled pilasters rising at the corners to an entablature that encircles the building below the roof line. The main facade is symmetrically arranged, with two entrances each flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature. Above each entrance at the second level is a sash window. The gable end is fully pedimented, with a small lancet-shaped window at the center. The interior of the building has a single large space, with a balcony gallery on three sides (excepting the west end). The original box pews were removed from the main floor, probably before 1900, with congregants apparently using folding chairs; box pews remain in the gallery. A 19th- century pressed metal ceiling obscures the original domed ceiling. The building now houses museum displays. The Universalist congregation of Orleans took form as early as 1832, when a number of congregants left the local Congregational Church over their theological differences. The new congregation was formally organized in 1833, and its new meetinghouse was built by David Taylor, Jr. on land donated by David Taylor, Sr., a former ship's captain and the local postmaster. The building was enlarged sometime in the 19th century by the addition of about to the west end; this probably took place between the 1840s and 1860s, when the congregation was at its largest. Faced with declining participation, the Universalists and Congregationalists reunited their congregations in 1939, holding services in the Congregational church and using this meetinghouse as a Sunday school. The building was sold to the Orleans Historical Society in 1971.

J. Franklin in 1809 Great Ealing School was situated on St Mary's Road, Ealing W5 London and was founded in 1698. In its heyday of the 19th century, it was as famous as Eton or Harrow, being considered \\"the best private school in England\\". History The school first took up residence in Ealing's Old Rectory. This was a moated house with a magnificent garden which stood next to the church of St Mary where Ranelagh Road now runs and all the way northward, along St Mary's Road to Warwick Road. The school had a swimming pool, cricket greens, tennis courts and the once famous Fives courts. A row of five cottages were used as studies. Opposite the school was the parish workhouse, where the poor and infirm slept three or more to a bed. The future King of France, Louis-Philippe, taught mathematics and geography at the school. He did this to support himself whilst living in exile in Twickenham between 1800 and 1815.

Eventually, the Rectory succumbed to dry rot and had to relocate in 1847. It moved from the north side of St. Mary's Church in Ealing on the eastern side of St Mary's Road to the western side of the same road and was renamed The Owls, which then formed part of its crest. In 1874, it became a day school teaching vocational subjects such as bookkeeping. In 1879, it changed again, becoming a school for Jewish boys. It closed in 1908 and the roads Cairn Avenue and Nicholas Gardens now stand upon the grounds. The latter is named after the famous headmastering family of its greatest period.

Emilio De Marchi (; January 6, 1861 ‚Äì March 20, 1917) was an Italian operatic tenor. He had a significant career during the late 19th and early 20th century, appearing at major theatres on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1900, he entered the annals of musical history as the creator of the role of Cavaradossi in Giacomo Puccini's Tosca. Today, however, he has largely been forgotten because, unlike many of his contemporaries, he did not leave a legacy of commercial gramophone or phonograph recordings. Singing career De Marchi came from Northern Italy's Lombardy region; he was born in Voghera. His voice was discovered during his military service, and he received professional singing lessons. In 1886, he made his operatic debut in Milan, at the Teatro Dal Verme, as Alfredo in Giuseppe Verdi's La traviata. Over the next few years he appeared at leading operahouses throughout Italy and Spain and was a member of a distinguished Italian operatic company which visited Buenos Aires in 1890. There he sang Don Jos√©, Enzo, and Faust (Gounod). De Marchi returned to Buenos Aires in 1895, 1896 and 1900 and his other roles were Raoul, Alfredo, Faust (Boito), Des Grieux (Puccini), Lohengrin, Tannh√§user, Turiddu, and Samson. In Buenos Aires, he was the first Rodolfo (1896), the first Cavaradossi (1900), and sang at the premiere of Beruti¬¥sTaras Bulba (1895). He debuted at Italy's leading opera house, La Scala, Milan, in 1898 as Stolzing in an Italian-language version of Richard Wagner's Die Meistersinger. He proved to be a success at La Scala and was chosen by the composer Puccini to sing the coveted role of Cavaradossi in the first performance of Tosca, which occurred at Rome's Teatro Costanzi on January 14, 1900. A rising young tenor named Enrico Caruso, 12 years De Marchi's junior, had hoped to create Cavaradossi; but in the end, Puccini, although greatly impressed by Caruso's voice, decided to entrust the part to the more experienced singer. When Puccini heard Caruso sing the role of Cavaradossi in Bologna the following November, he stated that he regretted his earlier decision. De Marchi sang Cavaradossi again at London's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1901. Cavaradossi was also his debut role the following year at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. During his New York sojourn, he sang the title role in the premiere Met production of Verdi's Ernani, which was mounted in 1903. His other Met roles were Radames, Alfredo, Manrico, Raoul, Rodolfo, Riccardo, Turiddu, Canio, Leandro (in Mancinelli¬¥s Ero e Leandro), and Don Jose. He returned to Italy and, in addition to a number of mainstream Italian operatic parts, he sang Max in Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz and Licinius in Spontini's La Vestale during his final seasons at La Scala. He died in Milan at the age of 56. De Marchi did not make any commercial recordings, but he can be heard clearly in a few fragments from Tosca that were recorded on the Mapleson Cylinders during a live performance at the Met on January 3, 1903. He sang with soprano Emma Eames as Tosca and baritone Antonio Scotti as Scarpia, with Luigi Mancinelli conducting. He is also audible in excerpts from Ernani, Aida, and Cavalleria Rusticana (the latter with soprano Emma Calv√©). Sources * Grove Music Online, J. B.

Tunisia has over ten million citizens, almost all of Arab-Berber descent. The Mediterranean Sea is to the north and east, Libya to the southeast, and Algeria to the west. Tunis is the capital and the largest city (over 800,000); it is located near the ancient site of the city of Carthage.See map at end of article.For background information on geography, see History of Tunisia preview. Its first modern leader, President Habib Bourguiba brought to the office hard-won political experience, after many decades of service in the leadership of the independence movement. As the major figure of the Neo-Destour Party, he was instrumental in obtaining full independence for Tunisia in 1956. He dominated the government until his removal in 1987. During his years in office, his accomplishments included: a law reform, economic policies which detoured briefly in a socialist direction, a moderate but steady improvement in standard of living, and a foreign policy which retained an independent approach while maintaining trade and economic connections to the west. Ben Ali became President of the Republic in 1987, and kept power until he was forced to leave in 2011. His economic policies emphasized a market orientation. His attempt at reapproachment with Islamist groups did not meet expectations. The ruling party was reorganized. Under his leadership Tunisia's economy continued to perform at a pace which yielded a moderate but overall steady rate of growth. A Constituent Assembly was elected following the overthrow of Ben Ali, which completed the task of drafting a new constitution and handed over to newly elected authorities in 2014, ushering in the Second Republic. Independence of the Kingdom of Tunisia Lamine Bey, first king and last bey of Tunisia An independence movement lasting many decades eventually prevailed, leading to the end of the French protectorate (commenced in 1881). In 1954 the Tunisian struggle and consequent civil disturbances resulted in the start of negotiations for autonomy between France and the Neo Destour political party (essentially under Habib Bourguiba) supported by the Tunisian labor unions and by the Arab League. The agreed Convention of April, 1955, stated that France would retain control of the army and foreign affairs while granting autonomy, which was to begin the following year. Bourguiba was released from prison by the French to a tumultuous welcome. This compromise, however, split the Neo Destour; eventually it led to suppression of its left wing, and expulsion of its radical, pan-Arab leader Salah ben Youssef (or Yusuf), who later fled to Egypt. This resolution of intra-party strife signalled that Neo Destour would pursue a moderate path. The French then terminated their protectorate over Morocco, in order to concentrate their forces in Algeria. In reaction, and following the strong public opinion voiced by Tunisians, Bourguiba pressed for independence. The French, overcoming the heated objections of the French settlers, eventually acceded and protocols were drafted. On 20 March 1956, Tunisia achieved its full sovereignty. In July Tunisia's application for membership in the United Nations was accepted. The French conceived an independent Tunisia as a constitutional monarchy ruled by the Bey of Tunis, Muhammad VIII al-Amin Bey (Lamine or Amin Bey). The Bey was an institution that dated back to the early Ottoman era. The prior Bey Muhammad VII al-Munsif (Moncef Bey) had been a popular nationalist, but Amin Bey was both considered by some to be compromised by the French, by others to be a youssefist. Already scheduled elections were held on 25 March 1956; due to secret arrangements negotiated by Bourguiba with the Bey the voters choose only party lists, not candidates. This arrangement made it easier for the Neo Destour party to keep out any youssefist or other dissidents, and to maintain party discipline.Cf., Geyer, Tunisia (London: Stacy 2003) at 41. Geyer notes the \\"pyramidal structure\\" of the Neo Destour, nonetheless she praises Bourguiba's \\"flexibility and moderation\\". The elections were then swept by the Neo Destour party, whose leader Habib Bourguiba became prime minister. On 25 July 1957, the monarchy was abolished, the beylical office terminated, and Tunisia proclaimed a Republic. The assembly then made Bourguiba the first president, of what would be a single-party state.Kenneth J. Perkins, A History of Modern Tunisia (Cambridge University 2004) at 125-129, 131-133.Lisa Anderson, The State and Social Transformation in Tunisia and Libya, 1830-1980 (Princeton University 1986) at 231-235.Ivan Hrbek, \\"North Africa and the Horn\\" 127-160, at 129-132, [under section \\"The struggle for political sovereignty: from 1945 to independence\\"], in Ali A.

Brace, Morocco Algeria Tunisia (Prentice-Hall 1964) at 114-116, 121-123. First Republic (1957 - 2014)  Presidency of Habib Bourguiba  The Neo Destour regime sought to run a strictly structured regime with efficient and equitable state operations, but not with democratic-style politics. In effect, Bourguiba dominated the country for the next 31 years. He governed with programs yielding stability and economic progress, repressing Islamic fundamentalism, and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation.Brace, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia (1964) at 142. The political culture would be secular, populist, and imbued with a kind of French rationalist vision of the state that was buoyant, touched with √©lan, even Napoleonic in spirit. Bourguiba then saw an idiosyncratic, eclectic future combining tradition and innovation, Islam with a liberal prosperity. Habib Bourguiba has been compared to Atat√ºrk (Mustafa Kemal) of Turkey, as a unique national modernizing leader. Yet, what may be called an inclination to arbitrary methods when making government decisions, and to a kind of personality cult, detracted from Bourguiba's insight and substantial achievements.Perkins, A History of Modern Tunisia (2004), e.g., at 130, 204-209. \\"Bourguibism\\" was also resolutely nonmilitarist, arguing that Tunisia could never be a credible military power and that the building of a large military establishment would only consume scarce investment resources and perhaps thrust Tunisia into the cycles of military intervention in politics that had plagued the rest of the Middle East. In the name of economic development, Bourguiba nationalized various religious land holdings and dismantled several religious institutions. While surely a secularist, he did not appear anti-religious.Bourguiba could bargain when opportunity offered. He negotiated with the Catholic Church; as a result Tunisia received scores of churches and land parcels to be used for libraries or museums, and the right to be consulted in the naming of future Church leaders. John K. Cooley, Baal, Christ, and Mohammad. Religion and Revolution in North Africa (Holt Rinehart Winston 1965) at 3-5, 297-298. Bourguiba's great asset was that \\"Tunisia possessed a mature nationalist organization, the Neo Destour Party, which on independence day held the nation's confidence in hand.\\" It had made its case to the city workers in the modern economy and to country folk in the traditional economy; it had excellent leaders who commanded respect and who generally developed reasonable government programs.Brace, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia (1964) at 141. =External and internal struggles= Habib Bourguiba, official photo as President of Tunisia. In July 1961 when Tunisia imposed a blockade on the French naval base at Bizerte, hoping to force its evacuation the crisis culminated in a three- day battle between French and Tunisian forces that left some 630 Tunisians and 24 French dead and eventually led to France ceding the city and naval base to Tunisia in 1963. One serious rival to Habib Bourguiba was Salah Ben Youssef. Exiled in Cairo during the early 1950s he had absorbed the pan-Arab nationalism associated with the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdul Nasser. Yet as a result of his strong opposition to the Neo Destour leadership during their negotiations with France for autonomy prior to independence, Ben Youssef was removed from his position as secretary-general and expelled from the party. Nonetheless he rallied disaffected union members, students, and others, enough to put 20,000 youssefists into the street during the next congress of the Neo Destour party. Eventually he left Tunisia for Cairo.Perkins, A History of Modern Tunisia (Cambridge Univ. 2004) at 117-118, 128-129.Ben Youssef was assassinated in Egypt in 1961. Brace, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia (1964) at 115-116, 142.After 1987, Ben Youssef was gradually \\"rehabilitated\\" and his body returned to Tunisia for burial. Perkins, A History of Modern Tunisia (Cambridge Univ. 2004) at 199-201. This was the end of any meaningful opposition to Bourguiba. In 1963, the Neo-Destour Party was proclaimed to be the only legally permitted party, though for all intents and purposes Tunisia had been a one-party state since independence. =Economy= Socialism was not initially a major part of the Neo Destour project, but the government had always held and implemented redistributive policies. A large public works program was launched in 1961.Brace, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia (1964) at 146-147. Nonetheless in 1964, Tunisia entered a short lived socialist era. The Neo Destour party became the Socialist Destour (Parti Socialiste Destourien or PSD), and the new minister of planning, Ahmed Ben Salah, formulated a state- led plan for agricultural cooperatives and public-sector industrialization. The socialist experiment raised considerable opposition within Bourguiba's old coalition. Ahmed Ben Salah was eventually dismissed in 1970, and many socialized operations (e.g., the farm cooperatives) were returned to private ownership in the early 1970s.Moncef M. Khaddar, \\"Tunisia\\" at 848-850, 849, in Joel Krieger (ed.), Oxford Companion to Politics of the World (2d ed. 2001). In 1978, a general strike was repressed by the government with its forces killing dozens, and union leaders were jailed. After independence, Tunisian economic policy had been primarily to promote light industry and tourism, and develop its phosphate deposits. The major sector remained agriculture with small farms prevailing, but these did not produce well. In the early 1960s the economy slowed down, but the socialist program did not prove to be the cure. In the 1970s the economy of Tunisia expanded at a very agreeable rate. Oil was discovered, and tourism continued. Foreign corporate investment increased. For example, Renault opened an auto manufacturing plant. City and countryside populations drew roughly equal in number. Yet agricultural problems and urban unemployment led to increased migration to Europe for work. =Politics in the 1980s= Rashid al-Ghannushi (around 1980) In 1981 the government allowed a few \\"officially sanctioned\\" parties to run for office. But the economy faltered. Austerity imposed by the I.M.F. caused increases in the price of bread. During the Tunisian bread riots of December 1983 ‚Äì January 1984 over 100 demonstrators were killed. The Islamic Tendency Movement (MTI) of Rashid al-Ghannushi came to the fore. Thousands were jailed, especially Islamists; critical newspapers were closed, disruptive trade unions disbanded. Security was headed by General Ben Ali. An ailing Bourguiba threatened severe repression. Tunisia continued its close ties to the West, both economic and political. From 1979 to 1991 the Arab League was located in Tunis. The P.L.O. was also based in Tunis from 1982 to 1994. On 1 October 1985, in Operation Wooden Leg, Israeli Air Force F-15s bombed the PLO's Tunis headquarters, killing more than 60 people. On the debit side, political democracy in the Western sense was more or less nonexistent. Even before Tunisia became a one- party state, it adopted a constitution vesting almost dictatorial powers in the presidency. Civil liberties were subject to \\"the limits prescribed by law,\\" per the constitution. The media were expected to practice self- censorship, and opponents were frequently imprisoned. Bourguiba became the focus of a personality cult in which he was extolled as the \\"Supreme Warrior\\" of the nation. In 1975, Bourguiba was proclaimed president for life, though his health was increasingly poor. Although he was prevailed upon to legalize opposition parties in 1981, Tunisia remained for all intents and purposes a one-party state. The Destourian Socialist Party, in alliance with the trade unions, swept all of the seats in parliament. The opposition was disgusted; it boycotted the next elections, in 1986. Era of Ben Ali In the 1980s the economy performed poorly. In 1983 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forced the government to raise the price of bread and semolina, causing severe hardship and protest riots. In this situation, the Islamic Tendency Movement (MTI) under Rashid al-Ghannushi provided popular leadership. Civil disturbances, including those by the Islamists, were repressed by government security forces under General Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The government persisted in following its program; Ben Ali was named prime minister. =Rise to the Presidency= Ben Ali, former President of Tunisia Ben Ali ascended to the office of President on 7 November 1987, after attending physicians to the former president filed an official medical report declaring Habib Bourguiba medically incapacitated and unable to fulfill the duties of the presidency. Two of the names given to Ben Ali's rise to the presidency include \\"the medical coup d'√©tat\\" and the \\"Jasmine Revolution\\". In conformity with Article 57 of the Tunisian Constitution, Ben Ali became acting president pending elections in 1989. The country had faced 10% inflation, external debt accounting for 46% of GDP and a debt service ratio of 21% of GDP, in addition to a bombing campaign and attempted government overthrow, for which 76 members of the radical ‚ÄúIslamic Tendency Movement‚Äù were convicted in 1987. In 1999 Fulvio Martini, former head of Italian military secret service SISMI, declared to a parliamentary committee that \\"In 1985-1987 we organized a kind of coup in Tunisia, putting president Ben Ali as head of state, replacing Burghiba (sic) who wanted to flee\\". Bourguiba, although a symbol of anticolonial resistance, was considered not capable to lead his country anymore, and his reaction to the raising Islamic integralism was deemed \\"a bit too energetic\\" by Martini: Bourguiba's threat to execute the suspects might have had strong negative implications in the neighbouring countries. Acting under directives of Bettino Craxi, Italian prime minister, and Giulio Andreotti, foreign minister, Martini claims to have brokered the accord that lead to the peaceful transition of powers.La Repubblica, 10 October 2010 Bettino Craxi had visited Algeria in November 1984, being warned by the president Chadli Benjedid that Algeria was ready to invade that region of Tunisia that was crossed by the pipeline towards Italy, if Bourguiba wasn't able to guarantee the stability of his own country. Algeria was trying to diversify its foreign policy, feeling isolated by Spain and by Mitterrand's accord with Morocco and Libya over Chad. For two years, according to Martini, Italian and Algerians secret services worked together in order, on one hand, to avoid that the growing destabilization of Tunisia might spillover in Algeria, and on the other hand to control pro- Palestinian terrorist activities in Italy. Finally, Ben Ali was singled out as possible replacement for Bourguiba: as chief of the Tunisian secret services and as Minister of Interiors, he had opposed plans for rough justice execution of fundamentalists. SISMI's action did not have the consent of Ren√© Imbot, head of the French secret service, and the United States were not informed. According to Martini, the SISMI didn't have an operational role in Ben Ali's raise to power, but organized a political move to support politically and economically his new government, avoiding that Tunisia might fell in an open confrontation with fundamentalists as would be in Algeria in the following years.La Repubblica, 11 October 1999 In 1994, following the Tangentopoli scandal and the Mani Pulite inquiry, Bettino Craxi fled from Italy to Hammamet in Tunisia, and remained a fugitive there, protected by Ben Ali's government. He repeatedly declared himself innocent, but never returned to Italy where he had been sentenced to 27 years in jail because of his corruption crimes (of these, 9 years and 8 months were upheld on appeal). He died on 19 January 2000, at the age of 65, from complications of diabetes. =Liberalisation, then repression= Ben Ali initially took some steps to liberalise the regime. He dismantled the personality cult surrounding his predecessor. He also amended the constitution to limit the president to a total of three five- year terms, with no more than two in a row. In 1988, several Islamist activists were released from prison. He also forged a national pact with the Tunisian party Harakat al-Ittijah al-Islami (Islamic Tendency Movement), which had been founded in 1981; later it changed its name to Ennahda (the Renaissance Party). He also changed the ruling party's name to the Democratic Constitutional Rally. However, Ben Ali's innovative tack did not work out well. Subsequently, An-Nahda claimed to have run strongly in the 1989 elections, giving it the appearance of being unfair; official results gave the RCD every seat in the legislature. Ben Ali subsequently banned Islamist political parties and reportedly jailed as many as 8,000 activists. At the same time, Ben Ali ran unopposed in Tunisia's first presidential election since 1972. At the time, prospective presidential candidates had to get the endorsements of 30 political figures. Given the RCD's near-total domination of politics, opposition candidates found it impossible to get their nomination papers signed. The 1989 crackdown led to the restoration of some Bourguiba-era restrictions. Increasingly, self-censorship gave way to official censorship. Ben Ali was reelected unopposed in 1994. After amending the constitution to allow a president to run for three consecutive terms, Ben Ali was reelected in 1999, 2004 and 2009‚Äîeach time by implausibly high margins (never falling below 89 percent of the vote) While the requirement to get signatures from 30 political figures had been lifted, opposition figures still faced nearly insurmountable obstacles. By the dawn of the 21st century, Ben Ali was reckoned as leading one of the most repressive regimes in the world. His regime consistently gained poor ratings from human rights and press freedom agencies. =Economic reforms= As president, Ben Ali championed economic reforms that strengthened Tunisia's economy and increased foreign investment. After he ascended to the office of President, Tunisia's per capita GDP more than tripled from $1,201 in 1986 to $3,786 in 2008. Although, growth in 2002 slowed to a 15-year low of 1.9% due to drought and lackluster tourism, better conditions after 2003 helped push growth to about 5% of GDP. For about 20 years after 1987, the GDP annual growth averaged nearly 5%. A report published in July 2010 by the Boston Consulting Group (\\"The African Challengers: Global Competitors Emerge from the Overlooked Continent\\") listed Tunisia as one of the African \\"Lions\\" and indicated that the eight African lions account for 70 percent of the continent's gross domestic product. Stable increases in GDP growth continued through positive trade relations with the European Union, a revitalized tourism industry and sustained agricultural production. Privatization, increasing foreign investment, improvements in government efficiency and reduction of the trade deficit remained challenges however. The 2010-2011 Global Competitiveness Report (Davos World Economic Forum) ranked Tunisia first in Africa and 32nd globally out of 139 countries. However, Tunisia continued to suffer from a high unemployment, especially among youth. Left out of the relative prosperity were many rural and urban poor, including small businesses facing the world market. This was the cause of mass protests in December 2010-January 2011 - the worst unrest the country had faced for at least a decade. =Diplomacy= During Ben Ali's presidency, Tunisia pursued a moderate foreign policy promoting peaceful settlement of conflicts. Tunisia took a middle of the road approach contributing to peacemaking especially in the Middle East and Africa. Tunisia hosted the first-ever Palestinian American dialogue. While contributing actively to the Middle East peace process, Tunisian diplomacy supported the Palestinian cause. As host to the Palestine Liberation Organization from 1982‚Äì1993, considerable efforts were made to moderate the views of the organization. Tunisia has, since the early 1990s, called for a \\"concerted\\" international effort against terrorism. It has also been a key US partner in the effort to fight global terrorism through the Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Initiative. President Ben Ali mostly retained his predecessor's pro-western foreign policy, though he improved ties with the Arab-Moslem world. He took several initiatives to promote solidarity, dialogue and cooperation among nations, initiating the United Nations World Solidarity Fund to eradicate poverty and promote social development based on the successful experience of the Tunisian National Solidarity Fund. Ben Ali also played a lead role in the UN's proclaiming 2010 as the International Year of Youth. =Loss of power = Starting in December 2010, Tunisian citizens began mass protesting against unemployment and Ben Ali's corruption. As mass protests grew, Ben Ali declared a state of emergency in the country, dissolved the government on 14 January 2011 and promised new legislative elections within six months. Later on that same day Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi went on state television to say he was assuming power in Tunisia and said that the President had left the country. Ben Ali fled the country on 14 January at 4:00 pm local time on a flight bound for Dubai and arrived in Saudi Arabia early on Saturday 15 January, where he was welcomed by Saudi authorities. The protests became known as the Tunisian Revolution.

Lebanon became part of the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon and administered from Damascus and officially part of the French colonial empire.BBC: Lebanon profile - Timeline From November 1929 to November 1931, Charles de Gaulle was posted as General Staff of the Levant Troops in Beirut.Le Commandant De Gaulle au levant de 1929 √† 1931 (in French) Initially during World War II, Lebanon was administered by Vichy France, however, by 1942, the territory came under Free France. In August of that same year, General De Gaulle returned to Lebanon to meet with the occupying British forces who entered the territory to prevent German advances into the levant.Et√© 1942 : Le G√©n√©ral De Gaulle en Syrie et au Liban Dans le contexte des difficiles relations avec les Britanniques (2/2) (in French) In March 1943, using the 1932 census, France distributed seats in the Lebanese parliament on a ratio of six-to-five in favor of Christians. This was later extended to other public offices. The president was to be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies a Shia Muslim. In January 1944, France agreed to transfer power to the Lebanese government, thus granting the territory independence. Lebanese Civil War During the Lebanese Civil War, France was an active member in the creation of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and voted in favor of numerous UN Resolutions regarding Lebanon such as Resolution 501, Resolution 508, Resolution 511, Resolution 511, Resolution 594 and Resolution 599. France was also a member of the Multinational Force in Lebanon and in 1982, during Operation √âpaulard I, headquartered from the Beirut Internal Airport, French Armed Forces and Paratroopers were sent to the coastal parts of West Beirut and the seaport to ensure peace in those regions. From 1982 - 1984, France was tasked with training the Lebanese Armed Forces. During that same period, France lost more than 89 soldiers out of which 58 French Paratroopers were killed in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings.Attentat du Drakkar : 30 ans apr√®s le drame, des larmes et des doutes (in French) Post civil war French legionnaires on guard during the evacuation of the PLO from Beirut; 1982. After 1990, France continued to give Lebanon a modest military assistance. Since the end of the Lebanese civil war, relations between both nations have improved and strengthened. With regards to policy of cooperation and development between both nations, there are five main objectives: the consolidation of the rule of law, economic and social development, protection of the environment and heritage, university cooperation and research, cultural exchanges and the debate of ideas.Diplomatie: Relations bilat√©rales (in French) There have been numerous high-level visits between leaders of both nations. After the Cedar Revolution in 2005, Syria withdrew its troops from the country. In April 2009, French and Lebanese officials approved the framework of a security agreement that besides improving bilateral relations include drugs and arms trafficking, illegal immigration and cyber-crime. On 4 November 2017, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned in a televised statement from Saudi Arabia, citing Iran‚Äôs and Hezbollah's political over- extension in the Middle East region and fears of assassination. Later that month, with the intervention by French President Emmanuel Macron, Hariri was allowed to leave Saudi Arabia (where he also holds citizenship) and travelled to Paris. On 5 December 2017, Hariri rescinded his resignation and stated: All (the government‚Äôs) political components decided to dissociate themselves from all conflicts, disputes, wars or the internal affairs of brother Arab countries, in order to preserve Lebanon‚Äôs economic and political relations. Lebanon's Hariri rescinds resignation, drawing line under crisis French President Emmanuel Macron's intervention was aimed in part to put pressure on Saudi Arabia and Iran to desist from interference in Lebanon. Migration Since the French Mandate of Lebanon, several thousands Lebanese immigrated to France. Initially, most Lebanese people who migrated to France were Christians. However, most of those who migrate from Lebanon to France are now Muslim.Lebanon: A Country of Emigration and Immigration Many left Lebanon due to religious tension in the country and due to the civil wars and invasion from Israel into the country.

Around 33% of households in the village have 1-5 members, 51% have 6-10 members and 17% have over 10 members. About 10% of the population over ten years of age is illiterate, women making up 78% of this statistic. In addition, 43% of the student population are females.

Deir al-Hatab's village council claims unemployment has dramatically increased from 30% in 1999 to 90% in 2001. Because Elon Moreh and its outposts overlooks and is in proximity to half of the land, Palestinian farmers have in the last decade been allowed only a few days each year to tend their fields, after coordinating with the Israeli occupation army. From 2002 to 2007 the IDF banned the villagers from working their land, and settlers began to plant new olive trees and grapevines on private lots. A 'disruptive use' injunction was issued in January 2007 by Major General Yair Naveh, allowing Palestinian authorities to remove settlers who had engaged in illegal cultivation of local lands in the preceding 3 years. The ordinance has not deterred settler appropriation of Deir al-Hatab's land, according to Amira Hass, and injunctions are often not implemented. In 2007, Israeli settlers from Elon Moreh put a plastic swimming pool by the spring which supplies Deir al-Hatab with 40% of its drinking water. They diverted the water from the spring to their pool.

After his ordination he accepted a call to care for his countrymen in the United States, and arrived in New York in October, 1837. The unorthodox opinions of the New York Lutherans displeased him, and he left for Missouri early in 1839. Things were no better there, so he returned to New York. Denominational dissensions weakened his faith, and in 1840 he became a Roman Catholic. An account of his conversion in pamphlet form published 25 March 1840, had quite a vogue in the controversial literature of the day. After his conversion he taught German at St. John's College, Fordham; later he edited in Cincinnati the \\"Wahrheitsfreund\\", a German Catholic weekly, and in 1846 he left for Baltimore where he founded the weekly \\"Kirchenzeitung\\". Under his editorial direction, it was the most prominent German Catholic publication in the United States. In 1851, he moved the paper to New York. In 1869 he published \\"Altesund Neues\\".

The guides provide practical, clinician-friendly advice on all aspects of evidence-based medicine. As articles During the late 1970s a group of clinical epidemiologists at McMaster University including Dr. David Sackett prepared a series of articles to assist clinicians interpreting clinical research. These articles, introducing the term \\"critical appraisal\\", appeared in the Canadian Medical Association Journal beginning in 1981. In 1990 Dr. Gordon Guyatt introduced the term \\"evidence-based medicine\\" to stress the role of rigorous, systematic evidence from clinical research in conjunction with patients‚Äô values and preferences in clinical decision-making.Guyatt GH. Evidence-based medicine. ACP Journal Club. 1991;114:A-16. A group of academic physicians subsequently formed the international Evidence-based Medicine Working Group and published a 1992 article announcing the \\"new paradigm\\" of evidence-based medicine. The Evidence-based Medicine Working Group decided to build on the popular series in the Canadian Medical Association Journal by creating a more practical approach to applying the medical literature to clinical practice. Championed by Dr. Drummond Rennie, an editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, the result was the Users' Guides. The guides originally consisted of 25 topics, covered in a series of 32 articles published in the Journal of the American Medical Association between 1993 and 2000, describing approaches to different types of medical questions and the study designs that may answer them.

Books Dr. Guyatt and Dr. Rennie edited the articles and compiled them to form a book titled Users' Guides to the Medical Literature: A Manual for Evidence-Based Clinical Practice. The books teach a systematic approach to reading and applying the medical literature to individual patient care. It focuses on three questions: 1. Whether new information is likely to be valid, 2. What the information says about patient care, and 3. How the information can be used. To demonstrate the clinical relevance of the suggested approach, each section begins with a practical clinical scenario. The chapter is then structured around identifying the best available evidence and applying the three key questions to the evidence, in the context of the clinical scenario. Each chapter concludes with a resolution of the scenario. Most of the book chapters are based on specific types of clinical questions, including questions of therapy, harm, diagnosis, and prognosis. Other chapters deal with general skills that are important for all clinical questions, such as ‚ÄúFinding the Evidence‚Äù, ‚ÄúSummarizing the Evidence‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMoving From Evidence to Action‚Äù. The Users' Guides come in two book versions: the Essentials introduces the concepts of evidence-based medicine (EBM), with which every practicing clinician should be familiar, while the Manual provides a more comprehensive, in-depth exploration of EBM concepts for clinicians seeking a deeper understanding, or for those who wish to teach EBM. Website The complete text of the second edition of the Users‚Äô Guides Manual is available online by subscription. The JAMAevidence website also includes a large number of calculators, worksheets and additional aids for the practice of EBM, including the updated and edited collection of another long-running JAMA article series, The Rational Clinical Examination: Evidence-based Clinical Diagnosis.

The company performed in French and gave the American premieres of many French operas. It was located on Orleans Street between Royal and Bourbon. The plans for the theatre were drawn up by Louis Tabary, a refugee from the French colony of Saint-Domingue (Haiti). Construction began in 1806, but the opening was delayed until October 1815 (after the War of 1812). After a fire, it was rebuilt (with the adjacent Orleans Ballroom) and reopened in 1819, led by another √©migr√© from Saint-Domingue, John Davis. Davis became one of the major figures in French theatre in New Orleans. The theatre was destroyed by fire in 1866,Belsom 2007.Joyce & McPeek 2001. but the ballroom is still used. History of the theatre The Orleans Theatre and Ballroom, 1838 1819‚Äì1837: John Davis In the first five seasons under the leadership of Davis, the Th√©√¢tre d'Orl√©ans presented 140 operas, including 52 American premieres. The repertory consisted primarily of French operas by composers such as Boieldieu, Isouard and Dalayrac. Shows could only be given from autumn through the spring, ending when the heat and humidity forced it. Unable to perform during the summer months, Davis came up with a way to continue to make money even during the summer. Beginning in 1827, Davis took the company on six tours to the northeastern United States, bringing unfamiliar repertory to Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, and in the process brought national recognition to the theater.Crawford 2001, p. 191 The Th√©√¢tre d'Orl√©ans soon became part of a rivalry with the Camp Street Theatre, run by James Caldwell and founded in 1824; Camp Street focused on operas performed in English. In 1835, both theatres produced Meyerbeer's Robert le diable. Although Caldwell's English version (as Robert the Devil) opened on March 30, ahead of Davis's French version, which finally reached the stage on May 12, the latter production was thought to be \\"closer to both the singing and the staging demands of the opera.\\" Later that year, the Camp Street Theatre opened a new facility, the St. Charles Theatre, and hired Montresor's company from Havana to perform Italian opera, among which were the American premieres of Vincenzo Bellini's Norma (1836), Beatrice di Tenda (1837), and I Capuleti e i Montecchi (1841), as well as Rossini's Semiramide and Donizetti's Parisina in 1837. 1837‚Äì1853: Pierre Davis Davis was succeeded as director of the Th√©√¢tre d'Orl√©ans by his son Pierre in 1837. In the 1837-38 season Mademoiselle Julie Calv√© joined the company and was the leading soprano throughout the next decade. She sang Henriette in the American premiere of Halevy's L'√©clair and was New Orleans' first Lucie and Anne de Boulen, its first Louise (Norina) in Don Pasquale, and Valentine in Les Huguenots. She also sang Pauline in Donizetti's Les martyrs.Warrack & West 1992; Kutsch & Riemens 2003, p. 692. The theatre remained the dominant venue in New Orleans during the pre-Civil War period. Competition with Caldwell's St. Charles Theatre and his New American Theatre ended in 1842, when both were destroyed by fire. With Caldwell's competition out of the way, the Th√©√¢tre d'Orl√©ans entered a period of dominance in New Orleans' cultural life. The company again performed in the northeast United States in 1843 and 1845. During the spring of 1844, New Orleans was visited by the important French soprano, Laure Cinti- Damoreau. During her brief visit she was heard on two evenings as Rosine in Le Barbier de S√©ville. During her two-year appointment at the theatre, Rosa de Vries-van Os sang in many well known roles. Most memorable would be her role on 21 April 1852 as Fid√®s in Meyerbeer's Le Proph√®te. The very day after her performance she gave birth to a daughter who, unsurprisingly, took the name Fid√®s Devri√®s. Both Fid√®s and her sister Jeanne would become popular sopranos in their own right during their lifetimes. 1853‚Äì1859: Charles Boudousqui√© Pierre Davis was succeeded by the American-born Charles Boudousqui√©, husband of the soprano Julie Calve, in 1853. Boudousqui√© staged many more American premieres, and featured international stars like the German soprano Henriette Sontag and the Italian Erminia Frezzolini (1818‚Äì1884). In 1859 the Th√©√¢tre d'Orl√©ans was superseded by the French Opera House, which was built by Boudousqui√© after a quarrel with the owner of the Th√©√¢tre d'Orl√©ans. Orleans Ballroom In 1817 John Davis engaged architect William Brand to design the Orleans Ballroom (Salle d'Orl√©ans) next to the theatre.Fraiser 2003, pp. 104‚Äì105. It was the site of many subscription balls, carnival balls, and masquerades and catered to the most select of New Orleans society. For gala events the ballroom could be joined to the theatre, where temporary flooring was laid over the pit, making one enormous ballroom. The facilities also included gambling rooms, \\"for those unlucky at love.\\"Kmen 1966, p. 20. When the noted American architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe visited in 1819, he judged it to be the best in the United States.Kmen 1966, p. 21. The Marquis de Lafayette was entertained here during his six-day visit in 1826.Arthur 1936, p. 84. The famous New Orleans bals du cordon bleu (quadroon balls) were usually held at the Salle de Cond√© at the corner of Chartres and Madison streets, but were also occasionally held at the Orleans Ballroom. At these events wealthy, respectable Creole gentlemen would court young mixed-race women and provide them with a house in the Faubourg Trem√©. Many duels were fought over these \\"Quadroon Mistresses\\". The ballroom survived the 1866 fire that claimed the theatre and in 1873 was purchased by mulatto Thomy Lafon, who was named for architect Barth√©lemy Lafon.Fraiser 2003, p. 105. It became a convent and school for the Sisters of the Holy Family, a religious order founded in the city ‚Äì the first female-led African-American religious order in the country. The old ballroom became their chapel. Once, when a sister was showing a visitor the convent, she stopped at the chapel door. \\"This is the old Orleans Ballroom; they say it is the best dancing floor in the world. It is made of three thicknesses of cypress. That is the balcony where the ladies and gentlemen used to promenade. Down there, on the banquette, the beaux used to fight duels.\\"\\"The Life of a Building: 1817‚Äì2011\\" at old-new-orleans.com In 1964, the ballroom was bought and renovated by the Bourbon Orleans Hotel; today it can be, once again, used as a ballroom.

The specific subject matter of each episode shifts from week to week, ranging from planets and stars to cosmology and mythbusting. Premiering on September 10, 2006, the weekly show is co-hosted by Fraser Cain, the editor of the space and astronomy news site Universe Today, and by Dr. Pamela L. Gay, a Senior Education and Communication Specialist and Senior Scientist for the Planetary Science Institute and the director of CosmoQuest. Each show usually has a length of approximately 30 minutes, and all shows, past and present, are accessible for download through the Astronomy Cast archive, as well as in podcast format. The Astronomy Cast official website also hosts the blog Astronomy Cast LIVE, which covers select astronomy meetings using various bloggers, including Cain, Gay, and Phil Plait, as well as recent astronomy-related news and events. A public forum, the Astronomy Cast Forum, where registered members and site visitors may share and exchange valuable information can also be found on the website and is created under Bad Astronomer and Universe Today Forum. Format Labeled as \\"a fact-based journey through the cosmos\\" that aims to help the listeners understand \\"not only what we know, but how we know what we know,\\" the show offers a large amount of information in the form of a conversation between the two co-hosts, with more resources and show notes available on the show's website to aid the listeners in their attempt to understand the material covered. Several \\"enhanced\\" podcast episodes accompanied by pictures have also been released, but this experiment was terminated due to the large file size associated with the pictures and small number of downloads compared to the regular format. There are also episodes in which listeners' questions are answered. Initially the question shows were produced irregularly (ten shows as of September 2008), but as the number of questions received increased a question show will be released weekly when possible. The hosts have also experimented with student questions shows where they have sent recording equipment to schools who have requested it. The students have then recorded questions to ask the hosts, which are then answered and edited into a special show available separately on the Astronomy Cast website. As of June 2008, two shows have been done in this format, and this ongoing project has been sponsored by NASA's Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope. Astronomy Cast has covered a wide variety of topics ranging from the planets in our solar system to the end of the universe, from the big bang to black holes. All previous episodes can be downloaded from the Astronomy Cast website archive in MP3 format or through major pod-catching software such as iTunes. As of September 2019, the shows are streamed live on the Astronomy Cast YouTube channel and are co-streamed live on CosmoQuest's Twitch channel. The opening 20 - 30 minute segment dealing with the topic of the week is then later converted into podcast format. Where time permits, both hosts often continue to stream for approximately another half hour, answering questions posed to them on the topic just covered, as well as other astronomy & science related subjects. The questions are posed by viewers of the live stream who post in the YouTube chat during the broadcast, as well as on other social media platforms. The full, unedited version of the video is then uploaded to the Astronomy Cast channel, as well as to those of CosmoQuest and Fraser Cain, while the edited podcast is uploaded soon after. Audience The listeners of Astronomy Cast vary widely in demographics, but the vast majority is between the ages of 18 and 53 according to a conducted survey. It is believed that the lack of young listeners is caused by the fact that Astronomy Cast may prove slightly too advanced for a younger audience and that the shortage of older listeners is due to the generation's relative unfamiliarity with technology and portable devices. Moreover, although Astronomy Cast is aimed at both the male and female audiences, only about 9% of the listeners are female. Milestones , Astronomy Cast has produced over 400 podcasts. In September 2018, Astronomy Cast recorded its 500th episode in front of a live audience, in addition to the usual YouTube live stream. The event was part of the AC:500 celebration, an event which was primarily organized & executed by the fans & supporters of the series, and in association with the Weekly Space Hangout, which also recorded & streamed a live episode during the event. The event was held in Edwardsville, IL, from September 14‚Äì16, 2018, and included a live recording of one of Cain's \\"Q & A\\" videos on various space-related topics, an astronomy-inspired \\"planet painting\\" art session with Dr. Gay, and a sidewalk astronomy event held in conjunction with various fans of the show, members of local star-gazing societies, which was open free of charge to the general public & passers-by. Astronomy Cast was nominated for the Technology/Science section of the 2008 People's Choice Podcast Awards.

It was designed by Harold Boultbee to meet the requirements of Air Ministry Specification 23/25 for a replacement for the Hawker Horsley in the day bomber role,Mason 1994, p.195-196. competing against the Blackburn Beagle, Hawker Harrier, Gloster Goring and Westland Witch. The Hare was a conventional biplane, with single-bay unequal-span staggered wings, of mixed wood and metal construction (although the specification required that any production aircraft be of all-metal construction). It had a crew of two with the pilot in an open cockpit aft of the wing with a gunner/bomb aimer behind him. Only one aircraft was built, with the serial J8622. It was first flown on 24 February 1928, powered by a Gnome-Rh√¥ne Jupiter as the planned Jupiter VIII was unavailable.Barnes 1976, p.269. Testing showed that the aircraft had poor handling and was prone to vibration, and it was modified with a 2 ft (0.61 m) longer fuselage and a revised tail, which improved handling. It was decided to modify the aircraft so that it could meet the requirements of Specification 24/25 to replace the Horsely in its other role as a shore-based torpedo bomber.Barnes 1976, p.270. The Hare was unsuccessful in meeting both competitions, with the day bomber competition being abandoned in favour of purchasing the more advanced Hawker Hart built to Specification 12/36, while the torpedo bomber requirement was met by the Vickers Vildebeest.Mason 1994, p.196. It remained in use with the Royal Air Force as a trials aircraft until 1932. It was then sold for a proposed long-distance flight by J.N. Addinsell and registered G-ACEL. The Hare was flown to London Air Park, Hanworth in 1933 where it was redoped and painted in civilian colours. It never flew again and was scrapped in 1937.Jackson 1973, p.343.

Its congregation developed from the Free African Society, a non- denominational group formed by blacks who had left St. George's Methodist Church because of discrimination and segregation by class. They were led by Absalom Jones, a free black and lay Methodist preacher. As his congregation became established, he was ordained in 1802 by Presiding Bishop William White as the first black priest in the Episcopal Church. Bishop White also ordained William Levington as a deacon at this church, although he soon became a missionary in the South, establishing St. James Church in Baltimore in 1824. The congregation remains within the Episcopal diocese of Philadelphia, although as discussed below its location changed several times. St. Thomas became a leading institution in Philadelphia's black cultural life. Its second rector was William Douglass, an African American, former student of Rev. Levington, and an abolitionist. Clergy and parishioners were active in the Underground Railroad in the 19th century, and participated in the modern Civil Rights Movement in the mid to late 20th century. St. Thomas was the first black church in the country to purchase a pipe organ, and the first to hire a black woman as organist, who was Ann Appo. p. 603 Other notable organists were John C. Bowers and his brother, Thomas J. Bowers.  Location  While the congregation has worshipped in several different buildings, it has remained continuously active since its founding. The site of the original building, dedicated on July 17, 1794, at Fifth and Adelphi streets, is now covered by the passageway/plaza known as St. James Place. It also worshipped for a time on Twelfth Street south of Walnut Street, before following changing demographics and moving out of the downtown area to West Philadelphia, where the congregation worshipped at 57th and Pearl streets, and 52nd and Parrish streets.

He also performs guitar and lead vocals in Spinalcord (formerly known as Aushvitz) and was formerly a member of Animetal. On September 29, 2010 he released a cover album named Crying Stars -Stand Proud!-, covering songs from Scorpions, Stratovarius, Yngwie Malmsteen, Skid Row, M.S.G., Racer X and more. It features some of his bandmates from Galneryus and Spinalcord, as well as other well-known musicians like Eizo Sakamoto (Anthem), whom Syu was in Animetal with.  Biography   Early life  Syu, born in Kansai, Japan, first began playing violin at the age of 6 years, and he also played piano. He continued playing violin until he was 12‚Äì13 years old. While in the fourth grade of elementary school, Syu discovered a passion for drums, which was fuelled by listening to X Japan. He says he found it easy to change from violin to guitar because they have similarly styled movements and finger patterns. He continued playing the drums for the band Cross-Large, but enjoyed the guitar more, as it was easier and he could better express himself through guitar than through drums. He soon gave up drums altogether, when he couldn't find good band members to play with.  Valkyr  Syu joined visual kei band Valkyr in August 1998, nearly a year later they released their first demo tape, titled \\"Love of Insanity\\". In August 2000, they released a \\"making of\\" VHS. In 2001 they finally released their first single, \\"Batta\\". After releasing 5 demos, a single and a VHS, the band broke up on April 24, 2002.  Galneryus  During his time with Valkyr he also formed the band Galneryus, which was a power metal band that he started with famous singer Yama-B. He started this band whilst he was living in Kujo, Osaka and heard him singing on the radio. Then they began working together as they were from the same area and made Galneryus. They hired support musicians A on Keyboards (who had previously played with Syu on Valkyr), Sh√¥go Himuro on Bass, and Toshihiro Yui (formerly of Cemetery, Honey Quest) on Drums. They went on to release a 2-track demo titled \\"United Flag\\". After playing live for a long time, they went back to record their second EP Rebel Flag with the independent label Iron Shock, with Yoshinori Kataoka on keyboards (replacing A). In 2002, Galneryus were signed to VAP, and began work on the first full-length album titled The Flag of Punishment. They released their next album, Advance to the Fall, in 2005. They then released their third album Beyond the End of Despair... in 2006. In 2007 they returned again with their fourth full-length album One For All ‚Äì All For One. In 2008 they released their fifth album, Reincarnation, this would be the last album with Yama-B on vocals, as he decided to leave. He was replaced by Masatoshi \\"Sho\\" Ono and in 2010 they released their sixth full-length album, aptly titled Resurrection.  Spinalcord  While he was still in the early days with Galneryus, Syu started another side project, with former fellow Valkyr member Kyoichi, called Aushvitz in 2002, in which he plays guitar and also does the main vocals. This style is much darker than his other projects. They released their first single, \\"Akarui\\" in September that year. They went on a very slow pace and went silent for a long time, but announced in 2006 that they were coming back as trio with Galneryus drummer Junichi. In the summer of 2008, Aushvitz was renamed Spinalcord and released their first maxi-single \\"The Spinalcord\\" on December 25, 2008. On April 4, 2009 they released their second maxi-single \\"Spinalcord 2\\". On September 23, 2009 they released their debut album Remember Me'Til Your Dying Day. With the change in the band's name also came a change in direction, which besides the old style now also incorporates a more popular style.  Animetal and other work  In 2003, Syu joined Animetal as their new guitarist. He recorded five full-length albums with them before they went on indefinite hiatus in 2006. Syu contributed significantly to the first solo album by Rami, 2016's Aspiration.  Style and influences  Syu's style of playing has been likened to that of Yngwie MalmsteenExclusive interview with Syu jame-world.com and many neo-classical guitarists. Syu himself lists some of his influences as: Kyoji Yamamoto, John Petrucci,Galneryus im Ohanami Interview & #Fanfaces! (English translation inside!) Ulrich Roth, Gary Moore, Paul Gilbert and Michael Schenker. He has also stated that hide and X influenced him greatly.

However, India's economic and commercial links as well as people-to-people contacts with Taiwan have expanded in recent years.India‚Äôs changing attitude toward Taiwan Taiwan Today According to a 2010 Gallup poll, 21% of Taiwanese people approve of Indian leadership, with 19% disapproving and 60% uncertain.U.S. Leadership More Popular in Asia Than China's, India's Gallup According to a December 2019 survey conducted via National Chengchi University's Election Study Center, 53.8% of Taiwanese people polled overall supported \\"increasing ties with India\\", with 73.1% of DPP voters supporting increasing ties with India and 44.6% of KMT voters supporting increasing ties.Taiwan's Relations with India - Partisan Divides The Diplomat In May 2020, two members of the Indian Parliament virtually attended the newly elected President Tsai‚Äôs swearing in ceremony and praised Taiwanese democracy, thereby sending what some have termed a warning message to China and signaling a strengthening of relations between the Tsai and Modi administrations.BJP MPs praise Taiwan as ‚Äòdemocratic country‚Äô as President Tsai Ing-wen begins new term In July 2020, the Indian government appointed a top career diplomat, Joint Secretary Gourangalal Das, the former head of the U.S. division in India's Ministry of External Affairs, as its new envoy to Taiwan.India silently upgrades Taiwan ties  Background  Despite China proper and the Indian subcontinent, where two of the four ancient civilizations of the world emerged, having shared thousands of years of extensive trade and cultural exchanges, primarily through Buddhism, direct contact between Formosa and South Asia has historically been considerably more limited due to geographic constraints and distances. Tianzhu (Â§©Á´∫), situated in Buddhist cosmology at the \\"Western Heaven\\", has traditionally been regarded by Buddhists as an idealized holy land where their faith originated from, and subsequently served as a pilgrimage site for many who sought to receive Buddhist scriptures, as romanticized in the classical Chinese tale of Journey to the West. Hu Shih, the ROC Ambassador to the United States from 1938 to 1942, commented, albeit critically, on India's Buddhism almost completely subsuming Chinese society upon its introduction. > ASIA is one. The Himalayas divide, only to accentuate, two mighty > civilizations, the Chinese with its communism of Confucius, and the Indian > with its individualism of the Vedas. But not even the snowy barriers can > interrupt for one moment that broad expanse of love for the Ultimate and > Universal, which is the common thought-inheritance of every Asiatic race, > enabling them to produce all the great religions of the world and > distinguishing them from those maritime peoples of the Mediterranean and the > Baltic, who love to dwell on the Particular, and to search out the means, > not the end, of life.Okakura, Tenshin (1904) Ideal of the East While never having actually visited India in his lifetime, Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Republic of China, occasionally spoke and wrote of India as a fellow Asian nation that was likewise subject to harsh Western exploitation, and frequently called for a Pan-Asian united front against all unjust imperialism; in a 1921 speech, Sun stated: \\"The Indians have long been oppressed by the British. They have now reacted with a change in their revolutionary thinking...There is progress in their revolutionary spirit, they will not be cowed down by Britain.\\"Sun Yat-sen's speech on Pan-Asianism To this day, there is a prominent street named Sun Yat-sen street in an old Chinatown in Calcutta (now known as Kolkata). Chiang Kai-shek and his wife with Mahatma Gandhi Partially to enlist India's aid against both Japanese and Western imperialism in exchange for the ROC's support for Indian independence, Chiang Kai-shek visited India under British rule in 1942 and met with Jawaharlal Nehru, along with Mahatma Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Despite pledges of mutual friendship and future cooperation between the two peoples, Chiang argued that while Gandhi's non-violent resistance was not necessarily invalid for the Indian people, it was an unrealistic worldview on a global context; Gandhi, who had at the time insisted on India refraining from participating in any war in any circumstances, in turn later noted that, \\"I would not say that I had learnt anything, and there was nothing that we could teach him.\\"Shaping the Future of Asia In their meeting in Calcutta, Jinnah tried to persuade Chiang, who had pressed Britain to relinquish India as soon as possible, of the necessity of establishing a separate nation for Muslims in the subcontinent, to which Chiang, who apparently recognized Congress as the sole nationalist force in the Raj, replied that if ten crores of Muslims could live peacefully with other communities in China, then there was no true necessity as he saw it of a separate state for a smaller population of nine crores of Muslims living in India.The Cripps Mission: A Reappraisal A division of the KMT's forces entered India around this time as the Chinese Army in India in their struggle against Japanese expansion in Southeast Asia. Dwarkanath Kotnis and four other Indian physicians traveled to a war-torn China to provide medical assistance against Japanese forces. Representatives of the Indian independence movement later invited Tibetan delegates to the 1947 Asian Relations Conference hosted in New Delhi at which the Tibetans were allowed to display their flag. According to Tibetologist A. Tom Grunfeld, the conference was not government-sponsored, and so Tibet's and the Tibetan flag's presence had \\"no diplomatic significance\\". Nonetheless, the ROC, also present at the conference, protested Tibet's showing, and in response, the Tibetan flag was removed and conference organizers issued a statement that Nehru invited the Tibetan delegates \\"in a personal capacity\\". Although his government also viewed Tibet as part of China, after the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion, Chiang Kai-shek announced in his Letter to Tibetan Friends () that the ROC's policy would be to help the Tibetan diaspora overthrow the People's Republic of China's rule in Tibet. The ROC's Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission sent secret agents to India to disseminate pro-Kuomintang (KMT) and anti-Communist propaganda among Tibetan exiles. From 1971 to 1978, the MTAC also recruited ethnic Tibetan children from India and Nepal to study in Taiwan, with the expectation that they would work for a ROC government that returned to the mainland. In 1994, the veterans' association for the Tibetan guerrilla group Chushi Gangdruk met with the MTAC and agreed to the KMT's One China Principle. In response, the Dalai Lama's Central Tibetan Administration forbade all exiled Tibetans from contact with the MTAC. India officially recognised the PRC on April 1, 1950, and was supportive of its stand that it was the only state that could be recognised as \\"China\\" and that the island of Taiwan was a part of Chinese territory, thus voting in favour of the PRC's bid to join the United Nations and replacing the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China in the UN Security Council; the Republic of India recognized the ROC from 1947 to 1950, while Pakistan recognized the ROC until 1951. Despite its somewhat strained relations with the PRC after the border war of 1962, India has continued to recognise the PRC's \\"One China\\" policy.International Recognition of the Republic of China Border dispute Like the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China claims Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh, currently administered by the Republic of India, as part of its sovereign territory. While the PRC and Pakistan managed to largely resolve their former territorial dispute in 1963 through the Sino-Pakistan Agreement, neither India nor the ROC officially recognizes this treaty, and as such, India claims PRC-occupied parts of Kashmir and the ROC claims parts of Pakistan-administered Kashmir in addition to the disputed territories with India.Republic of China Territorial Claims =Cold War= Throughout the Cold War, the government of Taiwan generally had the same basic understanding on the China-India border dispute as the People's Republic of China (PRC), and in 1962, around the time of the Sino-Indian War, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that they did not recognise the legality of McMahon Line. The same year Western countries increased pressure on the then Taiwan leader, Chiang Kai-shek, to recognise the legality of McMahon Line in order to isolate Beijing. However, Chiang dismissed McMahon Line as 'imperialist imposition on China'. At the same time, as India began to gradually lose ground against the PRC during the course of the border conflict, Nehru began reaching out to various other anti-Communist powers, including the Taiwan-based ROC government led by Chiang, with whom he had maintainted close contacts with since their initial meeting during the Second World War, seeking aid and assistance. Some U.S. officials, such as Navy Admiral Harry D. Felt, the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet from 1958 to 1964, also encouraged Chiang to use the opportunity to strike mainland China from the east while part of its military was occupied by the border war. The ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs's reaction was somewhat mixed, and based upon pragmatism and its fundamental priority of containing Communism at the same time, with the PLA deemed a constant existential threat to its government in the 1960s. It declared that the war was a conflict between \\"Indian nationalism and international communism, not a war between the Indian people and the Chinese people\\", and though it clearly repeated its refusal to recognize the McMahon Line, it also claimed that the PRC's war was not necessarily about territory alone, but rather used within the broader context of an alleged Communist agenda to expand its ideology throughout most of Asia, implying that even if there were no dispute over land, conflict would still have occurred eventually. The statement also noted that the ROC believed \\"a fair and reasonable solution\\" should be found were the mainland to be reclaimed, and insisted that the attack against India allegedly \\"violated the traditional peace-loving spirit of the Chinese people\\". The Vice President of the ROC, Chen Cheng, also condemned the PRC as the \\"initiator and the aggressor\\" in the war in a November 1962 statement, again citing ideological differences rather than territorial ones as largely being responsible for the outbreak in hostitilies.Sino-Indian War and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionChiang Kai-shek's Reaction to the Sino-Indian War in Chinese The Foreign Ministry also sent a telegram overseas to all its overseas embassies, instructing them to avoid criticizing Nehru while remaining resolute in its stance regarding the disputed territories, and remaining open to the hopes of re-establishing relations between the two governments given the collapse of PRC-India relations following the war.Declassification of Taiwan and India Diplomatic Archives: Taiwan-India Interactive Relations after the Sino-Indian War in 1962 The Reporter, July 6, 2020 However despite this, Nehru was surprised when the ROC representatives sent to New Delhi, despite expressing support for India against the so-called \\"Communist bandits\\", also emphasized that \\"Southern Tibet\\" belonged to China from their point of view, causing bilateral talks for concrete support to break down. Chiang had also rejected America's official recognition of the McMahon Line, and further rebuffed Admiral Felt's call for Taiwan's counterattacking the mainland (even with an assurance from John F. Kennedy that the U.S. would support the ROC with all its strength), saying that were he to do so, he would be scolded by all the generations of Yanhuang, or the descendants of the ancient Chinese people.In the Sino-Indian War in 1962, the United States tried to persuade Chiang to take the opportunity to counterattack the mainlandDuring the Sino- Indian War, India asked Chiang Kai-shek for help but was rejected Despite a considerable surge in anti-Communist sentiment in India following India's defeat in the 1962 war, the Indian government did not elect to renew its official diplomatic ties with the ROC. However, covert Indian, American and Taiwanese support for the Tibetan rebels intensified in the aftermath, with the former two governments establishing the Joint Mission Center to counter the PRC in Tibet, and helping to train thousands of Tibetan rebels to prepare for the event of a second conflict. Furthermore, via the Tibetan exiles, specifically the Dalai Lama's second-eldest brother Gyalo Thondup, who shared close personal ties with Chiang Kai-shek after having grown up under his tutelage when the ROC still ruled Nanjing, a close relationship between the Indian and Taiwanese intelligence agencies were then established, one which apparently endures to the modern day.The story of Tibet's struggle: Sino- Indian war and Taiwan-India intelligence cooperation The Reporter In February 1987, India's move to elevate the status of 'Arunachal centrally administered region' to the state of Arunachal Pradesh was declared null and void by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry, in a formal statement, stated that it did not recognise 'illegal occupation' of ROC territory south of McMahon Line and the establishment of 'Arunachal Pradesh state' was an illegal act. In 1995, Ambassador Pei-yin Teng (Taiwan's first representative to India) in response to Indian member of the parliament, stated that Taiwan did not recognise McMahon Line. However, Pei-yin Teng was the last Taiwanese official who made a statement against the McMahon Line. Since, then Taiwan has not made any statement on China-India dispute and has adopted a neutral stance on the dispute.  Development of bilateral relations  Even as India's own relations with the PRC have developed substantially in recent years, India has sought to gradually develop better commercial, cultural and scientific co- operation with Taiwan, albeit whilst ruling out the possibility of establishing formal diplomatic relations Taiwan has also viewed India's rising geopolitical standing as a counterbalance to the PRC's dominance in the region.Taiwan-India: New Friends? As a part of its \\"Look East\\" foreign policy, India has sought to cultivate extensive ties with Taiwan in trade and investment as well as developing co-operation in science & technology, environment issues and people-to-people exchanges. Both sides have aimed to develop ties to counteract Chinese rivalry with both nations.

In 2007, Ma Ying-jeou, the leader of the Kuomintang, Taiwan's largest political party, and a major candidate in the 2008 presidential elections made an unofficial visit to India. Effective 15 August 2015, Republic of China passport holders can avail of India's e-Tourist Visa facility.  Commercial ties  Both governments have launched efforts to significantly expand bilateral trade and investment, especially in the fields of information technology (IT), energy, telecommunications and electronics. India‚Äôs trade with Taiwan in the calendar year 2008 registered a total of US$5.34 billion, an increase of 9.5% as compared to 2007. In 2007, bilateral trade between the two sides had risen 80% to reach US$4.8 billion. In 2008, Indian exports to Taiwan declined year-on-year at a rate of -7.8%, to touch US$2.33 billion as compared to US$2.53 billion in 2007. Taiwanese exports to India in 2008 grew at a rate of 28.41% to reach US$3 billion. In 2008, India recorded a trade deficit of US$669 million with Taiwan, as against a trade surplus of US$159 million in year 2007 Major Indian exports to Taiwan include waste oil, naptha, cereals, cotton, organic chemicals, copper, aluminum and food residues. In 2019, India - Taiwan trade volume was US$7 billion, growing at a rate of 20% YoY. Major Taiwanese exports to India include integrated circuits, machinery and other electronic products. India is also keen to attract Taiwanese investment particularly in hi-tech and labour-intensive industries. More than 80 Taiwanese companies and entities currently have a presence in India. Some of the companies include Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (FoxConn), Sanyang Corporation, Gigabyte Technologies, Continental Engineering, CTCI, Apache and Feng Tay (shoes), Wintek Corporation, Delta Electronics, D-Link, Meita Industrials, Transcend, MediaTek, etc. While bilateral trade has experienced significant growth in recent years, Taiwanese investment in India has been affected by cultural and linguistic barriers and reticence on part of Taiwanese businesses.  Cultural exchanges  While the ROC and India are two of Asia's leading democracies, both with fairly close ties to the United States and Europe, both sides continue to lack formal diplomatic relations. However, the two governments maintain unofficial ties with each other. According to some sources, Buddhism is the most widely practiced religion in Taiwan, usually alongside elements of Daoism, and Bollywood films have in recent years gained a reasonably popular following, along with other aspects of Indian culture such as yoga, cuisine and Indian dance.Bollywood moves in Taipei Taipei Times, April 20, 2010 See also *Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in Chennai *Indians in Taiwan *Buddhism in Taiwan  References  Category:Bilateral relations of Taiwan Taiwan ","title":"India‚ÄìTaiwan relations"},{"id":"17719887","title":"John Kelly (Royal Navy officer)"},{"id":"17719893","text":"The Nuevo Estadio Azul is a planned stadium in Mexico City, intended to replace the Estadio Azul, the home of football club Cruz Azul. History The building that would replace the present Blue Stage exists on paper, though it has yet to be started. It will have four levels of underground parking, (first to be constructed), and two levels for commercial enterprises, besides a ceiling that would cover the divided launching slips high and general generally low. There are to be three levels of theater boxes. This first draft constitutes the idea of the new home of Cruz Azul, that not only would lodge to La Maquina in its encounter like the premises, but also would be available for concerts and spectacles of all type. Recently, the president of Cruz Azul, Guillermo Alvarez Cuevas, said that the project may yet begin in 2012, once problems, like delegation permissions and negotiations with zone neighbors,are solved. One solution would be for the Cos√≠o family, which owns the present building, to turn over ownership to Cruz Azul, while the former would use the levels destined for commercial enterprises. However, before work begins, several issues need to be resolved. First, the pertinent permissions of the Delegation Benito Ju√°rez and the Secretary of Urban Development and House of Mexico City must be obtained, as they will soon sign an agreement with the Cos√≠o company. In addition, this project needs to be elaborated upon, as it has a projected cost of $2 million. Furthermore, Cruz Azul must specify what role they will play during construction. All this must be approved by President Guillermo Alvarez Cuevas and the General Assembly of the Cruz Azul Cooperative.

Early years She was born and raised in Bangor, Maine and, after graduating from Bangor High School, spent a further year of schooling in New York City. She then lived for a year in Chicago with her sister Marion Howard Smith, who was married to Benjamin Fuller Smith, a son of former Maine Governor Samuel E. Smith. Career Howard gained success with her first novel, One Summer (Boston, 1875), set in the coastal town of Wiscasset, Maine. An 1877 edition of One Summer was illustrated by Augustus Hoppin. The publisher of One Summer was James R. Osgood, who began his career with Ticknor and Fields and later was in partnership with Henry Houghton. Following publication of One Summer, Howard went to Europe, having received an assignment from the Boston Evening Transcript for a series of articles. Her articles were subsequently published as the travel book One Year Abroad (Boston, 1877). Howard settled in Stuttgart, Germany and continued to write, producing novels, short fiction, poems, and essays. For two years, she was editor of Hallberger's Illustrated Magazine, an English-language magazine first edited by the German poet Ferdinand Freiligrath. To supplement her income, Howard supervised the education of American girls in Stuttgart. Among her students were the three daughters of the actor Lawrence Barrett and the two daughters of Harriet Hubbard Ayer, founder of the cosmetics and patent medicine company Recamier Manufacturing. In 1890, Howard married Baron Julius von Teuffel, a court physician to King Charles I of W√ºrttemberg, thereby becoming the Baroness von Teuffel. She died in Munich in 1898. Some of Howard's publications were translated into several European languages, including French, German, and Italian. Howard was one of only a handful of American novelists of this era to write from abroad, the iconic example being Henry James. Howard was an accomplished pianist and Franz Liszt is said to have complimented her playing following a performance. Works * One Summer (Boston: James R.

She was portrayed by Ashley Tesoro from 1998-2001. Introduction Kimberly Fairchild is the daughter of Myles Fairchild. Her mother died, and she and Myles moved to Los Angeles from Nantucket (where she was born and raised) into James and Maggie Warwick's old home. They were introduced to society at a party at Brooke Logan's home where Kimberly was immediately smitten with Rick. She enrolled in Meadow Woods High School, like Rick, and it wasn't long before the two were study buddies. Kimberly & Rick Kimberly fell for Rick, who seemed to share her views on waiting for the right person before going 'all the way'. She was confused when she met Amber, who warned her to keep away from Rick. Kimberly was devastated to learn that Rick had a girlfriend. Kimberly's resistance didn't last long. She was soon back in the thick of things with Rick. After Amber warned her to stop chasing Rick again, Kimberly decided to pull out all the stops to destroy Rick and Amber's relationship. Kimberly was encouraged when Brooke explained that Amber was a gold-digger and a tramp and Eric begged for her help in breaking up Rick and Amber. She soon began dating C.J. casually as a way of staying close to Rick. Although Kimberly toyed with the idea of leaving town, she eventually decided that it was far more important to be there for Rick. Kimberly Fairchild, Retrieved August 28, 2011 Kimberly & Amber When Amber nearly lost the baby after another fight with Kimberly, Kimberly told Rick that she couldn't continue to cause problems for Amber and hurt the baby. She secured a promise from Amber that she would do her best to make Rick happy, but Kimberly's best intentions nearly fell by the wayside when Amber missed the wedding rehearsal and Kimberly had to stand in for her. Kimberly was heartbroken as she watched Rick and Amber exchange their vows. Kimberly Fairchild, Retrieved August 28, 2011 Kimberly & Macy When Kimberly learned Macy was her sister, Kimberly was devastated that her father had a life that didn't include her. She ran away, staying with her friend Alexis until Rick convinced her to go home. Once Kimberly learned that there was a possibility that Amber's baby may not be Rick's, she was more determined than ever to pursue a future with him. C.J. tried to warn her against the idea and she promised that if the baby was Rick's she'd walk away. She was beginning to accept Macy as her sister and the two were growing closer. Once Rick announced that he forgave Amber even though the baby could have been Raymond's, Kimberly accepted dates from C.J., and even kissed C.J. in an attempt to make Rick jealous. Her suspicion of Amber grew and she found it impossible to stay away from Rick. Kimberly Fairchild, Retrieved August 28, 2011 Model (Forrester Creations) Kimberly was thrilled when Brooke chose her to be Forrester's newest model. While modeling the show-stopper, the back of the dress was caught on a hook on the runway. When the back ripped off, Kimberly was left utterly humiliated. This began a war between the Spectras and the Forresters. The Spectras were convinced the Forresters did it to humiliate Kimberly while the Forresters were convinced the Spectras did it to ruin the show. The incident was soon overshadowed when Macy and Thorne broke up over it, and Kimberly began to resent Brooke, who she felt seduced Thorne to destroy his relationship with her sister. After finally putting C.J. off once and for all, Kimberly returned to pursuing Rick, even encouraging him to divorce Amber so they could be together. When she saw how Amber didn't want Becky near the baby, she pushed Rick to find out why. Despite her disapproval of what Brooke did to her half-sister, Kimberly accepted a modeling position with Forrester when Brooke offered it as they both knew it was Brooke's way of trying to come between Rick and Amber. Kimberly Fairchild, Retrieved August 28, 2011 Italy Kimberly then met Giovanni, a new Forrester photographer, who was quite taken with her. She shared a few kisses with Giovanni but was unable to forget Rick. When she got a phone call from a 'reporter' asking a lot of pointed questions about Rick and Amber's marriage, she was more determined than ever to be with Rick. After sharing a few kisses with the married Rick, Kimberly left for Paris to meet Becky, determined to use her to bring an end to Rick and Amber. She told Becky that Amber and Rick's marriage was a complete mistake and that she was the only woman Rick loved. After returning to the U.S., she confronted Amber, only to have her mother Tawny pull a gun on her. Kimberly Fairchild, Retrieved August 28, 2011 Rick finally admitted to Kimberly that he loved her but asked her to accept his marriage to Amber. She refused and pushed Becky to expose whatever dirt she had on Amber. Kimberly continued to pursue Rick, and he admitted that he wasn't in love with Amber. After months of nothing happening, Kimberly realized she wasn't going to get what she wanted so she quit modeling and told Rick to move on with Amber. She sought comfort with Giovanni and allowed him to show her around Venice. Kimberly Fairchild, Retrieved August 28, 2011 Return to L.A. Kimberly returned to L.A. to find that Amber and Rick's marriage was as good as over. Amber's secret (that her child had died and Little Eric was really Becky's son) was out, and Rick wanted to pursue a real relationship with Kimberly. Rick was a great comfort to her when Adam had to leave Los Angeles without saying goodbye to her. Although his marriage was over, Kimberly still wasn't willing to sleep with Rick. She planned to remain a virgin until her wedding night. She and Rick began to date, and it wasn't long before Kimberly realized that Amber was working as a waitress. Kimberly taunted Amber and was thrilled when she nearly got Amber fired from her job. She began feeling jealous of even chance encounters between Rick and Amber, and when she realized that Rick supported Brooke and Thorne's relationship even though Thorne was married to her half-sister, she called things off. When she realized Macy was drinking again, she wasn't sure what to do, and went to Sally for help. She was shocked when Macy admitted to her that Thorne wanted a divorce, and Brooke bore the brunt of her frustrations. When Macy died in a car accident after Brooke tried to deliver divorce papers to her up at Big Bear, Kimberly was devastated, and blamed Brooke. Kimberly Fairchild, Retrieved August 28, 2011 Kimberly & Thorne In her grief, Kimberly began getting closer and closer to Thorne. She appreciated his being there for her, and begged him not to marry Brooke right after Macy's death. She soon became attracted to her late half-sister's husband, and it wasn't long until she began altering her looks in hopes of pleasing Thorne. Brooke tried to intimidate her by telling her that she and Thorne would be together, but Kimberly refused to accept it. Knowing that Bridget was opposed to her mother and half-brother getting married, she made sure that Bridget knew exactly what was going on between them. Rick tried to get close to her again, but she brushed him off. Kimberly even agreed to do a model shoot (with Thorne supervising), and it looked like her plan was working when she was able to secure his attention, and successfully interrupted his planned evening with Brooke, even though he swore to her that he could not return her feelings. After spending the night in bed with a drunken Thorne, Kimberly allowed him to believe they had slept together, but eventually admitted the truth to him. After watching Thorne and Brooke exchange their vows, Kimberly went back to the beach house Macy left to her. Adam showed up one day to take her away from Los Angeles.

It uses a Haptic touchscreen interface, and three touchscreen buttons (pictured at right, from left to right - [back], [home], [phone]). The Instinct, in addition to being a mobile phone, also functions as a camera phone, portable media player, text messenger, and a complete web browser and e-mail client. The email client allows for access to only the main inbox of any associated account ‚Äì not to any subfolder. The folders for \\"drafts\\", \\"sent\\", \\"deleted\\", and \\"outbox\\" represent only messages originating from the phone. The MP3 player allows users to listen to music while they exchange text messages. It pauses music when the user answers a call. The Instinct supports uploading music into the music library. The phone does not come with MP3 ringtones. The Instinct was initially available only in the United States through Sprint. It was announced in early July 2008 that the Instinct would be available in Canada from Bell Mobility, starting on August 8, 2008 and from Telus Mobility on August 19, 2008. It became the second fastest selling phone in Sprint's history (the first being the Palm Pre). Specifications The specifications as listed on the Samsung Instinct website are: *Screen size: 7.87 cm (3.1 in) *Screen resolution: 432√ó240 pixels *Input method: Haptic touch-screen interface *Storage: 2GB MicroSD Card (Also supports higher-quality MicroSDHC cards) (Officially upgradeable to an 8GB card, but according to the posters at www.instinct-samsung.com , any software restrictions preventing the Instinct from reading cards of greater capacity could be fixed by a simple firmware update, distributed by the cellular service provider, i.e. Sprint [in the U.S.], or Bell or Telus [in Canada]), at this time however no update has been released. *Network: CDMA EV-DO Rev A (800 MHz/1900 MHz) (Comparable to better-known 3G) * 1,000mAh Li-ion battery, capable of 5.75 hours of continuous talk time; third-party extended batteries (up to capacities of 1880 mAh) are available. *Size: 11.61√ó5.51√ó1.24 cm (4.57\\"√ó2.17\\"√ó0.48\\" in) *Weight: 124.74 g (4.4 oz) *Applications **Video recording and streaming (MPEG-4 AVC) (Note: streaming and/or playback may be limited/disabled in Canadian versions.) **Personal organizer **2 megapixel camera (max resolution 1600 x 1200 pixels) **Full internet browser (WAP 2.0, XHTML, HTML, WML, WMLS). The Instinct has the ability to run the popular mobile browser Opera Mini (version 4.2 is currently the most cooperative), while performing very well compared to the default web browser. **Swappable 2nd battery with separate charging case included in US package. **Sprint Navigation available in US package, depending on cellular plan. Sprint advertising against Apple iPhone When Samsung first introduced the Instinct, its marketing campaign imitated some methods that have usually been employed by Apple. One of these was using side-by-side comparisons in a teaser website for Instinct, presenting a breakdown of all features that were superior to, insufficient, or wholly missing in what was then the first-generation iPhone (as listed byTG Daily) -- * Loading a web page much faster; * Exact geographical positioning with built-in GPS; * Downloading songs wirelessly through the mobile network of the carrier; * Possibility to watch live television; * Recording and sending video. Samsung also had a fictional film trailer produced, featuring the device in a clip fashioned after Hollywood blockbusters. The ad campaign utilized negative language with the words \\"kill\\" and \\"defeat\\" toward the iPhone. The campaign was criticized by TG Daily as \\"bad marketing,\\" specifically for negative language and pitting the Instinct directly against the iPhone, thereby offering Apple's product additional exposure. At the time, iPhone 3G was known to be less than two weeks away from being introduced, with the launch date for Instinct set to 20 June 2008, the day the new iPhone was speculated to be released. iPhone 3G was subsequently released the following month, on 11 July 2008.

He made facial reconstructions of the dead based on their skeletons, and of fugitives based on outdated photographs, with his reconstructions showing how they might look in the present day. He primarily worked in clay and then cast his pieces into plaster and painted them, but he also created age-progression drawings of fugitives using pastels. His most famous facial reconstruction case was that of John Emil List, whose case was shown on America's Most Wanted. Bender's work led to List's capture. Career Bender originally began his forensic work when, impoverished, he worked out a deal with the Philadelphia coroner to be allowed to study some of their unknown dead bodies in an effort to improve his sculpting skills. He also created life-sized monuments in bronze for the African Burial Ground National Monument in New York (using three of the actual skulls found on the site to give faces to the unknown slaves who had been buried there), a monument for slain police officers in New Jersey, and a Holocaust obelisk. Bender was one of the founding members of the Vidocq Society, along with William Fleisher and Richard Walter. The Vidocq Society, named after Eug√®ne Fran√ßois Vidocq, meets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and focuses on solving cold cases. In popular culture On May 13, 2008, Random House published The Girl With the Crooked Nose by Ted Botha, a book on Bender's life story intertwined with his most challenging case: the female homicides in Ciudad Ju√°rez.http://www.randomhouse.com/rhpg/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781400065332http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/06/15/facing- the-dead.html In August 2010, Penguin Books published The Murder Room by Michael Capuzzo in which Frank Bender is a central figure--the book includes a biography of Bender and focuses on the work of the Vidocq Society. In 2009, Bender was diagnosed with pleural mesothelioma, a rare cancer that attacks the lining of the lungs and is caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos. Bender believed he was exposed to it during his time in the Navy working in the engine room. Bender died on July 28, 2011, at his home in Philadelphia.

The planet has a mass of nearly half that of Jupiter, but a radius five-quarters of the size of Jupiter. This low relative mass might be caused by a core that is of low mass or that is not present at all. The planet orbits at approximately 5% of the distance between the Sun and Earth every four days. The star was observed several times between 2006 and 2009, at first through the SuperWASP program and later through focused follow-up observations. Analysis of collected radial velocity measurements led to the discovery of Cruinlagh, which was reported in a journal on April 7, 2009. A follow-up study published in 2011 investigated the cause for inflated planets such as Cruinlagh, and re-examined (and re- constrained) its mass, radius, density, and age. Discovery Between November 27, 2006, and April 1, 2007, 3329 images of the star Gloas, called WASP-13 at the time, by the SuperWASP-North program based at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands led to the identification of Gloas as host to a potentially transiting object. Photometric follow-up observations were taken on February 16, 2008 using the James Gregory Telescope (JGT) in Scotland, which took 1047 exposures of the star, although the last twenty images taken were obscured by cloud cover and were discarded. Using HD 80408 as a reference star along with JGT measurements, the astronomers investigating the system were able to create a light curve for the transiting planet. Gloas was observed between February 11 and 15 in 2008 by the SOPHIE √©chelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in France, determining the radial velocity of the transiting body. Use of the FIES echelle spectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands gained other spectral measurements that yielded the characteristics of the star. Analysis of the SOPHIE and FIES data were used to constrain some of the orbiting body's characteristics. The discovery of the orbiting body's mass using radial velocity measurements led to its confirmation as the planet WASP-13b. The discovery of Cruinlagh was reported in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics by the European Southern Observatory on May 19, 2009. The discovery paper was received by the journal on April 7, 2009. Later, between 2009 and 2011, another team of astronomers observed Cruinlagh and WASP-21b to find what caused some Hot Jupiters to have anomalously high radii. The RISE photometric camera on the Liverpool Telescope was used to detect further transits. Two partial transits and two full transits were observed during this period, although the quality of both full transits was slightly compromised because of passing cloud cover. The collected observations, along with the JGT observations that were used to confirm the planet, were scaled to filter out errors such as background noise. The data was then used to re-define Cruinlagh's parameters, including its age, mass, radius, and density. The study also noted that a limb darkening effect was present, a characteristic that may affect future atmospheric studies of the planet. Host star Gloas is a sunlike G-type star located in the Lynx constellation. Measurements taken by FIES and SOPHIE did not constrain the mass, radius, or age well; however, a later 2011 study using the Liverpool Telescope better-constrained those parameters. The star's mass is estimated at 1.09 times the mass of the Sun, its radius at 1.559 times that of the Sun, and its density at 0.288 time's the Sun's density. These characteristics are re-defined taking limb darkening into account. The star's metallicity, which is measured by iron content, is placed roughly at [Fe/H] = 0, similar to that of the Sun. Also, the star's estimated effective temperature is 5826 K, slightly warmer than the Sun. Gloas has an apparent magnitude of 10.42, making it invisible to the unaided eye as seen from Earth. Characteristics Cruinlagh is a transiting planet with an estimated mass that is (including limb darkening) 0.477 times that of Jupiter and a radius that is 1.389 times Jupiter's radius. The planet is, in other words, less than half the mass of Jupiter, but slightly less than fourteen tenths its size. The planet's low mass can mostly likely be attributed to the presence of a low-mass core, or to the total lack of a core, according to the discovery paper. Cruinlagh, which orbits its host star at a distance of 0.05362 AU, circles its star completely every 4.35298 days. The 2011 study on the planet recognized Cruinlagh as the fifth-lowest-density extrasolar planet known, behind Kepler-7b; WASP-17b; TrES-4b; and COROT-5b. Cruinlagh has an orbital inclination of 86.9¬∫, which means that it orbits almost edge-on as seen from Earth. Naming The planet was originally named WASP-13b, as the second object in the WASP-13 system. In 2019 the IAU announced that WASP-13 and its planet WASP-13b would be given official names chosen by school children from Cronk y Berry school, Isle of Man. The chosen names were Gloas for WASP-13 and Cruinlagh for WASP-13b, the Manx words for 'to shine' and 'to orbit' respectively.

Early life Young was born in Belgravia, London, to Henry George Melvin Young, a British solicitor, and Fannie Rowan Young. He was educated at Amesbury School in Hindhead, Westminster School class of 1933, Kent School in Kent, Connecticut class of 1932, and Trinity College, Oxford, where he was part of the winning crew of the 1938 Boat Race. Though going normally by the name Melvin, he acquired the nickname \\"Dinghy\\" after coming down in the sea twice and surviving in inflatable dinghies. Royal Air Force service Young qualified as a pilot as a member of the Oxford University Air Squadron, although the officer who trained him described him as \\"not a natural pilot\\". He joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in 1938. After the outbreak of war in 1939, he began operational training. In June 1940, he joined No. 102 Squadron RAF, flying Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bombers. It was during this tour that he twice had to ditch his aircraft and take to a dinghy. The first occasion was on 7 October, when he was flying on a convoy escort mission over the Atlantic from a base in Northern Ireland. Young was forced to ditch his aircraft because of engine failure and the crew spent 22 hours in an inflatable dinghy before being rescued. The second occasion was in the English Channel, south of Plymouth. Young completed his tour in February 1941 and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). After serving in a training unit, Young was promoted to squadron leader and, in September 1941, began a tour with 104 Squadron, flying Vickers Wellingtons. He served in Egypt and Malta and, on completing his tour of duty, received a Bar to his DFC. In July 1942, he was sent to Washington, D.C. to serve as part of the RAF Delegation. Upon his return to the United Kingdom, he began training to fly the Avro Lancaster with a new crew. They all joined 57 Squadron in March 1943, where Young became a flight commander. Operation Chastise Soon after joining No. 57 Squadron, he was transferred to No. 617 Squadron, specially formed for the purpose of carrying out Operation Chastise, the raid to attack German dams in the Ruhr Valley. Young, together with Henry Maudslay, carried out much of the organising work needed to form a new squadron but remained popular with his fellow officers. On the night of the 16/17 May 1943, the raid took place. Young flew Avro Lancaster ED877/G AJ-A (code-named \\"A-Apple\\"). The other crew were Flight Sergeant Charles Walpole Roberts (Navigator), Flying Officer Vincent Sandford MacCausland (Bomb Aimer), Sergeant David Taylor Horsfall (Flight Engineer), Sergeant Lawrence William Nichols (Wireless Operator), Sergeant Gordon Arthur Yeo (Front Gunner) and Sergeant Wilfred Ibbotson (Rear Gunner). A-Apple flew as part of the first wave which attacked the M√∂hne Dam. Young was second in command of the raid, which was led by Wing Commander Guy Gibson flying G-George. The first three aircraft to attack, Gibson (G-George), Hopgood (M-Mother) and Martin (P-Popsie), all missed the target. A-Apple was fourth to attack and hit the dam, causing a small breach. As this breach was not apparent, a fifth aircraft of Maltby (J-Johnny) subsequently attacked the dam and achieved a hit, causing a larger breach. On the return journey, A-Apple was brought down by anti-aircraft fire, probably by gunners at Castricum-aan-Zee, who reported shooting down an aircraft at 2.58 am. The bodies of all seven crewmen washed up on the Dutch coast over the subsequent days and were buried in the Bergen General Cemetery, Bergen, North Holland.

The planet orbits its host star at a distance of 0.05 AU every four days. The mass of this planet is about one half that of Jupiter, but its radius is nearly 50% larger than Jupiter's, making the density of this planet only one quarter that of water; it is thought that some other form of heating must explain its extremely low density. WASP-15b's discovery was published on April 29, 2009. Discovery WASP-15 was first observed by the WASP-South branch of the SuperWASP project, which operates from the South African Astronomical Observatory, between May 4, 2006 and July 17, 2006. It was later observed by WASP-South from January 31, 2007 to July 17, 2007 and from January 31, 2008 to May 29, 2008. Further analysis taken from 24,943 collected data points revealed eleven full or partial transits. Follow-up observations were conducted by a European and American science team at the 1.2 m Leonhard Euler Telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile, which further raised the possibility of the existence of a planet in WASP-15's orbit; use of the CORALIE spectrograph on the Euler Telescope between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 revealed that the variations in radial velocity measurements were not because of an eclipsing binary star system. CORALIE and the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) revealed the spectrum of WASP-15, which was used to derive the star's characteristics. The science team studying WASP-15 found that, after running best-fit models, WASP-15's radial velocity and transit shifts were most likely due to the existence of a planet. WASP-15's planet, WASP-15b, had one of the lowest densities known amongst extrasolar planets when it was discovered. Its discovery paper was published by the American Astronomical Society on April 29, 2009 in the Astronomical Journal. Host star WASP-15 is an F-type star located in the Hydra constellation. It is located approximately 290 parsecs (900 light years) from Earth and has an apparent magnitude of 10.9, making it invisible to the unaided eye. The star is 1.18 times more massive than the Sun, and has a radius that is 1.477 times larger than that of the Sun, making it more diffuse. WASP-15 has an effective temperature of 6300 K, and is thus hotter than the Sun, although at 3.9 billion years, it is also younger. WASP-15 has a metallicity of [Fe/H] of -0.17, which means that it has 68% of the iron found in the Sun. Characteristics WASP-15b has a mass of 0.542 times Jupiter's mass and a radius that is 1.428 times Jupiter's radius. Due in part to its proximity to its host star, a distance of 0.0499 AU (7,500,000 km), WASP-15b is greatly inflated, with a density of 0.247 g/cm3. Another factor, such as an internal heat source, is suspected to add to this extremely high radius and extremely low density. WASP-15b orbits its host star every 3.7520656 days. It also has an orbital inclination of 85.5¬∫, making it almost edge-on as seen from the Earth's perspective. The study in 2012, utilizing a Rossiter‚ÄìMcLaughlin effect, have determined the planetary orbit is strongly misaligned with the equatorial plane of the star, misalignment equal to -139.6¬∞. This spin-orbit angle is making orbit of WASP-15b retrograde. Naming In 2019 the IAU announced that WASP-15 and its planet WASP-15b would be given official names chosen by school children from The Ivory Coast.

He was the son of George Frederick Augustus Lambart, Viscount Kilcoursie and Sarah Coppin. His father, while with the Coldstream Guards, was severely wounded during the Peninsular War in the battle of Talavera and remained lame for the rest of his life until his death in 1828 at the age of 39. Frederick was left an orphan. He was sent to Eton from 1829 until 1833, where he was known, without his title, simply as Lambart. The Rev. Dr. Hawtrey was the then-headmaster and gave encouraging influence, which helped him succeed in his education. Career At age 17, he was placed in the 7th Dragoon Guards, joining the regiment in Cork under Colonel Clarke. In 1835, his quarters were changed from Carlow to Dublin. In the autumn of 1836 he was posted to Walsall, Staffordshire. Marriage He married Caroline Augusta Littleton, daughter of Edward John Littleton, 1st Baron Hatherton, and Hyacinthe Mary Wellesley, on 24 July 1838 at St George's Church, Hanover Square, London. It was about this time, after the death of his grandfather, that he succeeded to the title and impaired estates. They remained married for 49 years and 5 months, and had five children: * Lady Mary Hyacinthe Lambart (died 22 August 1933) * Lady Sarah Sophia Lambart (died 8 July 1914) * Sir Frederick Edward Gould Lambart, 9th Earl of the County of Cavan (21 October 1839 ‚Äì 14 July 1900) * Hon.

Arthur Lambart (11 August 1858 ‚Äì 3 April 1937) Religious faith After 1839 they went to Frankfurt am Main, then Bad Ems, followed by two years in Munich. It was here that his deeper biblical studies began. Upon securing a Bible in Dublin in 1835, religion began to play a part in his life. After 1844 he was, until his death, a member of the Open Plymouth Brethren. In 1846 Cavan went to Torquay and played a part in the formation of the Evangelical Alliance with Sir Culling Eardley. Among his special interests was biblical prophecy. He often preached on Christ's expected second advent. In 1866 Lord Cavan invited Granville Waldegrave, 3rd Baron Radstock to come to Weston-super-Mare for evangelistic meetings. Dr. Friedrich Wilhelm Baedeker, cousin of Karl Baedeker, the famous travel guides editor, attended one of these meetings and experienced a religious conversion.D.R., \\"Dr. F. W.

The star is similar, in terms of metallicity and mass, to the Sun, although it is hotter and most likely older. The star was first observed in 1997, according to the SIMBAD database, and was targeted by SuperWASP after the star was observed by one of the SuperWASP telescopes beginning in 2006. Follow-up observations on the star led to the discovery of planet Cruinlagh in 2008; the discovery paper was published in 2009. Observational history The telescope, housed at the Haute-Provence Observatory, which was used to collect radial velocity measurements According to SIMBAD, WASP-13 was first observed in 1997, when it was catalogued by astronomers measuring the proper motion of stars in regions of the sky where galaxies are detected. Between November 27, 2006, and April 1, 2007, the SuperWASP-North telescope in the Canary Islands observed WASP-13; analysis of the data suggested that a planet could be in the orbit of the star. Follow-up observations were conducted by a team of British, Spanish, French, Swiss and American astronomers using the photometer on the James Gregory Telescope in Scotland; using visual comparisons to the nearby bright star HD 80408, the star's light curve was better defined. In combination with measurements of WASP-13's spectrum measured using the SOPHIE √©chelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in France, the star's radial velocity was also discovered. The Fibre-Fed Echelle Spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope gathered additional measurements of WASP-13's spectrum, allowing astronomers to determine WASP-13's characteristics. Use of SOPHIE's data led to the discovery of the planet Cruinlagh in 2008; the planet was reported in 2009. Based on SIMBAD's archive, WASP-13 was included in ten more papers between its discovery and 2010. Characteristics WASP-13 is a sunlike, G-type star that is situated approximately 230 parsecs (750 light years) in the Lynx constellation. With an apparent magnitude of 10.42, the star cannot be seen with the unaided eye from the perspective of someone on Earth. The star's effective temperature, at , is slightly hotter than that of the Sun, and the radius of is also larger, leading to a bolometric luminosity of . However, its metallicity is similar; this can be seen in how the logarithm of the concentration of iron, or [Fe/H], is approximately 0. WASP-13 has a mass of and the logarithm of its surface gravity is measured at , while the rate at which it rotates is at most . The evolutionary status of WASP-13, as shown from its position in the Hertsprung-Russel diagram is near the main sequence turnoff, and it is considered very close to exhausting its core hydrogen and becoming a subgiant. Comparison with theoretical isochrones and stars with accurately-determined ages gives an age for WASP-13 of around . Earlier estimates had given an older age, but with a very large uncertainty. Planetary system WASP-13 has a planet that orbits its host star at a distance of 0.0527 AU, or approximately 5.27% of the mean distance between the Earth and Sun. The planet completes an orbit every 4.35298 days, or approximately 4 days and 8.5 hours. Cruinlagh's estimated mass is 0.46 times the mass of Jupiter, while its radius is about 1.21 times that of the planet. Naming The star was designated WASP-13 as it was discovered through the Wide Angle Search for Planets programme. In 2019 the IAU announced that WASP-13 and its planet WASP-13b would be given official names chosen by school children from the UK. The chosen names were Gloas for WASP-13 and Cruinlagh for WASP-13b, the Manx words for 'to shine' and 'to orbit' respectively.

The star, which is more massive, larger, hotter, and more luminous than the Sun, is also less metal-rich than the Sun. WASP-15 has one known planet in its orbit, WASP-15b; the planet is a Hot Jupiter with an anomalously high radius, a phenomenon which may be explained by the presence of an internal heat source. The star was first observed by the SuperWASP program in 2006; future measurements in 2007 and 2008, as well as follow-up observations and analysis, eventually led to the discovery of WASP-15b using the transit method and Doppler spectroscopy. Observational history WASP-15 was first observed from the South African Astronomical Observatory, which hosts the planet-searching SuperWASP program in the Southern Hemisphere (WASP- South), and was catalogued by its brightness and its coordinates in the sky. This information was captured first with one camera field between May 4, 2006 and July 17, 2006, and later again using two overlapping camera fields between January 31, 2007 to July 7, 2007 and from January 31, 2008 to May 29, 2008. Data processing led to the acquisition of 24,943 data points that suggested that some body transited, or crossed in front of (and briefly dimmed), WASP-15 every 3.7520 days. Approximately eleven transits, full and partial, were observed. Use of the EulerCAM photometer at the La Silla Observatory's 1.2 m Leonhard Euler Telescope on March 29, 2008 provided further evidence for an exoplanet by better defining the transit's curve. Later, the CORALIE spectrograph (also on the Euler telescope) between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 used Doppler spectroscopy to collect 21 radial velocity measurements. Analysis confirmed the presence of a planet that was later designated WASP-15b. Characteristics WASP-15 is an F-type star with a mass that is 1.18 times larger than the Sun, and a radius that is 1.477 bigger. It is, thus, larger, more massive, and more diffuse than the Sun. The star has an effective temperature of 6300 K, making it also hotter than the Sun. With a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.17, WASP-15 has 0.676 times the amount of iron than the Sun, and has consistently lower levels of other metals, including sodium, magnesium, silicon, calcium, and scandium. In addition, WASP-15 is most likely younger than the Sun, as it has an estimated age of 3.9 billion years. WASP-15 is approximately 3.09 times more luminous than the Sun. WASP-15 is located at a distance of approximately 290 parsecs (900 light years), and it has an estimated apparent magnitude of 10.9. It is, thus, not visible from Earth with the unaided eye. Planetary system WASP-15 is host to the planet WASP-15b. The planet, which is a Hot Jupiter, orbits its host star at a distance of 0.0499 AU every 3.7520656 days. WASP-15b was noted by its discoverers because of its anomalously high radius, which is 1.428 times that of Jupiter, compared to its mass, which is 0.542 times the size of Jupiter. WASP-15b's large radius cannot be explained solely by its proximity to its star, suggesting that some form of tidal heating or other internal heating mechanism is also involved. Naming WASP-15, and its planet WASP-15b, were chosen as part of the 2019 NameExoWorlds campaign organised by the International Astronomical Union, which assigned each country a star and planet to be named. WASP-15 was assigned to Ivory Coast. The winning proposal named the star Nyamien refers to the supreme creator deity of Akan mythology, and the planet Asye refers to the Earth goddess of Akan mythology.

Heir to Escadrille 3 (the \\"Cigognes\\" Escadrille) EC 1/2 Cigogne was created on November 1945, by reorganizing No. 329 Squadron RAF, which the latter was constituted by pilots of Groupe de Chasse 1/2 Cigognes after the armistice of 1940. The latter was deployed to French Indochina, and combat engaged on Supermarine Spitfire, with Escadrille SPA 3 stationed in Saigon and the SPA 103 stationed in Hanoi. Upon its return to mainland France, the squadron converted to the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt in 1948.

Accessed 2009-08-30. Archived 2009-09-03. in June 1912, the first flights of the French air arm were formed. One of these was established at the army camp of Avord, in Cher. Its designation, B.L. 3, arose from the aircraft type with which it was equipped, the Bl√©riot XI. Once established, the flight moved eastward, towards Alsace. The sight of this 'migration' led to comparison with the storks which are harbingers spring in Alsace. So the name 'Cigogne' came to be associated in people's minds with B.L. 3.Squadron site Alsace had been part of France until 1871 but in 1912 was part of Germany. The association therefore touched French pride. It was not until 1916, under the pressure of the Great War in which aircraft numbers grew rapidly, that the association between the emblem and the unit became official. So that aircrews should be able to recognise other members of their own flight, in order to regroup after dispersal during fighting, the command of the Somme Combat Group, of which flight.3 was then a part, ordered that clear symbols be painted on aircraft. By this time, the flights had been grouped into squadrons. The squadron's commanding officer, Commandant Felix Brocard, chose to make reference to the Alsatian storks by using a white stork with lowered wings as the emblem on the Nieuports of no. 3 flight. He then ordered the other flights of the squadron to choose emblems using storks in other postures. The modern emblem of the squadron bears three storks at three points in the wing-beat cycle. They represent respectively Flight 3 (wings low), Flight 103 (wings high) and Flight 12 (wings spread).The three emblems may be seen separately at the foot of the squadron‚Äôs page in the Air Force site. While the squadron's emblem has all three birds in black and white, the individual emblem of No. 12 Flight is in black and silver. Accessed 2009-08-30. Archived 2009-09-03.

However, it was re-formed in July 1941 and equipped with Dewoitine D.520s. In 1942, it was sent to North Africa where it took its opportunity, with other units, to join the Free French Forces and was shipped to Ayr, in Scotland. There it was given the British designation No. 329 Squadron RAF. On 6 June 1944, it took part in the Normandy landings and from 19 August, was again based in France, at Sommervieu, Normandy, under Captain Ozanne. At this period, it specialized in ground attack but aerial combat was still part of the job and in December 1944, the squadron was faced with its first Jet- propelled opposition. In July 1945, fifteen aircraft of the squadron took part in the victory fly-past. Post World War II In November 1945, the squadron, EC 1/2 Cigognes was re-established as a unit of the French Air Force. In June 1946 it left for French Indochina where it flew the Supermarine Spitfire, with the SPA 3 flight stationed at Saigon and SPA 103 at Hanoi. On its return to Metropolitan France in 1948, it was reequipped with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. In 1949, EC 1/2 Cigognes moved to its present base at Dijon-Longvic, at the same time reequipping with De Havilland Vampire jets, followed by the Dassault MD 450 Ouragan, then Dassault Myst√®re IVAs. It was in this aircraft that the squadron was engaged during the Suez Crisis in 1956. Notably, it became the first unit of the French Air Force to deploy an indigenous Mach-2 fighter, the new Mirage IIIC, on 7 July 1961. In 1968 these were replaced by Mirage IIIE. In 1984, the \\"Storks\\" moved onto the Mirage 2000C. On September 9 1994, it received a third flight: the SPA 12. At the end of the 1990s, the squadron moved to Mirage 2000-5F. Escadrille SPA 12 was dissolved on September 3 2009 and replaced by SPA 26 (a traditional escadrille of EC 1/5 Vend√©e, dissolved in 2007). On Friday 29 July 2011, the squadron moved to Luxeuil Air Base. This put an end to the presence of the Cigognes on Aerial Base 102 Dijon-Longvic. The squadron has played a role in NATO's response to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, providing a pair of Mirage 2000-5F (along with a pair of Mirage 2000C fighters from EC 2/5) which arrived at Poland's 22nd Air Base on 2 June 2014.

Because of its fame as a monument, Mount Rushmore in South Dakota has appeared frequently in works of fiction, and has been discussed or depicted in other popular works. As a cover for a secret location Several films and other media depict Mount Rushmore as a secret base of operations for the government or another clandestine group, or as having some comparable significance other than as a monument. In the early 1980s television series, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, a flashback sequence in the episode, \\"Testimony of a Traitor\\", shows Rogers meeting with the President of the United States in a secret base inside Mount Rushmore. In Team America: World Police, it is the secret base of operations for the protagonists. In the film, the base, along with the sculptures on the surface, are severely damaged in a suicide bombing by Michael Moore. In the universe of the Ben 10 franchise, Mount Rushmore is the location of the main Plumbers (a sort of intergalactic police force) complex, and plays a key role in multiple episodes of the series, including \\"Secrets,\\" \\"Truth\\", the \\"Ben 10,000\\" episodes, and \\"Ben 10 vs. The Negative 10.\\" The monument is inadvertently destroyed by Upchuck in the latter episode, during the final battle with the Forever King. Another group shown as having a secret base inside the mountain is the \\"All Purpose Enforcement Squad\\" of Young Justice, in the DC Universe series, with the team accidentally damaging Washington's head when they break into the facility to rescue their teammate Secret. The comic book superhero Mister Majestic, a character in the Wildstorm Productions universe, also had a secret base of operations inside Mount Rushmore, analogous to Superman's \\"Fortress of Solitude\\". In Ultraman: The Adventure Begins, a 1981 animated movie jointly produced by Hanna-Barbera and Tsuburaya Productions, the heroic Ultra Force is headquartered within Mount Rushmore. Mount Rushmore was a primary location of interest in the plot of the 2007 film National Treasure: Book of Secrets starring Nicolas Cage.Real Movie News, National Treasure: Book Of Secrets (2007) Movie Information. In the film, Benjamin Franklin Gates (Cage) discovers in the titular Book Of Secrets that the location of the monument was chosen to erase landmarks in a map that leads to the golden city of C√≠bola, hidden deep underground behind the mountain. In the film, the golden city appears to be beneath a lake to the north of the monument - this would likely be Horse Thief Lake, about 1.5 miles to the northwest of the monument, but the lake actually used in the film is the nearby Sylvan Lake, five miles southwest of the monument.  Alterations and additions to the faces  Mount Rushmore with a fifth President in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989) Mountain overlooking the fictional town of Konohagakure, from Naruto The large carved faces of the monument have made it a target for parodies and other symbolic alterations of its appearance in media: Replacement or destruction of the existing faces Alterations in media have frequently included replacement of one or more of the four presidents' faces with other people or characters, or the addition of another face: *In the 2000 Courage The Cowardly Dog episode \\"Family Business\\", Muriel asked what a thief did with the rest of Mount Rushmore (since he stole the heads of Washington, Jefferson, and Roosevelt). The camera zooms out with the president's heads underneath the house. * In the 1980 film Superman II, General Zod and his criminal partners Ursa and Non (the three escaped supervillains from the Phantom Zone) use their superpowers to replace the faces of Washington, Jefferson and Roosevelt with their own, while destroying Lincoln's. This scene is removed in the 2006 director's cut of the film, replaced instead with a scene showing them destroying the Washington Monument.https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=4165 The October 1981 issue of MAD Magazine parodies the film and depicts this scene, except that in addition to putting their own faces on the monument, the villains have replaced Lincoln with Richard Nixon. * In the 1992 film Buried on Sunday, an unarmed nuclear missile is accidentally launched and it breaks the nose of Theodore Roosevelt off before landing next to a group of bikers in Sturgis, who decide to trade it for speed. * In the 1996 film Mars Attacks!, the Martians in a UFO carve their leaders' faces into Mount Rushmore, replacing the Presidents' heads. * The cover of the Chipmunks' 1982 album, Chipmunk Rock, depicts Roosevelt replaced by Alvin the Chipmunk. * The Nintendo 64 video game Pilotwings 64 (which features a level based on United States geography and landmarks) shows the monument in the approximate location of South Dakota, but replaces Washington's head with that of Nintendo's mascot Mario. The player can change Mario into his rival, Wario by crashing into his face or by shooting him from the Gyrocopter. * In a viral video teaser for the Watchmen film, \\"The Keene Act and You\\", a brief scene depicts Richard Nixon in place of Abraham Lincoln.YouTube video, \\"The Keene Act and You\\" (at 0:26). * In the 2005 miniseries Category 7: The End of the World, global warming causes the moisture inside the mountain to expand, which causes the head of George Washington to break off. * In the 2006 miniseries 10.5 Apocalypse, an earthquake hits the site as a fault-line begins to recreate the Western Interior Seaway, destroying the faces of the presidents, which eventually fall. * In an episode of Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide, Ned Bigby and his friend, Jennifer \\"Moze\\" Mosely, collaborate on a project involving Mount Rushmore with Ned in place of Thomas Jefferson. By the end of the episode, the project gets ruined after Ned frees himself after getting stuck and the project falls over. * In Robert Ferrigno's Assassin trilogy, fundamentalist Islamic clerics dynamite Mount Rushmore in a failed attempt to destroy it. * In the Roger Rabbit short Trail Mix-Up, Roger and some other characters are sent flying by an erupting geyser, and crash into Mount Rushmore, destroying it (the faces comically screaming before the crash). * In Poul Anderson's dystopian novelette The Pugilist, the United States is defeated and conquered by the Soviet Union. The puppet American government installed by the Soviets orders what is left of the US Army to turn its artillery at the Heads on Mount Rushmore and destroy them. * In the beginning of the \\"Boom Boom\\" trailer for the 2014 video game Wolfenstein: The New Order, Mount Rushmore is seen being destroyed by Nazi soldiers after their victory in World War II, with a general observing the destruction of the landmark.Youtube Video, \\"Wolfenstein - 'BOOM BOOM' Gameplay Trailer\\" Addition of extra faces Depictions of a fifth (and occasionally, sixth) face usually place it to the left of George Washington or to the right of Abraham Lincoln, at about the same height as other presidents: * The cover of the February 1957 issue of MAD Magazine Issue #31, depicts Mount Rushmore with a fifth face: that of Alfred E. Neuman. In MAD Magazine, the fifth face is closer to the base of the mountain, and is below Thomas Jefferson. * In the 1964 film, The Incredible Mr. Limpet, Don Knott‚Äôs title character is transformed into a fish resembling a tilefish. He helps the Allies win the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. For these exploits, his tilefish image is added (during a fantasy sequence) to Mount Rushmore, to Lincoln‚Äôs right (viewer's perspective). * In the 1978 Judge Dredd comic \\"The Cursed Earth\\" two faces are added: President Jimmy Carter to the left of Washington, and the leader of a group of mutants to the right of Lincoln. * In the final scene of the 2003 film Head of State, fictional president Mays Gilliam's face has been added into Mount Rushmore next to Abraham Lincoln. * In the opening titles of the 2001 British satirical animated series 2DTV, George W. Bush erects his face in the gap between Roosevelt and Lincoln. A nuclear warhead is then deployed from the top of Bush's sculpture, much to the shock of the other presidents. * In a deleted scene from the 1989 film Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, a fifth face carved into the mountain is that of an African-American woman (named in the novelization as Sarah Susan Eckert). * President Barack Obama has been added as a fifth head to Mount Rushmore on internet depictions of the mountain. On July 8, 2009, climate change activists unfurled a banner with the purpose of portraying a fifth face on Mount Rushmore of Obama as a President who could make Presidential changes in leading effective climate legislation as opposed to being a politician.Greenpeace Gets Badass, Drapes Pic Of Obama Over Mt. Rushmore Calling For Climate ActionObama Makes Early, Unflattering Appearance on Mount RushmoreGreenpeace members charged in Mount Rushmore G-8 protest - CNN.com * Prior to the retirement of Coach Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant in 1982, fans of the University of Alabama football team generated an image with Bryant's face added to the left of Lincoln. * In the popular cartoon, Phineas and Ferb, the character Candace gets her face carved into the Mt. Rushmoore by her brothers for her birthday, but afterwards, lava destroys it. Imitation of the style Deep Purple's 1970 album Deep Purple in Rock has a cover inspired by Mount Rushmore depicting the five members' faces instead of the four presidents. The title is an obvious pun, the music genre of the album being rock music, while the monument is carved from what is essentially a very large rock. In turn, the English cover of the volume 4 DVD release of the anime series Cromartie High School (entitled \\"Mount Rockmore\\") is a parody of the Deep Purple album. Here, the anime characters' faces replace those of the band members. In the Japanese manga, Naruto, four of the main leaders (Hokage) of Konohagakure (Hidden Leaf Village) have had their faces carved into a mountain overlooking the village of Konohagakure, in a style similar to that of Mount Rushmore (with Tsunade's face added later, in Shippuuden. (Hatake Kakashi) and (Uzumaki Naruto) were the 6th and 7th face to be added to the mountain in the last chapter). The village was designed by Japanese manga artist Masashi Kishimoto. The fictional nuclear-equipped warship Outer Haven, in the video game Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, features a Mount Rushmore-esque sculpture of the four \\"Snake\\" characters that have appeared thorough the Metal Gear series (Solidus Snake, Old Snake, Liquid Snake and Big Boss). In the 1994 live action version of Richie Rich starring Macaulay Culkin, the Rich family has their own version of Mount Rushmore, named Mount Richmore in the movie, built on their property with their own faces sculpted into it. It becomes the setting for the film's finale, echoing the finale of North by Northwest. The WWE had their own version of Mount Rushmore consisting of the best wrestlers in the company's history. The ones sculpted into the mountain are The Undertaker, Steve Austin, John Cena, and Hulk Hogan. In North by Northwest Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) and Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) dangle precipitously from the sculpture of George Washington in North by Northwest. Sign near the mountain The memorial was famously used as the location of the climactic chase scene in Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 film North by Northwest. The scene was developed in the course of screenwriting, as Hitchcock and scriptwriter Ernest Lehman were trying to develop an idea. As Lehman would later recall, Hitchcock \\"murmured wistfully, 'I always wanted to do a chase across the faces of Mount Rushmore.'\\"Barbara Straumann, \\"Rewriting American Foundational Myths in Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest\\", in Martin Heusser and Gudrun Grabher, American Foundational Myths (2002), p. 201. While writing the script, Lehman took a trip to Mount Rushmore to scale the faces of the famous monument; he only got halfway to the top, and bought a camera to give to the park ranger to photograph the famous monument for him. However, the scene was not actually filmed at the monument, since permission to shoot an attempted killing on the face of a national monument was refused by the National Park Service. In the film the villain's house is located on a fictitious forested plateau above the monument. Other scenes, including the view of the Memorial's parking lot, the patio at the Memorial concession, the scene in the dining room of the concession, and the loading of the body into the ambulance, were actually shot at Mount Rushmore. The other scenes involving Mount Rushmore were filmed on Hollywood soundstages. The reference in the movie to the Sheraton-Johnson Hotel in Rapid City, South Dakota is accurate; the hotel still operates as the Hotel Alex Johnson. The North by Northwest appearance has been parodied in several venues. In \\"North by North Quahog\\", a 2005 episode of the animated series Family Guy, Mount Rushmore's forested plateau was the location of the villain's home, and characters Peter and Lois are chased down the monument by Mel Gibson. In Richie Rich, the Rich family's imitation of Mount Rushmore becomes the setting for the film's finale, echoing the finale of North by Northwest. Other appearances Appearances set in the future Alan Weisman, in his 2007 book The World Without Us,Alan Weisman, The World Without Us (St. Martin's Press, 2007) suggests that the Mount Rushmore memorial could last up to 7.2 million years and thus be one of the longest-lasting human artifacts. Because of this enduring structure, it has appeared in some science fiction set in the distant future: * In the 1991 Red Dwarf novel Better Than Life, Dave Lister finds Mount Rushmore half-buried underneath garbage, which causes him to realize he is back on Earth (a usage reminiscent of the scene from the original Planet of the Apes film). * A 1980 episode of the post-apocalyptic cartoon Thundarr the Barbarian, \\"Attack of the Amazon Women\\", uses Mount Rushmore as its setting. * The altered appearance in the 1989 film Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is also a future setting, specifically the late 23rd century. * In Nelson S. Bond's \\"Meg the Priestess\\" series, the short story \\"Pilgrimage\\" involves a journey to the \\"Place of the Gods\\": Jarg, Ibrim, Taamuz and Tedhi, revealed to be Mount Rushmore. * The speculative documentary series Life After People predicts that, while the faces of Mount Rushmore are expected to still be recognizable in 10,000 years, in five million years the sculpture will no longer exist due to erosion. In literature * In Donald E. Westlake's 1990 crime novel Drowned Hopes, protagonist John Dortmunder climbs the mountain and into Abraham Lincoln's nose to retrieve a stash of stolen money hidden there years earlier. In theme parks * Mount Rushmore is one of the landmarks reproduced at the Window of the World theme park located in the western part of the city of Shenzhen in the People's Republic of China. * A version made out of 1.5 million Lego bricks is featured at Legoland Billund in Denmark. The one at Legoland California has minifigures that move a giant cotton swab in and out of Washington's right ear. In video games In addition to in Pilotwings 64, Mount Rushmore also appears: * As a Wonder of the World in the PC game Civilization IV * In Capcom's Street Fighter as the background stage of Mike * In Pro Pinball: Timeshock!, where climbing on it is one of the tasks * In Fatal Fury 2 as Terry Bogard's stage. * In the 1993 computer game Sam & Max Hit the Road, one scene features a fictional Dinosaur Tar Pit at Mount Rushmore, where the character Sam can be made to sing \\"The Name Game\\" with the names of the Presidents depicted on the mountain. Characters are also seen bungee jumping from each of the Presidents' nostrils using green colored rope. * In Metal Gear Solid 4, the four computer AIs: GW, AL, TJ and TR are named after the initials of the four presidents and Liquid Ocelot's warship, Outer Haven, is decorated with a \\"Mount Snakemore\\" consisting of Solidus Snake, Old Snake, Liquid Snake, and Big Boss. * In the 2008 strategy game Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3, an allied campaign mission is staged around the site, with various weapons located inside the heads. * In Crash Tag Team Racing, In the Tyrannosaurus Wrecks Hub, one can see, in a mount, four dinosaur skulls imitating Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Lincoln. * Br√ºtal Legend has a Mt. Rockmore feature. Due to the game being centered around rock, the legendary figures of the real life Mt. Rockmore have been replaced with figures of legendary rockers (the player also has the option of changing these heads). * In the 1990 game Fighter Bomber from Activision, one can fly by the monument. * In Just Cause 2, one of the settlements features a parody of Mount Rushmore, featuring a three-headed sculpture secret base where the head of the middle represents the current president of Panau, Pandak \\"Baby\\" Panay.

It publishes the Journal of Black Psychology. Its main offices are in Washington, D.C. The focuses of the ABPsi are to address the needs of black psychologists while also seeking to improve the state of black mental health at large. Beginnings The ABPsi was formed in the wake of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the rise of Black Nationalism of that era.The History of the Association of Black Psychologists, pg.1 The ABPsi intended to create a psychology of the black experience focused on improving the circumstances of black people. Their initial purpose was to help black psychologists in a time of discrimination and to provide psychological resources to the larger black community. The founding psychologists believed that a psychology created mostly by white middle-class men could not explain the situation of people of African descent, and moved to incorporate African philosophy and cultural experience into the creation of a new understanding of black psychology.The History of the Association of Black Psychologists, pg.13 The principles of ABPsi's creation were \\"to organize their skills and abilities to influence necessary change, and to address themselves to significant social problems affecting the Black community and other segments of the population whose needs society has not fulfilled.\\" The founders actively chose to remain independent of the American Psychological Association, decrying that body's complicit role in perpetuating white racism in society and the prevalence of studies featuring only white male participants. Instead, the ABPsi took a more active stance, seeking ‚Äúto develop a nationwide structure for pooling their resources in meeting the challenge of racism and poverty‚ÄùThe History of the Association Black Psychologists, pg. 3 according to a statement released at their founding in 1968. Ebony Magazine's publication of \\"Toward a Black Psychology\\" by Joseph White in 1970 was a landmark in setting the tone and direction of the emerging field of Black Psychology. By 1974 the ABPsi had established offices in Washington D.C., begun the Journal of Black Psychology, and fully separated from the APA. In 1976 Ruth G. King became the first female president of the ABPsi. Work The ABPsi successfully anchored the formation of an independent field of Black Psychology. With increased numbers of African- Americans enrolling in graduate programs in Psychology and entering the field, the ABPsi's Journal, newsletter, and annual meetings brought the individual efforts of African-American psychologists together to form a collective endeavor encompassing a large body of research including hundreds of books and thousands of articles. The ABPsi has continued to orient itself toward actively addressing the problems facing black communities and challenging myths of black inferiority that persist in mainstream psychology. The ABPsi aided in the formation of many other associations of Black professionals, joining in an inter-disciplinary effort to further the struggles of African- Americans.The History of the Association of Black Psychologists, pg.34 While the ABPsi has achieved greater recognition within mainstream psychology, the critiques levied by its founders can be clearly seen in the ascendant field of cultural psychology. Within the past few years, the ABPsi has been able to launch programs to certify specialists in the practice of \\"African-centered psychology\\". Through these programs, practitioners are trained to tend to the specific needs of those of African ancestry.

Life After having studied law, and taken the degree of doctor at Bologna, he joined the Friars Minor of the Observants in the convent of San Paolo. As companion of James of the Marches in Bosnia, and as Vicar-Provincial of Apulia (1439), Nicholas greatly contributed to the prosperity of the Observants for whom (1440) he obtained complete independence from the Conventuals, a privilege shortly after revoked according to the desire of Bernardino of Siena. He was also appointed Visitator and afterwards Superior, of Palestine, but difficulties seem to have hindered him from the discharge of these offices. Works Nicholas wrote both in Latin and Italian a number of treatises on moral theology, the spiritual life, and on the Rule of St. Francis. They include: *\\"Supplementum Summae Magistratiae seu Pisanellae,\\" a revised and increased edition of the Summa of Bartholomew of San Concordio(or of Pisa), O.P., completed at Milan, 1444, with many editions before the end of the fifteenth century: Venice, 1473 sqq.; Genoa, 1474; Milan, 1479; Reutlingen, 1483; Nuremberg, 1494. * \\"Quadriga Spirituale,\\" in Italian, treats in a popular way what the author considers the four principal means of salvation, viz. faith, good works, confession, and prayer. These are like the four wheels of a chariot, whence the name. The work was printed at Jesi, 1475, and under the name of St. Bernardine of Siena in 1494.

Biography Henry Monson was born on 25 August 1793 in Cawood, North Yorkshire, England, the son of Bernard Monson, a labourer. By 1825 he was living in London, where he married and set up in business as a builder and carpenter, only to go bankrupt in 1826.\\"Monson, Henry 1793‚Äì1866\\", New Zealand Dictionary of Biography.

In 1847 he again went bankrupt and turned to a neighbour, the computer pioneer Charles Babbage, for help in obtaining assisted passage to New Zealand. He duly sailed on the John Wickliffe along with two of his sons, William Henry and John Robert, arriving at Port Chalmers on 23 March 1848.Elsie Locke The Gaoler (Palmerston North: Dunmore Press, 1978) pp. 13‚Äì17. During Monson's first three years in Dunedin his struggle to survive as a builder and carpenter became increasingly difficult, and was brought to a head by the burning down of his own painfully built house. The crisis was resolved in 1851 when, through Charles Babbage's continuing influence, he was appointed to keep Dunedin's newly established gaol. He took up his duties on 1 September 1851, and at the same time began to keep the journal which has secured him his small niche in New Zealand history. Monson's administration was informed by his Christian principles, which led him to lead prayer meetings, teach some of his prisoners reading and writing, and (most unusually at the time) to abstain from the use of flogging. He set out his philosophy in an official report: > The punishment of vengeance or anything else which is calculated to embitter > the life of a Prisoner, beyond that of Barrs and Fence, I most strenuously > condemn‚Ä¶A Criminal of any \\"Class\\" cannot be improved by any mode of > severity; he may, and generally will be, by an enlightened spirit of > humanity.Elsie Locke The Gaoler (Palmerston North: Dunmore Press, 1978) p. > 85 This liberal policy, which was continuously opposed by his immediate superiors in the Provincial government, was found by a delegation of Visiting Judges in 1855 to produce encouraging results: > Mr. Monson the Gaoler appears to have stood nearly alone in all efforts > hitherto to improve the moral status of the prisoners‚Ä¶It is but just a > tribute of praise to say that he has evinced great zeal, and that his system > of \\"moral suasion\\" coupled with firmness appears to have succeeded where, > perhaps, under the circumstances, no other would.Elsie Locke The Gaoler > (Palmerston North: Dunmore Press, 1978) p. 102 Henry Monson retired from his post on 15 November 1861.

A series is therefore a sequence of strata defining a chronostratigraphic unit. Series are subdivisions of systems and are themselves divided into stages. Series is a term defining a unit of rock layers formed during a certain interval of time (a chronostratigraphic unit); it is equivalent (but not synonymous) to the term geological epoch (see epoch criteria) which defines the interval of time itself, although the two words are sometimes confused in informal literature. Series in the geological timescale The geological timescale has all systems in the Phanerozoic eonothem subdivided into series. Some of these have their own names, in other cases a system is simply divided into a Lower, Middle and Upper series. The Cretaceous system is for example divided into the Upper Cretaceous and Lower Cretaceous series; while the Carboniferous system is divided in the Pennsylvanian and Mississippian series. In 2008, the International Commission on Stratigraphy had not yet named all four series of the Cambrian. Currently series are limited to the Phanerozoic, but the ICS has stated its intention of subdividing the three systems of the Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran, Cryogenian and Tonian) into stages too. Systems and lithostratigraphy Systems can include many lithostratigraphic units (for example formations, beds, members, etc.) of differing rock types that were being laid down in different environments at the same time.

They are an example of a nondimensionalised design from which the desired filter can be scaled or transformed. They are most often seen in regard to electronic filters and especially linear analogue passive filters. However, in principle, the method can be applied to any kind of linear filter or signal processing, including mechanical, acoustic and optical filters. Filters are required to operate at many different frequencies, impedances and bandwidths. The utility of a prototype filter comes from the property that all these other filters can be derived from it by applying a scaling factor to the components of the prototype. The filter design need thus only be carried out once in full, with other filters being obtained by simply applying a scaling factor. Especially useful is the ability to transform from one bandform to another. In this case, the transform is more than a simple scale factor. Bandform here is meant to indicate the category of passband that the filter possesses. The usual bandforms are lowpass, highpass, bandpass and bandstop, but others are possible. In particular, it is possible for a filter to have multiple passbands. In fact, in some treatments, the bandstop filter is considered to be a type of multiple passband filter having two passbands. Most commonly, the prototype filter is expressed as a lowpass filter, but other techniques are possible. constant k Œ† (pi) filter __TOC__ Low-pass prototype The prototype is most often a low-pass filter with a 3 dB corner frequency of angular frequency œâc' = 1 rad/s. Occasionally, frequency f' ' = 1 Hz is used instead of œâc' = 1. Likewise, the nominal or characteristic impedance of the filter is set to R ' = 1 Œ©. In principle, any non-zero frequency point on the filter response could be used as a reference for the prototype design. For example, for filters with ripple in the passband, the corner frequency is usually defined as the highest frequency at maximum ripple rather than 3 dB. Another case is in image parameter filters (an older design method than the more modern network synthesis filters) which use the cut-off frequency rather than the 3 dB point since cut-off is a well-defined point in this type of filter. The prototype filter can only be used to produce other filters of the same classThe class of a filter is the mathematical class of the polynomials in the rational function that describe its transfer function. Image parameter filters are not rational and hence do not have a polynomial class. Such filters are classified by type (k-type, m-type etc). Type serves as the class name for image filters and is based on the filter circuit topology. and order.The order of a filter is the order of the filter's rational function. A rational function is a ratio of two polynomials and the order of the function is the order of the highest order polynomial. Any filter constructed from a finite number of discrete elements will be described by a rational function and in general, the order will be equal to the number of reactive elements that are used. For instance, a fifth-order Bessel filter prototype can be converted into any other fifth-order Bessel filter, but it cannot be transformed into a third-order Bessel filter or a fifth-order Chebyshev filter. Frequency scaling The prototype filter is scaled to the frequency required with the following transformation: i \\\\omega \\\\to \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\omega_c'}{\\\\omega_c}\\\\right) i \\\\omega where œâc' is the value of the frequency parameter (e.g. cut-off frequency) for the prototype and œâc is the desired value. So if œâc' = 1 then the transfer function of the filter is transformed as: A(i\\\\omega) \\\\to A\\\\left( i\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_c}\\\\right) It can readily be seen that to achieve this, the non-resistive components of the filter must be transformed by: L \\\\to \\\\frac{\\\\omega_c'}{\\\\omega_c}\\\\,L and, C \\\\to \\\\frac{\\\\omega_c'}{\\\\omega_c}\\\\,C Impedance scaling Impedance scaling is invariably a scaling to a fixed resistance. This is because the terminations of the filter, at least nominally, are taken to be a fixed resistance. To carry out this scaling to a nominal impedance R, each impedance element of the filter is transformed by: Z \\\\to \\\\frac{R}{R'}\\\\,Z It may be more convenient on some elements to scale the admittance instead: Y \\\\to \\\\frac{R'}{R} \\\\,Y The prototype filter above, transformed to a 600Œ©, 16kHz lowpass filter It can readily be seen that to achieve this, the non-resistive components of the filter must be scaled as: L \\\\to \\\\frac{R}{R'} \\\\,L and, C \\\\to \\\\frac{R'}{R} \\\\,C Impedance scaling by itself has no effect on the transfer function of the filter (providing that the terminating impedances have the same scaling applied to them). However, it is usual to combine the frequency and impedance scaling into a single step:Matthaei et al., pp.96-97. L \\\\to \\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\omega_c'}{\\\\omega_c}\\\\,\\\\frac{R}{R'} \\\\,L and, C \\\\to \\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\omega_c'}{\\\\omega_c}\\\\,\\\\frac{R'}{R} \\\\,C Bandform transformation In general, the bandform of a filter is transformed by replacing iœâ where it occurs in the transfer function with a function of iœâ. This in turn leads to the transformation of the impedance components of the filter into some other component(s). The frequency scaling above is a trivial case of bandform transformation corresponding to a lowpass to lowpass transformation. Lowpass to highpass The frequency transformation required in this case is:Matthaei et al., pp.412-413. \\\\frac{i\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_c'} \\\\to \\\\frac {\\\\omega_c}{i\\\\omega} where œâc is the point on the highpass filter corresponding to œâc' on the prototype. The transfer function then transforms as: A(i\\\\omega) \\\\to A\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\omega_c \\\\, \\\\omega_c'}{i\\\\omega} \\\\right) Inductors are transformed into capacitors according to, L' \\\\to C= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega_c \\\\,\\\\omega_c'\\\\,L'} and capacitors are transformed into inductors, C' \\\\to L = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega_c \\\\,\\\\omega_c'\\\\,C'} the primed quantities being the component value in the prototype. Lowpass to bandpass In this case, the required frequency transformation is:Matthaei et al., pp.438-440. \\\\frac{i\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_c'} \\\\to Q \\\\left( \\\\frac {i\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_0}+\\\\frac {\\\\omega_0}{i\\\\omega} \\\\right) where Q is the Q-factor and is equal to the inverse of the fractional bandwidth:Farago, p.69. Q=\\\\frac{\\\\omega_0}{\\\\Delta\\\\omega} If œâ1 and œâ2 are the lower and upper frequency points (respectively) of the bandpass response corresponding to œâc' of the prototype, then, \\\\Delta\\\\omega=\\\\omega_2-\\\\omega_1\\\\, and \\\\omega_0=\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega_1\\\\omega_2} Œîœâ is the absolute bandwidth, and œâ0 is the resonant frequency of the resonators in the filter. Note that frequency scaling the prototype prior to lowpass to bandpass transformation does not affect the resonant frequency, but instead affects the final bandwidth of the filter. The transfer function of the filter is transformed according to: A(i\\\\omega) \\\\to A\\\\left( \\\\omega_c' Q \\\\left[ \\\\frac {i\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_0}+\\\\frac {\\\\omega_0}{i\\\\omega} \\\\right] \\\\right) The prototype filter above, transformed to a 50Œ©, 6MHz bandpass filter with 100kHz bandwidth Inductors are transformed into series resonators, L' \\\\to L= \\\\frac{\\\\omega_c' Q}{\\\\omega_0}L' \\\\,,\\\\,C= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega_0 \\\\omega_c' Q}\\\\frac{1}{L'} and capacitors are transformed into parallel resonators, C' \\\\to C= \\\\frac{\\\\omega_c' Q}{\\\\omega_0}C' \\\\, \\\\lVert \\\\,L= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega_0 \\\\omega_c' Q}\\\\frac{1}{C'} Lowpass to bandstop The required frequency transformation for lowpass to bandstop is:Matthaei et al., pp.727-729. \\\\frac{\\\\omega_c'}{i\\\\omega} \\\\to Q \\\\left( \\\\frac {i\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_0}+\\\\dfrac {\\\\omega_0}{i\\\\omega} \\\\right) Inductors are transformed into parallel resonators, L' \\\\to L= \\\\frac{\\\\omega_c'}{\\\\omega_0 Q}L' \\\\,\\\\lVert \\\\,C= \\\\frac{Q}{\\\\omega_0 \\\\omega_c'}\\\\frac{1}{L'} and capacitors are transformed into series resonators, C' \\\\to C= \\\\frac{\\\\omega_c'}{\\\\omega_0 Q}C' \\\\, , \\\\,L= \\\\frac{Q}{\\\\omega_0 \\\\omega_c'}\\\\frac{1}{C'} Lowpass to multi-band Filters with multiple passbands may be obtained by applying the general transformation: \\\\frac{\\\\omega_c'}{i\\\\omega} \\\\to \\\\dfrac{1}{Q_1 \\\\left( \\\\dfrac {i\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_{01}}+\\\\dfrac {\\\\omega_{01}}{i\\\\omega} \\\\right)}+ \\\\dfrac{1}{Q_2 \\\\left( \\\\dfrac {i\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_{02}}+\\\\dfrac {\\\\omega_{02}}{i\\\\omega} \\\\right)}+ \\\\cdots The number of resonators in the expression corresponds to the number of passbands required. Lowpass and highpass filters can be viewed as special cases of the resonator expression with one or the other of the terms becoming zero as appropriate. Bandstop filters can be regarded as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple bandpass filter. In this way it, can be seen that this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to be viewed as special cases of it. The same response can equivalently be obtained, sometimes with a more convenient component topology, by transforming to multiple stopbands instead of multiple passbands. The required transformation in those cases is: \\\\frac{i\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_c'} \\\\to \\\\dfrac{1}{Q_1 \\\\left( \\\\dfrac {i\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_{01}}+\\\\dfrac {\\\\omega_{01}}{i\\\\omega} \\\\right)}+ \\\\dfrac{1}{Q_2 \\\\left( \\\\dfrac {i\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_{02}}+\\\\dfrac {\\\\omega_{02}}{i\\\\omega} \\\\right)}+ \\\\cdots Alternative prototype In his treatment of image filters, Zobel provided an alternative basis for constructing a prototype which is not based in the frequency domain.Zobel, 1930, p. 3. The Zobel prototypes do not, therefore, correspond to any particular bandform, but they can be transformed into any of them. Not giving special significance to any one bandform makes the method more mathematically pleasing; however, it is not in common use. The Zobel prototype considers filter sections, rather than components. That is, the transformation is carried out on a two-port network rather than a two- terminal inductor or capacitor. The transfer function is expressed in terms of the product of the series impedance, Z, and the shunt admittance Y of a filter half-section. See the article Image impedance for a description of half- sections. This quantity is nondimensional, adding to the prototype's generality. Generally, ZY is a complex quantity, ZY = U + iV\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and as U and V are both, in general, functions of œâ we should properly write, ZY = U(\\\\omega) + iV(\\\\omega)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! With image filters, it is possible to obtain filters of different classes from the constant k filter prototype by means of a different kind of transformation (see composite image filter), constant k being those filters for which Z/Y is a constant. For this reason, filters of all classes are given in terms of U(œâ) for a constant k, which is notated as, ZY = U_k(\\\\omega) + iV_k(\\\\omega)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! In the case of dissipationless networks, i.e. no resistors, the quantity V(œâ) is zero and only U(œâ) need be considered. Uk(œâ) ranges from 0 at the centre of the passband to -1 at the cut-off frequency and then continues to increase negatively into the stopband regardless of the bandform of the filter being designed. To obtain the required bandform, the following transforms are used: For a lowpass constant k prototype that is scaled: R_0=1 \\\\,,\\\\, \\\\omega_c=1 the independent variable of the response plot is, U_k(\\\\omega)=-\\\\omega^2\\\\,\\\\\\\\! The bandform transformations from this prototype are, for lowpass, U_k(\\\\omega) \\\\to \\\\left(\\\\frac{i\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_c}\\\\right)^2 for highpass, U_k(\\\\omega) \\\\to \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\omega_c}{i\\\\omega}\\\\right)^2 and for bandpass, U_k(\\\\omega) \\\\to Q^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{i\\\\omega}{\\\\omega_0}+\\\\frac{\\\\omega_0}{i\\\\omega}\\\\right)^2 See also *Electronic filter topology *Electronic filter *Linear filter *Composite image filter Filter bandforms: see, low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-stop.

The term inert gas counterdiffusion is sometimes used as a synonym, but can also be applied to situations where the ambient pressure changes. It has relevance in mixed gas diving and anesthesiology.  Background  Isobaric counterdiffusion was first described by Graves, Idicula, Lambertsen, and Quinn in 1973 in subjects who breathed one gas mixture (in which the inert component was nitrogen or neon) while being surrounded by another (helium based).  Clinical Relevance  In medicine, ICD is the diffusion of gases in different directions that can increase the pressure inside open air spaces of the body and surrounding equipment. An example of this would be a patient breathing nitrous oxide in an operating room (surrounded by air). Cuffs on the endotracheal tubes must be monitored as nitrous oxide will diffuse into the air filled space causing the volume to increase. In laparoscopic surgery, nitrous oxide is avoided since the gas will diffuse into the abdominal or pelvic cavities causing an increase in internal pressure. In the case of a tympanoplasty, the skin flap will not lay down as the nitrous oxide will be diffusing into the middle ear.  Diving Relevance  In underwater diving, ICD is the diffusion of one inert gas into body tissues while another inert gas is diffusing out. While not strictly speaking a phenomenon of decompression, it is a complication that can occur during decompression, and that can result in the formation or growth of bubbles without changes in the environmental pressure.Lambertson, Christian J (1989). Relations of isobaric gas counterdiffusion and decompression gas lesion diseases. In Vann, RD. \\"The Physiological Basis of Decompression\\". 38th Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society Workshop UHMS Publication Number 75(Phys)6-1-89. http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6853. Retrieved 10 January 2010. If the gas that is diffusing into a tissue does so at a rate which exceeds the rate of the other leaving the tissue, it can raise the combined gas concentration in the tissue to a supersaturation sufficient to cause the formation or growth of bubbles, without changes in the environmental pressure, and in particular, without concurrent decompression. Two forms of this phenomenon have been described by Lambertsen:  Superficial ICD  Superficial ICD (also known as Steady State Isobaric Counterdiffusion) occurs when the inert gas breathed by the diver diffuses more slowly into the body than the inert gas surrounding the body. An example of this would be breathing air in a heliox environment. The helium in the heliox diffuses into the skin quickly, while the nitrogen diffuses more slowly from the capillaries to the skin and out of the body. The resulting effect generates supersaturation in certain sites of the superficial tissues and the formation of inert gas bubbles. These isobaric skin lesions (urticaria) do not occur when the ambient gas is nitrogen and the breathing gas is helium.  Deep tissue ICD  Deep tissue ICD (also known as Transient Isobaric Counterdiffusion) occurs when different inert gases are breathed by the diver in sequence. The rapidly diffusing gas is transported into the tissue faster than the slower diffusing gas is transported out of the tissue. An example of this was shown in the literature by Harvey in 1977 as divers switched from a nitrogen mixture to a helium mixture (diffusivity of helium is 2.65 times faster than nitrogen), they quickly developed itching followed by joint pain. Saturation divers breathing hydreliox switched to a heliox mixture and developed symptoms of decompression sickness during Hydra V. More recently, Doolette and Mitchell have described ICD as the basis for inner ear decompression sickness and suggest \\"breathing-gas switches should be scheduled deep or shallow to avoid the period of maximum supersaturation resulting from decompression\\". It can also happen when saturation divers breathing hydreliox switch to a heliox mixture. There is another effect which can manifest as a result of the disparity in solubility between inert breathing gas diluents, which occurs in isobaric gas switches near the decompression ceiling between a low solubility gas (typically helium, and a higher solubility gas, typically nitrogen) An inner ear decompression model by Doolette and Mitchell suggests that a transient increase in gas tension after a switch from helium to nitrogen in breathing gas may result from the difference in gas transfer between compartments. If the transport of nitrogen into the vascular compartment by perfusion exceeds removal of helium by perfusion, while transfer of helium into the vascular compartment by diffusion from the perilymph and endolymph exceeds the counterdiffusion of nitrogen, this may result in a temporary increase in total gas tension, as the input of nitrogen exceeds the removal of helium, which can result in bubble formation and growth. This model suggests that diffusion of gases from the middle ear across the round window is negligible. The model is not necessarily applicable to all tissue types.  ICD Prevention  Lambertsen made suggestions to help avoid ICD while diving. If the diver is surrounded by or saturated with nitrogen, they should not breathe helium rich gases. Lambertson also proposed that gas switches that involve going from helium rich mixtures to nitrogen rich mixtures would be acceptable, but changes from nitrogen to helium should include recompression. However Doolette and Mitchell's more recent study of Inner Ear Decompression Sickness (IEDCS) now shows that the inner ear may not be well-modelled by common (e.g. B√ºhlmann) algorithms. Doolette and Mitchell propose that a switch from a helium-rich mix to a nitrogen-rich mix, as is common in technical diving when switching from trimix to nitrox on ascent, may cause a transient supersaturation of inert gas within the inner ear and result in IEDCS. A similar hypothesis to explain the incidence of IEDCS when switching from trimix to nitrox was proposed by Steve Burton, who considered the effect of the much greater solubility of nitrogen than helium in producing transient increases in total inert gas pressure, which could lead to DCS under isobaric conditions. Recompression with oxygen is effective for relief of symptoms resulting from ICD. However, Burton's model for IEDCS does not agree with Doolette and Mitchell's model of the inner ear. Doolette and Mitchell model the inner ear using solubility coefficients close to that of water. They suggest that breathing-gas switches from helium-rich to nitrogen-rich mixtures should be carefully scheduled either deep (with due consideration to nitrogen narcosis) or shallow to avoid the period of maximum supersaturation resulting from the decompression. Switches should also be made during breathing of the largest inspired oxygen partial pressure that can be safely tolerated with due consideration to oxygen toxicity. A similar hypothesis to explain the incidence of IEDCS when switching from trimix to nitrox was proposed by Steve Burton, who considered the effect of the much greater solubility of nitrogen than helium in producing transient increases in total inert gas pressure, which could lead to DCS under isobaric conditions.Burton, Steve (December 2004). \\"Isobaric Counter Diffusion\\". ScubaEngineer. http://www.scubaengineer.com/isobaric_counter_diffusion.htm. Retrieved 10 January 2010. Burton argues that effect of switching to Nitrox from Trimix with a large increase of nitrogen fraction at constant pressure has the effect of increasing the overall gas loading within particularly the faster tissues, since the loss of helium is more than compensated by the increase in nitrogen. This could cause immediate bubble formation and growth in the fast tissues. A simple rule for avoidance of ICD when gas switching at a decompression ceiling is suggested: * Any increase in gas fraction of nitrogen in the decompression gas should be limited to 1/5 of the decrease in gas fraction of helium. This rule has been found to successfully avoid ICD on hundreds of deep trimix dives. A decompression planning software tool called Ultimate Planner attempts to predict ICD through modeling the inner ear as either aqueous (Mitchell and Doolette's approach) or lipid tissue (Burton's approach).

It attracted controversy over its support for negationism. The leading spirit was Dominique Blanc. He had previously been involved in the Organisation des Jeunes Travailleurs R√©volutionnaires (OJTR) during the early 1970s. Originally inspired by the Situationist International, the OJTR was later influenced by left communism. A milieu had developed around the bookshop La Vieille Taupe which sought to reconcile the views of the German and Italian left communists. The group Le Mouvement Communiste had emerged from these circles. In 1972 OJTR published the text Militantisme, stade supr√™me de l'ali√©nation. They also produced texts under the name Quatre Millions de Jeune Travailleurs, taking the name from a 1971 youth publication of the Parti Socialiste Unifi√© - a French Socialist Party. During 1974 OJTR organised a national conference but disappeared shortly afterwards. However the text Un Monde Sans Argent emerged from the remains of the group. It was published as three pamphlets by the 'Les Amis de 4 Millions de Jeunes Travailleur' between 1975‚Äì76. By 1976 Dominique Blanc had published a journal called King Kong International with former members of the OJTR, Le Mouvement Communiste and the milieu around La Vieille Taupe. The following year essentially the same grouping produced the first issue of La Guerre Sociale. The text 'De l'exploitation dans les camps √† l'exploitation des camps' appeared in GS#3 in 1979. This tackled the concentration camp system and its subsequent ideological use. It made extensive use of the work of Paul Rassinier, a lifelong pacifist whose political trajectory had taken him through being a left-oppositionist, socialist deputy and by the 1950s a member of the Anarchist Federation. He had been interned in German labour camps during the war for his resistance activities. He subsequently wrote several books challenging other accounts of the concentration camps. In the course of this he moved from scepticism about the existence of extermination camps as opposed to labour camps, to denial of the scale of the holocaust. Although GS appreciated the visceral anti-Stalinism in Rassinier's writings, such as his accusations that Communist Party members collaborated in the functioning of the camps, they 'failed' to mention that Rassinier was equally antisemitic. Extracts from the article were used on a wall poster titled Qui est le juif ?(Who is the Jew?), which Guerre Sociale published in defence of Robert Faurisson, at the time an obscure professor of literature with a taste for controversy. He claimed he was being 'persecuted' for declaring that the gas chambers had not existed. Faurisson's alleged 'victimisation' by opponents of his views was compared through the title of this wall poster to the victimisation of Jews. This was the beginning of ultra-left negationionism. The mentor of this phenomenon was Pierre Guillaume, a former member of Socialisme ou Barbarie and Pouvoir Ouvrier who in 1965 had founded the bookshop La Vieille Taupe. Until its closure in 1972 it provided a home to a section of the ultra-left milieu in Paris. By 1978, several years after the bookshop had closed, Guillaume became infatuated with Faurisson and revived the name La Vieille Taupe for a publishing house devoted to negationism.

The video game was only released in Japan. Mystic Ark has strong similarities to the games The 7th Saga and Brain Lord, also developed by Produce and distributed by Enix. The game was being localized for a North American release under the title 7th Saga II, but the release was cancelled. Gameplay The game plays mostly as a standard Japanese role-playing game. The player controls the main character from an overhead perspective as the player traverses many worlds with towns and dungeons. The game features random battles that when the player wins will receive experience points that when accumulated will allow the player to reach the next level of experience. When certain levels of experience have been gained the player will learn spells or techniques. The unique feature of the gameplay is that when the player receives two certain arks, the power ark and the wisdom ark, the player is then allowed to pick two partners of their liking that are located within the temple as figurines. Plot The game's plot involves one of two characters that the player can choose, Remeer or Ferris. The chosen hero awakens in a temple, on an unknown island. As the player explores the temple, it is discovered that, in order to make it home, he/she must travel to different worlds that lie within the temple and find the different arks that lie within each world. When the player retrieves all the arks, he/she is given access to the final area of the temple, to face the final boss and finally return home. Each different world has its own specific storyline, involving Miriene the witch, Reeshine the grappler, Lux the tetujin, Kamiwoo the ogre, Meisia the priestess and Tokio the ninja. As such, the game plays out more of an anthology of stories with the temple tying the story as a whole together. Audio Mystic Ark's music was composed by Akihiko Mori. The game featured 30 tracks of music and was released on 2 discs with the game's original music and with arranged versions of certain tracks. Sequel A sequel titled Mystic Ark: Maboroshi Gekijo („Åæ„Åº„Çç„ÅóÂäáÂ†¥; Theatre of Illusions) was released for the PlayStation in 1999. Akihiro Yamada returned as the character designer.

Reception  Upon the game's release, four reviewers for Weekly Famitsu gave the game scores of 7, 6, 7, and 6 for a total of 26 out of 40. Gamers' Republic gave the game a B, saying the game was well deserving of an American localization. They praised the game's controls, physics, and camera, and said the game is fun to play in either single player or multiplayer modes. The review went onto say that the tanks had as much personality as their pilots, and had more \\"vigor\\" than those found in the game Tiny Tank. The reviewer wondered if the anime cinemas in the game implied it might be turned into an anime series, and hoped that the game would get a sequel on the PlayStation 2. Gamers' Republic later listed Pop'n Tanks in their 1999 Video Game Buyers Guide and Y2K Preview as one of the best games to import from Japan that year along with The Adventures of Little Ralph, Bangai-O, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Pepsiman, Robot Dandy, Metal Slug 2, Internal Section, and Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counter Attack.

A major industry since the 19th century, today it forms an important part of the nation's economy and culture. The raw materials used in chocolate production do not originate in Belgium; most cocoa is produced in Africa, Central America, and South America. Nonetheless, the country has an association with the product that dates to the early 17th century. The industry expanded massively in the 19th century, gaining an international reputation and, together with the Swiss, became one of the commodity's most important producers in Europe. Although the industry has been regulated by law since 1894, there is no universal standard for the chocolate to be labelled \\"Belgian\\". The most commonly accepted standard dictates that the actual production of the chocolate must take place inside Belgium. History A chocolatier producing easter eggs in Bruges Belgium's association with chocolate goes back as far as 1635, when the country was under Spanish occupation shortly after chocolate had been brought to Europe from Mesoamerica. By the mid-18th century, chocolate had become extremely popular in upper and middle class circles, particularly in the form of hot chocolate. Among them was Charles-Alexander of Lorraine, the Austrian governor of the territory. From the early 20th century, the country was able to import large quantities of cocoa from its African colony, the Belgian Congo. Contrary to popular belief, however, Belgium's colonies did not play an important role in the foundation of the Belgian chocolate industry. By the 1900s, chocolate was increasingly affordable for the Belgian working class. According to one study, Belgium first started to export more chocolate than it imported in the 1960s, with exports of ‚ÄúBelgian chocolates‚Äù growing exponentially since 1980. The praline is an invention of the Belgian chocolate industry, as is the ballotin, a kind of packaging associated with high-quality chocolate that was designed by Louise Agostini, the wife of Jean Neuhaus Jr., in 1915. Production and standards The composition of Belgian chocolate has been regulated by law since 1894 when, in order to prevent adulteration of the chocolate with low-quality fats from other sources, a minimum level of 35 percent pure cocoa was imposed. Attempts to introduce industry standardisation have met with little success. An attempt by the European Economic Community (EEC) to introducing minimum standards of the amount of cocoa butter substitutes across Europe led to prolonged negotiation but the legislation finally enacted, in 2003, was viewed as excessively lenient in Belgium. In 2007, a voluntary quality standard (to which about 90 percent of the country's chocolate makers adhere) was introduced by the European Union which set certain criteria for a product to be considered \\"Belgian chocolate\\". Under this \\"Belgian Chocolate Code\\", refining, mixing and concheing must be done inside Belgium. Controversy about what can legitimately be called \\"Belgian chocolate\\" has been fueled by some traditional Belgian chocolatiers being purchased by non-Belgian companies and even moving production out of Belgium. Ignace Van Doorselaere, chief executive of chocolatier Neuhaus, insists that ‚ÄúIn our dictionary, Belgian means place of manufacturing, headquarters and ownership,‚Äù but without an EU protected food status designation, those chocolatiers who remain 100% Belgian find the \\"Belgian chocolate\\" brand hard to protect. Many firms produce chocolates by hand, which is laborious and explains the prevalence of small, independent chocolate outlets, which are popular with tourists. Famous chocolate companies strictly follow traditional (and sometimes secret) recipes for their products. Varieties Pralines Pralines made in Belgium are usually soft-centred confections with a chocolate casing. They are distinct from the nut and sugar sweets popular in France and the United States which are sometimes known by the same name. They were first introduced by Jean Neuhaus II in 1912. There have always been many forms and shapes, although they almost always consist of a chocolate shell with a softer filling. Confusion can arise over the use of the word praline in Belgium as it may refer to filled chocolates in general or sometimes to traditional \\"pralin√©\\"-filled chocolates popular in Europe (pralin√© refers to caramelised hazelnuts or almonds ground into a paste). Belgian pralines are not limited to the traditional pralin√© filling and often include nuts, marzipan, salted caramel, coffee, liquors, cream liqueur, cherry or a chocolate blend that contrasts with the outer shell. They are often sold in stylised boxes in the form of a gift box. The largest manufacturers are Neuhaus, Godiva, Leonidas, and Guylian. Truffles The interior of a typical chocolate shop in Brussels Most commonly in the form of a flaky or smooth chocolate ball or traditionally a truffle-shaped lump, Belgian chocolate truffles are sometimes in encrusted form containing wafers or coated in a high-quality cocoa powder. They contain a soft ganache which is traditionally a semi-emulsion of liquid and therefore has a couple of days' shelf-life at low temperatures and/or requires refrigeration. Special truffles sometimes have a fruit, nut or coffee ganache. Rarely they feature a fruit- based liqueur or cream liqueur but remain distinguishable from pralines by their shape and texture in most cases -- crossover 'praline-truffles' also exist. Eggs, animals and figurines Hand-finished and luxury examples of eggs, animals, figurines and Valentine's Day hearts are made by many smaller Belgian chocolatiers, as elsewhere, accounting for a relatively small market share however in peak demand at Valentine's Day, Easter, Sinterklaas and Christmas. Economics Chocolate plays an important part in the Belgian economy, and there are over 2,000 chocolatiers in the country, both small and large. Today, chocolate is very popular in Belgium, with 172,000 tonnes produced each year, and widely exported. C√¥te d'Or is probably the largest commercial brand, with their products available in virtually every grocery store in the country. The largest manufacturers of wider varieties of chocolates are mentioned at Pralines. Belgian pralines (fondants) shaped like sea shells, fish, diamonds and individualist creations topped with are sold in town centre shops, market stands and many village shops across Belgium.

Xavier Barbier de Montault (6 February 1830 - 29 March 1901) was a French writer on Catholic Church history, liturgy and antiquities. Life He was born at Loudun, of a noble family. When only eight years old, he was confided to the care of his great-uncle, Charles Montault des Isles, Bishop of Angers. He studied theology at the Seminary of St. Sulpice, and went to Rome to continue his studies in theology and archaeology at the Sapienza and the Roman College. After four years his health obliged him to return to France (1857), where he was appointed historiographer of the Diocese of Angers. He searched the archives of the diocese, studied its inscriptions and monuments, and founded a diocesan museum, a project in which Arcisse de Caumont took a lively interest. Another sojourn of fourteen years in Rome (1861‚Äì75) enabled him to augment his knowledge of liturgy and Christian antiquities. He was canonical consultor to different French bishops, and at the First Vatican Council acted as theologian to Mgr Desfl√®ches. He died, aged 71, at Blaslay, Vienne, France. Works His first arch√¶ological study appeared in 1851 in the \\"Annales arch√©ologiques\\", and Adolphe Napol√©on Didron assigned him the task of making an index for this publication. Barbier de Montault was one of the most prolific contributors to the \\"Revue de l'art chr√©tien\\" from the inception of this periodical, his articles continuing to appear until 1903 (two years after his death). He also wrote numerous articles for other reviews as well as several separate works on iconography, ecclesiastical furniture, liturgy, canon law, etc. In 1889 he began to reprint his scattered works, classifying them according to subjects.

Systems in the geological timescale The systems of the Phanerozoic were defined during the 19th century, beginning with the Cretaceous (by Belgian geologist Jean d'Omalius d'Halloy in the Paris Basin) and the Carboniferous (by British geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips) in 1822). The Paleozoic and Mesozoic were divided into the currently used systems before the second half of the 19th century, except for a minor revision when the Ordovician system was added in 1879. The Cenozoic has seen more recent revisions by the International Commission on Stratigraphy. It has been divided into three systems with the Paleogene and Neogene replacing the former Tertiary System though the succeeding Quaternary remains. The one-time system names of Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene and Pliocene are now series within the Paleogene and Neogene. Another recent development is the official division of the Proterozoic into systems, which was decided in 2004.

Joshua Leavitt (September 8, 1794, Heath, Massachusetts ‚Äì January 16, 1873, Brooklyn, New York) was an American Congregationalist minister and former lawyer who became a prominent writer, editor and publisher of abolitionist literature. He was also a spokesman for the Liberty Party and a prominent campaigner for cheap postage. Leavitt served as editor of The Emancipator, The New York Independent, The New York Evangelist, and other periodicals. He was the first secretary of the American Temperance Society and co-founder of the New York City Anti-Slavery Society. Biography Born in Heath, Massachusetts, in the Berkshires, Leavitt attended Yale College, where he graduated at age twenty. He subsequently studied law and practiced for a time in Putney, Vermont, before matriculating at the Yale Theological Seminary for a three-year course of study. He was subsequently ordained as a Congregational clergyman at Stratford, Connecticut. After four years in Stratford, Rev. Leavitt decamped for New York City, where he first became secretary of the American Seamens' Friend Society, and began his 44-year career as editor of Sailors' Magazine. Thus was Leavitt launched on his career as social reformer, temperance spokesman, editor, abolitionist and religious proselytizer.A History of the Churches and Ministers, and of Franklin Association, Theophilus Packard, Boston, 1854 The Emancipator, an abolitionist broadsheet edited by Rev. Joshua Leavitt Leavitt was heavily involved in a series of high-profile anti-slavery cases, including the escape of the slave Basil Dorsey from Maryland into Massachusetts (Leavitt aided Dorsey's passage northward, and members of the extended Leavitt family helped shelter Dorsey in Massachusetts), as well as the La Amistad case, in which enslaved Africans on a Spanish ship rebelled and took control.The Amistad Case (1839‚Äì1840), American History told by Contemporaries, Joshua Leavitt, The Macmillan Company, New York, 1901 Leavitt played a pivotal role in the Amistad events, when on September 4, 1839, he, Lewis Tappan, and Simeon Jocelyn formed the Amistad Committee to raise funds for the defense of the Amistad captives.Amistad, Timeline of Events, National Park Service, nps.org One of Leavitt's major accomplishments was helping to provide the intellectual underpinnings of the abolitionist argument through his writing and publishing. In 1841, for instance, Leavitt published his \\"Financial Power of Slavery\\", a compelling document which argued that the South was draining the national economy through its reliance on slavery. The Christian Lyre Leavitt published The Christian Lyre in 1830Scan at https://archive.org/details/christianlyre00leav/, the \\"first American tunebook to take the form of a modern hymnal, with music for every hymn (melody and bass only) and the multistanza hymns printed in full, under or beside the music\\".

Its plot revolves around the power struggle between the English King Edward IV and his powerful minister Earl of Warwick, known as \\"Warwick the kingmaker\\". The King is portrayed as effeminate, capricious and licentious, in contrast with the Earl, shown as a distinguished warrior and politician, great patriot and affectionate father. Other historical figures that appear frequently in the text are Duke of Clarence, Duke of Gloucester (the future King Richard III), Marquess of Montagu, and Lord Hastings. Romance and science in the Middle Ages are the secondary themes of the novel. They are explored through Sibyll, a beautiful young maiden, and her old father, Adam Warner. Sibyll, who is in love with Lord Hastings, is inseparable from her father throughout the story. Adam is a hypomanic natural philosopher working for many years to complete his invention, a mechanical device that is supposed to carry out the functions of a modern steam engine. Persecuted, mistrusted, and misunderstood, he is forced to work as a royal alchemist. The novel ends tragically with the defeat and death of Warwick at the Battle of Barnet.

She researched and wrote extensively on the study of dance, co-authoring several books and writing hundreds of articles. Her main areas of interest were ethnomusicology and dance ethnology, with some of her best known works being \\"Panorama of Dance Ethnology\\" in Current Anthropology (1960), the book Music and dance of the Tewa Pueblos co-written with Antonio Garcia (1970), and Iroquois Music and Dance: ceremonial arts of two Seneca Longhouses (1964), in the Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology bulletin. She made substantial contributions to the study of Amerindian dance, and to dance theory. From 1958 to January 1972 she was dance editor for the journal Ethnomusicology. Biography Gertrude Prokosch was born on August 19, 1903, in Chicago, Illinois. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College, receiving a BA in 1922, and an MA in art history in 1928, concurrently studying music and dance in Berlin, Philadelphia, New York, and Providence, Rhode Island from 1922 to 1928. She then studied music and dance at the Yale School of Drama at Yale University, from 1929 to 1930. She danced under the stage name of Tula, starting in 1922. From 1923 to 1946 she was a teacher, performer, producer, and choreographer of modern dance. In the mid-1940s, she turned her focus to the study of American Indian dance, doing extensive fieldwork on the musical traditions of Michigan's Anishinaabe and others. She was awarded grants for field research by the Wenner-Gren Foundation from 1949‚Äì1973, the American Philosophical Society from 1951‚Äì1965, and the National Museum of Canada (1962‚Äì1965, 1969‚Äì1970). She wrote about Iroquois, Pueblo, Six Nations, and Great Lakes Indian dances, as well as on the subjects of dance theory and methods. In 1962, she founded the Dance Research Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Her other scholarly interests included the fields of folk liturgy and rock music. Robert Commanday of the San Francisco Chronicle praised her addition to The New Grove Dictionary of American Music, saying, \\"For the first time in the country's history, a comprehensive survey of its music and musicians is available in a single reference work. It encompasses the spectrum, the fields of concert, opera, traditional, folk and popular music, and areas related to and touching on American music in every conceivable way - industry, technology, education, religion, literature.... Two treatments must be singled out as unique and outstanding. One is the 20-page study on \\"Indians, American\\" by Bruno Nettl and Charlotte Heth on the music, Gertrude Kurath on the dance. In addition, there are separate articles on the music of nearly 40 tribes and tribal groups. Equally impressive is the 22-page article on 'European-American Music', treating in sequence the musical cultures and influences here of 19 European countries.\\" Kurath died on August 1, 1992, just a few months after the death of her husband, linguist Hans Kurath. Her archives are maintained at Cross-Cultural Dance Resources in Arizona, which published her work Half a Century of Dance Research. The Iroquois materials are housed in the Woodlands Cultural Centre in Brantford, Ontario.

Biography Khuchbarov was an ethnic Ingush and native of the village of Galashki in the republic of Ingushetia near the border with Chechnya. His body was reportedly identified after he was killed during the storming of the school. According to FSB information obtained by the Russian newspaper Vremya Novostey, Khuchbarov was living with his Russian girlfriend and their son in Oryol Oblast, until he was accused of murder and attempted murder of two members of the Armenian diaspora and declared wanted in 1998. Khuchbarov then went into hiding and moved to Chechnya, where he underwent extensive combat training in a camp of the field commander Ibragimov and took the nickname Colonel, collaborating with Arbi Barayev. Eventually he joined the brigade of Shamil Basayev and became one of his closest associates in Ingushetia. Khuchbarov and one other rebel, Amriev, were responsible for the Galashki ambush in Ingushetia on 11 May 2000, killing 18 soldiers and officers and wounding three. The bombing of the Ingushetian Department of the FSB on 15 September 2003, when three people died and 32 were seriously injured, has also been ascribed to Khuchbarov.

Her work includes performance art, installation art, multimedia art, photography, and art intervention.  Biography  From 1976-83, Kallnbach studied at the Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste in Kassel and attended the classes of Harry Kramer, Karl Oskar Blase, Georg Bussmann and Heiner Georgsdorf. She received a scholarship by the Evangelische Studienwerk Villigst. In 1977, Kallnbach spent an academic year in Auckland, New Zealand. In 1983, she graduated in fine arts, partly with the performance Examensperformance L(e)ine, and passed her Staatsexamen (Teacher Certificate Examination) in art education and English studies. Since that time, she has pursued her career as an international artist. In 1985, she was awarded a prize by the Robert Bosch Stiftung. Several trips led her to Oceania and South-East Asia in order to study, exhibit her work, or do art projects. Kallnbach held teaching positions at the Musahi University Tokyo, at the WAKO University Tokyo, at the Fachhochschule Bochum and the Kunstakademie Bad Reichenhall. In 2002, she finished training for multi-media design. Siglinde Kallnbach lives and works in Cologne, Germany.  Life and work  Since the end of the 1970s, Siglinde Kallnbach deals with socially and politically relevant subjects in her performances and interventions such as discrimination, racism, war, and injustice. Through her frequent travels, she is concerned with transcultural aspects, e.g. basic human needs and rituals, which she cross-culturally compares to facilitate dialogue beyond cultural borders. In doing so, using her own body as an instrument of physical perception is of central relevance. Until today, Siglinde Kallnbach realizes the impact of social conditions and predicaments through her own body. In her early work, this often implied carrying herself to physical extremes. Kallnbach comprehensively includes photography, various objects and materials in her performances and installations and conveys complex cultural meanings by her highly symbolic acts. These do not only refer to an individually defined myth, but transfer her very own existential experience into a wider social context. Moreover, an important aspect of her artistic work is the active involvement of others. For example, in the second part of her Trilogy Kleinsassen (1985), she was able to unite 360 participations from 39 countries in her exhibition. For her project Wunschspur-Wishingtrack (1999‚Äì2001), she collected more than 4000 wishes for the future from all over the world and transformed them into a 460 m abstract track, which she presented in a maintenance tunnel underneath the Rhine on New Year‚Äôs Eve 2000 and 2001. Siglinde Kallnbach‚Äôs artistic work is closely related to life and the everyday. Since she was diagnosed with cancer for the first time in 2000, she started to address the disease and its impact also in her art, while she places the individual suffering into a wider social context. With her interactive project a performancelife (since 2001) that serves to express empathy with cancer patients, Kallnbach creates options to release creative energy so as to convey its transformative power for the benefit of patients, their relatives, and the medical staff. For her social commitment, she was called she who loves fire in Japan as early as the 1980s.

Abilene, Texas, has steadily become the retail, residential, business, medical, and overall center of the surrounding Big Country. Commercial development was especially boosted in 2007, with several multimillion-dollar projects throughout the entire city.Carl Kieke. \\"Building on the Rise\\" Abilene Reporter-News January 27, 2008. Most of the recent development is concentrated in roughly four areas in Abilene: Southwest Drive, Catclaw Drive, and Buffalo Gap Road near the Winters Freeway to the southwest, as this area becomes a strong commercial sector as well as a good residential district; Buffalo Gap Road, Beltway South, and US Highway 83/84 near and beyond the outskirts of the city in the south with several housing developments; Loop 322 area and Oldham Ln to the southeast, also near and past the edge of the city with a mix of several residential subdivisions as well as the start of commercial growth; and State Highway 351/Ambler Avenue near Interstate 20 to the northeast, also a combination of staple retail development, similar to the southwest commercial development, and the beginnings of residential growth with a new apartment complex and growing subdivisions. Development in Abilene is accelerated in part by a growth- oriented City Council, the Development Corporation of Abilene (DCOA), the Abilene Chamber of Commerce, the Abilene Texas Convention & Visitors Bureau, the Abilene Industrial Foundation and the Abilene Preservation League. A renewed interest in Downtown has prompted the inception of the Downtown Abilene Initiative, a coalition of individuals, business and institutions to overhaul the infrastructure of Downtown. The Abilene City Council recently approved a tax incentive for developers and business owners in efforts to overhaul the infrastructure of Downtown and the Treadaway Boulevard corridor, projected to be worth $19.76 million.  Downtown  300x300px Downtown Abilene has been recently reinvigorated by a mix of grassroots efforts and formal efforts through the Abilene Chamber of Commerce's can Not Downtown Abilene Initiative. Plans are in the works to open a hotel near the Abilene Convention Center making the city's accommodations more desirable to visitors. The Initiative is the product of several studies commissioned by the City and the Chamber. The City Council's efforts to incentivize a downtown convention hotel have not been reciprocated by Taylor County. In January 2019, the County Commissioner denied a request for a 50% tax abatement over a 10-year period. The City stated the project's success was not solely dependent on the county's ability to envision a prosperous future. Mayor Williams is confident that private sector forces will help the massive project succeed. In March 2019, the City Council approved the incorporation of the Abilene Convention Center Hotel Development Corporation, a local government corporation (LGC). The LGC, a separate entity from the City and the council, is now responsible for the planning and execution of the project. In April 2019, the City Council approved plans for a Master Development Agreement with Garfield Public/Private. The plan involves a mix of funding sources, the majority of which is non-tax related. The city is responsible only for $12.4 million of the $66.64 million needed to complete the project. East Highway 80 divides Downtown into two districts: the North district, anchored by the Abilene Convention Center and a lively business atmosphere; and the South district, referred to as SoDA District (South of Downtown Abilene), anchored by the 20-story Enterprise Building, many government buildings and a budding nightlife scene. Growth along the Pine Street Corridor has exploded due to the addition of the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center and major construction on Hendrick Hospital. The two institutions connect Ambler Avenue to Downtown.

In the southwest area of the city, along and near Southwest Drive, Ridgemont Drive, and Buffalo Gap Road, several new retailers and businesses have brought new names to Abilene as this area continues to attract many to new shops, hotels, and restaurants. In addition, even some new residential projects have sprouted throughout the southwest side of the city, many of which are within blocks of Rebecca Lane. Construction on several arterial and connective streetsCarl Kieke. \\"Construction Zone,\\" Abilene Reporter-News, May 19, 2008. is indicative of the area's strong commercial growth. Southwest Drive was widened from 2 lanes each direction (plus central left-turn lane) to 3 lanes each direction, totaling 7 lanes from Catclaw Drive to S. Clack Street and 6 lanes under the Winters Freeway. This project was completed in late 2008.City of Abilene Website - Construction and Repair Listing: Southwest Drive Traffic Improvements Also, Catclaw Drive was reconstructed and reconfigured to create 2 northbound lanes, 1 southbound lane, and 1 shared left-turn lane.Doug Myers. \\"Taking it to the streets,\\" Abilene Reporter-News, April 7, 2008. The frontage roads of the Winters Freeway, S. Clack Street and S. Danville Drive, were reconstructed from S. 14th St to the US 83/84 & Loop 322 interchange, with restriping and minor widening done between Southwest Drive and Buffalo Gap Road from 2 lanes each to 3 lanes each.Winters Freeway is not three lanes...yet Southwest Drive and Catclaw Drive have become the source of multiple new businesses, many of which are national chains with their first Abilene location. Two new shopping centers have been created in the area since 2005, Shops at Abilene and Abilene Marketplace, though the latter currently only has one tenant. Also, Buffalo Gap Road and Ridgemont Drive have been a constant area for retail and business and still continues to develop. Here the Mall of Abilene has been a strong spur for commerce since the 1980s, after it was constructed in 1979.Mall of Abilene property facts Property Fact Sheet, page 2 Contained is a list of several new businesses brought to this commercial district since the turn of the century.  Shops  * Shops at Abilene - Shopping center built in 2005 at the southeast corner of Southwest Drive and Catclaw Drive, where tenants include Bed Bath & Beyond, Michael's, Ross, PetSmart, Payless ShoeSource, James Avery, Old Navy, and several more chain, and even local, stores and restaurants * Abilene Marketplace - Currently only includes Kohl's, the only department store in the city outside of the Mall of Abilene, but has plenty of room for more construction for future tenants *The Shops at Abilene Village - Construction began in 2018.

South of Antilley Road, these subdivisions mainly use two routes to enter the city, Buffalo Gap Road and US Highway 83/84, where many of these places are located. This surge of residential growth is evidence of both recent outward growth in the city and the desire for open spaces often exhibited by urbanites as well as suburbanites. Buffalo Gap Road * Southern Meadows (Rio Mesa) - Created by the extension of a small existing road, nearly up to capacity * Indian Trails - Located off Antilley Road, currently has very few houses * Bella Vista Estates - A wealthier subdivision located southeast of Beltway South and Buffalo Gap Road * Tuscany Trails - off Beltway South, roughly midway between Buffalo Gap Road and US 83/84 US Highway 83/84 * Skyline Estates - Small subdivision off Beltway South near the US 83/84 overpass * Saddle Creek Estates - Also a wealthier subdivision that has expanded since its inception in the mid-1990s * Lakes at Saddle Creek - Expanded continuously since 1999, reached capacity in 2008 The following subdivisions are located outside of the city limits. * Mountain Shadows Ranch - Another wealthier subdivision, created in 2006, which still has very few houses * Remington Estates - Average-class community located at Clark Road and US 83/84, nearly at full capacity * Deer Valley Estates - off US 83/84 just south of Bell Plains Road * Mountain Meadow - On Bell Plains Road near Buffalo Gap, Texas * Cedar Hills Lake - Also on Bell Plains Road between FM 89 and US 83/84 * The Canyons - off County Road 127 south of Bell Plains Road * Callahan Divide - off US 83/84 south of Country Road 149 * Vista Del Sol - Located around the Steamboat Mountain area Southeast In commercial development, the southeast area of Abilene, around Loop 322, is likely \\"ranked third in the city\\" for development.Loop 322 on the grow Quoted Richard Petree, Taylor County Chief Appraiser Currently, all that exists is a family entertainment center, a small local shopping center, a restaurant, and a new gas station.\\"Building on the Rise\\" (Look at the bottom of the article.) Albeit, that could easily change in near future with the area possibly on the move towards self-sustainability. The area is definitely a leading source of residential development. Several subdivisions have broken ground around the Loop area and along Oldham Lane/FM 1750. As business develops in the area, the southeast region could become analogous to the southwest area, but today the region is only in its initial stages. Commercial Though only a few businesses are in the southeast area outside of Loop 322, the area does show promise for future growth. With housing construction on the rise, the region proves to be a good market for residential necessity businesses such as grocery and home improvement stores or possibly restaurants. Currently, however, there exist a unique collection of various local businesses and very few, if any, chain stores. * Prime Time Family Entertainment Center - Located on the Loop 322 frontage road, this family-oriented business has become widely successful, offering a venue unlike that found anywhere else in the city.Prime Time offers family fun * Skyline Oven & Grill - Located in Prime Time Family Entertainment Center *Lytle Land & Cattle Co - An Abilene culinary staple offering mesquite grilled steaks and seafood. *The Winery at Willow Creek - Locally owned winery, great for events. * Lone Star Outpost Retail Center - Small shopping plaza of local businesses given similar architecture to the nearby Lone Star Ranch subdivision * Copper Creek Restaurant - Upscale restaurant that often hosts live music *Cisco College - Regional college offering associate degrees and certificates in various fields. *Texas State Technical College - Abilene Industrial Technology Center, newly constructed in 2018. 300x300px * Dodge Jones Youth Sports Center - Funded and planned opening for November 2019. *Abilene Zoo - One of Abilene's biggest attractions. *Taylor County Expo Center - Regional grounds for rodeos and the West Texas Fair.

However, after the turn of the 21st century, construction accelerated rapidly for the area to become the second strongest area of development in the city. Since 2005, the Heritage Parks subdivision has expanded; a new community and apartment complex have begun; a Wal-Mart has been attracted to the area, enticing more commercial growth, and a new master- planned commercial district has been created by a major developer, Kenneth Musgrave, who owned, and still owns, much of the land in the area along SH 351.

In the early nineties he joined a pen friend scheme run by the Prison Reform Trust and began corresponding with a life sentenced prisoner, Tom Shannon. Through Tom's letters, Christopher learned about prison life and about the shocking levels of poor literacy amongst prisoners. In 1995 the letters were put together in a book titled, ‚ÄòInvisible Crying Tree‚Äô. The royalties from the sale of the book were used to found the Shannon Trust. Christopher took his idea for the Shannon Reading Plan to the Director General of the Prison Service who was sceptical and challenged him to make it work in HMP Wandsworth, a notoriously busy prison in London. It took a further three years of experimentation before the Shannon Reading Plan really started to impact on the lives of non-reading prisoners. In 2001, Neil Lodge, a prison officer at HMP Wandsworth took an interest in the Shannon Reading Plan and by the end of the year he had developed a workable plan and produced 48 new readers. Neil observed that those involved not only benefited from learning to read but also from increased confidence, raised self-esteem and improved behaviour. The major breakthrough came through the discovery of ‚ÄòToe by Toe‚Äô which is designed to help children and adults learn to read from the beginning. The Shannon Trust Reading Plan, is an award-winning peer mentoring programme that encourages and supports prisoners who can read to give one-to- one support to prisoners who struggle to read. The Reading Plan, which runs in almost every prison in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, now uses Turning Pages, a reading programmed developed by the Trust specifically for adults in custody. The Shannon Trust has been granted charitable funding from many sources. Christopher Morgan and the Shannon Trust have won awards for their contribution to learning in prisons, including The Longford Prize in 2004 and the Centre for Social Justice award in 2005.

They were patented by Otto Zobel in 1932.Zobel, O J, Electrical wave filters, US patent 1 850 146, filed 25 Nov 1930, issued 22 Mar 1932 Like the m-type filter from which it is derived, the mm'-type filter type was intended to provide an improved impedance match into the filter termination impedances and originally arose in connection with telephone frequency division multiplexing. The filter has a similar transfer function to the m-type, having the same advantage of rapid cut-off, but the input impedance remains much more nearly constant if suitable parameters are chosen. In fact, the cut-off performance is better for the mm'-type if like-for-like impedance matching are compared rather than like- for-like transfer function. It also has the same drawback of a rising response in the stopband as the m-type. However, its main disadvantage is its much increased complexity which is the chief reason its use never became widespread. It was only ever intended to be used as the end sections of composite filters, the rest of the filter being made up of other sections such as k-type and m-type sections. An incidental advantage of the mm'-type is that it has two independent parameters (m and m') that the designer can adjust. This allows for two different design criteria to be independently optimised. __TOC__ Background The mm'-type filter was an extension of Zobel's previous m-type filter, which itself grew out of George Campbell's k-type design. Zobel's m-type is arrived at by applying the m-derivation process (see m-derived filter) to the k-type filter. Completely analogously, the mm'-type is arrived at by applying the m-derived process to the m-type filter. The value of m used in the second transformation is designated m to distinguish it from m, hence the naming of the filter mm'-type. However, this filter is not a member of the class of filters, general mn-type image filters, which are a generalisation of m-type filters. Rather, it is a double application of the m-derived process and for those filters the arbitrary parameters are usually designated m1, m2, m3 etc., rather than m, m', m as here. The importance of the filter lies in its impedance properties. Some of the impedance terms and section terms used in image design theory are pictured in the diagram below. As always, image theory defines quantities in terms of an infinite cascade of two-port sections, and in the case of the filters being discussed, an infinite ladder network of L-sections. 600px The sections of the hypothetical infinite filter are made up of series impedance elements of 2Z and shunt admittance elements of 2Y. The factor of two is introduced since it is normal to work in terms of half-sections where it disappears. The image impedance of the input and output port of a section, \`Zi1\` and \`Zi2\`, will generally not be the same. However, for a mid-series section (that is, a section from halfway through a series element to halfway through the next series element) will have the same image impedance on both ports due to symmetry. This image impedance is designated \`ZiT\` due to the \\"\`T\`\\" topology of a mid-series section. Likewise, the image impedance of a mid-shunt section is designated \`ZiŒ†\` due to the \\"\`Œ†\`\\" topology. Half of such a \`\\"T\\"\` or \`\\"Œ†\\"\` section is (unsurprisingly) called a half-section. The image impedances of the half section are dissimilar on the input and output ports but are equal to the mid-series \`ZiT\` on the side presenting the series element and the mid-shunt \`ZiŒ†\` on the side presenting the shunt element. A mid-series derived section (that is, a series m-type filter) has precisely the same image impedance, \`ZiT\`, as a k-type mid- series \\"\`T\`\\" filter. However, the image impedance of a half-section of such a filter (on the shunt side) is not the same and is designated \`ZiŒ†m\`. Similarly, the series element side of a shunt m-derived filter half-section is designated \`ZiTm\`. Derivation Derivation of a mm'-type mid-shunt filter section. Starting from a prototype constant k filter T-filter, the circuit is transformed to a m-type mid-series derived filter, re-implemented as Œ†-section, transformed again to a mid-shunt derived mm'-type. The m-derived process starts with a k-type filter midsection and transforms it into a m-derived filter with a different transfer function but retaining the same image impedance and passband. Two different results are obtained depending on whether the process began with a T-section or a Œ†-section. From a T-section, the series Z and shunt Y are multiplied by an arbitrary parameter m . An additional impedance is then inserted in series with Y whose value is that which restores the original image impedance. The half-sections resulting from splitting the T-section, however, will show a different image impedance at the split, \`ZiŒ†m\`. Two such half-sections cascaded with the \`ZiT\` impedances facing, will form a \`Œ†\`-section with image impedance \`ZiŒ†m\`. The m-derived process can now be applied to this new section, but with a new parameter m'. The series Z and shunt Y are multiplied by m' and an additional admittance is inserted in parallel with the series elements to bring the image impedance back to its original value of \`ZiŒ†m\`. Again, the half sections will have a different image impedance at the split ports and this is designated \`ZiTmm'\`. The dual realisation of this filter is obtained in a completely analogous way by first transforming a mid-shunt k-type Œ†-section, forming the resulting mid- series m-type T-section and then transforming using m', resulting in a new Œ† flavour of \`Zimm'\`, \`ZiŒ†mm'\`, which is the dual of \`ZiTmm'\`. The m-derivation transformation can, in principle, be applied ad-infinitum and produce mm'm-types etc. There is, however, no practical benefit in doing this. The improvements obtained diminish at each iteration and are not worth the increase in complexity. Note that applying the m-derived transformation twice to a T-section (or Œ†-section) will merely result in an m-type filter with a different value of m. The transformation must be applied alternately to T-sections and Œ†-sections for a completely new form of filter to be obtained. mm'-type low-pass filter series half section. Operating frequency For a low-pass prototype, the cut-off frequency is given by the same expression as for the m-type and the k-type; : \\\\omega_c=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{LC}}. The pole of attenuation occurs at; : \\\\omega_\\\\infin=\\\\frac{\\\\omega_c}{\\\\sqrt{1-(mm')^2}}. Image impedance :See also Image impedance#Derivation Image impedance plot of an optimised mm'-type shunt section (ZiTmm', in blue) compared with an m-derived prototype shunt image impedance (ZiTm, in red) for . A constant-k filter's image impedance is also shown (ZiT, in green). The following expressions for image impedances are all referenced to the low-pass prototype section. They are scaled to the nominal impedance R0 = 1 and the frequencies in those expressions are all scaled to the cut-off frequency œâc = 1. =\\"T\\" port image impedance= The image impedance looking into a \\"T\\" topology port of a shunt derived section is given by, : Z_{iT mm'}=\\\\frac{ \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\omega^2} \\\\left(1-(1-m^2)\\\\omega^2 \\\\right)}{1-\\\\left(\\\\omega/\\\\omega_\\\\infin\\\\right)^2} For comparison; : Z_{iT}=\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\omega^2} and Z_{iT m}=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\omega^2}}{1-\\\\left(\\\\omega/\\\\omega_\\\\infin\\\\right)^2} =\\"Œ†\\" port image impedance= The image impedance looking into a \\"Œ†\\" topology port of a series derived section is given by, : Z_{i\\\\Pi mm'}=\\\\frac{1-\\\\left(\\\\omega/\\\\omega_\\\\infin\\\\right)^2}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\omega^2}\\\\left(1-(1-m^2)\\\\omega^2 \\\\right)} For comparison; : Z_{i\\\\Pi}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\omega^2}} and Z_{i\\\\Pi m}=\\\\frac{1-\\\\left(\\\\omega/\\\\omega_\\\\infin\\\\right)^2}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\omega^2}}. =Optimisation= Note that \\\\omega_\\\\infin can be adjusted independently of m by adjusting m'. It is therefore possible to adjust the impedance characteristic and frequency response characteristic independently. However, for optimum impedance match it is necessary to adjust both parameters solely for maximally flat image resistance in the passband. The term resistance is used because the image impedance is purely real in the passband between cut- off frequencies and purely imaginary outside the passband. It is not possible to obtain an exact impedance match across the entire band. With two degrees of freedom it is only possible to match the impedance exactly at two spot frequencies. It has been determined empirically that a good match is made with the values; :m=0.7230\\\\, :m'=0.4134\\\\, This amounts to setting the match to be exact at frequencies 0.8062 and 0.9487 rad/s for the prototype filter and the impedance departs less than 2% from nominal from 0 to 0.96 rad/s, that is, nearly all of the passband. The transfer function of an mm'-type is the same as an m-type with m set to the product mm' and in this case mm'=0.3. Where an m-type section is used for impedance matching the optimum value of m is m=0.6. Steepness of cut-off increases with decreasing m so an mm'-type section has this as an incidental advantage over an m-type in this application. Transmission parameters thumbright300pxmm'-type low-pass filter transfer function for a single half-section with various values of mm' \\\\gamma = \\\\alpha + i \\\\beta\\\\, :See also Image impedance#Transfer function The operating frequencies, transmission parameters and transfer function are identical to those for the m-type and details can be found in that article if the parameter m is replaced by the product mm'. Only the image impedance is different in the mm'-type filter in terms of black box behaviour. Prototype transformations The plots shown of image impedance and attenuation are the plots of a low-pass prototype filter section. The prototype has a cut-off frequency of œâc=1 rad/s and a nominal impedance R0=1Œ©. This is produced by a filter half-section where L=1 henry and C=1 farad. This prototype can be impedance scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values. The low-pass prototype can also be transformed into high-pass, band-pass or band-stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations. Cascading sections As with all image filters, it is required to match each section into a section of identical image impedance if the theoretical filter response is to be achieved. This is a particular difficulty for the end sections of the filter which are often working into resistive terminations which cannot be matched exactly by an image impedance. Hence the use of the mm'-type as end sections for the filter because of its nearly flat impedance with frequency characteristic in the passband. However, it is not desirable to use it throughout the entire filter. The workhorse of image filters are the k-type sections and these will usually be required somewhere in the filter for good rejection in the stopband well away from cut-off and also because they are the simplest topology and lowest component count. Unfortunately, neither side of a mm'-type can match into a k-type. The solution is to form a composite section from a mm'-type half-section and a m-type section which will match each other on one side if m has the same value for both half-sections. This can, for instance, produce a composite T-section with \`ZiTmm'\` facing the termination and \`ZiT\` facing the rest of the filter. The T-section will be matched internally with \`ZiTm\`. This has the additional incidental advantage of producing two poles of attenuation in the stopband at different frequencies. This is a consequence of m and mm' necessarily being different values.

From 1919 through 1924 the gang robbed dozens of banks, claiming a total of eighty-seven banks (unconfirmed) and six trains (confirmed). According to Willis Newton, the brothers \\"took in more money than the Dalton Gang, Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch and the James-Younger Gang combined.\\" According to their own claims, they never killed anyone. It is true that they were never charged with any death or injuries associated with their robberies, although one daylight robbery in Toronto, Ontario, Canada proved nearly fatal for one bank messenger. For the 1924 train robbery near Rondout, Illinois (the world's largest at the time) the brothers gained a second round of fame in their retirement, long after they had given up their criminal careers. In 1975, they participated in a documentary film, and then a more in-depth oral history project, that was eventually published in book form, possibly producing one of the clearest records of the career of criminal gang of the period, as told by multiple participants. This second round of fame led to a feature film being produced by a major Hollywood studio, after the death of the last surviving brother. Formation and outlaw career The Newton brothers came of age in Uvalde County, Texas. The four sons of a large cotton farming family were sharecroppers on the newly settled great plains. Raised on outlaw stories by their mother, leader and mastermind Willis Newton entered the workforce at an early age. He followed the contemporary exploits of outlaw Harry Tracy in the purple press of the time, as a newsboy. He says he cried when he heard the news of Tracy's suicide in Oct 1902. Willis quit school after a single year of attending classes, too proud to continue when his pants had to be patched in the seat. It's unclear when the brothers first ran afoul of the law but sharecropping didn't seem to suit their fierce pride. Willis Newton claims that at age twenty he was convicted for a crime he didn't commit - his brother Wylie \\"Dock,\\" or \\"Doc\\" Newton (b. 1891) (Prison #639) stole loose cotton from the loading dock of one processing gin and tried to sell it at another. Unable to find Dock, local authorities arrested J. Willis Newton (born January 19, 1889) and charged him instead. A local jury reportedly convicted Willis on slim evidence and he was sentenced to a year in the brutal Texas State Prison system, where he was forced to pick more cotton. His attitude hardened quickly in the face of the inhuman conditions and his perception of the injustice of it all. Dock soon joined him, entering the prison system soon after, possibly for robbing a Post Office of stamps. (The record indicates simply it was for a theft of less than fifty dollars.) From 1909 until 1918-1920 the two brothers were in and out of the Texas penal system due to their many escape attempts, which led to further sentences and a deeper hardening of attitudes. Eventually released, Willis began a career of petty theft, usually involving the night time theft of clothing from general stores. Brothers Jess (older) and Joe (much younger) stayed out of the penal system until later, working regularly as bronc busters and ranch hands. In 1914 Willis Newton began a more serious criminal career. He and an accomplice robbed a Southern Pacific Railroad passenger train in Cline, Texas, eighteen miles west of Uvalde in southwestern Uvalde County, taking $4,700 () at gunpoint from passengers. Then in 1916 Willis robbed a bank in Boswell, Oklahoma in the company of a gang he joined in Durant, Oklahoma, taking just over $10,000 () and escaping on horseback. In 1917, he went back to prison {Prison #83732} for burglary but eventually forged letters to secure a pardon. Upon release Willis served an apprenticeship of sorts with a crew of bank burglars with a rotating lineup due to accidental death and reckless behavior. Pride and intelligence led Willis to decide to form his own crew and eschew the wilder elements of his previous partners in crime. Joining forces with an experienced safecracker seems to have been a turning point. In 1920, operating out of Tulsa, Oklahoma, Willis Newton formed what others eventually called \\"the Newton Boys,\\" along with Brentwood \\"Brent\\" Glasscock, a safecracker and expert in high explosives, convincing his cowboy brothers Joe and later Jess to join his outfit. Dock's successful 1920 escape from prison in Texas (his fifth) enabled him to join his brothers soon after, and with this quintet as a nucleus, the crew had a good run, robbing banks across Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Colorado, North Dakota, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Canada. Other suspected robberies in Oregon and Washington state have not been confirmed as being their work. Most of their heists were committed at night, with them breaking in and busting the bank safe without ever having to come into contact with any people or authorities. Through bribing a corrupt insurance official with the Texas Association of Bankers, Willis obtained a list of banks that still possessed older models of safes that were vulnerable to their brand of attack, which involved forcing nitroglycerin into the cracks in the square door and setting the explosive off with dynamite caps. The resulting explosions were messy and loud but the gang liked to operate in the dead of winter in small farm towns where two men armed with shotguns could keep the few townspeople at bay while the money was hustled out to waiting cars - Studebaker and Cadillac being the preferred makes. Prior to entering the bank, Willis usually shinnied up a pole outside the telephone office and cut the phone lines at a strategic point, thereby insuring a clean getaway once the county line had been reached. In Hondo, Texas, the gang hit two banks the same night after discovering the first vault door open. Occasionally the tactics would change, and the crew planned daytime robberies, like in New Braunfels, Texas, a simple bank hold-up on March 9, 1922, or the daring and overly ambitious multiple attack on pedestrian bank messengers in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on July 24, 1923, when the Toronto Currency Clearinghouse was hit in downtown morning rush hour. A melee ensued when the bank messengers refused to surrender their bags at gunpoint, and the Newtons' reluctance to actually carry out the threats to shoot collided. Gunfire was exchanged eventually, and two messengers were wounded by Willis in the struggle and subsequent getaway. Two bags netted the gang some C$84,000 Canadian dollars, but spoiled their reputed non-violent record. In other robberies the patrons and bank employees often described them as being extremely polite, going out of their way to make sure everyone was comfortable, etc. The take from most bank jobs was not large, often less than $10,000 in combined cash and negotiable bonds. Liberty Bonds and Victory Bonds often formed the bulk of the take, stolen from individual deposit boxes. Various bonds and other securities were fenced through underworld connections in Chicago, where Willis and Glasscock cultivated contacts. Methodical to the last, Willis insisted on carrying out even the coins from the banks. \\"We never get enough. When I go in to get anything, I want a get it all,\\" he liked to brag. Ambitious, Willis invested a great deal of his money into oil wells in Smackover, Arkansas, and Mineral Wells, Texas, hoping to make it big during the boom times for the industry, when millionaires were being made overnight. Dock and Jess enjoyed the good life, visiting the Kentucky Derby and the Indianapolis 500 several times, and enjoying the night life in Kansas City, Chicago and the like between jobs, eating in the finest restaurants and staying in the nicest hotels, thereby avoiding suspicion. Willis persuaded Joe to invest with him in various oil wells, all of which failed to produce. Born into poverty, the brothers did not save much. Joe joked, \\"Why didn't you invest that money in something that makes it grow? Why, I said, who wants a better job what we already got? That's what we thought then. I need any money, go out and rob another bank.\\" Interstate crime was difficult to police in those years. Anonymous and fast moving, the Newton Gang received very little attention from law enforcement, despite the large number of robberies they'd committed. However, that would change when they robbed their sixth train, Milwaukee Road's Fast Mail, a postal train on June 12, 1924. The gang had teamed up with two Chicago gangsters, two racketeers, and a corrupt postal inspector named William J. Fahy and, using inside information to rob a postal train originating in Chicago, headed north and west and carrying large amounts of currency from the Federal Reserve commissioned for banks along the route. Boarding the train secretly in Chicago, Willis and Jess climbed into the engine and stopped the train at a remote crossing in Rondout, Illinois. The robbery netted them more than $3 million in one take. It was the largest train robbery in history. However, during the robbery, the engineer had overshot the crossing in his nervousness, and had to back the train up, causing some of the robbers to move out of position. In the confusion, Wylie \\"Dock\\" Newton was wounded five times with a .45 caliber pistol fired by Brent Glasscock, who mistook him for an armed postal worker in the dark. The gang took the money, loaded Dock into a vehicle, and left the scene. While loading into the vehicle, a bystander supposedly heard one of the robbers say the name \\"Willie\\", which was later testified to at trial. Dock and Joe were arrested first, in a Chicago tenement after police were tipped about an underworld doctor's visit to aid the wounded man. Willis was arrested when he returned to the room the next day but very nearly bribed his way out, offering $20,000 cash to the arresting officers, who wanted to take it but were double-crossed by a supervisor after the money changed hands. With Dock, Willis, and Joe Newton captured, Glasscock hid the bulk of the money and Jess Newton evaded capture and headed south to Texas with $35,000. Eventually all those involved with the robbery were arrested, and papers reported that all but $100,000 was recovered. Facing stiff sentences, the gang members agreed to testify against Fahey and the racketeers, and the prosecution played up the affair as a success for the law, having made an example of the crooked postal inspector and his mob connections. The exact amount stolen and recovered was impossible to determine, as some insurance claims were not filed, and various deals were cut behind closed doors. Glasscock very likely kept a low to mid six-figure sum of loose diamonds, untraceable bonds, etc., having eluded the law for the longest period. Having pleaded guilty, and supplied key testimony in convicting others (Glasscock took the witness stand in place of Willis, partially as repayment for his accidental shooting of Dock) the gang received relatively light sentences due to no one being injured but their own gang member, and the majority of the money having been returned. Chicago newspapers portrayed the \\"Newton Boys\\" as colorful cowboys due to the fact that Jess was brought to Chicago wearing rodeo clothes, having been tricked across the border into Del Rio, Texas, on a barroom bet involving a bronc ride at an independence day rodeo. The arresting officer was Texas Ranger Harrison Hamer, a brother of Frank Hamer.Hamer, Bud, Bobbie and Harrison (interviewed by Robert Nieman) (2006). Oral History Interview with Texas Ranger Descendants. Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum The admitted missing sum of $100,000 was never recovered. Jess Newton had buried some of it northwest of San Antonio, but being drunk when he did so, he could never remember exactly where. Jess and Joe, lacking criminal records, received the lightest sentences, and these two brothers returned to Uvalde, Texas, where they led respectable lives, for the most part. Willis and Dock spent years in Leavenworth, and on release Willis returned to Tulsa where he ran a series of gas stations and nightclubs and seems to have maintained criminal connections. He rarely spoke about these years in much detail, but he was involved in local \\"nightclub wars\\" and was the victim of an assassination attempt at one point, being shot through his bathroom window while shaving. He survived and prominent episodes of nightclub arson were reported in the same time period. After the April 6, 1934 murder of Constable Cal Campbell\\"Constable Cal Campbell.\\" The Officer Down Memorial Page by Clyde Barrow and Henry Methvin in Commerce, Oklahoma, Joe and Willis Newton allowed the Barrow Gang to hide out in a house they owned in Tulsa.Guinn, Jeff (2009).

The famous fan letter to Henry Fordsnopes.com: Clyde Barrow's Letter to Henry Ford snopes.com purportedly from Clyde Barrow was mailed from Tulsa on April 10, 1934; it may have been written at the Newton house.Guinn p. 298. Willis Newton's personal opinion of Bonnie and Clyde was quite low. He called them \\"silly kids\\" who only robbed filling stations and indiscriminately killed people. In 1934, both Willis and Joe were sentenced to nearly ten-year sentences in Oklahoma for a bank robbery they did not commit, based on specious testimony. They served at least seven years each. Joe returned to Uvalde, having already renounced crime, in 1924. Willis returned to Tulsa and the night club life but in the early 1950s also moved back to Uvalde, where he managed to stay out of prison and the limelight for the most part. Dock Newton was again arrested for bank robbery in 1968, in Rowena, Texas, but due to his old age the charges were dropped. Willis Newton was implicated in another bank robbery in 1973, in the town of Brackettville, Texas, but there was insufficient evidence to arrest him. Death of Newtons Jess Newton died on March 4, 1960, having lived out the remainder of his life as a cowboy in Uvalde. A veteran of the Texas Brigade of World War One, he died in a VA hospital. He never was able to remember where the buried money was, and often complained about the country being taken off the gold standard since he apparently lost a great deal of money when stolen bonds were left unredeemed. Dock was hospitalized after a rough beating during his last arrest, and never fully recovered, although he lived until 1974, dying at the age of 83. Willis lived to age 90, fierce and unrepentant to the end. He died of old age on August 22, 1979. Willis lived in the town of Uvalde, owner of a cafe and other small businesses, an avid horseman into his 80s. Youngest brother Joe Newton died at age 88 on February 3, 1989. In media Dock's 1968 arrest for bank robbery at age 77 made national news and was later the subject of an article in LIFE on April 19, 1968. Authors David Middleton and Claude I. Stanush edited the oral history book The Newton Boys; Portrait of an Outlaw Gang, with the participation of Willis and Joe Newton. Extensive audio interviews recorded in 1976 formed the basis of the text. The pair had produced a short documentary film the previous year and wanted to expand on the project. In November 1980, seventy-nine year old Joe Newton appeared on The Tonight Show and was interviewed by Johnny Carson. The 1998 film The Newton Boys, starring Matthew McConaughey, Skeet Ulrich, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Dwight Yoakam was based on the gang.

A hit outside the circles but still on the target (except on the haunch) counted for 1 point. The target made 10 runs for each shooter both in the Single- and Double-Shot event, and in the Team event each team consisted of four shooters. Thus the individual double-shot event a maximum of 80 points per shooter, the Individual Single-Shot event had a maximum 40 points per shooter, and the Team Single-Shot event had a maximum of (4¬∑40 =) 160 points per team. In the 1912 event the target had been changed to have 5 scoring areas, with 5 point for inner scoring area. The target distance was now specified as 100 meters. Each shooter still got 10 runs, and thus the maximum possible points thus became maximum 100 points for Individual Double- Shot, 50 for Individual Single-Shot and 200 for Team Single-Shot respectively. 20 shooters from 6 nations competed in the Individual Double-Shot event, 20 shooters from 5 nations competed in the Team Single-Shot event, and 34 sport shooters from 7 nations competed in the Team Single-Shot event. In 1920 the events were held on 27 July. 8 shooters from 3 nations competed in the Individual Double-Shot event, while 12 shooters from 4 nations competed in the Individual Single-Shot event. This championship saw the introduction of the Team Double-Shot event, now in addition to the Team Single-Shot event. 20 shooters from four nations competed in both these events. In 1924 the events were held from 30 June to 3 July at the shooting range in Le Stand de Tir de Versailles in Versailles, France. The number, types and format of the events was similar as in the 1920 Olympics. First out was the Individual Single-Shot event in 30 June where 32 shooters from 8 nations competed. The day after on 1 July the Individual Double-Shot event was held, with 31 shooters from 8 nations. The last two days consisted of the Team events. Team Single-Shot was held on 2 July with 25 shooters from 7 nations. Notably, Czechoslovakia was allowed to compete with an incomplete team; only one shooter participated. Lastly the Team Double-Shot event was held on 3 July, with 25 shooters from 7 nations. Notably Hungary was allowed to compete with an incomplete team; only one shooter participated. Running deer events would not be held again at the Olympics until 1952, meaning that the event was not included in the 1928, 1932, 1936 and 1948 Summer Olympics. 1924 would also be the last time of format with separate Single- and Double-Shot events, as well as any Team events. In the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, running deer was again on the olympic program, but this time in the new format of the Individual Combined Single- and Double-Shot event only. The competition was held on 28 and 29 July, and 14 shooters from 7 nations competed. The winner, John Larsen from Norway, scored 413 points. In the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia was again arranged in the format of an Individual Combined Single- and Double-Shot event on 3 and 4 December. 11 shooters from 6 nations competed. The winner, Vitali Romanenko from Ukrainia and competing for the Soviet Union, scored 441 points. This was the last time running deer was arranged as a part of the Olympics.

Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland). Retrieved 16 September 2011. is a large, ruined monastic site 0.75 miles (1.2 km) north-west of Downpatrick, County Down, Northern Ireland, on the north bank of the River Quoile in a hollow between two drumlins and featuring early Gothic architecture. The site is mostly in State Care and is at grid ref: J477455, off the main road to Belfast. Pre-Norman site The site was originally on an island () in the Quoile Marshes. The pre-Norman Celtic monastic settlement here, known as Inis Cumhscraigh (or Inis Cuscraidh), was in existence by the year 800. In 1002 it was plundered by the Vikings led by Sitric, King of the Danes, who came up the Quoile with a fleet from the sea. The Vikings plundered the settlement again in 1149. Its large earthwork enclosure has been traced from aerial photographs. On the ground, the early bank and ditch can be followed along the line of trees on the eastern boundary of the site, and partly along the western boundary. The buildings of the early monastery would have been made of timber. Norman Establishment Inch Abbey was established as a Cistercian house by John de Courcy and his wife Affreca. Inch, or Iniscourcy, was erected as an act of repentance for the destruction of the Abbey at Erinagh (or Erenagh) (3 miles (4.8 km) to the south) by de Courcy in 1177. It was colonised directly by monks from Furness Abbey in Lancashire in 1180, along with some of the monks from Erinagh. The Cistercian monastery was located near to the river in the southern area of the Early Christian earthwork enclosure. Features The Cistercian precinct was enclosed by a bank and ditch extending north and south from the parish graveyard to the river and east to west up the valley sides. The buildings are mainly of the late 12th century and the 13th century. The church (length 170 ft) was built about 1200, in the Cistercian cruciform plan with a low tower at the crossing, an aisled nave to the west and two projecting transepts (each square) each with a pair of chapels. Only the impressive east window remains. The chancel wall has three, well-proportioned, pointed windows, the middle one being high. The chancel was by 27 ft. There was an altar in each of the rib- vaulted transept chapels and in the north transept is a door out to the monk's cemetery (no longer visible) and a tower with broken stairs in the north-west angle. On the stone plinth of the north transept's exterior north wall a number of incised symbols can be seen which are mason's marks. The high altar was under the east windows and in the south wall are the remains of a triple sedilia (seats for the priests) and a piscina for washing the altar vessels. Piscina in the South wall of the chancel at Inch Abbey, Downpatrick The church is north of the cloister, divided in use between the monks to the east and lay brothers to the west. The cloister was surrounded by a series of rooms for meetings, work, sleeping, eating and storage. The foundations of the refectory and kitchen are along the south side of the cloister. A small excavation in 1993 failed to uncover the foundations of any stone buildings on the west side of the cloister. Later alteration The community of monks was probably never very large (suggested by the small chapter house), and this may have led to the decision to reduce the size of the church by walling off a smaller area to the east end. Some continuity was maintained with the 13th century work by reusing a fine door of that period as the west door of the reduced church. In the 15th century, when the monastic community was smaller, the church was altered. Through the walling in of the chancel and first bay of the nave, and blocking off the transepts, a much smaller church was created and the rest was abandoned. The cloister walks to the south have disappeared, but foundations of the east and south ranges remain, as well as outlying buildings toward the river. These include an infirmary and a bakehouse with two ovens and a well nearby. Much of the detail in the chancel is made up with cement over decayed sandstone, the result of restoration carried out in the 19th century. Post- Norman site and Dissolution Plaque at Inch Abbey Judged by medieval standards the abbey was wealthy. In 1291 its temporalities were valued for taxation at ¬£10 19s 4d. In 1380 Parliament tried to help waning English influence by restricting the membership of the Order at Inch to English or Anglicised Irish. Twenty-four years later, the abbey was burned and that, perhaps together with the collapse of a central tower and a dwindling community, gave the impetus to alter the size of the church. Monastic life continued, most likely on a small scale, until the 16th century, but the Abbey had been dissolved by 1541, when the abbey with about of land was granted to Gerald, Earl of Kildare, along with other monasteries. Excavations Sherds of medieval pottery were found in a field north of the Abbey graveyard. In 1983 conservation/preservation excavations were carried out on the Abbey nave by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland. One Romanesque carved stone of 12th century date was found at the site and could suggest that there had been a previous stone church on the site which could have been re- used.  Railway Station  Inch Abbey has its own railway station, which opened in 2005. Located 200m from the Abbey itself, Inch Abbey station is the terminus of the Downpatrick and County Down Railway's North Line. The station is open on St. Patrick's Day, Easter, bank holidays and Summer weekends for heritage steam or diesel services to Downpatrick town.

Access to the station was via a stairway which led down from the road bridge on Station Road.Ashby Magna today. History Opened by the Great Central Railway, it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. It was then closed by the British Railways Board. The site today The station closed along with the railway line in 1969, and today little remains of it. The construction of the M1 motorway (which occurred whilst the line was still open) to the east of the station resulted in the demolition of the stationmaster's house and the loss of the goods yard.

PUCH was established in 1968 by the mergers the Popular Entente Party (founded in 1959) and the Party of Union of Haitian Democrats (founded in 1954 and was until 1965 called the People's Party of National Liberation). The declaration of merger of the two parties stated: \\"PUCH is the conscious and organized vanguard of the working class, fighting under the banner of the Marxist- Leninist ideology. The path of the Haitian revolution, as defined in the documents of PUCH - is the path of armed struggle, which must be carried out in response to the reactionary violence\\".

Opposing the Vietnam war based on the theory of Just War, he objected to being conscripted, but as the law only allowed for conscientious objection to all wars, he was convicted of avoiding conscription and given a suspended sentence of five years. He was later pardoned by President Gerald Ford.  Early life  Born in the Bronx, Spiro attended Xavier High School in Manhattan. He attended the University of Chicago and later received bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from Fairleigh Dickinson University. While at the University of Chicago, his studies in economics and politics led him to become suspicious of government in all its forms. He joined the Student Peace Union and studied Catholic peace traditions, eventually becoming active in the Catholic Worker movement. He later described himself as a \\"Biblical anarchist and a radical pacifist.\\"  Opposition to war  Spiro opposed the Vietnam War as not conforming to the Catholic theory of just war. As the conscription laws in the United States allowed for conscientious objection only on the grounds of opposition to all war, Spiro was labeled a \\"selective conscientious objector\\" and was convicted of avoiding the draft.United States v. Spiro, 384 F.2d 159 (3d Cir. 1967)Hugh C. Macgill, Selective Conscientious Objection: Divine Will and Legislative Grace, Virginia Law Review 1355 (1968). His case was championed by the newly formed Catholic Peace Fellowship; Daniel Berrigan, Tom Cornell, and Thomas Merton all lobbied on his behalf. The sincerity of his beliefs were recognized, as he received a five-year suspended sentence for his actions, and he was later pardoned by President Gerald Ford. He was \\"more proud of the conviction than the pardon\\" and throughout his life he referred to himself as a \\"political criminal.\\" Spiro also opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In the last years of his life, he was the President of the New Jersey Catholic Peace Fellowship and he often engaged in counter-recruitment, setting up information tables in front of military recruiting offices in New Jersey.  Pro-life movement  Spiro was active in the Right to Life movement. He regularly attended the March for Life and met with legislators. He advocated a consistent life ethic, also known as the seamless garment argument. This argument states that the right to life leads to opposition to abortion, capital punishment and war as a single consistent moral position. He would often bring anti-war signs to pro-life rallies (and vice versa), sparking arguments with his fellow protesters.

The members in a winemaking cooperative are usually vineyard owners, who deliver grapes to the cooperative, which is involved in production of wine from the grapes and the subsequent marketing activities. Winemaking cooperatives are responsible for a significant proportion of the total wine production in many major wine-producing countries, including most of the classical European wine countries, but their importance varies much between different wine regions within these countries. Cooperatives tend to be more important in regions where the wine‚Äôs selling price is relatively low and average size of vineyard holdings is small. While some winemaking cooperatives were established in the 19th century, the majority were established in the early 1930s following the Great Depression.  Advantages to members  The advantage to members of a cooperative, in comparison to pursuing winemaking and marketing on their own, consists in pooling resources and sharing costs for winemaking and marketing, which call for costly equipment and technical expertise. There are also other financial advantages, including certain European Union subsidies for cooperatives located in EU countries. Wines from cooperatives are often allowed to be described as producer-bottled according to the wine laws of the country in question, which is sometimes an advantage in marketing. The French term corresponding to this is mis(e) en bouteille √† la propri√©t√©, while the German is Erzeugerabf√ºllung.  Alternatives available to wine-growers  Producing and marketing the wine on his or her own is usually not a realistic possibility for many vineyard owners with small holdings. However, being a member of a winemaking cooperative is not the only option available. Selling grapes on the open market, entering into long-term contracts with negociants or other winemaking companies and leasing out the vineyard to certain negociants are other options. The relative attractiveness of these options varies greatly between regions. As an example, in regions characterised by constant overproduction of wine, the market price of grapes is often depressed to a very low level, while grapes in Champagne command much higher prices as long as they fulfill some basic criteria.  France  The winemaking cooperative in Maraussan in the Languedoc region is one of France's oldest. In France, winemaking cooperatives are typically called caves coop√©ratives, and produce more than half the total amount of French wine. The first winemaking cooperative was established in Alsace in 1895,World Atlas of Wine, 2001 Edition, p. 126 although at this time Alsace was part of the German Empire rather than France. Members of French winemaking cooperatives own more than half the total French vineyard surface. The caves have their greatest strength on the Vin de pays level, where they are responsible for about three-quarter of the production. They have been involved in the large-scale switch over of the French wine production from the lower Vin de table category to Vin de pays. Many cooperatives also produce an impressive range of Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) wine. The total number of French winemaking cooperatives was over 850 in the early 2000s, with an average membership of 160 per cooperative in the 1990s. Cooperatives are particularly strong in Languedoc, Roussillon, Rh√¥ne, Provence and Corsica. Some of the more notable cooperatives are also found in Alsace and Chablis.  Germany  In Germany, a winemaking cooperative is often called Winzergenossenschaft, but can also be called Winzerverein, Winzervereinigung, Weing√§rtnergenossenschaft or Weinbauerverband. The earliest German winemaking cooperatives date back to the time before the later association laws were established. A union of winemakers in Neckarsulm in W√ºrttemberg pressed grapes and sold the resulting must, and to some extent also wine, cooperatively as early as 1834. Prussia passed an association law (Genossenschaftsgesetz) in 1867, which became law in the entire North German Confederation in 1868. One of the first winemaking cooperatives founded on the basis of this legislation, Winzerverein Mayscho√ü, was established in 1868 in the Ahr region and is the oldest German winemaking cooperative still in existence.Association of German winemaking cooperatives: Historical overview, accessed on July 2, 2008 Two thirds of all German vine- growers belong to a cooperative, but because of a dominance of small vineyard holdings and part-time vine growing among these members, their production is slightly less than one-third of the German total.Weinerzeugung insgesamt und genossenschaftlicher Anteil, accessed 2011-01-23 In 2008/2009, there were 209 cooperatives in Germany with a total of 51 000 members and vineyard surface.Entwicklung der Winzergenossenschaften, accessed 2011-01-23 There has been a trend to fewer cooperatives (275 existed in 1998/1999) due to fusions. A special form of winemaking cooperative is the Zentralkellereien, a centralized cooperative found in many German wine regions, where local cooperatives rather than individual growers deliver grapes, grape must or wine. Therefore, of the 209 cooperatives existing in Germany in 2008/2009, only 120 actually produced wine on their own premises. Cooperatives are particularly important in W√ºrttemberg, where they account for 80% of the production (2008), Baden, where they account for 76%, and the smallest German wine regions Ahr, Hessische Bergstrasse, Saale-Unstrut and Saxony.  Southern Europe  In southern Europe, cooperatives are responsible for a large part of the wine production. Figures of around 60 percent have been quoted for Italy‚Äôs cantina sociale and cooperatives in Spain and Portugal. However, in contrast to the situation in France and Germany, a large proportion of the cooperatives‚Äô wine is not bottled by the cooperative, but instead is sold in bulk for bottling by commercial operators or, especially in the case of Spain, for distillation.  Other countries  In South Africa, KWV (Ko√∂peratieve Wijnbouwers Vereniging van Zuid-Afrika) was originally formed as a winemaking cooperative which also had certain regulatory privileges akin to those of a government agency. However, in 2002, KWV was transformed into a regular commercial company.

It reaches an elevation of above sea level. The summit is topped by an abandoned fire tower that gives stunning views of other nearby peaks. Smoky Mountain News Mount Sterling crowns Mount Sterling Ridge, a ridge that gradually descends northward from the flanks of Big Cataloochee Mountain (on the Balsam Mountain crest) to the Pigeon River Valley. The ridge divides the Cataloochee area to the east from the Big Creek Valley (which represents the fringe of the Cosby area) to the west. The community of Waterville, North Carolina is located in the Pigeon Valley at the ridge's northern extreme. Geologically, Mount Sterling consists mainly of Precambrian metamorphic sandstone of the Ocoee Supergroup, formed nearly a billion years ago from ancient ocean sediments.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 32. The summit of Mount Sterling is surrounded by a stand of Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest. History Mount Sterling, viewed from Mount Cammerer According to early residents in the Mount Sterling area, the mountain was named after a wide streak of lead in the bed of the Pigeon River at the mountain's northern base. These early residents mistakenly thought the lead was silver.Rolfe Godshalk (ed.), \\"Mount Sterling.\\" Newport (Newport, Tenn.: Clifton Club, 1970), 64. The Big Creek campground, at the northern base of Mount Sterling Ridge, occupies what was once the community of Mount Sterling, North Carolina. Mount Sterling, North Carolina Fall Foliage During the U.S. Civil War, Cataloochee and the remote valleys at the base of Mount Sterling became popular hideouts for deserters, and both Union and Confederate detachments consistently made raids into the area to find them. Raiders and bushwhackers navigated through the area by following a trail that connected Cosby and Cataloochee via Mount Sterling. One local legend relates an incident in which Confederate Captain Albert Teague swept through Cataloochee and arrested three alleged Union sympathizers. Teague marched them up to Mount Sterling where he ordered one of the detainees-- a well-known local fiddle player named Henry Grooms-- to play a tune on his fiddle. Grooms chose the somber \\"Bonaparte's Retreat.\\" When he finished, Teague executed all three detainees.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg, Tenn.: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 159-162. Around 1903, the Cataloochee Lumber Company established the village of Crestmont at the northwest base of Mount Sterling to house a labor force needed to log the Big Creek Valley and operate a timber mill. Crestmont thrived until 1907, when the company commenced logging operations in the area. In the late 1920s, the Carolina Power and Light Company established the community of Waterville at the mountain's northern base, near the confluence of Big Creek and the Pigeon River. Waterville provided the labor force needed to operate the company's Walters Plant, which housed the powerhouse for the Waterville Lake reservoir further upstream. While vestiges of Waterville survived, Crestmont was absorbed into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the 1930s, and converted into what is now the Big Creek Campground.Godshalk, 64-66. The balsam wooly adelgid infestation-- which killed off most of the park's fraser firs-- was first noticed in the Smokies atop Mount Sterling in 1963.Carson Brewer, Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Portland, Ore: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), 114. Access Mount Sterling, North Carolina Fall FoliageA long gravel road connects the Big Creek ranger station (near Waterville) with the Cataloochee Campground. The trailhead for the Mount Sterling Trail is located near this road's halfway point at Mount Sterling Gap. The trail ascends to the summit. The Mount Sterling Ridge Trail traverses the ridge's crest between Laurel Gap on Balsam Mountain and the summit of Mount Sterling. The Baxter Creek Trail connects the summit to the Big Creek Campground to the north. These two trails both provide segments of the cross- country Benton MacKaye Trail. The Pretty Hollow Gap Trail connects Mount Sterling with Cataloochee to the east, and the Swallow Fork Trail connects the mountain with Walnut Bottom in the Big Creek Valley to the west.

The plan included a three-power directorate, consisting of France, Britain and the United States. The idea was to form a new 'Union of States', an intergovernmental alternative to the European Communities that had been created a few years prior. De Gaulle feared a loss of French national influence in the Communities, which were becoming increasingly supranational so the plan was an attempt to keep the balance of power in France's favor. The success of the European Communities and the lack of enthusiasm of other states for the idea stopped the implementation of the Fouchet Plan. Planned organisation First draft The first draft of The Fouchet Plan was proposed in 1961. The plan called for a \\"Union of the European peoples\\" \\"without supranational institutions.\\" Moravcsik, Andrew, The choice for Europe: social purpose and state power from Messina to Maastricht, Cornell University Press, 1998. It is divided into five sections (\\"Titles I ‚Äì V\\"), summarized below. Title I outlines the \\"aims\\" of the Union. Title II describes the institutions, their composition, and their various powers and relationships to one another. Title III describes the \\"Obligations of Member States\\". Title IV describes the Finances of the Union, and Title V describes General provisions. =Title I ‚Äì Union of the European peoples= The plan set forth two major aims of the Union: a common foreign policy and a common defense policy. Other aims of the Union were the development of the \\"common heritage\\" of the Member States and \\"the protection of the values on which their civilization rests\\".The Fouchet Plan, first draft, available online at: http://www.cvce.eu/viewer/-/content/485fa02e-f21e-4e4d-9665-92f0820a0c22/en;jsessionid=441BD693160E8706492434D58977AEB5 =Title II ‚Äì Institutions= The plan proposed three institutions of the Union: a \\"Council\\", a \\"European Parliament\\", and a \\"European Political Commission.\\" The Council would deliberate on questions posed by Member States and adopt decisions unanimously. However, if one or two members are absent, it would \\"not prevent a decision from being taken.\\" The Council would meet twice every four months, once at the Head of State or Government level and once at the Foreign Minister level. De Gaulle proposed that the decisions of the council be binding on Member States, but did not propose a method of enforcement. Should a Member State abstain from the adoption of a decision, that decision would not be enforced on that state. However, these states would be able to opt in at any time. The parliament would deliberate \\"on matters concerning the aims of the Union\\", as outlined in Title I, Article II. It would submit recommendations and would address oral or written questions to the Council. The Council would be free to act independently of the parliament, but must reply to parliament recommendations within four months. The main role of the Political Commission of the Union would be to assist the Council by preparing its deliberations, carrying out its decisions, and performing the duties the Council entrusts to it. The Commission would consist of \\"senior officials of the Foreign Affairs departments of each Member State.\\" =Title III ‚Äì Obligations of Member States= Title III called for cooperation between the Member States, mandating that they work towards the aims of the Union. =Title IV ‚Äì Finances of the Union= The budget of the Union would be \\"drawn up by the Council each year\\", and would be funded by contributions from the Member States. Article 13 lays out the proportional contribution of each Member State at the time. =Title V ‚Äì General provisions= Title V lays out how amendments should be made to the Plan, how they would be ratified, provisions for admission of new Member states, and other standard details. Second draft A second draft of the Fouchet plan was proposed when it appeared that the first would prove unsuccessful. Some concessions would have to be made in terms of what de Gaulle wanted for the union, its structure, and the French role. Much like the original Fouchet plan, the second draft continued to push for intergovernmental structures. It highlighted the importance of the individual member states. The second draft aimed at common interests among certain states, rather than ensuring their close cooperation in predetermined fields. The second draft also called for a structural change through the addition of Committees of Ministers. Two committees are explicitly mentioned: a committee for foreign affairs and a committee for education. These two groups were to meet four times a year and would be under the supervision of the proposed council. The council would also be able to create new committees when they deemed it necessary. Lastly, although it is not emphasized, France's role was slightly diminished and the European Political Commission would no longer meet in Paris. Charles De Gaulle's role The driving political force behind the Fouchet Plan was French President Charles de Gaulle. Concerned about the growing supranational tendencies of the European Economic Community, he sought to implement a new intergovernmental vision of cooperation which would put decision-making power back into the hands of the nation-states. After convincing the other five heads of state to agree to regular meetings, de Gaulle pushed the idea of further political cooperation. Headed by the French ambassador to Denmark, Christian Fouchet, a committee assembled to discuss the French recommendations. All of the suggestions put forward increased the intergovernmental nature of the organization, but the first draft of the plan also included a provision for a common foreign policy. This last aspect is especially telling: while the rest of \\"The Six\\" valued their membership in NATO, de Gaulle made no effort to hide his hostility towards it and what he considered to be undue American influence in Europe. Reactions Konrad Adenauer In 1959, when de Gaulle began to focus his attention away from France and Algeria and more on Europe as a whole, he began to propose more regular meetings of the six member states. He also suggested that the meetings be backed by a secretariat. West Germany and Italy in particular looked favourably on these proposals. However, when de Gaulle first introduced the Fouchet Plan in 1961, it faced opposition from many of the member states. Adenauer and de Gaulle had a close relationship and during de Gaulle's term in office, Franco-German relations improved significantly. However Adenauer and his Dutch counterparts were worried that the Fouchet Plan would divert power from the EEC and NATO. West Germany was also opposed to de Gaulle's idea that the plans be ratified by popular referendum on the grounds that it was not constitutional. Despite Adenauer's friendship with de Gaulle, West Germany was never convinced that the Fouchet Plan was the best course of action. However, though the plan fell through, Adenauer and de Gaulle were able to establish the Treaty of Friendship in 1963 to strengthen ties between France and West Germany. This agreement would not only be beneficial to the French and West Germans, but also the entire EEC. Benelux Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, collectively known as Benelux, were against the Fouchet Plan. They were afraid that the proposal removed too much power from the Commission, the supranational governing body, and would rely heavily on intergovernmentalism. They worried that the Fouchet Plan would weaken the Treaty of Rome and would be a step away from integration. The downgrade in power would have afforded France more opportunity to influence the other nations. Benelux feared that this would allow de Gaulle and France to dominate the EEC and push issues important to their own national interests. A second main issue was the speed with which France was trying to force the plan through. The Benelux countries thought that a decision of this magnitude should be deferred until after Britain's accession talks, which started in 1961, were completed. De Gaulle had been speaking closely with German Chancellor Adenauer at this time and Benelux worried that the collaboration of the two countries would shift the power of an intergovernmental organization towards France and West Germany. British accession would have balanced the power structure within the EEC more equally and would not have allowed France to dominate the talks. The Netherlands in particular thought that the Fouchet Plan was an attempt to subvert the power of NATO. The Plan's common defense policy would have directly conflicted with NATO's mission and directives, so the Netherlands worried that the plan was an attempt to weaken NATO's influence and to reassert France as a military power.

Their indigenous language is also called Achi and is closely related to K'iche'. Conquest Dominican friars arrived in present Guatemala, with just one place in which to settle a mission: Tezulutl√°n or \\"Land of War\\". Friar Bartolom√© de las Casas was trusted with \\"reducing\\" the indigenous population via Christianisation. One of the first references to Cubulco can be found in the Royal Charter of don Francisco Izquin Nehabib, written in 1558. The Rabinal Ach√≠ was published in Paris in 1862. This document was found by Braseur de Bouburg. Experts have pointed out that the text resemble the military honour codes present in Homer's Iliad. Dutch anthropologist Ruud van Akkeren in an interview stated that the 16th century Achi people weren't today's Achi people, the same as with the Quiches; these peoples have a right to know their history. Economics Rabinal is famed for producing the country's sweetest oranges. San Jer√≥nimo is known for having the colony's best houses and wineyards, where the best wine was produced. This region \\"introduced\\" African peoples to work in the plantations. Besides cultivation of oranges, the main economical activities are mud, hay and Agave americana crafts. Rabinal (in Zamaned vale) was an important location in the trade route out of the region. Ceramics, textiles, oranges, etc. were commercialised. Culture Traditions Traditions are passed from generation to generation. Ceremonies are performed as part of brotherhoods, and the duty of brothers to maintain ongoing traditions. They perform several dances. Their deities include Ajaaw (the divine), uk'u'x kaaj and uk'u'x uleew, to which they ask for permission to perform the traditional dances. The rain, wind, clouds and corn are also considered sacred beings. The people also celebrate Easter week, Christmas and Christmas Eve. Achi religion is a syncretic version of a Christianism-animism complex. They possess saintly places such as Chipichek, Chusxan, B'ele tz'ak y Cuwajuexij. They follow the Tzolk'in calendar. Textiles Being an important part of Achi culture, weaving is done the same way as Ixchel, which is using a waist loom or sticks. In this way, bands, servilletes, and table cloths are produced. The fabric used is ‚Äúixkak‚Äù, which is cotton dyed in white and coffee colour. The cotton is obtained at the end of winter, and is called \\"mish\\". Food Main dishes include pinol and bochbol. The former is done with toasted corn, which is then powdered and mixed with turkey meat and spices. The latter is made with ayote leaves, corn dough, toasted ayote seeds and tomato; rolls are then cooked, and eaten hot. Pinol is a festive dish, while bochbol is an everyday food.

River Song was introduced to the series as an experienced future companion of series protagonist the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time in his TARDIS. Because River Song is a time traveller herself, her adventures with the Doctor occur out of synchronisation; their first meeting (from the audience's perspective) is his first and apparently her last. While other actresses briefly portray younger versions of the character, Kingston plays her in 15 episodes, as River becomes a companion, romantic interest and eventual wife of the Doctor in his eleventh incarnation portrayed by Matt Smith. River Song was created by Doctor Who writer Steven Moffat for the show's fourth series in 2008, under the tenure of then executive producer Russell T Davies. When Moffat took over Davies' duties as executive producer, he began expanding on the character's background, depicting adventures earlier in River's timeline, upgrading Alex Kingston from a guest star to a recurring actor in the series. Other actresses have subsequently portrayed younger versions of the character. When the character was first introduced, much about her origins remained a mystery. Following the character's initial appearance, Davies had described her as \\"one of the most important characters\\" in the narrative, and \\"vital\\" to the Doctor's life.Russell T Davies, Doctor Who Confidential, Series 4, Episode 9 In series six (2011), Moffat's episodes unveil more about the character. Born Melody Pond, River is the daughter of the Eleventh Doctor's companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), alongside whom Kingston had already appeared several times in series five and six of the show. Having been conceived on board the TARDIS as it travelled through the time vortex, Melody is born with genetic traits and abilities similar to those of the Doctor's own race, the Time Lords. Appearances Television Three of the six actresses to portray River Song at different stages in her story. From left to right: Sydney Wade, Nina Toussaint-White and Alex Kingston. River Song first appears in the Doctor Who 2008 series two-parter \\"Silence in the Library\\"/\\"Forest of the Dead\\" (written by Steven Moffat) during the Russell T Davies era of Doctor Who. Here, she encounters the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) in the 52nd century and, though he has never met her, claims to be someone he will come to trust completely. River, who is a professor of archaeology and carries a TARDIS-colour/pattern diary of her adventures, is able to convince the Doctor of his future trust in her by whispering his real name into his ear, which he explains he would only divulge under rare circumstances. At the end of the second episode, she sacrifices herself to save the people who were trapped in the Library's database, knocking out the Doctor before he can do the same. In turn, he is able to upload a copy of her consciousness into a computer, allowing her to live on in a virtual world with the archaeological team she was with in the Library. He achieves this via the use of a sonic screwdriver given to her by his future self. After Moffat took over from Davies as executive producer of the show, River Song reappeared in the 2010 series. In the two-parter \\"The Time of Angels\\"/\\"Flesh and Stone\\", which takes place prior to River becoming a professor, she encounters the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith), with whom she is more familiar. She leaves coordinates for the Doctor so that he may rescue her in the 52nd century, and together they investigate the crash of the spaceship Byzantium. She shows herself to be more adept at flying the TARDIS than he is and reveals to the Doctor that she is imprisoned in the \\"Stormcage Containment Facility\\" for killing \\"the best man I've ever known.\\" An earlier version of River appears to assist the Doctor in the series finale \\"The Pandorica Opens\\"/\\"The Big Bang\\". After being contacted by Winston Churchill (Ian McNeice), River leads the Doctor to 102 A.D. While River is travelling in the TARDIS on her own, it explodes with her inside. The Doctor, using River's vortex manipulator, teleports her out. After the Doctor erases himself from history by flying the Pandorica into the exploding TARDIS in order to close the cracks in the universe, River helps Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) to remember the Doctor and bring him back, by giving Amy her now-blank diary. At the close of the series finale, River ambiguously suggests to the Doctor that they might be married and tells him that he will soon learn the truth about her, after which \\"everything changes\\". In 2011 series opener \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\"/\\"Day of the Moon\\", River, along with Amy and her husband Rory (Arthur Darvill), is contacted by a future version of the Doctor to meet up in the United States. As they enjoy a lakeside picnic, the Doctor is killed by an assailant in a space suit, and the trio give him a Viking funeral, in Lake Silencio. In 1969, the present Doctor and company subsequently encounter a little girl (Sydney Wade) who wears the space suit, which River tells the Doctor is a life support unit; the suit has been designed by the hypnotic aliens known as the Silence. Homeless, the girl is later shown regenerating in New York City, 1970. In \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\", it is revealed that River is Amy and Rory's daughter Melody (Harrison and Maddison Mortimer), who was conceived in the TARDIS while it was in the Time Vortex and consequently carries Time Lord DNA. The name River Song comes from a recursive translation of Melody Pond via the language of the Gamma Forests, which have no ponds, only rivers, hence the translation of \\"Pond\\" to \\"River.\\" Baby Melody is kidnapped by Madame Kovarian (Frances Barber) to become a weapon against the Doctor. \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\" establishes that Melody was trained by the Silence to kill the Doctor. At some point after regenerating in New York, Melody becomes Rory and Amy's childhood friend Mels (Maya Glace-Green) and grew up with them, and enlightened them to their romantic feelings for each other and ensuring her own existence. When adult Mels (Nina Toussaint-White) is shot, and regenerates into her next incarnation (Alex Kingston), she proceeds to do what she was created for: assassinate the Doctor. Persuaded she will one day become River Song, who the Doctor cares deeply about and places in great trust, Melody chooses to resurrect the Doctor with her own regenerative energy, losing any future regenerations. The Doctor learns, however, that it is she who kills him in the future. While she is recovering in bed, the Doctor gives her the blank TARDIS-shaped/coloured diary, and in an epilogue it is revealed that Melody (now River) wants to study archaeology. At the end of \\"Closing Time\\", on the day she receives her doctorate, the Silence and Kovarian recapture her and trap her in the space suit in order to kill the Doctor as history will record. In the series finale \\"The Wedding of River Song\\", River refuses to kill the Doctor as she is supposed to, creating an alternate reality in which time has frozen and all realities are occurring at once. In order to restart time and repair reality, the two of them must touch. The Doctor marries River and convinces her to repair the timeline by letting her know that he plans to fake his own death and how. River goes to prison for his murder in order to corroborate the deception, though it is established that she regularly breaks out of prison to go on dates and adventures with him with the aid of hallucinogenic lipstick and other tricks. River appears again in the fifth episode of the seventh series, titled \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\" (2012), where she encounters the Doctor and her parents, Rory and Amy, in 1930s New York City. At this later point in her timeline, she is a professor of archaeology and a free woman, having been released from the Stormcage Prison after the Doctor erased all evidence of his existence. When her parents are sent permanently back in time by the Weeping Angels, to be forever parted from the Doctor, she arranges for Amy to leave the Doctor a message in the form of an epilogue in a book they have been reading written by her in the 1930s. Although she agrees to travel with the Doctor for the time being, she declines his offer of being a full-time companion. In \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" (2013), the deceased River's consciousness is summoned from the Library computer, where she has existed since \\"Forest of the Dead\\", into a psychic 'conference call' by the Doctor's friend Madame Vastra (Neve McIntosh). There, she and Clara (Jenna Coleman) learn that the Doctor's grave has been discovered. River maintains the psychic link with Clara after the call ends, and counsels her throughout the exploration of the Doctor's tomb, although she seems to be invisible to everyone else. When the Doctor and his companions are threatened by the Great Intelligence, she whispers the Doctor's name in order to open his tomb which is inside the TARDIS. After Clara enters the Doctor's time stream to save him from the Great Intelligence, who entered it first so he could destroy the Doctor in all his regenerations, the Doctor reveals that he could see River all along, but had been avoiding confronting her continued existence because it was too painful for him to bear. After he kisses her, River feels closure and fades away. However, before disappearing River points out that her continued presence indicates that Clara has not been destroyed by entering his time stream, and, therefore, he can save her. When the Doctor next encounters River, in \\"The Husbands of River Song\\" (2015), as the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi), she does not initially recognise him and he is able to learn more about what she is like when he is not around. The Doctor accompanies River (from her perspective, shortly after \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\") on a scheme to obtain a rare diamond. He learns that in addition to him, River has had several spouses, both male and female, and is not above ruthless behaviour as she goes about her work. He also discovers that she truly loves him, but that she also genuinely believes that he does not love her back. She feels that the Doctor is above such petty emotions as love, and that he would never willingly jeopardise himself simply to help her. River ultimately discovers that the man she's been having this adventure with is actually the Doctor, with a new face she doesn't have a record of, thinking he only had 12 regenerations and that she'd already seen his last one. The pair later crash-land on the planet Darillium, where River had told the Doctor in \\"Forest of the Dead\\" that they would have their last night together. He uses time travel to ensure a perfect date, gives her the sonic screwdriver that she had in \\"Silence in the Library\\", and comforts her by revealing that the nights on Darillium last \\"24 years\\", giving River a happy life spent with the Doctor before her impending death in the Library. In 2017 series opener \\"The Pilot\\", a photograph of River is seen on the Doctor's desk in the university in which he is lecturing, beside a photograph of his granddaughter Susan Foreman. River is also referenced in the episode \\"Extremis\\", and it is revealed that she ordered her employee Nardole (Matt Lucas) to keep an eye on the Doctor for her in the event of her death. Other media Coinciding with the 2010 series, Alex Kingston portrays River Song narrating the \\"Monster Files\\" on the BBC website, an in-universe documentary account of Doctor Who monsters. This series had previously (in 2008-09) been narrated by John Barrowman in character as Captain Jack Harkness. Included with the series six DVD release, the exclusive-to-DVD bonus five-part serial Night and the Doctor (2011) references River throughout, with River appearing in the mini-episodes \\"First Night\\" and \\"Last Night\\". The serial helps explain the depth of the relationship shared by River and the Doctor - despite only appearing in 15 (14 plus one flashback, as of 2016) episodes of the television series - when Amy Pond discovers that the Doctor goes on dates with River when Amy and Rory sleep at night in the TARDIS. During the serial, the Doctor attempts to take River on a date shortly after she is imprisoned in Stormcage, but their time in the TARDIS is interrupted by two future incarnations of River, and all are in turn suspicious of the signs of \\"another woman\\" being aboard the TARDIS. The Doctor is able to be rid of the two future Rivers, but not before learning from his future self that one of them is shortly to die in the Library adventure where he first met her. (It is later revealed in \\"The Husbands of River Song\\" that the Eleventh Doctor ultimately cancelled this date, and it is the Twelfth Doctor who ends up taking River to the Singing Towers.) River appears in a further direct-to-DVD mini-episode included with the series 7 box set, \\"Rain Gods\\". River, alongside Smith's Eleventh Doctor, is one of two main playable characters in the PlayStation 3 Doctor Who console game The Eternity Clock. Kingston provided voice acting and motion capture physical acting for the character. In regard to River's role in the narrative of the game, the game's producer Simon Harris explains that she \\"realises that what‚Äôs in her diary is not what she wrote and that actually the Eternity Clock is playing with her history, as well as the Earth‚Äôs history.\\" Author Gary Russell had planned to use River in the Twelfth Doctor novel The Big Bang Generation, but when he was unable to get permission to use her due to Steven Moffat planning on the 2015 Christmas special \\"The Husbands of River Song\\" being the Twelfth Doctor and River's first meeting, Moffat suggested that Russell write the story to incorporate the Seventh Doctor's former companion Bernice Summerfield instead. On 27 June 2015, it was announced that River Song will feature in two Big Finish dramas, Doom Coalition 2 and The Diary of River Song, alongside Paul McGann. As a result, River Song becomes the first major character of the 2005‚Äìpresent modern era of Doctor Who to be featured in a Big Finish production (prior to 2015, the company had been restricted to only using characters from the original 1963‚Äì1989 series, plus McGann's Eighth Doctor from the 1996 Doctor Who TV movie). She also appeared in Doom Coalition 3 and Doom Coalition 4 alongside the Eighth Doctor. During these appearances, River avoids directly meeting with the Eighth Doctor to preserve the timeline; in Diary she communicates with him over a distorted radio transmission, and in Coalition she initially only assists his companions, although she later meets the Doctor directly while wearing a 'psychic wimple' while disguised as a nun, the wimple presenting her with a different face to anyone who has not already met her (she establishes a temporary psychic link with the Eighth Doctor while he is drifting in the Time Vortex in Doom Coalition 4, in which he expresses a subconscious recollection of other meetings with her in his past, but this brief flash of memory is lost when the Doctor is rescued). It was announced in early 2016 that The Diary of River Song would return for a second series in 2017, this time Kingston would be appearing alongside Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy as the Sixth and Seventh Doctors. This box set was released early on Christmas Day 2016. She returned again for a third series later in 2017, which sees River encounter the Fifth Doctor and his new companion Brooke, who is eventually revealed to be a clone of River created as part of the Silences' original plan to kill the Doctor. She returned for further series, with the fourth series seeing River meeting the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and the fifth season pitting River against four different versions of the Master (Geoffrey Beevers, Derek Jacobi, and the Big Finish debut of Eric Roberts and Michelle Gomez as their incarnations of the Master). The sixth season sees River use her knowledge of the Doctor to discreetly 'infiltrate' key moments in his history to acquire key artefacts before they would be lost, including \\"An Unearthly Child\\", \\"The Invasion\\", \\"Carnival of Monsters\\" and \\"The Talons of Weng-Chiang\\". She also appears in The Legacy of Time, a six- part audio created for Big Finish's twentieth anniversary of doing Doctor Who audios, where she works with Benny Summerfield when the Eighth Doctor- from a period during the Time War- discovers what appears to be a fragment of Gallifrey. Characterisation Casting For the role of River Song, whom executive producer Russell T Davies described as \\"sort of the Doctor's wife\\", the production sought to cast Kate Winslet. One of Winslet's first acting roles was in the BBC1 teen drama Dark Season, written by Davies. The role of River Song eventually went to Alex Kingston, known for starring in the popular US drama ER. On Kingston's casting, Davies said, \\"I bloody love her!\\"Davies, Russell T; Benjamin Cook (17 September 2008). \\"The Next Doctor\\". The Times. Retrieved 17 September 2008. Kingston had been a fan of Doctor Who as a child. Kingston, when first cast, did not expect her role to be recurring. She later learned that Moffat had always intended for Song to come back for return appearances. Kingston enjoys getting to play an unusual action hero female role, and praises the show for its variety of settings and opportunities \\"to relive one's childhood fantasies\\" playing with laser guns and wearing varied costumes from one appearance to the next. With regard to having to speak complicated dialogue, she said, \\"I'd work with a medical consultant on ER, who'd explain what we were saying, so I'd say it with a purpose and a truth. On Doctor Who, I've no idea what some of my lines mean!\\" Discussing her role alongside Tennant and Catherine Tate (Donna Noble) in her 2008 introductory episode, Kingston said, \\"We just clicked. I've done guest roles on other shows, but rarely have I felt such a warm bond.\\" About working with Kingston, Catherine Tate said, \\"I'm a huge ER fan. When you hold people in awe, it's almost a disappointment when they come in and they're utterly normal. But Alex isn't disappointing at all. She's such a lovely person.\\" David Tennant was quoted as saying, \\"Alex is terrific. When she's telling you stories about hanging out with George Clooney, you know she's pretty cool.\\" Conception and development The character was originally created purely for the plot of \\"Silence in the Library\\". Moffat knew that the team of archaeologists would have to trust the Doctor, but the Doctor's psychic paper could not explain and convince the team why he had appeared in a sealed-off library. Therefore, Moffat intended for the Doctor to know one of the archaeologists, but decided that idea was \\"dull\\" and instead decided to have one of them know him. Davies and Moffat were going through a phase in which they tried to find Doctor Who titles with rude acronyms \\"to wind up people on internet message boards\\", with one of Moffat's being \\"A River Song Ending\\"; when Davies asked \\"What's a river song?\\", Moffat decided to make this the name of a character who dies. They eventually changed the title to \\"Forest of the Dead\\", being unwilling to actually broadcast an episode with the acronym \\"ARSE\\". When Kingston returned to the show, Moffat explained to her some details about her character's back- story, knowledge which Smith, Gillan and Darvill did not receive until later. Kingston relates that she knows her character cannot be killed off because we saw her death in her introductory episode; each subsequent appearance is set at a different point in her character's personal history. Moffat had planned out that River was Amy and Rory's daughter for \\"a long time\\" and used \\"Pond\\" as Amy's last name to create a link between the two. For the filming of the sixth series, Kingston was aware of River Song's relationship to Amy and Rory, while the other cast only found out upon reading of the mid-season cliffhanger script for \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\". Moffat was influenced by Audrey Niffenegger's science fiction romance novel The Time Traveler's Wife, which depicts a woman who romances and marries a man who unintentionally moves through time. Niffenegger's lovers experience an asynchronous and tragic love story. He comments, \\"I've quite purposefully used it\\", though he cites his 2006 episode \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\" as the episode which most prominently explores the book's themes in addition to its conceit. Kingston herself compares the character to Niffenegger's titular Time Traveler's Wife, and like Moffat enjoys \\"backtracking\\" more and more with the character as the series progresses. The tragedy for Song highlighted by \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\"/\\"Day of the Moon\\" is that she is progressing to a point where the Doctor will not know or trust her any more. Kingston comments, Several artefacts of River Song's, on display at the Doctor Who Experience. Kingston describes the character as being \\"like a female Indiana Jones\\" with regard to both characters being archaeologists and having action hero qualities. She also took inspiration from Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Ellen Ripley in the Alien film franchise commenting that she'd always been \\"so envious of her for having that kind of role.\\" Kingston has also praised the way the love story between River and the Doctor has been deftly handled, stating that \\"I'm not sure you'd get that kind of dynamic in America\\". For Kingston, the physical age difference between herself and Matt Smith adds to the success of the pairing, whilst she feels that viewers have responded warmly to the notion of an action hero in her 40s. Matt Smith has noted that in his characterisation of the Doctor that \\"River Song frightens the Doctor but he finds himself strangely attracted to her\\" and that \\"what makes her a great companion is that when she turns up all hell breaks loose!\\". River's characterisation has invited parallels with that of Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), a companion of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors introduced by Steven Moffat in 2005. According to Moffat in the Doctor Who Confidential episode accompanying \\"Forest of the Dead\\", River's blaster gun is the one previously owned by Jack in the 2005 series of Doctor Who. Upon River's return in series five, Lyle Masaki of AfterElton felt that viewers had the chance to see the character \\"do her best to channel Captain Jack\\" by capturing the same \\"'charming rogue' vibe\\". In May 2012 Moffat stated that River, like Jack, is bisexual. Heather Hogan, a senior editor of AfterEllen felt that Moffat's ability to create \\"fascinating, complicated characters like... River Song\\" is a direct consequence of him abiding by \\"Captain Jack's label-eschewing motto\\": \\"You people and your quaint little categories\\". James Cornish of WhatCulture subsequently cited River's characterisation in a rebuke against claims of misogyny and homophobia in Moffat's writing. He described her as \\"a more sexual, trigger happy version of the Doctor\\" and \\"the strongest female character seen on Doctor Who for a quite a while\\". Reception An article published in Metro, entitled \\"Doctor Who fans love River Song...\\", noted how praise from fans on Twitter after the airing of \\"Day of the Moon\\" focused heavily on Song. In 2011, Laura Pledger of Radio Times listed Kingston as the fourth best Doctor Who guest star, writing, \\"For my money we‚Äôve seen rather too much of River in the last two series, but there‚Äôs no denying Kingston has created a memorable character in Melody Pond.\\" Keith Phipps for The A.V. Club compared the Doctor and River's romantic storyline to The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story, \\"if a bit more elegantly, for my money‚Äîit echoes the plight of anyone who's watched a loved one fade into the shadowlands of dementia. This is not a story that ends well for River and she knows it, whatever flirtatious high spirits being around The Doctor stirs in her.\\" Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker felt the character to be the Doctor's \\"soul mate\\" and described Alex Kingston as \\"badass\\". Neela Debnath of The Independent praised Nina Toussaint-White in her role as Mels, saying she was \\"every bit as sassy and vivacious as her later incarnation... it was a shame that she regenerated so early on because she brought a different energy to the character\\". However, Neil McCormick in The Daily Telegraph thought that her sudden introduction as Rory and Amy's childhood friend showed that Moffat was making it up as he went along. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 felt that River Song was at her \\"high point\\" in some of the early Matt Smith episodes, where she was \\"generally badass and mysterious\\". However, with \\"The Wedding of River Song\\", Anders felt she had lost her mystery and independence, and her love for the Doctor was unrealistic. Whilst critical of the typical characterisation of British female science fiction characters, The Guardians Krystina Nellis singles out River Song alongside Torchwoods Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) as positive depictions of strong female characters, stating: \\"It'd be difficult to find two superwomen in less need of a man to save them.\\" For her role as River Song in the 2011 series of Doctor Who, Alex Kingston won the Best Actress prize at the 2012 SFX magazine Awards. In a 2012 poll conducted by SFX magazine to find the 100 sexiest female characters in science fiction and fantasy, River was voted number 22. She was also included in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters, at number 44. Character Options have also released official toys based on River Song as part of their Doctor Who range. Upon being notified of her own action figure, Kingston stated she did not \\"quite believe it\\" as \\"you don't get that on ER.\\" References External links * * . * .

Cardiff, on the lookout for aircraft flying supplies to the Argentine forces occupying the Falkland Islands, had misidentified the helicopter as an enemy C-130 Hercules. Although the helicopter's loss was initially blamed on enemy action, a subsequent inquiry found Cardiffs missile to be the cause. On the night of 5 June, HMS Cardiff was stationed to the east of the islands to provide gunfire support to the land forces and intercept enemy aircraft. At around 02:00 a radar contact was detected; a British Army Air Corps Gazelle helicopter was making a routine delivery of personnel and equipment to a radio rebroadcast station on East Falkland. From the contact's speed and course, Cardiffs operations room crew assumed it to be hostile. One Sea Dart missile was fired, destroying the target. The Gazelle's wreckage and crew were discovered the next morning, and the loss was attributed to enemy fire. Although Cardiff was suspected, later scientific tests on the wreckage proved inconclusive. No formal inquiry was held until four years later. Defending their claim that the helicopter had been lost in action, the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence (MoD) stated that they had not wanted to \\"cause further anguish to relatives\\" while they were still trying to ascertain how the Gazelle had been shot down. The board of inquiry finally confirmed that the soldiers fell due to friendly fire. It recommended that \\"neither negligence nor blame should be attributed to any individual\\", but identified several factors. A lack of communication between the army and the navy meant that 5th Infantry Brigade had not notified anyone of the helicopter's flight. The navy had not informed the land forces that Cardiff had changed position to set up an ambush for Argentine aircraft travelling over the area. The helicopter's identification friend or foe (IFF) transmitter was turned off, because it caused interference with the army's Rapier anti-aircraft missile system. The board of inquiry's findings prompted criticism of the MoD's initial response to the incident.  Background  On 2 April 1982, the British overseas territory of the Falkland Islands was invaded by neighbouring Argentina. The United Kingdom, nearly away, assembled and dispatched a naval task force of 28,000 troops to recapture the islands. The conflict ended that June with the surrender of the Argentine forces; the battles fought on land, at sea, and in the air had cost the lives of some 900 British and Argentine servicemen. In early May, British troops landed at San Carlos on the western side of East Falkland, and from there moved overland towards the islands' capital of Stanley. To support the advance, logistical supplies were ferried to the troops by helicopter from San Carlos. The Argentine forces occupying Stanley were supplied throughout the war by C-130 Hercules aircraft from the Argentine mainland. These \\"milk-runs\\", as the British termed them, were a source of concern to the Royal Navy, and various attempts were made to intercept them.  Incident  4.5 inch gun litter her deck after providing gunfire support on 5 June. On the night of 5 June, the British Type 42 destroyer took up station on the \\"Bluff Cove Gunline\\" to the east of the islands. Tasked with a dual mission, Cardiff was to provide fire support to the Royal Marines of 3 Commando Brigade, and to interdict any Argentine aircraft attempting to fly into Stanley. The destroyer had performed a similar role four nights previously, when she unsuccessfully attempted to shoot down a re-supply aircraft as it landed, and again as it took off. Meanwhile, pilots Staff Sergeant Christopher Griffin and Lance Corporal Simon Cockton, of 656 Squadron Army Air Corps, had been ordered to fly equipment and personnel to a malfunctioning radio re-broadcast station on top of Pleasant Peak. The station had been established the previous day to provide a communications link between the 5th Infantry Brigade headquarters at Darwin, and the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment at Fitzroy. Night flying conditions were excellent, with a clear sky, a prominent moon and a wind speed of . The crew departed from Goose Green in Gazelle serial number XX377 and collected the replacement equipment from the headquarters at Darwin. They also took on board two passengers; Major Michael Forge, the OC of 205 Signal Squadron, and A Tp Staff Sergeant, Staff Sergeant John Baker. Griffin was an experienced pilot; the flight to the re- broadcast station was expected to take ten minutes. surface plot console At 02:00 local time, Cardiffs operations room detected XX377 on her surface plot radar at a range of . The helicopter's identification friend or foe (IFF) system was turned off, so receiving no friendly transmissions and with the contact apparently heading towards Stanley, the operations room crew assumed it to be hostile. After calculating its speed they believed they were tracking an Argentine fixed-wing aircraft ‚Äì either a Hercules conducting a resupply mission, or a FMA IA 58 Pucar√° ground-attack aircraft sent to retaliate for Cardiffs shelling. Cardiff fired one of her Sea Dart missiles. 5th Infantry Brigade lost radio contact with the Gazelle, and simultaneously the exploding missile was seen and heard by the re-broadcast station's personnel atop Pleasant Peak. Cardiffs crew were able to see the fireball, but only with the aid of night vision goggles. The helicopter's loss caused the British to suspect that Argentine forces were still operating in the area, so patrols were mounted by Gurkha soldiers. When the Gurkhas came across the personnel manning the Pleasant Peak station there was potential for another friendly fire incident to occur. At first light a proper search was carried out, and the Gazelle's wreckage was found along with the dead aircrew and passengers; 5th Infantry Brigade's first casualties of the war. Immediately there were suspicions that Cardiff had been responsible for the shootdown, and later that evening Rear Admiral \\"Sandy\\" Woodward declared a \\"Weapons Tight\\" order, forbidding the engagement of any aircraft not positively identified as hostile, for all contacts detected flying over East Falkland at less than and under .  Investigations  A live Sea Dart missile on HMS Cardiff in 1982 The crew's bodies were initially examined by senior medical officer, Surgeon- Captain Richard \\"Rick\\" Jolly of the Royal Navy. The helicopter's wreckage was inspected on-site, but the British were unable to determine if it had been destroyed by Cardiffs missiles or by Argentine fire. This uncertainty prompted the decision not to hold a board of inquiry, and XX377 was declared \\"lost in action\\". It was surmised that, if the relatives of the deceased were told that the Gazelle might have been lost to friendly fire, it would add to their grief. After the war, missile fragments found in the wreckage were taken to the British government's aviation research facility at RAE Farnborough for analysis. The scientific tests concluded that the fragments were not from a British Sea Dart missile, despite a Sea Dart casing later being found \\"several hundred yards\\" away from the wreckage. In December 1982 an inquest was held by a Southampton coroner into the death of Lance Corporal Cockton after his body was repatriated to the UK. Based on RAE Farnborough's test results, the Army Air Corps submitted evidence stating that the analysis of the warhead fragments found in the wreckage indicated that the helicopter had been destroyed by a type of anti-aircraft missile \\"known to have been in the possession of the enemy\\". The test results were reviewed in November 1985 and determined that there could be \\"no definitive conclusion as to the exact source of the missile fragments recovered from the crash site\\". In June 1986, John Stanley, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, announced in his written answers to the House of Commons: \\"the [Southampton] coroner has been informed accordingly.\\" Cardiff's scorched missile launcher the morning after the shootdown In October 1986, partly due to pressure from Cockton's mother and the anti-war politician Tam Dalyell, an official board of inquiry was finally opened. The board took a month to reach the conclusion that XX377 was shot down by Cardiff. Historian Hugh Bicheno remarks: \\"It took [the] MoD four years and two investigations, the first either incompetent or a deliberate cover-up, even to admit the Gazelle blue-on-blue.\\" The board's findings were made public by a Freedom of Information Act request in July 2008, although Paragraph 13 of the report was redacted under Section 26 of the act as it \\"contains operational details of the Royal Navy's activities, which, even with the passage of time since the Falklands campaign, would be of use to potential enemies.\\" The board of inquiry found that standard operating procedure dictated that the commanders of 5th Infantry Brigade were not required to declare the helicopter's mission to any other authority, as the flight was to occur in brigade airspace on a brigade task. Gazelle XX377 was equipped with an IFF transmitter, but this was turned off. In the opinion of the board, \\"had IFF been in use there is little doubt that Cardiff would not have engaged the aircraft that night.\\" At the time, less than half of the land force's helicopters were fitted with IFF transmitters, and those that were had been ordered not to use them because they inhibited the tracking systems of the British ground-based Rapier anti-aircraft missile batteries. A misconception about the Royal Navy's ability to engage air targets over land led to the navy not being informed that the army's helicopters were not using IFF. The board of inquiry concluded that it was this failure to communicate, together with the navy's assumption that all helicopters would be operating IFF, which \\"had a cumulative effect [and] was a major cause of [the] accident.\\" However, the board recommended that \\"neither negligence nor blame should be attributed to any individual\\".  Effects  The memorial cross Given that the role of helicopters in land force operations was increasing, as was the integration of guided missile destroyers for coastal defence, the board of inquiry recommended an amendment to NATO procedures for amphibious warfare and naval gunfire support, to alert other armed forces to the danger of underestimating a ship's missile engagement zone over land. During the late 1980s, the British government placed more emphasis on joint warfare training, with exercises, such as Purple Warrior, taking place in Oman and Scotland. The board noted the establishment of the Permanent Joint Headquarters, designed to put an end to the \\"ad hoc and reactive way\\" in which operations had been carried out while under single service control. IFF transmitters were fitted to all Army Air Corps and Royal Marine Gazelle and Lynx helicopters, and the problem of operating IFF in the vicinity of Rapier batteries was successfully addressed. The board supported a recommendation that the responsibilities of naval gunfire-support liaison officers could be broadened to include the interpretation of air defence problems during inshore joint warfare operations. A memorial cross was installed on Pleasant Peak, and the number \\"205\\" was painted at the crash site by the soldiers of 205 Signal Squadron. The number is approximately wide and can be seen from the air ().

She broke out of the Greenwich Village music scene boom of the late 1970s, along with other artists such as Steve Forbert, The Roches, and Willie Nile. She is credited with having started the Songwriter's Workshop at the Cornelia Street Cafe in 1977, which later went on to become the Songwriter's Exchange, featuring singer-songwriters such as Jack Hardy and Suzanne Vega. Although she remains relatively unknown in the United States, except for a loyal cult of fans, she managed to gain popularity in Europe and Canada, mostly due to the use of television as a promotional tool in these markets. Her records did well in the charts in Canada, but her greatest success was in Germany, where a live album, Mas Hysteria, was released by Phonogram. It was originally intended to promote her upcoming appearance on Rockpalast in January 1981, and included her most significant hit, \\"Sittin' in the Dark\\". Life and career Mas became well known for her energetic live shows, especially from 1979 to 1981 while signed to Mercury Records. She recorded three albums while with Mercury: Carolyne Mas (1979), Hold On (1980), and Modern Dreams (1981). She was often hailed as being the female Bruce Springsteen, a distinction that served to set her apart from her female contemporaries. She toured the United States, Canada, and Europe extensively with a band of musicians which included David Landau (the brother of Bruce Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau), Crispin Cioe of the Uptown Horns (who later went on to play with the Rolling Stones and Billy Joel), bassist Ivan Elias (1950‚Äì1995; who played with Scandal from 1981 to 1985), drummer Bobby Chouinard (1953‚Äì1997; who also played with Billy Squier), and keyboardist Charlie Giordano (who would eventually go on to become an adjunct member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band after playing several years with Pat Benatar). Her association with Springsteen included her involvement in the 3M benefit at the Stone Pony on January 19, 1986, and the \\"Jersey Artists for Mankind\\" project in May 1986, while she was living at the Jersey Shore. Mas and Cioe, 1980 Mas moved to Bremen, Germany, in 1989 where she continued to tour and record. She was signed to SPV GmbH from 1990 to 1993, and released three albums for them: Action Pact, which was recorded in Springfield, Missouri, in 1988 with the Skeletons/the Morells; a live album entitled Live!, recorded at Jovel Music Hall in M√ºnster, Germany, in November 1990; and a studio album, Reason Street, which was recorded in Bremen in 1992 and produced by Charlton Pettus, her friend at the time, who is now a member of the band Tears for Fears. From 1989 to 1993, Mas toured throughout Germany, performing also in Austria and Hungary. In August 1990, she performed on a television show in Moscow, which was broadcast to 400 million viewers. Mas returned to the United States in September 1993. In 1999, Mas reunited with producer-guitarist Steve Burgh (1950‚Äì2005), who had produced her first two albums, Carolyne Mas and Hold On, while she was signed to Mercury Records twenty years before. They recorded an album's worth of material at Burgh's studio, Baby Monster, in New York City. For these sessions she was also reunited with keyboardist Giordano and guitarist-keyboardist Charlton Pettus. The album is called Brand New World and was released by Mas in 2005, subsequent to Burgh's untimely death, as a tribute to him. Mas currently lives in Arizona with her husband and son. After completing one year at Cochise College with highest honors and being inducted into the Phi Theta Kappa International Honor Society, she transferred to Arizona State University (ASU) in order to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Integrative Health. In February 2017, she was inducted into ASU's chapter of the National Society of Collegiate Scholars, and in January 2018, she was inducted into ASU‚Äôs chapter of the Golden Key International Honor Society. On May 6 of 2019, Mas graduated summa cum laude from ASU, where she was also chosen outstanding student and selected to represent her degree plan at the Edson College of Nursing and Healthcare convocation on May 7 of the same year. Although semi-retired from the music business, Mas occasionally performs in New York City, Germany, and Italy, where she released a studio album entitled Across the River on Italian label Route 61 Music in October 2013. Currently, she is enrolled at ASU to pursue a Master of Science in Medical Nutrition and will graduate from grad school in 2021.

It was named after Gro√üe Freiheit (grand freedom), a street next to Hamburg's Reeperbahn road in the St. Pauli red light district. The film is also known as Port of Freedom in the United Kingdom. It was shot at the Tempelhof and Babelsberg Studios in Berlin, and on location in Hamburg and Prague.  Plot summary  The film tells the story of the blond \\"singing sailor\\" Hannes Kr√∂ger (played by Hans Albers) who works in a St. Pauli club - address: Gro√üe Freiheit 7 - and falls in love with a girl played by Ilse Werner. But she prefers his rival Willem (Hans S√∂hnker) and Hannes returns to the sea.

For a scene with a boat trip in Hamburg harbour warships had to be covered up.  Reception  postwar theatrical release poster Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels was dissatisfied, and demanded many changes to make the film more \\"German\\", for instance by renaming the lead role from Jonny (as in Albers' earlier hit song \\"Good bye, Jonny\\") to Hannes. After a year of editing, the movie was banned anyway in Nazi Germany on 12 December 1944,Also wird die \\"Gro√üe Freiheit Nr. 7\\" f√ºr den Rest des Krieges verboten. ‚Äì WDR.deDer Film wurde 1944 von der Filmpr√ºfstelle f√ºr die Auff√ºhrung in Deutschland verboten. and was only shown outside of the Gro√üdeutsches Reich proper, with the premiere on 15 December 1944 in occupied Prague (then a Reichsprotektorat).

It was re-released in the United Kingdom as Project Genocide. Plot The plot concerns the black- clad Legion of the Winged Serpent, a rogue group of human-like telepathic aliens led by Captain Rameses (Christopher Lee). The Legion's home planet Alpha in the Orion constellation is about to be destroyed in the imminent supernova of its star, and Rameses is leading a small force of flying saucers to Earth to examine its suitability for their race. Performing several alien abductions, they discover they are descendants of transplanted humans, and thus the Earth is perfect for them. They cover their tracks using a device that causes the abductees to commit suicide after a short time. They plan to take over after using a larger version of the device so that everyone on Earth will kill themselves. Opposing any attempt to interfere with less-developed planets is the Intergalactic League of Races, a highly advanced group of bald, big-headed aliens from Zeta Reticuli. The League operates an observation base on Earth in the form of a pyramid hidden beneath the ocean. Rameses lands at the base, pretending to be a friendly researcher, and the League reminds him that under the Galactic Treaty he is to have no contact with humans. While taking a tour of the base, he is disturbed to see a television broadcast featuring human UFO expert and astronomer Professor Allan Duncan (Robert Vaughn) discussing Rameses' abductions. He laughs it off and indulges in the local entertainment. Rameses' crew sabotages one of the League's three saucers, which is later shot down when approaching a United States Army base. The League sends its two remaining saucers to investigate. When they leave, Rameses and his crew kill everyone left in the base and destroy their robots. One of the League saucers manages to return to the base, but its crew is killed in a shootout. Rameses sends his ship to attack the remaining League saucer, but it loses the battle and is destroyed. Rameses then calls in reinforcements, hiding behind the Moon, to hunt down the surviving League ship. Rameses also deploys the \\"extermination device\\", the orbiting, global- scale version of the suicide device. The United States armed forces discover it in orbit, but are powerless to prevent the ensuing suicide epidemic. The surviving League ship has suffered minor computer damage, and contacts Duncan for assistance. He enlists the help of his friend Malcolm (Henry Ramer), a computer expert, who repairs the ship using parts picked up in downtown Toronto. They are discovered shortly after taking off and are intercepted by one of Rameses' ships, but they shoot it down and it crashes into First Canadian Place. Duncan and Malcolm's \\"abduction\\" makes the front page of the Toronto Star. After repairs and refueling, they leave Earth in an attempt to enlist the help of other League ships. Malcolm's improvised repairs burn out shortly past the Moon, so Duncan's knowledge of the masses of the planets is put to use by Malcolm's pocket calculator to plot their course to the outer solar system. The ship successfully reaches a League squadron, and they set out to attack the Legion. Rameses uses the computer in the League base to calculate superior strategies and begins to destroy the League ships. One of the robots in the base is only damaged, not destroyed, and re-takes command. He causes the extermination unit to destroy itself, and then directs Rameses' ships to collide with each other. His fleet destroyed, the super-weapon eliminated, there is no hope for Rameses and the League pleads with him to surrender. When Rameses discovers his sun has gone supernova during the battle, he crashes his ship into the Moon. During the action the extermination unit had passed over Toronto, causing Duncan's wife (Helen Shaver) to slash her wrists. The League races to Duncan's home and easily revives her.

It originally was titled War of the Aliens, which resembled the 1977 blockbuster Star Wars. The title was changed to Alien Encounter, which resembled the 1977 blockbuster Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Hal Roach Studios producers Earl A. Glick and Norman Glick bankrolled the production with $1 million. Many elements of the film, including the design of the robots and the winged serpent emblem the black-clad villains wear, are taken from UFO accounts. Starship Invasions was released in VHS format by Warner Home Video. It was also released in 1987 on video in the United Kingdom by Krypton Force under the title Project Genocide. Its French-language title was L'invasion des soucoupes volantes. Critical reception From contemporary reviews, Globe and Mail reviewer Robert Martin panned Starship Invasions, likening the film to \\"those dubbed Japanese movies usually seen on Saturday afternoon television\\". John Duvoli of The Evening News called it a \\"poor imitation\\" of previous science fiction films. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film is too low budget and derivative to even appeal to science fiction fans. Variety described the film as a \\"cinematic curio\\", stating that it was a \\"1970s replica of those hoaky old Republic sci-fi pix of the 1940s, apparently made in complete sincerity by young director Ed Hunt with none of the phony campiness that often haunts such recreations.\\" Notes  References  Sources * * * External links * * * Category:1970s science fiction drama films Category:1977 films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian science fiction drama films Category:Films shot in Toronto Category: Films scored by Gil Mell√© Category:Fiction about mind control Category:Hal Roach Studios ","title":"Starship Invasions"},{"id":"17722145","text":"The Experiment is a 2010 American drama thriller film directed by Paul T.

Among them is Travis (Brody), a proud anti-war protestor, and Michael Barris (Whitaker), a 42-year-old man who still lives with his domineering mother. After interviews measuring responses to various scenes of violence are conducted, a chosen 26 are driven to an isolated building set up as a prison and split into six guards and 20 prisoners. Travis is assigned to be a prisoner, Barris to be a guard. Basic rules are outlined: prisoners must eat, and fully consume, three meals a day; there will be 30 minutes of rec daily; prisoners must remain within designated areas. The guards in turn must ensure prisoners obey the rules, and deal with transgressions commensurately within 30 minutes. Archaleta stresses that the experiment will end immediately at the first sign of violence or quitting. If they manage to follow the rules for two weeks, each man will be paid $14,000. Travis shares his cell with Benjy, a graphic novelist, and Nix, a member of the Aryan Brotherhood. Barris, concerned that some of the guards, particularly Chase, may be capable of violence, tries to dissuade them from aggressive behavior. Instead, the guards grow more forceful in order to make prisoners follow the rules. Barris becomes more and more sadistic. Despite increasing abuse from the guards, Travis remains defiant. Realizing Travis is influencing prisoner dissent, Barris decides to humiliate him, as physical retribution is forbidden. Under Barris' lead Travis is abducted, head shaved, and urinated upon. The red light does not come on, and Barris takes this as a sign that his actions were \\"commensurate\\". He reassures the guards that they are behaving appropriately. When fellow guard Bosch dissents, Barris pressures him by reminding that quitting early will forfeit payment. Travis discovers that Benjy, who is taken ill, had concealed his diabetes, thinking that he could manage the condition himself. When Travis pleads for Bosche to intervene, Bosche tries to help by locating Benjy's insulin, but is caught by other guards. Barris, to Travis' surprise, gives Benjy his insulin, but later takes revenge by massing all other guards to beat Bosche severely, who is then left among the prison population. Barris also orders Travis to clean the prison toilets as punishment for his defiant attitude and his attempt to help Benjy. Travis taunts Barris, saying he should use his $14,000 for psychological treatment. The guards respond by shoving Travis' head into the toilet, nearly drowning him. One morning while being humiliated during roll call, Travis removes his prison shirt as a sign that the experiment should end, and is followed by the other prisoners. Travis jumps up to one of the cameras and demands that the group be let go, but is dragged to the floor by the guards, who choke him with their batons. When Benjy tries to defend Travis, Barris hits Benjy hard on the head with his baton, leaving him twitching on the floor. Guards throw Travis into an old boiler pipe overnight, attack remaining prisoners, and chain them up across the compound. While locked in the dark boiler, Travis realizes that there is a hidden infrared camera watching him, even there, and as his despondence turns to anger he manages to get out. He interrupts the rape of a prisoner by Chase, knocks him out, and sets the other prisoners free. Upon finding Benjy chained up and left to die, Travis leads an assault against the guards, chasing them through the building. Even as the rest of the guards try to lift the shutters to escape, Barris tries to keep them in. The money is no longer his main concern; instead he is unwilling to let go of his power. A vicious brawl ensues with the prisoners largely overwhelming the guards in sheer numbers. Barris, blaming Travis for causing the unrest, attempts to stab him, but the latter catches the blade with his hand. Barris abruptly pulls away, shocked at his actions before he is tackled to the ground. Travis proceeds to brutally beat Barris, as the siren finally blares. The red light comes on and the doors open, signaling the end of the experiment. The group emerges into bright sunshine and sit in stunned silence on the grass until a bus arrives. They are shown being driven home on the bus; clean, dressed, and paid for their participation in the experiment. Travis and Barris share a silent glance as Barris stares down at his $14,000 check. Nix asks Travis if he still believes that humans are higher in the chain of evolution than monkeys. Travis responds that he does, because people have the ability to change. Audio news snippets suggest that Archaleta is being tried for manslaughter. Travis meets his girlfriend in India. She notices that his knuckles are bruised, in contrast to the beginning of the film, when she noted his pristine knuckles, an indication that he was, at the time, incapable of violence.

The dark fruit are mainly used for cooking or culinary uses. History It is thought it may have come to the UK, by the Romans and was first mentioned at the Cistercian built Abbey of Warden in Bedfordshire in the 13th century. It may also be linked to the French pear ‚Äòde Livre‚Äô. 'Black Worcester' was recorded as being grown by monks at the Abbey as early as 1388. As long keeping fruit, it formed an important part of the winter diet until root-crops were introduced. The fruit is larger than average and the flesh hard and coarse, but is reported to be excellent when stewed. It may also have been used to make perry. In the 1990s and 2000s, Worcestershire County Council created a 'Fruit Trees for Worcestershire' scheme, in which several hundred young black pear trees were planted. The cultivar is a tentatively accepted name by the RHS. Heraldry Arms of Worcestershire County Council, featuring a tree bearing black pears Pears formed part of the provisions of the troops at Agincourt in 1415, where Worcestershire bowmen carried banners depicting a pear tree laden with fruit. Michael Drayton's poem of the battle, notes ‚ÄúWor‚Äôster a pear tree laden with its fruit‚Äù. On Queen Elizabeth I's visit to the city of Worcester in August 1575, the city authorities ordered a black pear fruit-laden tree to be transplanted to the Foregate from Whystone Farm, in her honour. So admiring was she of the good management that had allowed the fruit to remain unplucked that she granted an augmentation of honour of a canton charged with \\"three pears sable\\" to be added to the city's coat of arms. Up until 1956, the Worcestershire Yeomanry Cavalry have used an image of the pear blossom for badges. It is still used on the County Council and County Cricket Club badge. Specific varieties of pear are seldom mentioned in heraldic blazons, although \\"Warden pears\\" are blazoned as canting arms for the family of Warden. Pears feature in the canting arms of the families of Parincheff and Periton. Warden Pear The name of 'Warden pear' may refer to any one of a number of pear varieties that do not truly ripen and must therefore be cooked to be edible. They are used to make \\"Warden pies\\"; \\"I must have Saffron to colour the Warden Pies\\" (Shakespeare, The Winter's Tale iv.3). In Two Fifteenth-Century Cookery-Books, edited by Thomas Austin for the Early English Text Society (Original Series, Volume 91), a recipe is given (p. 51) for \\"Quyncis or Wardouns in past\\" Also known as 'Parkinson's Warden'.Mr Urban Description The fruits are up to 78mm (3‚Ä≥) wide and 85mm long, and can weigh as much as 260g. The skin is a dark mahogany colour with russet freckles and small areas of rough skin. The flesh is a pale yellow or cream, tinged green under the skin. They should be picked in October or early November, when it is crisp, hard and gritty then they can be stored until April. This does not require refrigeration, hence why they were so valuable in the past, as they could be used by troops when on long distance travels. They are also sharp and bitter until cooked.

Refusenik Refusenik is a 2008 feature-length documentary written, directed, and produced by Laura Bialis, and co-produced by Stephanie Seldin Howard. Refusenik is the first retrospective documentary to chronicle the thirty-year international human rights campaign to free more than 1.5 million Soviet Jews who tried to escape the pervasive anti-Semitism of postwar Russia. Refuseniks is the term that Soviet Jews gave themselves when they were refused exit visas.Preston, Ben. ‚ÄúThe Long Road Home‚Äù, Santa Barbara Independent. May 22, 2008. Told through the eyes of activists on both sides of the Iron Curtain, the film shows how a small grassroots effort bold enough to confront the Cold War superpower transformed into an international human rights campaign. The film is a tapestry of first-person accounts of heroism, sacrifice, and ultimately, liberation. ‚ÄúOne of the proudest chapters in Jewish history, the story of the refuseniks demonstrates the need for Jewish solidarity, the importance of the State of Israel, and the responsibilities we face as individuals living in a democracy,‚Äù read a review in Jewish Current Issues. Much of the material used in Refusenik was unique and exclusive to the film. Interviews with leaders in the movement (including Anatoly Sharansky) were some of the first ever to be recorded. Many of the photographs and covert film footage ‚Äì some of it smuggled out of the Soviet Union ‚Äì had never been seen before by a large audience, and helped make Refusenik a unique portrait of this important story. ‚ÄúRarely is the subject (of human rights abuses) addressed as effectively as it is in Laura Bialis' absorbing new documentary, Refusenik,‚Äù read a review in The Seattle Times. ‚ÄúIt symbolized hope over tragedy, and the triumph of the human spirit.\\" In an interview with the Jewish Daily Forward, Bialis said, ‚ÄúThe film changed my life.

Statement Let F, G, and H be homogeneous polynomials in three variables, with H having higher degree than F and G; let a = deg H ‚àí deg F and b = deg H ‚àí deg G (both positive integers) be the differences of the degrees of the polynomials. Suppose that the greatest common divisor of F and G is a constant, which means that the projective curves that they define in the projective plane P2 have an intersection consisting in a finite number of points. For each point P of this intersection, the polynomials F and G generate an ideal (F, G)P of the local ring of P2 at P (this local ring is the ring of the fractions n/d, where n and d are polynomials in three variables and d(P) ‚â† 0). The theorem asserts that, if H lies in (F, G)P for every intersection point P, then H lies in the ideal (F, G); that is, there are homogeneous polynomials A and B of degrees a and b, respectively, such that H = AF + BG. Furthermore, any two choices of A differ by a multiple of G, and similarly any two choices of B differ by a multiple of F. Related results This theorem may be viewed as a generalization of B√©zout's identity, which provides a condition under which an integer or a univariate polynomial h may be expressed as an element of the ideal generated by two other integers or univariate polynomials f and g: such a representation exists exactly when h is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of f and g. The AF+BG condition expresses, in terms of divisors (sets of points, with multiplicities), a similar condition under which a homogeneous polynomial H in three variables can be written as an element of the ideal generated by two other polynomials F and G. This theorem is also a refinement, for this particular case, of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, which provides a condition expressing that some power of a polynomial h (in any number of variables) belongs to the ideal generated by a finite set of polynomials.

R. S. Yorke and informally as Kay or K, was an English architect and author. One of the first native British architects to design in a modernist style, he made numerous contacts with leading European architects while contributing to the Architects Journal in the 1930s, and in 1933 was secretary and founder member of the MARS Group. From 1935 until 1962 he was the editor of an annual publication Specification. Between 1935 and 1937 he worked in partnership with the Hungarian architect and former Bauhaus teacher Marcel Breuer, before forming the Yorke Rosenberg Mardall partnership in 1944 together with Eugene Rosenberg (1907-1990) and Cyril Mardall (Sj√∂str√∂m) (1909-1994), with whom he designed many post-war buildings including Gatwick Airport. Yorke was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, where his father was also an architect, and studied architecture and planning at the Birmingham School of Architecture, where his fellow students included other notable early modernist figures including Richard Sheppard, Frederick Gibberd, Colin Penn and Robert Furneaux Jordan. The Modern House In 1934, Yorke wrote The Modern House, a book that introduced modernist houses, fourteen pages of which were dedicated to English examples. Yorke was inspired by seeing modern architecture on his Prague visit in 1931 and initially collaborated on the book with the Czech architect Karel Honz√≠k. He wrote a follow-up article in the Architectural Review in 1936 focusing on the use of concrete and this included a further eleven English houses. These contributions helped lay the basis for the postwar English fascination with concrete.Mallgrave (2009). p. 314 In 1937 he published The Modern House in England which illustrated houses from a number of his fellows from the MARS group. The book was split into chapters on brick and stone, timber frame and concrete. It included a foreword by William LethabyYorke (1947), p. 5-8 Also in 1937 Yorke together with Frederick Gibberd published The Modern Flat and in 1939 with Colin Penn A Key to Modern Architecture.

It is the only college or university in the state of New Mexico to offer a Master's Degree in Art Therapy. History Southwestern College traces its roots to the Quimby Metaphysical Library, a library which has a large collection of religious and metaphysical books, and manuscripts of American transcendentalist and the Father of the New Thought Movement, Phineas Parkhurst Quimby. The library was founded by Neva Dell Hunter in 1945 in Alamogordo, New Mexico. The library was eventually known as Quimby Memorial Library. The school's vision, mission, philosophy, and programs are also influenced by Rudolf Steiner, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Alice Bailey, perennial wisdom traditions, and Hindu scriptures. In 1976, the center was rededicated as Quimby College by Robert Waterman, with Hunter as the guest of honor. Hunter's ideas were used by Waterman in founding the core curriculum of the college and its programs. The college's initial intention was to train counselors who were well-versed and practiced in areas of spirituality and consciousness. In 1979, the college started to offer programs in Counseling. Quimby College later became Southwestern College. In 1996, Southwestern College became accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, an independent corporation and one of two commission members of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In the same year, Dr. Marylou Butler became the school's second President. In 1998, the college's Master of Arts in Art Therapy/Counseling was approved by the American Art Therapy Association. In 2006, Dr. James Michael Nolan was selected as the third president. Since 2006,the College tripled the size of its campus, built an Art Therapy building, created the Tierra Nueva Counseling Center, and launched professional certificate training in Human Sexuality, Infant Mental Health, and Interpersonal Neurobiology.

In an unusual move for an Iraqi woman, Hussein spoke out against the so-called \\"honour killing,\\" left her husband and went into hiding. She had intended to leave Iraq for Jordan with the help of an Iraqi women's rights group.Sarhan, Afif and Davies, Caroline. \\"Mother who defied the killers is gunned down\\", The Observer, June 1, 2008. She was shot dead in Basra by unknown assailants on May 17, 2008, the day she had planned to leave the country. The Observer reports that local police are not certain that she was the target of the shooting. Early life Hussein was born into a Shiite Muslim family. She was an orphan, and was raised by an uncle, who was himself killed during the Shia uprising in the 1990s against Saddam Hussein. Daughter's death Hussein's daughter, Rand Abdel-Qader (b. June 23, 1990), was a student at Basra University. In 2007, while working as a volunteer with displaced Iraqi families, she formed a friendship with a 22-year-old British soldier who had been distributing water. She later told her mother she had spoken to him because she was the only English speaker in the group. Although the friendship was by all accounts innocent, Rand confided to a friend that she had developed romantic feelings for the man. In March 2008, months after the girl and the soldier had last seen one another, news of the friendship reached her father, a former government employee. He decided that she had dishonoured the family, and on March 16, he stamped on her head, choked her, and stabbed her until she was dead. Rand's brothers are reported to have helped him.Sarhan, Afif and Davies, Caroline. \\"'My daughter deserved to die for falling in love'\\", The Observer, May 11, 2008. She was buried in a makeshift grave, which her uncles reportedly spat on. The father was arrested by local police and held for two hours before being released without charge. In an interview with The Observer, he admitted that he had killed his daughter, and said that the police had congratulated him. He told the newspaper that his only regret was that he did not kill her at birth. Shooting After her daughter's killing, Hussein denounced her husband, an unusual and dangerous step for a woman in Iraq. She left the family home, reportedly after being beaten and having her arm broken, and went into hiding with the help of an NGO women's group, who planned to help her escape Iraq to Amman, Jordan. Her husband told The Observer that his daughter had inherited \\"bad genes\\" from her mother. In a separate interview in April 2008, Hussein made it clear that she feared for her life, telling the newspaper, \\"No man can accept being left by a woman in Iraq. But I would prefer to be killed than sleep in the same bed as a man who was able to do what he did to his own daughter.\\" She moved constantly between safe houses, spending no more than four days in any one. She was gunned down in the street while walking toward a taxi with two women's rights activists, on their way to meet a contact who was going to smuggle her into Jordan. A car reportedly containing three men drew up alongside the women, and five bullets were fired, three of which hit Hussein. The women activists were also shot and were admitted to a hospital. A senior police officer in Basra said police believe the women activists were the targets, not Hussein. Two other activists from the same group have been killed since 2006: one was raped before being shot, and the second, the only man who had worked for the group, was shot at the beginning of 2008.

CE 50) was written around CE 30 or 31.Walker, p. xiiiThe Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition (2001-07), s.v. \\"Valerius Maximus\\" It is a collection of approximately a thousand short stories that Valerius wrote during the reign of Tiberius (42 BCE ‚Äì CE 37). The stories are a variety of anecdotes illustrating how the ancient Romans lived. While the majority of the stories are of Roman life, he does have some foreign stories at the end of some chapters. Most of these are of Greek life and most of those are about Greek philosophers or famous kings.Walker, p. xix Several of the stories relate to moral subjects that parallel those in the Old Testament and New Testament. Valerius refers to his moral stories as \\"examples\\" that were to be used as moral guidance. Valerius' work on the preservation of moral values of the Roman Republic of the past was widely popular through the Age of Enlightenment, a literary life-span of some 1,700 years. People read Valerius' work for practical guidance in their everyday tasks for living a moral life.Walker, p. xxii This work was especially used as a reference by writers and professional orators. It is estimated that Valerius's work on these nine books took over a decade. He obtained material from Cicero, and from Livy, Sallust, Pompeius Trogus, Marcus Terentius Varro and other ancient historians. Each of the nine books has several chapters. Each chapter is outlined and grouped thematically and contains several stories illustrating that theme.Walker, p. vii Table of Contents This work is the earliest known use of a hierarchical organization system for topics of a book.Princeton University Press article A short history of information retrieval There are a total of 91 chapters covering a wide variety of subjects drawn from Roman life. Valerius arranges his chapters focused on particular virtues, moral and immoral habits, religious practices, superstitions and ancient traditions. There is a thematic guide at the end of the work.Walker, p. 355 Subjects Omens One example of Valerius' balanced subject themes covered is where he writes stories about omens.Walker, p. 17 He notes that the observations of omens had a connection to religion in ancient Rome since many people of that time believed that omens were from divine providence.Walker, p. 17 Valerius records that omens had played an important role when Rome had been demolished by the Gauls in 390 BCE. The Senate was debating whether they should then move Rome to Veii or rebuild the city walls.Walker, p. 17 While they were deciding some cohorts had just returned from guard duty.Walker, p. 17 Their centurion then just happened to shout in the assembly place, \\"Standard-bearer, set up the standard; this is the best place for us to stay.\\" The city was rebuilt in the same place then, since they interpreted these words as an omen.Walker, p. 17 Auspices One of the subject themes that Valerius wrote about was the superstition of auspices in Book 1 Chapter 4.Walker, p. 14 Auspices means \\"bird observations.\\" It is from the Latin words of avis (bird) and spicere (to sight or watch).Walker, p. 14 Before doing anything of great importance, the Romans would \\"take the auspices\\" in order to determine what the gods approved.Walker, p. 14 This was an examination of the behavior of birds in flight or eating.Walker, p. 14 It was interpreted by an augur as to the will of the gods from this behavior. A Roman story that Valerius writes about is the founding of Rome by Romulus and Remus.Walker, p. 14 He records that the founding of the city was based on the auspices. Remus was the first to \\"take the auspices\\" by seeing six vultures.Walker, p. 14 Romulus later however saw twelve vultures. Romulus claimed he had a stronger claim because he saw a larger quantity, even though Remus was the first to spot vultures.Walker, p. 14 Another \\"foreign\\" story Valerius writes on this theme for a comparison is on the founding of the city of Alexandria in Egypt.Walker, p. 17 It was founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BCE. The architect was Deinocrates.Walker, p. 17 He records that when Deinocrates was going to design a great city in Egypt, he had no chalk to use for writing.Walker, p. 17 Instead he used a large quantity of barley, and drew out the plans on the ground.Walker, p. 17 A group of birds then came from a nearby lake and ate the barley.Walker, p. 17 The Egyptian augur interpreted this to mean that there would be plenty of food for a large city there.Walker, p. 17 Modesty Cato the Elder Valerius writes on the theme of modesty in Book 4 Chapter 5 about the fact that there was no separate seating for the Conscript Fathers (Roman Senators) at the theater.Walker, p. 142, Book 4 Chapter 5.1 reads, From the foundation of our city to the consulship of Scipio Africanus and Tiberius Longus there was no separate seating for the Senate and the people when they watched the games. In spite of this, no member of the plebs ever brought himself to sit in front of the Conscript Fathers at the theater; the respect shown in our state was so scrupulous. This was from the beginnings of Rome in the 8th century BCE until the time of the consulship of Scipio Africanus and Tiberius Sempronius Longus in 194 BCE. In spite of this no member of the plebs ever sat in front of the Conscript Fathers. Their respect for this tradition was also shown when one day Lucius Quinctius Flamininus was to stand in the very back of the theater. He was placed there because he had been removed from the Roman Senate by Cato the Censor and Lucius Valerius Flaccus. Flamininus already held the office of consul and was the brother of Titus Flamininus (consul 192 BCE), who had defeated Philip V of Macedon in 197 BCE. In spite of this he still was forced to go to the back of the theater by Cato the Elder. Out of respect however, the entire audience moved Flamininus to the very front so that nobody was in front of him. Valerius illustrates another story of modesty when he writes of Gaius Terentius Varro. Varro devastated the Roman Republic when he started the Battle of Cannae, one of the worst battles of recorded history. His sense of shame would not allow him to accept dictatorship, even though it was offered to him. The people of the Republic attributed the great loss to the anger of the gods. On the inscription under his death mask shows his good character which brought him more honor that most men receive from the dictatorship position itself. Valerius records another story of modesty where king Hiero II of Syracuse hears of the disastrous defeat of the Romans at the Battle of Lake Trasimene.Walker, p. 156 He immediately sends as a gift to Rome 70,000 bushels of wheat, 50,000 bushels of barley, and 240 pounds of gold. So that the gold was accepted and not returned he presented it in the form of a statue of victory. This was so the Roman people would accept it on religious grounds. Parenting Cornelia proclaiming \\"These are my jewels,\\" in reference to her sons Another example of Valerius' themes is where he writes stories about Roman parents and the affection they had toward their children. A story in Book 4 Chapter 4 on Poverty is about the Gracchus brothers, Gaius Gracchus and his younger brother Tiberius Gracchus. The story relates how one day Cornelia Africana, their mother (daughter of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus), was pestered by a lady guest that was showing off her elegant jewellery. Cornelia patiently endured this lady until her sons came home from school. Then, introducing them to this lady, she proclaimed proudly, \\"These are my jewels.\\"Walker, p. 138 Another example in Book 8 Chapter 8 is about the philosopher Socrates. He writes of him showing an intimate side which did not distract from his stature because, as Valerius puts it, no part of wisdom was hidden from him. He tells how Socrates one time made a hobbyhorse out of reed for his sons. He would then play with the hobbyhorse with them showing Socrates' personal parental side.Walker, p. 291 Valerius writes many stories of other Roman fathers which generally are contrary to the stereotypical image of being brutal and harsh.Walker, p. xv Some of these examples are in Book 5 Chapter 7 titled The Love and Indulgence of Parents towards Their Children.Walker, p. 189 He writes that the real fathers are the ones that are benignly permissive and show indulgence. He reports with delight that this kind of father could be found in the streets of Rome and that these fathers were as gentle as fathers in a comedy.Walker, p. 193 He does, however, describe in Book 5 Chapter 8 Fathers who were severe with their children some all-powerful Roman abusive fathers as being tyrannical patriarchs killing and murdering others including of their own blood. He clearly reports these that are extremely strict and severe as no longer in the role of being a loving father.Walker, p. 191 Valerius writes of Lucius Junius Brutus, who killed his sons for failing in their military duties, He left the role of a father so that he could play the part of a consul.Book 5, Chapter 8.1 Other examples of these role changes can be found in Book 6. In Chapter 1.5 where Valerius tells the story of Quintus Fabius Maximus Eburnus,Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.5, p. 199 Eburnus had carried out the highest public offices with great splendor and finished off his career with much dignity; however, he had his son punished for a chastity that was dubious. In Chapter 1.6 Valerius writes about Publius Atilius Philiscus who was abused as a child.Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.6, p. 199 When he became an adult, Philiscus became a strict father on chastity. Learning of his daughter's premarital sex, he murdered her. The role of women Titian's image of the rape of Lucretia Valerius writes of Roman women being generally in seclusion. He reports in Book 6 on Chastity the stereotypical woman as being well-behaved and who would rather face death than dishonor. One story is of Lucretia in Book 6 Chapter 1.1.Walker, p. 198 He writes that she was violently forced to have sex with Sextus Tarquinius, the son of King Tarquin the Proud. Lucretia could not bear the disgrace and committed suicide. Another example is about Hippo, a Greek woman. She committed suicide rather than being raped by drunken sailors.Valerius Maximus Book 6. ext. 1. Valerius even writes in Book 2, Chapter 6.14, of suttee being an admired practice model for all women to follow in his day.Book 2 Chapter 6.14 Homosexuality Valerius writes about homosexuality, which was an unusual category for that time period of writers.Walker, p. xvi This aspect of private life was kept under wraps. The only relationship along these lines that was tolerated by law was that between a master and a slave. Valerius, however, does report on male homosexuality in the Roman army and the upper class. He does not report on female homosexuality nor \\"gay women\\" as some writers did at the time. Roman army In the stories of the Roman army, Valerius always records high-ranking military personnel taking advantage of their position. In Book 6 Chapter 1.10 Valerius tells the story of Gaius Cornelius.Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.10, p. 200Book 6, Chapter 1.10 He was rewarded four times by his superiors to be the senior centurion of his legion. However Gaius Pescennius, a triumvir capitalis (prison manager) in CE 149, had Cornelius thrown in jail and shackled in irons for having sexual relations with a young boy of free birth. Cornelius did not deny the charges and was prepared to make a sponsio (legal guarantee). In so doing, Cornelius was making a statement and putting down a sum of money as a guarantee of truth. If the guaranteed statement was found to be false, the young boy was to be paid this amount. His statement was to say that the boy openly and willingly sold his body for cash. The tribunes refused to allow this, since they thought soldiers of the Roman Republic should not make deals in which they could pay for pleasures at home by facing dangers overseas. Cornelius spent the rest of his life in prison. In Book 6 Chapter 1.11 Valerius tells the story of Marcus Laetorius Mergus.Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1.11, p. 200 Cominius and a tribune of the plebs summoned Mergus, a high- ranking military career person, before the people because of sexual relations with young men and women outside his marriage. He was prosecuted and sent to prison. In Book 6 Chapter 1.12 Valerius tells the story of Chiomara.Walker, Book 6, Chapter 1. ext. 2, p. 201Book 6, ext. 2 Chiomara was the wife of Ortiagon. During the Galatian War with Rome of 189 BC, Gnaeus Manlius Vulso was victorious in a campaign against the Galatian Gauls. One of his centurions was put in charge of a group of captives including Chiomara. The centurion made sexual advances towards her and she rejected him. Under violence and force he raped her. The centurion then offered, to assuage his shame, to ransom her back to her relatives. When he received his ransom and was counting the gold pieces, Chiomara secretly indicated to her relatives to murder him and cut off his head. She later presented the head of the centurion to her husband. Political views Coin of Lucius Appuleius Saturninus The political views of ordinary Romans basically were not written on by most ancient writers.Walker, P. xvii Valerius, however, did write about the grassroots customs of Rome as a democratic society. He points out that the poorer Romans had goals as to where they wanted to ultimately be and in what direction they wanted to go. One example of how political views were looked upon in his days is where he writes a story on Sextus Titus, who kept a picture in his residence of a murdered radical called Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.Walker, p. 271Book 8, Chapter 8.1.damn.3 Titus was popular with the people because of a new land reform law he proposed; however, he was prosecuted and punished just because of the picture and his political views. He writes that the Romans felt a personal loyalty to the memory of these reformers. The tribal assembly of plebeians felt that this memory could be led astray if there was an association to a radical. Many times there were imposters that said they were sons of populist leaders like Tiberius, Gaius Marius, Gracchus, and Publius Clodius Pulcher. The people of Rome loved them.Book 9, Chapter 7.1 and 7.2Book 9, Chapter 15. 1 -4 In fact, he records that one claimed to be the grandson of Gaius Marius and drew a crowd as what Caesar himself would obtain. Valerius records the attitudes of the aristocracy and the contempt to which the lower class was subjected by the Roman elite. He demonstrates this with a story about Scipio Aemilianus Africanus. Scipio one day preached to a group of plebs that basically they are nothing other than just a level above being slaves. He tells them they don't even deserve to call Italy their home.Book 6, Chapter 6.2.3 Valerius shows a similar concept with Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio. The story goes that Nasica treated a poor man with ridicule and contempt because his hands were so rough from manual labor.Book 7 Chapter 5.2 Valerius writes of still another example where the aristocratic Claudia had hoped for more of the Roman common people to have been finished off in the First Punic War.Book 8, Chapter 1.damn.4 Coin of Eumenes II Generosity Valerius gives examples of generosity in Book 5 Chapter 8.Walker, p. 155 Valerius writes that generosity is given to those that are poor.Walker, p. 157 The Latin word for generosity is liberalitas. The god of wine is Liber. The god Liber and the word liberalitas come from the word liber, meaning \\"free.\\" Here he tells the story of how, after the Romans captured Asia from King Antiochus III the Great in 190 BCE, they gave a large portion of it to their ally King Eumenes II of Pergamum free as a permanent gift.Walker, p. 155 Another example of generosity which Valerius writes about occurs after the Romans had defeated Philip V of Macedonia. In 196 BCE, the Greeks had the Isthmian Games. Here Titus Quinctius Flamininus proclaimed the independence of the Greek states from Macedonian rule.Walker, p. 155 At the games, the stadium was full of people and Titus had the herald make the following proclamation: \\"The Roman people and Senate, and Titus Quinctius Flamininus, their general, having vanquished the Macedonians and Philip, their king, order that Greece shall be free from foreign garrisons, not subject to tribute, and shall live under her own customs and laws.\\"Walker, p. 155 Kindness and compassion The themes in Chapter 1 of Book 5 are kindness and compassion; Valerius gives several examples based on these concepts.Walker, p. 157 He considered these lesser virtues than generosity, although companions of it.Walker, p. 157 Valerius writes that kindness is shown to those that are in trouble and compassion is for those whose luck has turned against them.Walker, p. 157 He considered generosity to be the one that derived its name from a god, and should receive the most approval of these three.Walker, p. 157 One Roman story is where Valerius gives an example of generosity, kindness and compassion. Here he explains that one day the Roman Senate was offered a large sum of ransom money for the release of 2,743 Carthaginian soldiers and refused it. The Senate released the soldiers to the representatives that had come to get them, and forgave the crimes. The representatives were astonished and even admitted that they themselves would not have been so kind and generous.Walker, p. 157 Another Roman story in which Valerius writes about kindness is where king Syphax of western Numidia died in prison in Tibur (modern day Tivoli, Italy) in 201 BCE. The Senate gave him a state funeral with a proper burial.Walker, p. 157 Another similar Roman story in which Valerius writes about compassion is where the Senate sent a quaestor to Alba (in Latium) in 167 BCE. There King Perseus of Macedonia was banished to and had just died there. They wanted to give him honor and provided a state funeral for the king.Walker, p. 157 Roman Forum Gratitude Valerius gives examples of gratitude in Book 5 Chapter 2 as the theme.Walker, p. 165 One example is when Valerius writes about how Capua was being besieged by Quintus Fulvius Flaccus at the first Battle of Capua; there were two Campanian women who had kind feelings for Rome. They devoted much of their time and property to its benefit.Walker, p. 165 One was Vestia Oppia, a married woman with a family, who labored every day for the Roman army.Walker, p. 165 Another was Cluvia Facula, a prostitute, who supplied food to the Roman prisoners of war.Walker, p. 165 When Capua was defeated, the Roman Senate gave back their freedom and property and rewarded them. These two women were even praised at an important Senate meeting in 210 BCE.Walker, p. 165 Valerius gives another example of gratitude when he writes of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus (c. 280 BC ‚Äì 203 BC), called Cunctator (the Delayer).Walker, p. 166 Fabius died in 203 BCE after being consul for five terms. Many people of Rome generously gave money to his funeral in gratitude for his leadership.Walker, p. 166 When he was still alive, to show gratitude of his outstanding service to the Roman people, a referendum of the plebs gave equal power to his magister equitum Marcus Minucius Rufus as co-dictator in 217 BCE.Walker, p. 166 Carthage location Ingratitude Valerius gives as the theme \\"ingratitude\\" in Book 4 Chapter 3. Valerius writes that Scipio Aemilianus, grandson of famous general Scipio Africanus, had destroyed two major cities, Numantia and Carthage, that were major threats to Rome. However, in Rome later, he met his death in mysterious circumstances in 129 BCE.Book 4, Chapter 1.12 There was never anyone in the Roman Forum that avenged his death. Valerius writes of another example on ingratitude being the circumstances around Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio. Nasica had led a group of conservative senators of the Roman Senate to kill the populist tribune of the plebs Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BCE.Book 3, Chapter 2.17 He soon afterward had to withdraw from public life because the people of Rome had judged his merits unfairly. Nasica, a Pontifex Maximus, went to Pergamum ostensibly as a diplomat and never returned. He died there, but never missed his country because the Roman people were so ungrateful for what he considered a great deed he had done for them. The rostra at the Roman Forum Infamous crimes On another theme, Valerius writes of several examples of infamous crimes in Book 8 Chapter 1 and how they related to jealousy.Walker, p. 266 One example Valerius records of acquittal (absoluti) is where Marcus Horatius is found guilty by King Tullus Hostilius of killing his sister.Book 8 Chapter 1.abs.1 Horatius was acquitted of the crime when he appealed to the public. The brutal nature of the killing influenced King Tullus to convict him; however, the motive for which Horatius did it influenced the people. In a battle defending Rome Horatius defeated the Curiatius brothers and killed them. His sister was in love with one of these brothers and planned on marrying him. She wept over him, hearing of his death. Horatius murdered her then because of her premature love affair with the enemy. The people of Rome felt this was harsh punishment rather than an actual crime of the Roman Republic. Horatius received glory for not only killing the Curiatius brothers, the enemy, but for killing his sister. In this case the Roman people were acting as a strict guardian of chastity.Walker, p. 266 Another case Valerius records is where the Roman people were acting as an unfair, lax judge. In this case Servius Sulpicius Galba was being harshly denounced at the rostra by Lucius Scribonius Libo, tribune of the plebs in 149 BCE.Walker, p. 266 Cato the Elder supported the tribune's charges in a grand speech at a Roman assembly as is recorded in his Origins.Walker, p. 266 Galba had committed an atrocious war crime against the Lusitanians. He had made a peace agreement with the Lusitanians, but then massacred 8,000 of them while he was governor of Spain in 150 BCE.Walker, p. 266 Galba, being a great speaker in his own right, had no real defense for his crimes. Through bribery and bringing forth his children and the orphan child of a relative before the public in a speech for mercy, he procured his acquittal.Walker, p. 266 Another case where Valerius records ancient history crimes is about Gaius Cosconius, praetor in 89 BCE and governor of Illyria from 78 to 76 BCE.Walker, p. 268 He was accused of misgovernment under the Servilian Law passed in 101 BCE.Walker, p. 268 There was no doubt that he was guilty; however, he recited a poem about his accuser, Valerius Valentinus, and got an acquittal.Walker, p. 268 The poem was about how Valerius seduced a young man in a striped toga and a young freeborn woman. Valerius was then convicted by the acquittal of Cosconius.Walker, p. 268 Outrageous behavior Valerius reports in Book 9 Chapter 5 under Foreign Stories that Alexander the Great had three stages of arrogance.Book 9 Chapter 5.ext.1 One was that he looked down on his father Philip II of Macedon and claimed that Jupiter Hammon was his real father. Another was that he took up the ways of the Persian people by dressing and behaving their way. Still another was that Alexander believed himself to be a god, not a human being. Valerius writes another foreign story here of Xerxes I of Persia.Book 9 Chapter 5.ext.2 To show his outrageous behavior and arrogance, he tells how Xerxes summoned all the leaders of Asia together. Just as he was about to declare war on Greece, he tells them, I did not want people to think that I was acting on my own initiative, so I brought you together here. But remember that it is your duty to obey me rather than persuade me. Valerius reports that in the invasion, Xerxes suffered such a defeat that one would wonder if his words were just arrogance or stupidity. Valerius writes on still another foreign story of Hannibal and how arrogant he was after his success at the Battle of Cannae.Book 9 Chapter 5.ext.3 He tells how Hannibal had delusions of grandeur and would not then receive any of his fellow citizens directly. He would only communicate through a go-between. He even insulted his cavalry commander Maharbal, who had said in front of his tent in a loud voice that he had planned things so that Hannibal would be dining on the Capitol in Rome within a few days.

The Common Austro-Hungarian Army (Gemeinsame Armee) and the Austro-Hungarian Navy (K.u.k. Kriegsmarine) were institutions shared by the constituent parts of the dual monarchy, although both Austria and Hungary possessed their own defence ministries charged with the internal administration of the homeland troops (i.e. K.k. Landwehr and Magyar Kir√°lyi Honv√©ds√©g), known as the K.k. Ministerium f√ºr Landesverteidigung and K.u. Honv√©dministerium respectively. Ministers  According to the Delegation Law of 21 December 1867, the Minister of War, together with the Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Imperial and Royal House and of the Exterior formed the Council of Ministers for Common Affairs under the direction of the Foreign Minister. The three Imperial and Royal ministers were appointed and relieved from office by the Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary himself. Until 1911, the ministers were called Reich Ministers of War. Upon the accession of Moritz von Auffenberg, following Hungarian wishes not to be summarized under an Austrian realm that did not consist of the Hungarian lands at that time, the ministers were called Imperial and Royal (k.u.k.) Ministers of War. List: The influence of the Austro-Hungarian War Minister was limited, due to the rivalry between the Austrian Minister-President and the Prime Minister of Hungary. Moreover, it was the Emperor who acted as commander-in-chief of the Imperial and Royal Armed Might, served by his personal military chancellery and represented by an Inspector General, since 1869 Field Marshal Archduke Albert of Austria- Teschen. His successor General of the Cavalry and Admiral Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Este in 1906 achieved the dismissal of Minister Pitreich and 76-year-old Chief of the General Staff Friedrich von Beck-Rzikowsky, who was replaced by Franz Ferdinand's confidant Field Marshal Lieutenant Franz Conrad von H√∂tzendorf. Dismissed in 1911 but again appointed together with Minister Alexander von Krobatin during the 1912 Balkan Wars, Conrad acted autonomously, being directly responsible to the emperor. In the 1914 July Crisis upon the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, he and Krobatin declared the Austro-Hungarian armed forces 'prepared for war'. On 30 October 1918, Emperor Charles I of Austria assigned the Naval command to the newly established Yugoslavian State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. After the Kingdom of Hungary left the real union with Austria the next day, the last Austro-Hungarian minister St√∂ger-Steiner had to supervise the liquidation of the remaining Cisleithanian troops. Upon the resignation of Emperor Charles on 12 November, he was answerable to an Army state secretary of the republican German Austrian government under Chancellor Karl Renner. The 'War Ministry in Liquidation' was renamed 'Military Liquidation Agency' in 1920, when the Austrian Federal Ministry of the Army was established. It was not dissolved until 1931. The War Ministry Austrian war ministry building, Am Hof (demolished in 1913) The Ministry initially was located at the historical seat of the Hofkriegsrat, the Court Council of War serving the Habsburg monarchs on Am Hof square in the central Innere Stadt borough of Vienna. After the Council's dissolution in the 1848 Revolution, the building had housed the War Ministry of the Austrian Empire; Minister Theodor Franz Baillet von Latour was lynched in front of it during the October Uprising. From 1909 to 1913, the imposing Neoclassical Imperial and Royal War Ministry headquarters on Ringstra√üe boulevard, the department's final home, was erected according to plans designed by architect Ludwig Baumann, who had also built the Oriental Academy, the current US embassy. Dedicated on 1 May 1913 during the reign of Emperor Francis Joseph I and Minister Krobatin's tenure, it can still be seen in Vienna today; it is officially called Government Building (Regierungsgeb√§ude) and is used as seat of the Minister for Economy, the Minister for Social Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture and Environment. In front of the ministry building Am Hof as well as, since 1913, of the existing building stands the equestrian monument of Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky, the most venerated military leader of the Austrian monarchy, designed by Kaspar von Zumbusch. The Navy Section of the ministry (k.u.k. Marinesektion) had its own building at Vordere Zollamtsstrasse, corner of Marxergasse, behind the headquarters and is still existing, too. At the outside of this building the coats of arms of 16 Imperial and Royal ports on the Adriatic Coast are displayed.

Unlike most other installments in the series, this was not released in Japan. Gameplay Sega Rally 3 contains three racing modes: World Championship, Quick Race and Classic. World Championship mode is a single player game which takes place across three stages (Tropical, Canyon and Alpine) and largely follows the format of the previous Sega Rally arcade games. The game is a 22 car race played to a time limit, and the player's starting position for one race is determined by their finishing position in the previous race. Unlike the previous games in the series, each race contains two laps. If the player finishes the third stage in first place, they are able to play a head to head race on the bonus Lakeside track. Quick Race is a single or multiplayer mode, in which six cars (containing any mixture of human and AI players) race three laps on any of the three World Championship courses. In World Championship and Quick Race modes, players can choose from one of six licensed cars from Citro√´n C4 WRC, Ford Focus RS WRC 07, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X, Peugeot 207 S2000, Subaru Impreza WRC 08 and Suzuki SX4 WRC. Additionally, in Quick Race players can choose two secret cars: the Bowler Nemesis and the McRae Enduro. Classic mode is a single or multiplayer mode which takes place on the Desert '95 track, recreated from the original Sega Rally arcade game. In single player, the mode is a head to head race against a single AI opponent, while multiplayer allows for up to six human players with no AI opponents. The sixth generation Toyota Celica GT-Four and Lancia Delta HF Integrale cars from the original Sega Rally can be used in this mode exclusively. Development The game was developed simultaneously with Sega Rally Revo. During development, it went under the codename of 'Super Challenge'. The game runs at 60 frame/s at a 720p resolution as opposed to the 30 frames per second of its console counterpart due to the power of the new Sega Europa-R arcade hardware. Sega Rally 3 was released in 2011 on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network as Sega Rally Online Arcade, it is essentially the same title, except with a few extras including the original Sega Rally 1995 Desert track. The game has been delisted for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in 2012 for unexplained reasons. Cabinet Sega Rally 3 is available in four different cabinet configurations: a large single player deluxe cabinet with motion simulation system, a large single player deluxe non-motion cabinet, a smaller twin non-motion cabinet and finally a single player non-motion cabinet (for the US market only). The game is also available in a conversion kit, which changes an existing game to Sega Rally 3. The deluxe motion cabinet includes a 62\\" High Definition DLP monitor and a dual actuator motion simulation system which moves the players seat in direct response to the on screen action. Up to six cabinets can be linked for multiplayer racing. In November 2010, Sega Amusements USA had Sega Rally 3 kit setup at their booth for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Expo. The kit was designed for old Atari, Midway or Raw Thrills cabinets and offers an optional 27\\" open frame LCD monitor as a part of the package.http://arcadeheroes.com/2010/11/19/iaapa-2010-sega/ IAAPA 2010 - Sega (Arcade Heroes) References External links *Sega Rally 3 hands on impression Category:2008 video games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Rally racing video games Category:Arcade games Category:Sega arcade games Category:Video game sequels Category:Off-road racing video games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Sega Rally 3"},{"id":"17722415","text":"Claude Russell (1732-1820) was a high ranking British administrator in the Bengal civil service in India.

For the first time in history a Cultural Universiade was also included, with many festivals and shows held simultaneously with the sporting events. The Universiade was organized by the International University Sports Federation (FISU) and by the authorities of the Republic of Tatarstan. Bidding process Kazan had bid twice for the Universiade; the first attempt was for the 2011 Summer Universiade, but Kazan lost to Shenzhen by just two votes. The city applied again for the 2013 Summer Universiade, and won the right to host the Universiade. The games Park of the Cultural Universiade Transportation Prior to the Universiade, Kazan International Airport was totally rebuilt as a hub, the new Kazan-2 transit rail-bus terminal was built, the old Kazan-1 rail terminal was rebuilt, and the fast rail aeroexpress with Siemens trains was inaugurated between the Kazan-1 rail terminal downtown and the airport. Zones of activity of the Universiade were connected by renewed highways with two-level flyovers, including the completed \\"Big Kazan Ring\\" with a new LRT (fast tram). In addition, a Kremlin bridge over the Kazanka River was rebuilt. The key transportation connector to the sporting and other venues from the Universiade Village was the Kazan Metro (subway) that had been built in 2005 and was expanded before the Universiade. A large part of design works was carried out by JSC Institute Tatdorproject (autoroads, pedestrian crosses, transport junctions), Roszheldorproject (arrangement of intermodal transportation), Energoprojekt (reconstruction of Kazan International Airport), etc. The Cultural Universiade was held in the Cultural Park at Palace Square downtown near the Kazan Kremlin, at various theatres and performance venues in the Kremlin, and at other places throughout the city. Venues A total of 27 new stadia were built as venues for the event. The Games used 64 venues in all, 36 of which were constructed specifically for the 2013 Summer Universiade. The 64 venues were concentrated in 4 zones across the city of Kazan. These included the area of Pobeda Avenue with the Kazan Area, the Aquatics Palace of Water Sports, the Combat Sports (Boxing) Palace, and the area of Orenburgsky Trakt where the Universiade Village was located, as well as the Tennis Academy and Gymnastics Palace. In addition, many sports venues for training functions were located elsewhere in Zarechye (Novo- Savinovsky and Airbuilders districts), and some of them in downtown Kazan.

Nearly 400 sporting and cultural events have been staged on the campus since it opened its doors in 2010. Shortly after the first move-in phase, an open-air step aerobics marathon was held that brought together up to 1,000 Universiade Village residents. The campus had already hosted football, volleyball, and chess championships that can rightfully be called ‚Äòinternational‚Äô as a number of international students competed in them. Torch relay The length of the relay was about 104,000 kilometers, and 2,013 torchbearers were enlisted to participate in the relay. After touring through 51 cities on five continents, the torch arrived in Vladivostok on 24 January, and on 25 January, the Russian leg of the Universiade torch relay began.

This is more than any other nation in this games and in the history of Universiades. The media explained this by the fact that the Russian team featured nineteen reigning Olympic champions, who were listed as students, more than all other teams taken together, in an apparent attempt to make a good impression in Russian language media. There were 67 Universiade records, 38 of them set by Russian athletes. On 19 July 2013, Vladimir Putin congratulated Russian athletes, and responded to criticism by saying that all critics of Russia‚Äôs achievements should take Viagra. Schedule The competition schedule at stops The competition schedule for the 2013 Summer Universiade is shown as follows: Marketing Logo, emblem and mascot Universiade logo and mascot on street graffiti Every Universiade logo must contain the Latin letter \\"U\\", designating a sporting event held under the auspices of the International University Sports Federation (FISU). The logo of the 2013 Summer Universiade represents a vertical rectangular design that comprises the words \\"Universiade\\", \\"Kazan\\", \\"Russia\\", \\"2013\\" and the five stars of the International University Sports Federation (FISU). The emblem of the 2013 Summer Universiade takes its origin from an image of a tulip, a common element of Tatar ornaments that symbolizes revival. Uni, a kitten rendering of the symbolic winged snow leopard, was chosen as the mascot for the Kazan 2013 Summer Universiade. The winged snow leopard is the national symbol of the Republic of Tatarstan. A stylized version of this creature is represented on Tatarstan‚Äôs coat of arms. Slogan Each Universiade host city chooses a slogan for their edition of the Games, according to their ideals and goals, and as approved by FISU. The slogan of the Kazan 2013 Summer Universiade was ‚ÄòU are the world‚Äô, which has two meanings: ‚ÄòYou are the world‚Äô and ‚ÄòUniversiade is the World‚Äô. Partners The League of Partners was founded in November 2010 to ensure a multilateral partnership between business circles and the Kazan 2013 Organizing Committee. The League includes the companies that signed partnership agreements with the Executive Committee of the 27th World University Summer Games. The main mission of the League of Partners is to enlist the support of corporations through a partnership contract with the Kazan 2013 Executive Committee, and also to consolidate all efforts under the unified vision of the Universiade. To achieve that, the partner companies were to implement joint projects aimed at further developing specialized industries that will be part of the Kazan 2013 legacy. * General partners: Hyundai, MegaFon, local AK BARS Bank * Official partners: Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Sogaz, Aeroflot, Tissot * Partners: PWC, English First, Panasonic * Official suppliers: Danone, Ecolab, Forward, Planet Fitness, ROSTEK-TRANS Logistika, Kaspersky Lab, Technogym, MadWave, Sportmaster Group, Wilson Tickets Tickets price ran between 700 and 6000 Russian rubles for the opening and closing ceremonies, and 30 to 200 RR for sporting events.

It protects rare plant and animal species adapted to the unique conditions of a karst landscape. History The Cedars Natural Area Preserve began as a procurement by The Nature Conservancy in 1996. The following year, the land was transferred to the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation to be managed as a Natural Area Preserve. Additional lands were added to the preserve in the ensuing years. In 2015, a state grant provided $317,711 to expand the preserve through purchase of an additional , including of frontage along the Powell River. Description The Cedars Natural Area Preserve is located in Lee County near the Powell River, within a region of karst landscape that is known as \\"The Cedars\\". The limestone bedrock in such karst regions is easily eroded, leading to thin soils, sinkholes, caves, and losing streams. The preserve's glades and woodlands comprise a rocky and rugged landscape that serves as a haven for numerous rare plants adapted to the habitat. The preserve also protects habitat for the loggerhead shrike, a rare bird within Virginia. Regionally rare plants found within the preserve include: *Wild hyacinth (Camassia scilloides) *Crawe's sedge (Carex crawei) *Mullien Foxglove (Dasistoma macrophylla) *Ringed panic grass (Dichanthelium annulum) *Flattened spikerush (Eleocharis compressa var. compressa) *Northern rattlesnake-master (Eryngium yuccifolium var. yuccifolium) *Pink thoroughwort (Fleischmannia incarnata) *Canada bluets (Houstonia canadensis) *Rattlesnake-master (Manfreda virginica) *Pitcher's stitchwort (Minuartia patula) *Yarrow-leaved ragwort (Packera millefolium) *White blue-eyed grass (Sisyrinchium albidum) *Tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus var. compositus) *Ozark dropseed (Sporobolus ozarkanus) *Running glade clover (Trifolium calcaricum) Public access The preserve is owned and maintained by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation. It does not include improvements for public access, and visitors must make arrangements with a state-employed land steward prior to visiting.

He was Secretary of State for both the Northern and the Southern Departments during the reign of William III. Early life Vernon was a younger son of Francis Vernon of London (a scion of the Vernons of Haslington, Cheshire, and Hanbury, Worcestershire), and his wife, Anne Welby, widow, daughter of George Smithes, a London goldsmith. Like his elder brother Francis, he was an alumnus of Charterhouse School, and matriculated at Christ Church on 19 July 1662, aged 16. He graduated BA in 1666, and proceeded MA in 1669. He married, by licence dated 6 April 1675, Mary Buck, daughter of Sir John Buck, 1st Baronet, of Hamby Grange, Lincolnshire. In 1676 he was incorporated at St John's College, Cambridge. Rise to prominence Vernon was employed by Sir Joseph Williamson to collect news in Holland in March 1672, and in the following June attended Lord Halifax on his mission to Louis XIV. On his return he became secretary to the Duke of Monmouth. He is said to have removed the words 'natural son' from the patent conferring the command- in-chief upon the duke in 1674 but left his service in 1678. He was returned at the general election of March 1679 as Member of Parliament for Cambridge University. He then entered the secretary of state's office as clerk and gazetteer, i.e. editor of the London Gazette. These duties he exchanged on the revolution for the post of private secretary to Lord Shrewsbury. On Shrewsbury's resignation, Vernon served in the same capacity Sir John Trenchard, by whom he was employed in Flanders in the summer of 1692 to furnish reports of the movements of the army to Sir William Dutton Colt, British minister at Celle. In 1693 he was appointed to a commissionership of prizes, which he held until 1705. At the 1695 English general election, Vernon was returned to parliament as MP for Penryn, Cornwall. On Shrewsbury's return to power (March 1693-4) Vernon resumed in name his former relations with him. Shrewsbury's ill-health, however, and the course of events soon thrust Vernon into prominence, and during the king's absences on the continent he acted as secretary to the lords justices. On him fell the main burden of investigating the assassination plot, and of hushing up the charges brought by Sir John Fenwick (1645‚Äì1697) against Godolphin, Shrewsbury, Marlborough, and Russell. In support of the bill for Fenwick's attainder he made on 25 November 1696 the only important speech which he is recorded to have delivered throughout his parliamentary career. The dexterity which he displayed in this affair, and Shrewsbury's virtual retirement, enhanced his consequence, and at Sunderland's suggestion he received the seals on the resignation of Sir William Trumbull, and was sworn of the privy council (5 December 1697). Though he did not formally succeed to Shrewsbury's department on his resignation, 12 December 1698, he was thenceforth virtually secretary for both departments until the delivery of the southern seals to the Earl of Jersey, 14 May 1699. At the 1698 English general election, he was returned as MP for Westminster. Secretary of State By the king Vernon was treated rather as a clerk than as a minister. He was hardly more than cognisant of the negotiations for the peace of Ryswick, and of the partition treaty he knew nothing until the draft was placed in his hands for transmission to Lord Somers. He went down to Tunbridge Wells with a mind made up against the treaty, and, though he drafted the blank commission and transmitted it to Holland, he fully approved, if he did not inspire, the letter with which Somers accompanied it (28 August 1698). When the treaty was signed he drafted the necessary forms of ratification and procured their authentication by Somers under the great seal. With Somers alone of the ministers in England, he shared the secret of the separate articles. When the treaty came before the notice of parliament, Portland, who bore the first brunt of the attack, sought to share his responsibility with Vernon, whom he represented as cognisant of and concurring in the negotiation from the outset. Vernon cleared himself from this charge by producing with the king's leave the relevant correspondence, and, though no less responsible than Somers for the course taken at Tunbridge Wells, he was omitted from the articles of impeachment and was continued in office. He was, in fact, sole secretary during the interval, 2 May ‚Äì 5 November 1700, between Jersey's resignation and the appointment of Sir Charles Hedges, and retained the seals when Hedges gave place to the Duke of Manchester on 1 January 1701‚Äì2. Dismissal and later career A staunch Whig, Vernon viewed with undisguised alarm the death of the Duke of Gloucester on 30 July 1700, and proposed that the king should again marry and the succession be settled, in default of issue, in the Hanoverian line, thus passing over Anne. This proposition rendered him so odious to the Tories that, soon after the accession of Anne, he was dismissed and replaced by the Earl of Nottingham. He was re-elected MP for Westminster in the two general elections of 1701. He did not stand at the 1702 English general election. By way of pension, he was provided on 29 June 1702, with the sinecure office of Teller of the Receipt of the Exchequer. He was again returned as MP for Penryn at the 1705 English general election and then at the 1708 British general election. He lost his tellership in September 1710 on the decisive victory of the Tories, but was subsequently rewarded with a bounty of ¬£700 and an annual pension of ¬£600. He did not stand at the 1710 British general election. He was one of the commissioners to whom, on 28 August 1716, the Privy Seal was entrusted during Sunderland's absence on the continent, but held no other office during the reign of George I. Later life and legacy Vernon's wife Mary died on 12 October 1715, and he married as his second wife Arethusa Boyle, daughter of Charles Boyle, Lord Clifford. His last days were spent in retirement at Watford, Hertfordshire, where he died on 31 January 1727. His remains were interred in Watford parish church. He, and his first wife Mary, had two sons and two daughters, one of whom Mary married Michael Harrison, M.P. for Lisburn, Co. Antrim. His eldest son, James (died 1756), was ambassador to Copenhagen. His younger son, Edward Vernon (1684‚Äì1757), became an admiral, who was famous for his victory at Porto Bello. Vernon's son by his second wife Arethusa, Francis, was created Earl of Shipbrook in 1777.

Population estimates vary between 30,000 and over 60,000. Their indigenous language is also called Chuj and belongs to the Q'anjobalan branch of Mayan languages. In Guatemala, most Chuj live in the department of Huehuetenango in the municipalities of San Mateo Ixtat√°n and San Sebasti√°n Coat√°n. The Chuj, and their ancestors, are believed to have lived in the same area for 4,000 years. They first came into contact with Spanish conquistadores in the 1530s; however, they were not finally subdued by the Spanish colonial authorities until the 1680s. In the post-Colonial era, the Chuj lost much of their communal land, reducing them to extreme poverty. This resulted in a history of violent resistance to authority culminating in guerrilla activity against Guatemala's military junta in the 1980s. Ethnonym The name Chuj is an exonym first used by the Spanish. According to folk tradition, the term was coined by Tzeltal conscripts of the Spanish, for whom it meant the loose wool overgarment traditionally worn by Chuj men. The Chuj themselves use an autonym based on their town of origin, i.e. ajSan Mat√©yo (from San Mateo Ixtat√°n), ajSan Sabasty√°n (from San Sebasti√°n Coat√°n), or ajNenton (from Nent√≥n). Overview and demographics San Mateo Ixtat√°n, home of many of the Chuj The Chuj are a small grouping of Mayan people who live in Guatemala and Mexico. Following emigration to the United States in the 1980s, large numbers of the Chuj also live in Los Angeles. Most of the Chuj live in Guatemala, in the highlands of the department of Huehuetenango. Their main centres of settlement in Huehuetenango are the towns of San Mateo Ixtat√°n and San Sebasti√°n Coat√°n with some living in parts of the town of Nent√≥n. Additionally, small numbers also live in the Mexican state of Chiapas. Estimates of total numbers vary from 30,000 to over 60,000. The populations of San Mateo Ixtat√°n and San Sebasti√°n Coat√°n, both of which are almost wholly Chuj, are about 16,000 and 9,000 respectively. There are nearly 4,000 Chuj-speakers in Nent√≥n constituting about a third of the town. Because of the irregular immigrant status of the Chuj in the U.S, it is not known how many Chuj live in Los Angeles, but one estimate is that it equals the population of San Sebasti√°n Coat√°n. In Guatemala, the Chuj have a reputation for rebelliousness and antagonism to authority, the historic causes of which arise out of poverty and grievances over land distribution. History Pre-Columbian era The Chuj live in an area believed to have been the Proto-Mayan language homeland and they and their ancestors are thought to have lived there continuously since Proto-Maya began splitting into the modern Maya languages about 4,000 years ago.Maxwell, Judith. \\"Chuj.\\" Encyclopedia of World Cultures. 1996. Retrieved June 8, 2012, from Encyclopedia.com There is, immediately below the modern town of San Mateo Ixtat√°n, archaeological evidence of a Chuj urban settlement, with mounds and plazas, dating from between 600 and 900 A.D. Like other Maya, the Chuj were a settled farming people who cultivated maize and beans. As far as the Chuj's political history is concerned, it is known that they were subject to K'iche' domination in the 15th century but freed themselves from K'iche' control in the early 16th century. Spanish conquest The Spanish conquest of the Maya territories of the Guatemalan highlands began in 1524 when the conquistador Pedro de Alvarado led his army into the region. In 1529 the Chuj city of San Mateo Ixtat√°n (then known by the name of Ystapalap√°n) was given in encomienda to Gonzalo de Ovalle, a companion of Pedro de Alvarado, together with Santa Eulalia and Jacaltenango. In the 1530s, the Chuj submitted to the Spanish conquest and, in 1549, the first Chuj reduccion was established at San Mateo Ixtat√°n, overseen by Dominican missionaries.Lim√≥n Aguirre 2008, p. 10. The Chuj of San Mateo Ixtat√°n remained rebellious and resisted Spanish control for longer than their highland neighbours; their resistance was so determined that the Chuj remained pacified only while the immediate effects of the Spanish expeditions lasted.Lim√≥n Aguirre 2008, pp. 10‚Äì11. But the longer-term effect was that disease and warfare substantially reduced Chuj numbers in the 16th century. alt=A series of semi-collapsed dry-stone terraces, overgrown with short grass. On top of the uppermost of five terraces stand the crumbling, overgrown remains of two large buildings flanking the ruins of a smaller structure. In the late 17th century, the Spanish missionary Alonso de Le√≥n reported that about eighty families lived in San Mateo Ixtat√°n but that they did not pay tribute to the Spanish Crown or attend the Roman Catholic mass. He described the inhabitants as \\"quarrelsome\\" and complained that their religious practices were such that they were Christian in name only: they had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of pre-Columbian temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. Eventually, de Le√≥n was driven out of San Mateo Ixtat√°n by the Chuj.Lovell 2000, pp. 416‚Äì417. In 1684, Enrique Enriquez de Guzm√°n, the governor of Guatemala, decided on the final conquest of the region.Pons S√°ez 1997, pp. 149‚Äì150. In 1686, the Governor himself arrived in San Mateo Ixtat√°n, after sending in troops under Captain Melchor Rodr√≠guez Mazariegos, and successfully took control of the town. After recruiting Chuj warriors from the nearby villages, including 61 from San Mateo itself,Pons S√°ez 1997, pp. xxxiii, 153‚Äì154Pons S√°ez 1997, p. xxxiii. he launched an invasion of the still unconquered Lacandon region from San Mateo Ixtat√°n and completed the conquest of the area. Post-colonial era Guatemala gained its independence from Spain in 1821. In the late 19th century the Guatemalan government sanctioned the transfer of Chuj tribal land to powerful agricultural land owners. The process began in 1876, when they were forced to cede land to create the new municipality of Nenton. In the fighting that followed, the Chuj managed to maintain their communal lands in the high mountains, and this prompted their modern reputation for rebelliousness. With the loss of much of their land, and the resultant extreme poverty, many of the Chuj were forced to migrate to Guatemala's southern coast. As a people, they were reduced to becoming either peasants or migrant labourers. In the years that followed, the Chuj were involved in frequent uprisings and violent unrest caused by extreme poverty and a sense of grievance because of the loss of their lands. Political unrest and bloody reprisals against the Chuj increased after the Second World War. By the 1970s, violent confrontations with the Guatemalan police were common. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the confrontation with Guatemalan authorities became focused on the Chuj campaign to preserve their forests in the region. By the 1980s, when Guatemala was ruled by a military junta, the Chuj were involved in full-scale guerrilla activity against the Army, who regarded them as \\"internal enemies\\". During the decade, about 25% of the Chuj emigrated to the United States. Culture Chuj folk art: a Chuj woman with text in the Chuj language alluding to Maya corn culture Language The Chuj historically speak a language, also called Chuj, which is part of the Q'anjobalan branch of the Mayan languages. It is most closely related to Tojolab'al, spoken in Mexico. The Chuj now also speak Spanish and are bi-lingual. Although the Chuj language remains viable, as with other Mayan languages, children, particularly in urban centres, increasingly do not learn Chuj as a first language or, in some cases, at all. Marriage and family The Chuj traditionally have arranged marriages, although Church weddings are relatively rare because of the cost of having a priest officiate. Chuj men also practise \\"bride kidnapping\\" where a woman is effectively abducted rather than her family formally petitioned for her hand. Descent is reckoned bilaterally and each side is of equal importance. Typically, the nuclear family shares a compound with the husband's brothers and parents and economic and child care activities are shared within the compound. The extended family will own several small parcels of land, at varying distances from the town center. In San Mateo and San Sebasti√°n there is also access to communal land. Religion and beliefs Traditional Chuj beliefs, where most natural features‚Äîhills, rock outcrops, streams, and caves‚Äîhave spirits, remain strong. The spirits in caves, who are often ancestors of the townspeople, may be approached for aid and advice. Death is the transition to \\"ancestorhood.\\" Deathbed instructions are binding obligations, and spirits enforce them with sanctions of illness and misfortune. These spirits can be approached for advice and aid at family altars, cave entrances, hilltops, or, in San Mateo, at cross-sites and accesses to the Maya structures underneath the modern city. Catholicism is prevalent as well: in San Mateo it is syncretic, combining with traditional beliefs, while in San Sebasti√°n there is a sharp divide between those that hold traditional beliefs and those that follow the activist Catholicism of the Catholic Action group in the town. Dress The Chuj wear distinctive \\"trade\\" garments which vary between each of the towns. Men usually wear a wool short-sleeved tunic, lightly embroidered at the neck and arms. Women wear a cotton broadcloth overblouse elaborately embroidered in red, yellow, green, and black.

Holsingeria unthanksensis has since been found in additional cave streams in Lee County, with an additional population noted north in Skyline Caverns. Additional unusual species found within the cave include a second hydrobiid snail, the Powell Valley planarian (Sphalloplana consimilis), the Southwest Virginia cave isopod (Caecidotea recurvata), and a cave-dwelling carabid beetle. The only known entrance to the cave was purchased by The Nature Conservancy in 1987, and was the first cave system purchased in Virginia by the organization.

Otago Dancers practice for a performance at the Bledisloe Cup. The Forsyth Barr Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Dunedin, New Zealand. At various stages of development it was also known as Dunedin Stadium or Awatea Street Stadium, or its non-commercial official name during the 2011 Rugby World Cup and 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup, Otago Stadium. It is also known colloquially as 'the glasshouse' due to its resemblance to a horticultural hothouse. The stadium was opened by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key on 5 August 2011, replacing Carisbrook as the home stadium of the Highlanders team in Super Rugby and the Otago Rugby Football Union team in the domestic Mitre 10 Cup. The stadium hosted four matches of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and has hosted major music tours, starting in November 2011 with Elton John.  Location  The stadium is located in Dunedin North, close to the outflow of the Water of Leith into Otago Harbour (and directly over the outflow of Opoho Stream). Its site is close to several other major sports venues. Logan Park lies immediately to the north, and the University Oval and the Caledonian Ground are also nearby to the north of the stadium. Also to the north of the stadium is Logan Point quarry, at the foot of Signal Hill. To the west, the stadium's near neighbours include Otago Polytechnic and the University of Otago College of Education. The main campus of the University of Otago lies one kilometre to the west. The stadium's construction required the shifting of New Zealand State Highway 88, the main road between the CBD to the West Harbour Suburbs and the port facilities, which prior to stadium construction followed Anzac Avenue as part of its route, turning northeast at Logan Park before following the harbour's edge past Ravensbourne. The highway was diverted onto a new stretch of road alongside the railway line, 200 metres east of Anzac Avenue. Several roads located close to the mouth of the Leith were either covered over by the new construction (Leander Street and Awatea Street) or had their routes considerably altered (Magnet Street and Parry Street). A new street, Neptune Street, was built to link remaining stretches of Magnet and Parry Streets, and connects with SH88 at a newly built roundabout immediately to the east of the stadium.  Design  The stadium was designed by Populous and Jasmax in a joint venture, and is the world's first fully enclosed grassed (though strengthened by synthetic grass fibres from Desso GrassMaster) stadium since the original grass field of the Astrodome in Houston was replaced in 1966 with what would be known as AstroTurf. The stadium roof was constructed with a clear ETFE roof supplied and installed by the firm Vector Foiltec, the same material as used at Allianz Arena in Munich and the Water Cube in Beijing. The stadium was designed as a versatile venue, and is expected to be able to host a range of events including sports (rugby union, rugby league, football, basketball, netball), concerts, trade fairs and other large-scale events. The use of relocatable seating allows for flexibility to suit a range of event requirements. Due to size constraints, some sports (such as cricket, a popular sport in New Zealand) are unable to use the stadium. It has a maximum seated capacity of 30,748 in a full sports mode, and capacity in excess of 36,000 for concerts. There are permanent stands in the South and North with removable seating in East and West Stand areas. The West Stand Area, officially called the Mitre 10 Mega Stand, is also known as the Zoo and is popular with the student population.\\"Dunedin's 'Zoo' proving popular with students,\\" Newshub. 23 May 2012. Retrieved 30 April 2018.  Roof  Internal roof height at centre line: 37 metres Highest observed rugby kick 29.4m External roof height 47 metres (equivalent to a 12-storey building) Football goal posts: 16 metres The roof is covered with 20,500m2 of ETFE (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) transparent roofing material (also used in the Eden Project, England and the Beijing Cube, China). This roof should have been angled to face north to optimise sun in Southern Hemisphere winter, however it was constructed facing a north-east direction. Rainwater is collected from the 20,500m2 roof surface and recycled to irrigate the pitch. The roof, supported by 5 steel trusses each spanning 105 metres, is capable of supporting the weight of a car. The main truss (South Stand) is 130 metres long and weighs 390 tonnes. It can be retracted as needed.  Turf  Real grass is strengthened by synthetic grass fibres injected deep into the soil. This increases the hard-wearing capability, allowing 3 times the use of natural grass field. The turf is serviced by 2.5 km of drainage, 15 km of irrigation and 40 automated sprinkler heads. It consists of three different types of seed, 3200m3 of sand, soil and compost in three different layers. Due to the perceived high cost of maintaining the turf, proposals have been made to replace the grass/artificial turf with a 100% artificial turf, which would limit the attractiveness of the venue for high earning events like rugby test matches (for which the stadium was initially proposed to replace Carisbrook).  Construction  Hawkins Construction began work on the site during May 2009. It was completed in August 2011. During construction, 609 piles were driven to support stadium structure, and 1840m3 concrete poured in North and South stand seating areas. Construction work produced 22,000m3 of excavated fill ‚Äì much from buildings demolished to make way for the stadium. Over 3,200 tonnes of structural steel and 2,000 tonnes of reinforced steel were used. The stadium contains 318 toilets and 260 metres of urinals. It houses 12 food and beverage stalls. The grounds are lighted by 220 two-kilowatt sports lights. At least 600 people were employed in new jobs created by the stadium's construction and fit out. Changes to State Highway 88 proposed prior to the stadium proposal were amended to accommodate the proposed new structure. Construction of the revamped highway was completed in mid-2011.  Opposition  The Forsyth Barr Stadium project was met with significant opposition within Dunedin, with objections focusing largely on the expected cost of a stadium that may find limited use. After prolonged deliberation, the Dunedin City Council on 17 March 2008 voted 12‚Äì2 in favour of proceeding with the project. A telephone survey of 2,200 residents run by the Dunedin City Council in early 2007 showed 51.9% thought the council should pay for the project, and larger mail-out surveys by the city and Otago Regional council showed around 40%. A November 2008 survey organised by Stop the Stadium showed 73.3% of respondents did not support public funding. Two legal proceedings were taken separately against the Dunedin City Council and Otago Regional Council, attempting to stop funding the stadium with public money. The Otago Regional Council won the case against it in the Dunedin High Court, and the Dunedin City Council won both the High Court proceedings, and subsequent Court of Appeal hearing. Within a year of opening, stadium critics claimed evidence was published that supported the objections to the stadium being built; sources include the Dunedin City Council, some of its councillors, and associated sporting bodies.  Funding  Originally the total cost of the stadium including land purchases was projected to be NZ $198.3 million. The following contributors make up the original total funding of the project: * Otago Regional Council $37.5 million * Community Trust of Otago $7.0 million * University of Otago $10.0 million * Government $15.0 million * Dunedin City Council $98.5 million The non-forensic audit of total cost to construct found the original budget was exceeded, and that Papers for Council were unnecessarily complicated - final disclosed stadium costs were $206.4m plus $18m interest for a total cost of $224.4m The Carisbrook Stadium Trust began purchasing the required land on 31 July 2008, with remaining settlements on 31 October 2008. The final cost of the land was $32.5 million, significantly above the original budget of $20 million, but the trust expected to make some money back from the sale of surplus land and materials from the demolition.  Sport  Rugby union Forsyth Barr Stadium replaced Carisbrook as the home stadium of the Highlanders team in Super Rugby in late 2011, with the stadium in use from the beginning of the 2012 Super Rugby season. The first Super Rugby match played at the stadium, on 3 March 2012, resulted in a narrow win for the Highlanders over local derby rivals the Crusaders. The stadium also became the new home of the Otago Rugby Football Union team in the domestic ITM Cup, since renamed the Mitre 10 Cup. The stadium hosted four matches of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, three of them featuring England, with the first being played on 10 September 2011 against Argentina2011 Rugby World Cup.

The squadron is a descendant organization of the Kansas National Guard 127th Observation Squadron, established on 30 July 1940. It is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. Overview The mission of the 127 CACS was to provide communication support to the U.S. Government at all levels, including United States Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency, state, and local agencies. These agencies are provided redundant communities during Peace Time, Natural Disasters and National Emergencies. Equipment utilized in support of the mission is flexible and state of the art, enabling the 127th to provide services in a full spectrum of situations.AF FOIA Request 2009-02224-F, 30 July 2009 History Established by the National Guard Bureau on 30 July 1940 as the 127th Observation Squadron, and activated in August 1941. Initially the squadron had 115 men in its ranks. It was, however, still short of officers since it only had nine officers but was authorized a total of thirty-one. Moved to Sherman Field at Fort Leavenworth, by November 1941 the squadron had one BE-1, one O-47A, one O-38E and several L-1's. All of the aircraft were single engine observation/liaison planes. World War II The 127th was ordered to federal service on 6 October 1941, became a training unit for observation and liaison pilots. According to the original plans, the squadron was to be based at Brownwood Army Airfield, Texas until the \\"emergency\\" was over and it could return to its home base at Wichita. The 7 December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor changed all plans for American military units. A number of 127th personnel were off the base that Sunday (7 December) and returned to find it almost impossible to get back on base. Was moved to Tullahoma Army Air Base, Tullahoma, Tennessee. Tullahoma Army Air Base was situated in close proximity to Camp Forrest, Tennessee, the site of a major infantry center. Trained on missions cooperating with the 33d and 80th Infantry divisions, both of which were stationed in the vicinity. At the same time the 124th Observation Squadron from the Iowa National Guard was stationed at Tullahoma. Beginning in 1942, the squadron was assigned to the 75th Observation Group (headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama) for its higher headquarters. The squadron left Tullahoma on 5 September 1942, for Barksdale Army Airfield, Shreveport, Louisiana to participate in the largest war games ever staged by the United States Army. During the Louisiana Maneuvers the 127th worked in close cooperation with their higher headquarters, the 75th Observation Group. On 19 August 1943, the 127th was reassigned to the First Air Support Command (headquarters at Morris Field, Charlotte, North Carolina). This command would soon become the First Tactical Air Division. Beginning in April 1944 the squadron received indications that it would not remain a training organization much longer. on 10 November 1944, three years after mobilization, the squadron left the United States for the Pacific Theater. Docked at Bombay, India on 10 December 1944 being assigned to the Tenth Air Force in the China Burma India Theater. Squadron pilots were constantly involved in duties supporting the British Army. Their missions included such activities as photographic and reconnaissance duties, evacuation of wounded, supply drops, courier duties, and cargo flights. They were entrusted with secret messages, regular mail and with transporting fresh blood to the front. Their operations were directed from the Tactical Air Command headquarters of the Fifteenth Corps of the British Army (their actual higher headquarters in this period was the Second Air Commando Group, United States Army Air Corps). The 127th Liaison Squadron (Commando) cooperated with the British Army from the beginning of the Burma offensive in February until the latter part of April 1945. Through this campaign, every pilot that participated (with one exception) flew sufficient hours and missions to entitle him to an Air Medal with one Oak Leaf Cluster, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and most of the pilots were eligible for a second Oak Leaf Cluster to the Air Medal. After the end of the war, was moved to Okinawa where the unit was inactivated. Kansas Air National Guard 127th Fighter Squadron F-51D 44-13646, about 1947 The wartime 127th Liaison Squadron was re-designated as the 127th Fighter Squadron and was allotted to the Kansas Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Wichita Army Airfield, and was extended federal recognition on 7 September 1946 by the National Guard Bureau. The 127th Fighter Squadron was bestowed the history, honors, and colors of the 127th Liaison Squadron. The squadron was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and was assigned to the Missouri ANG 131st Fighter Group for administration, however it was placed under the Kansas Military Department for operational control. The F-51 was flown until December 1949, when the unit received the F-84C Thunderjet fighter. =Korean War activation= The 127th was federalized on 10 October 1950 due to the Korean War. It was assigned to the federalized Oklahoma ANG 137th Fighter-Bomber Wing and equipped with F-84G Thunderjets. Along with the Oklahoma ANG 125th Fighter Squadron and Georgia ANG 128th Fighter Squadron, the wing was scheduled for deployment to the new Chaumont-Semoutiers AB, France, as part of the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). by 27 November, the wing assembled at Alexandria Municipal Airport, Louisiana for conversion training in the newer F-84Gs. Deployment of the wing was delayed, however, by the need to transfer pilots to Korea from training and delays in receiving engines for the F-84Gs, as well as the ongoing construction at Chaumont AB. Training and delays continued throughout 1951. Due to these delays, many of the activated National Guard airmen were released from active duty and never deployed to France. With mostly regular Air Force personnel and all the delays behind them, the remaining Guardsmen departed Louisiana on 5 May 1952 for Europe, however, the 128th inherited a base that was little more than acres of mud where wheat fields used to be. The only hardened facilities at Chaumont was a concrete runway and a handful of tarpaper shacks. The 127th wound up being stationed by USAFE at Neubiberg Air Base, West Germany until the facilities in France were suitable for military use. The aircraft arrived at Chaumont on 25 June, being the first USAF tactical air fighters to be based permanently in France, albeit working mostly in tents and temporary wooden buildings on their new base. The Guardsmen of the 127th ended their active-duty tour in France and returned to the United States in late June, leaving their F-84 Thunderjets in Europe. =Cold War= 127th TFS F-100C 4-ship formation, about 1961 Upon the squadrons return to Wichita, the 127th Fighter-Bomber squadron was again assigned F-51D aircraft due to the shortage of jets created by the Korean War. In June 1954, F-80C Shooting Star jet fighters were assigned, followed by designation of the unit to the 127th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, and assignment of the F-86L Sabre all-weather interceptor in January 1958 being used in an air defense mission for Air Defense Command. The unit converted to the F-100C Super Sabre, and was designated the 127th Tactical Fighter Squadron in April 1961, being assigned to Tactical Air Command. On 1 October 1962, the 127th was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 184th Tactical Fighter Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 127th TFS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 184th Headquarters, 184th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 184th Combat Support Squadron, and the 184th USAF Dispensary.

The unit was assigned as part of the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing until release from active duty and return to state control in June 1969. On 25 March 1971, the 184th was designated the 184th Tactical Fighter Training Group and acquired the F-105 Thunderchief aircraft, receiving Vietnam War returning aircraft. As the USAF Combat Crew Training School, the unit conducted pilot training in the F-105 for nine years. On 1 October 1973, the 184th assumed the responsibility of operating and maintaining the Smoky Hill Weapons Range at Salina, Kansas. With over 36,000 acres, Smoky Hill is the Air National Guard's largest weapons range. On 7 August 1979, the unit received its first F-4D Phantom II, and on 8 October 1979, was designated as the 184th Tactical Fighter Group, equipped with 50 F-4D's. In April 1982, the 184th was tasked to develop a F-4D Fighter Weapons Instructor Course to meet the needs of the Air Reserve Forces and the USAF Tactical Air Command. In January 1987, the 184th was tasked to activate a squadron of F-16A/B Fighting Falcon aircraft, and conduct conversion and upgrade training in the F-16. On 8 July 1987, the 161st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron was established as the third flying squadron at the 184th TFG. Formal activation ceremonies for the 161st occurred on 12 September 1987, with the unit flying 10 F-16s and conducting its first student training class. In August 1988, the 127th Tactical Fighter Squadron graduated its final Fighter Weapons Instructor Course Class. The 127th TFS converted as the second F-16 training squadron. The last F-4D departed from the 184th TFG on 31 March 1990. The 161st TFTS began converting to the F-16 C/D when the first C/D model arrived at the 184th TFG in July 1990. =Post Cold War era= In July 1993, the 184th Fighter Group changed gaining commands and became part of the new Air Education and Training Command. In July 1994, the 184th Fighter Group was designated at the 184th Bomb Wing and again became part of the Air Combat Command, flying the B-1B Lancer. The 184th was the first Air National Guard unit to fly bombers. It received its B-1Bs from the former 28th Bomb Squadron/384th Bomb Wing at McConnell. In order to save money, the USAF agreed to reduce its active fleet of B-1Bs from 92 to 60 aircraft. The first B-1B was flown to storage at AMARC on 20 August 2002. In total, 24 B-1Bs were consigned to storage at AMARC, with ten of these being retained in \\"active storage\\" which means that they could be quickly returned to service should circumstances dictate. The remaining 14 in storage at AMARC will be scavenged for spare parts to keep the remainder flying. The remaining 8 aircraft to be withdrawn from service were placed on static display at various museums. In exchange for retiring its B-1s, the 184th was redesigned the 184th Air Refueling Wing on 16 September 2002, flying the KC-135R tanker. In addition to the tanker mission, the 184th also took on several new missions within the information operations mission set. =BRAC 2005= In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign McConnell Air National Guard (ANG) Base by relocating the 184th Air Refueling Wing (ANG) nine KC-135R aircraft to the 190th Air Refueling Wing at Forbes Field AGS, which would retire its eight assigned KC-135E aircraft. The 184th Air Refueling Wing 's operations and maintenance manpower would transfer with the aircraft to Forbes. Realigning ANG KC-135R aircraft from McConnell to Forbes would replace the 190th's aging, higher maintenance KC-135E aircraft with newer models while retaining the experienced personnel from one of the highest-ranking reserve component tanker bases. In June 2007, the 190 ARW gained custody of all KC-135R aircraft from the 184th ARW. This action consolidated all of the Kansas ANG's KC-135R assets into a single wing located at Forbes Field. In April 2008, the 184th Air Refueling Wing was designated the 184th Intelligence Wing making it the first Intelligence Wing in the Air National Guard.

His seizure of power in the Pashalik of Akhaltsikh and attempts to bring all of \\"Ottoman Georgia\\" under his rule led to a fallout with the sultan's government and a war which ended in Selim's death. Selim Bey was a son and successor of Abdullah Bey, a derebey (\\"the lord of the valleys\\") of Upper Adjara, who was killed at Aketi during his raid against the neighboring Georgian principality of Guria in 1784. Selim Bey cherished an ambition to bring all of the Ottoman possessions in Georgia under his autonomous rule. In 1802, he capitalized on a crisis in Akhaltsikh and seized control of it, declaring himself a new pasha. His adversary, ≈ûerif Pa≈üa, was able to dispossess him in June 1809, but Selim staged a comeback in 1812. His staunch opposition to the central Ottoman government led him into clandestine negotiations with the Russians through Mamia V Gurieli, Prince of Guria, whose sister was married to Selim's son Abdi Bey. In 1815, the sultan ordered him be deposed and put to death for treason. As 15,000 Ottoman troops under Pehlivan ƒ∞br√¢him Pa≈üa, serasker of Erzurum, approached, Selim fled Akhaltsikhe to the mountains of Adjara and entrenched himself in the castle of Khikhani, which fell after a two-month-long siege on 31 May 1815. Selim Pa≈üa was beheaded on 3 June 1815. Selim's four sons‚ÄîAbdi (Abdullah; 1786‚Äì1859), Ahmed (1781‚Äì1836), H√ºseyin, and Dede (Dursun)‚Äîtook shelter in Guria until the Turkish punitive force left Adjara in 1818. Subsequently, they came to rule several areas in \\"Ottoman Georgia\\": Abdi Bey in Shavsheti (≈ûav≈üat), Ahmed in Upper Adjara, H√ºseyin in the Andzavi valley, and Dede in Taoskari. In today's Adjara, Selim is remembered as a hero. His native village Nigazeuli hosts his museum and the day of his memory, Selimoba, is marked annually in June.

The vast majority of Chinese silk originates from the mulberry silkworms (Bombyx mori). During the larval stage of its life-cycle, the insects feeds on the leaves of mulberry trees. Non-mulberry silkworms cocoon production in China primarily focuses on wild silk from the Chinese Tussah moth (Antheraea spp.). This moth typically feeds on trees (e.g. oaks) and its larvae spin coarser, flatter, yellower filament than the mulberry silk moths. In 2005, China accounted for 74 percent of the global raw silk production and 90 percent of the world export market.Ministry of Commerce Statistics Industrial plans Silk spinning mill, Suzhou, China Local governments have and are continuing to introduce new facilities that are expected to bring in latest high-end silk manufacturing machinery that will elevate both the quality and the quantity of the silk being produced in China. It is estimated that it will render significant revenue increases as its new facilities bring increased production and distribution capabilities. There are a number of material preferential benefits. These government incentives include such as land policy exemptions, tax breaks, project prioritization (priority in review and approval of applications), and Energy discounts (upon approval, company can receive discounts of fees related to water, electric, gas, etc.). Geography Different from the East coast of China, the silk industry has more emphasis on silk reprocessing, Western parts is more focused on raw silk production due to its natural weather and soil conditions, mostly in Chongqing and Yunnan areas. Also as the land cost and manpower cost is increasing on the east coast, business is shifting to the west. With the government's preferential policies, Chongqing's silk industry has seen some significant developments. Foreign investment Foreign investment has helped develop the silk industry.

Biography Born at Mexborough, Yorkshire, Walker was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-spin bowler. He played five matches as a 16-year-old for Yorkshire's second eleven in 1950, and one the following year, but then joined Somerset where he made his first-class debut in the match against the 1952 Indian side. Three wickets in the match earned him a contract, and in 1953 he started the season as a regular member of what was a very weak side. But in nine matches he scored just 74 runs and took only nine wickets, and was upstaged that summer by an even younger off-spin bowler, Brian Langford, who took 51 County Championship wickets, including 26 in his first three matches. Walker did not play at all in Somerset's first team in 1954, but he reappeared in mid 1955 in the match against Essex at Romford and, having batted at No 6 in the first innings, was promoted to open the second innings. He made exactly 100, putting on 152 with Peter Wight for the fourth wicket and more than doubling his previous first-class aggregate. Wisden reported that he \\"drove splendidly, hitting fifteen 4's\\". After the match, Walker was found to be suffering appendicitis. That limited his further appearances, but he failed to reach 50 in any other innings that season, though his off-spin produced a return of five for 45 against Gloucestershire at Bristol, and that, like his century, remained the best of his career. In its review of Somerset's season, Wisden said the innings at Romford \\"raised hopes of [Walker] developing into an attractive opening batsman\\". The hopes were not realised. In 1956, Walker's fellow Yorkshireman Lewis Pickles became a regular opening batsman, and though the combination of Pickles and Walker, according to Wisden, \\"promised at one stage to develop into a sound opening pair\\", Walker lost form after scoring 72 in the match against Derbyshire at Yeovil and was unable to regain his place. Though Walker played fairly regularly for Somerset's second eleven in both 1957 and 1958, he made only one further first-class appearance, scoring 4 and 0 against Yorkshire at Bath in 1958, a game that was also the last first-class appearance for Pickles, his opening partner. Walker died in a motorcycle accident at Retford on 2 September 1986.

It is one of five lighthouses located on the island of Martha's Vineyard. Early history The East Chop Light was built in 1878 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. In the early 1800s the location was occupied by a semaphore station - thus the origin of the name \\"Telegraph Hill.\\" Circa 1869 a marine merchant named Captain Silas Daggett constructed a privately owned lighthouse on the property. To pay for construction and maintenance, Daggett collected fees from local merchants, maritime insurance agencies, and ship owners who benefited from the light as an aid-to-navigation. Daggett's 1869 lighthouse was the last of the six lighthouses to be constructed on Martha's Vineyard. The oil-fired East Chop Light burned down in 1871. The light was rebuilt by Daggett in 1872 as a house with a protruding lantern room - similar in concept to the first Edgartown Harbor Light. Daggett's new East Chop Light produced a red signal and had three 21-inch reflectors fueled by kerosene lamps. In 1875, the United States Congress purchased the property for $6,000 and removed the lighthouse and other buildings constructed by Daggett. In 1878 the present day cast-iron conical tower with a fourth-order Fresnel lens was constructed along with an adjacent two-story gabled roof keeper's house. The lighthouse was originally painted white, but was repainted as a brown-red color in the 1880s. The brown- red color was maintained until 1988, when the light was painted white by Vineyard Environmental Research, Institute (VERI). Many people in the East Chop community and elsewhere still harbor fond memories of their \\"Chocolate Lighthouse.\\" In 1933 the East Chop Light was automated. At the time, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) offered to rent the Keeper's dwelling to longtime keeper, George Walter Purdy. Purdy, who had one arm, served as the East Chop Light's principal keeper for thirty-two years. Purdy refused the offer, and shortly afterwards, the keeper's dwelling, fuel oil shed, and other outbuildings were torn down. Without a keeper on the lighthouse grounds, the USCG closed the East Chop Light to public access. Saved from destruction From 1878 through the early 1980s, the East Chop Light was maintained by the United States Coast Guard. Due to U. S. Coast Guard Congressional funding shortages through the 1970s and early 1980s, various lighthouses around the United States were destroyed or designated for destruction. Such designation was due to the high cost of maintaining the structures, and because the lights no longer served as vital aids to navigation. This obsolete status of the lighthouses was facilitated by enhanced satellite GPS and other electrical maritime navigation aids. In fact, according to the 2012 \\"Doomsday List\\" published by Lighthouse Digest, there are currently 43 lighthouses in the U.S. listed for destruction in the near future. Due to such funding shortages, the East Chop Light and two other Martha's Vineyard lighthouses (Gay Head Light and Edgartown Harbor Light) were designated for destruction in the early 1980s. These three island lights were saved through federal petition and Congressional testimony of Vineyard Environmental Research, Inst, Founder/President, William Waterway Marks, and, Chair, John F. Bitzer, Jr. During and after the Congressional hearings, this effort received support from Congressman Gerry Studds, and Senator Ted Kennedy. Shortly after the Congressional hearings, the United States Coast Guard issued a 35-year license for the three lights to VERI in 1985.VERI This was the first time in U.S. history that control of \\"active\\" lighthouses was transferred to a civilian organization. On similar note, this was the first time in the history of Martha's Vineyard that control of any of its five lighthouses was in the hands of an island organization. After receiving the lighthouse license, the Institute undertook a series of fundraising activities that engaged the community of Martha's Vineyard, including local supporters and celebrities such as board members: Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr.; Jonathan Mayhew, whose ancestor's were the Vineyard's first European settlers; Vineyard Gazette co- owner, Jody Reston; philanthropist, Flipper Harris; Margaret K. Littlefield; the actress, Linda Kelsey; WHOI Director, Derek W. Spencer, and John F. Bitzer, Jr. Speakers and performers appearing at these lighthouse events were renowned historian, David McCullough; Senator Ted Kennedy; Caroline Kennedy; Edward M. Kennedy, Jr.; Congressman Gerry Studds; singer/songwriter, Carly Simon; Kate Taylor; Livingston Taylor; Hugh Taylor; Dennis Miller from Saturday Night Live; Bill Styron's wife, Rose Styron - who read one of her original lighthouse poems; United States Navy Rear Admiral, Richard A. Bauman; renowned photographer, Alfred Eisenstaedt and comedian, Steve Sweeney. The proceeds from the lighthouse benefits were applied to a major restoration of the East Chop Light. In 1988, after consultation with the United States Coast Guard and lighthouse restoration experts, VERI changed the light's exterior color from reddish brown to white ‚Äì the original color of the tower when installed in 1878. The color change from brown to white was precipitated by a VERI engineering evaluation in 1987. At the time, it was determined that the dark reddish-brown color of the cast iron exterior was causing the tower to overheat. After gaining heat during warm weather, the interior of lighthouse's cast iron would sweat from condensation, thus accelerating rust corrosion and rotting of interior wood walls on the second floor. Public access Public access to the East Chop Light was closed after its automation in 1933. For the first time in fifty-five years, Vineyard Environmental Research, Inst., opened the light to limited public access in 1988. This public access was allowed after VERI made extensive restoration and safety alterations of the light's interior and exterior, including an elevated lighting room exterior balcony guardrail. The extent of public access was determined after VERI held meetings with abutting property owners and the East Chop Association. As a result, VERI allowed public access to the light every Sunday during the summer season, and on special occasions such as weddings and fundraisers. This \\"Sunday's only\\" public access policy remains in place under the light's current management by the Martha's Vineyard Museum. Lighthouse license transfer In 1994, VERI transferred their three lighthouse licenses to the Martha's Vineyard Historical Society (MVHS), which is now known as the Martha's Vineyard Museum. At the time of the 1994 transfer, William Waterway Marks was also a member of MVHS's board, and was installed as the first Chairman of the newly formed MVHS Lighthouse Committee, where he served for four years from 1994 to 1997. MV Museum board member, Craig Dripps, followed Marks as the MV Museum's Lighthouse Committee Chair, with Marks remaining as a member of the committee for several years as an advisor. The Martha's Vineyard Museum has been caretaking the three lighthouse since 1994, although the United States Coast Guard continues to own the structures. In 2003, the MV Museum paid $25,000 for a professional assessment of all three lighthouses by Gary Gredell, who had previously worked on the restoration of forty-six lighthouses on the east coast. When funds from the Community Preservation Act were made available for lighthouse restoration, the MV Museum hired Campbell Construction Group of Beverly, MA., to overhaul the lights at East Chop and Edgartown. During the summer of 2007, the East Chop Lighthouse was refurbished inside and out, with new electrical wiring, new windows (except for the ground floor), and a refurbished exterior. Present Day The current United States Coast Guard Light List description is \\"White tower\\". The actual light is above Mean High Water. Through the concern and effort of the Martha's Vineyard community, the East Chop Light survives today as an iconic symbol of the island's rich maritime history. In 1987, the East Chop Light was placed on the National Register of Historic Places as East Chop Light, while under management of VERI through its United States Coast Guard license number DTCGZ71101-85-RP-007L.

The district is roughly bounded by Water St. (North and South) and Pease's Point Way (North and South), and encompasses some . The buildings within the district primarily represent the period of Edgartown's growth in the 19th century, featuring the elaborate houses of wealthy ship captains, as well as significant public buildings such as the Dukes County Courthouse and Jail, the Federated Church, and the Whaling Church. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Edgartown was settled after the area was granted in 1641 to Thomas Mayhew, having previously been occupied by the Wampanoag people, and was incorporated in 1671, when Martha's Vineyard was part of New York. Only portions of First Period construction have survived in Edgartown; one example is the Captain D. Fisher House on North Water Street (c. 1704). Most of the 18th century houses that survive are vernacular in their construction methods; the Thomas Cooke House (c. 1765) is a typical Georgian five-bay house with a central chimney. Edgartown's heyday during the 19th century was roughly during the second quarter of the 19th century, when the whaling industry dominated its economy. As a result, a large portion of its architecture is in the most popular style from that time, the Greek Revival. However, side-hall plans that were typical of this time in other parts of Massachusetts were uncommon here, Most of the buildings from this period were cottages of one and a half stories, with modest styling such as corner pilasters. The Fisher House on Morse Street is probably the most elaborate Greek Revival house in the village. Because of the decline in the whaling industry and the village economy, there are comparatively few Victorian period buildings. Between 1895 and about 1930 a number of summer houses were built, predominantly in Colonial Revival styling.

The district includes six contributing buildings and two monuments, based around the intersection of South and Church Streets in Aquinnah. History Prior to the arrival of English colonists, the island of Martha's Vineyard was occupied by Wampanoag Indians. English settlement began in the 1640s in the eastern part of the island, and the Gay Head area in the far west remained reserved to the natives. Following American independence in 1783, the Wampanoags became de facto wards of the state, but their lands at Gay Head remained under their control. By the first decades of the 19th century, there were two church congregations, and a school in the area. The church congregations declined in size, and were eventually absorbed into that of nearby Holmes Hole (present- day Vineyard Haven). In the early 1830s, a town center began to take shape along Old South Road. The Gay Head congregants organized a new church in 1832, which met in the schoolhouse. It is unclear whether this refers to the schoolhouse in the district, whose existence is only definitely dated to 1844. The small congregation received a donation for the construction of a new church, which was dedicated in December 1850. The town of Gay Head was incorporated in 1870; it was renamed Aquinnah in 1998. A new town center began to take shape following incorporation, and the surveying and construction of what is now South Road. By 1907, the church, school and parsonage house had all been relocated to their present setting near the intersection of South and Church Roads.s To these were added the present town hall, and a post office with residence for the postmaster. District elements The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. It includes the following six contributing buildings: * a schoolhouse, known to exist in 1844; this building now serves as the Aquinnah town library * the Gay Head Community Baptist church, constructed 1850; it is the only church in town * the minister's parsonage house, constructed 1856 * the town hall, constructed 1929 * the former post office and residence, constructed in the 1920s * a small outhouse on the church property, not used in living memory Two monuments, commemorating the town's contributions to World War I, are also contributing elements to the district.

History 1796‚Äì1838 ‚Äì Gay Head Light ‚Äì the first lighthouse on Martha's Vineyard When the first Congress of the newly formed United States government met in 1789, one of its first acts was to assume responsibility for lighthouses and other aids to navigation along the country's coastline. For the next twenty-five years, design and construction of new lighthouses were authorized by Congress. The location, size, design, and construction of each lighthouse was considered of such vital importance, that the decision-making process involved the highest officials, including the President. In 1796, Massachusetts State Senator, Peleg Coffin, requested a lighthouse be installed on Martha's Vineyard above the Gay Head cliffs overlooking a dangerous section of underwater rocks known as \\"Devil's Bridge.\\" Senator Peleg's request to his Congressman in Washington was substantiated by the maritime traffic navigating the waters between Gay Head and the Elizabeth Islands, which would eventually be reported in a late 1800s Massachusetts study at 80,000 vessels annually. As the state representative for Nantucket, Peleg Coffin also had the whaling industry interests of Nantucket in mind. The Gay Head lighthouse was authorized in 1798 by the United States Congress during the Presidency of John Adams. This authorization was to help facilitate safe passage for vessels passing through the hazardous Vineyard Sound waters near the Gay Head cliffs. In 1799, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts deeded two acres and four rods to the Federal Government for the purpose of building a lighthouse overlooking the clay cliffs and Devil's Bridge. During the same year, President John Adams approved a contract with Martin Lincoln of Hingham, Massachusetts, to build a 47-foot octagonal wooden lighthouse tower on a stone base (including light room); a 17 x 26-foot wooden keeper's house; a whale oil storage building, and various other outbuildings. This wooden octagonal lighthouse is illustrated in the ca. 1800 woodcut shown below left. Charles Edward Banks, who published \\"The history of Martha's Vineyard\\" in 1911 wrote, \\"This wooden tower lasted sixty years, and the site of it, nearer the brow of the cliffs than the present one, can be seen yet in a circular elevation of the soil. c1880 woodcut print of the first lighthouse on Martha's Vineyard built in 1799 and located above the Gay Head clay cliffs. This wooden lighthouse was octagonal. According to this print, there was a lighthouse keeper's house nearby. The planned 1799 installation of a Gay Head lighthouse, along with a full-time lighthouse Superintendent and his family, represented the first \\"Whiteman\\" homestead established in Gay Head. During the planning process of designing and building the first Gay Head lighthouse in 1799, there was some concern expressed about the impact of a Whiteman settlement in Gay Head. William Rotch, a supplier of whale oil, wrote a letter to Congress on September 28, 1799. Rotch's letter recommended that Captain Owen Hillman, of Martha's Vineyard, be appointed lighthouse Keeper. Most of the letter, however, discussed the subject of how a certain aspect of Whiteman's culture may negatively impact the indigenous Wampanoag community. A section of Rotch's letter states: \\"As this light house is in a neighborhood of peaceful natives who are industrious and temperate, it is the fear of some of the most considerate that the Superintendent [Keeper of the lighthouse] may injure them by selling them liquor and, feeling much concern for that people, we hope it will meet thy views to have him put under positive restrictions thereupon.\\" \\"Lighthouse History,\\" Martha's Vineyard Magazine, Fall/Winter 1989‚Äì90, Page 42, paragraphs 3 & 4. In the fall of 1799, Congress chose not to appoint Owen Hillman as Keeper. Instead, Congress chose Ebenezer Skiff as the island's first Principal Keeper. Skiff became the first white man of European descent to live in the town of Gay Head. On 18 November 1799, Ebenezer Skiff ignited the spider lamp inside the tower's lighting room, officially illuminating the Gay Head Light for the first time as an aide to navigation. The light was projected from lamp wicks fueled by sperm whale oil. Spider lamps were the principal source of light in U.S. lighthouses in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. They consisted of a pan of oil with a wick system that was first used in Boston Light in 1790. Spider lamps were known to produce fumes that burned the Keeper's eyes and obscured the light's glass with an oily smudge. The first Gay Head Light \\"...was a white flash, was produced by fourteen lamps burning sperm oil, and it is part of tradition of the place that there was quite as much smoke as flame resulting from the combustion of this illuminant. The Keeper was often obliged to wear a veil while in the tower, and the cleansing of the smudge on the glass lantern was no small part of his job.\\" Gay Head Light was one of several early U. S. lighthouses to use a so-called \\"revolving illuminating apparatus\\" to generate a flashing white light signal. The revolving illuminating apparatus consisted of sperm whale oil lamps placed on circular service tables attached to a Pedestal rotated by wooden clockwork. According to complaint by the light's first Keeper, Ebenezer Skiff, during cold or damp weather, the wooden clockwork became swollen, which required that the Keeper turn the rotating lighting mechanism by hand. At times, Keeper Skiff hired local Aquinnah Indians at $1.00 per day to help maintain and rotate the Light. Ebenezer Skiff also became involved with teaching Gay Head Wampanoag children. Ebenezer Skiff's original salary as Principal Keeper in 1799 was $200 per year. After a few years as Keeper of the Gay Head Light, Ebenezer Skiff realized that the job of keeping the sperm-oil- fired light was more arduous and time-consuming than anticipated. It also took many hours of labor to keep the glass surrounding the light clean of the smudge produced by the fumes. There was also the challenge of keeping the lantern glass clean of airborne deposits of clay particles from the nearby clay cliffs. After a few years of service, Ebenezer Skiff gathered the courage to write a letter requesting a pay increase to Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury. Gayhead, October 25, 1805. Keeper Skiff's letter read as follows: \\"Sir: Clay and Oker of different colours from which this place derived its name ascend in a Sheet of wind from the high Clifts and catch on the light House Glass, which often requires cleaning on the outside ‚Äì tedious service in cold weather, and additional to what is necessary in any other part of the Massachusetts. The spring of water in the edge of the Clift is not sufficient. I have carted almost the whole of the water used in my family during the last Summer and until this Month commenced, from nearly one mile distant. These impediments were neither known nor under Consideration at the time of fixing my Salary. I humbly pray you to think of me, and (if it shall be consistent with your wisdom) increase my Salary. And in duty bound I am yours to Command. EBENEZER SKIFF Keeper of Gayhead Light House\\" Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin, reviewed Ebenezer's letter and saw the merit of Keeper Skiff's request for a pay increase. In the fall of 1805, President Thomas Jefferson increased Keeper Skiff's annual salary by $50 from $200 to $250. Skiff served as the Gay Head Light Principal Keeper for twenty-nine years (1799‚Äì1828). Between 1805 and 1828, Ebenezer Skiff received one additional $50 raise. Sometime between the years of 1810‚Äì12, Keeper Ebenezer Skiff oversaw the replacement of the original spider lighthouse optics by ten new Lewis Patent Lamps. During the testing phase of the Lewis Patent Lamps ‚Äì they allegedly proved to burn brighter while using about half the oil required by spider lamps. The statement that Lewis-Patent lamps were an improvement over the Spider Lamps was questioned by mariners. In 1820, the spring at the Gay Head Light went dry, requiring Skiff to submit a request for a cart and casks to use in fetching water from a distant spring. Stephen Pleasonton, Fifth Auditor at the Treasury, asked Skiff to provide a budget for the cart and casks. Upon receipt of the cost, Pleasonton authorized Ebenezer Skiff ‚Äú...to procure a pair of wheels and water casks for the use of the Keeper of Gayhead Light House, provided the expense shall not exceed the sum you state, viz., fifty dollars.‚ÄùNational Archives In 1828, Ebenezer Skiff's son, Ellis Skiff, assumed the position of Principal Keeper at the Gay Head Light. Keeper Ellis Skiff's beginning annual salary in 1828 was $350, which at the time, was considered a relatively good annual income compared to other United States lighthouse keepers. Ellis Skiff served as the Principal Gay Head Lighthouse Keeper for seventeen years from 1828‚Äì1845. 1838‚Äì1854 Circa 1838, a new 10 parabolic lens was installed. At the same time, the lantern was lowered 14 feet (4m) to get the light under the fog. It was also in 1838 that Lt. Edward W. Carpenter did a structural inspection of the Gay Head Light. He noted that the light made one complete revolution every four minutes; that the light and premises were in good order, and that the light was visible for more than twenty miles. In 1838, the lighting room was lowered again the same year by 3 feet (1m) during a major rebuilding of the lantern and deck by a New Bedford blacksmith. Another significant improvement between 1799 and 1838 was the installation of a Benjamin Franklin pointed tip lightning rod on top of the lighthouse. Benjamin Franklin appreciated the value of lighthouses to society and is quoted as saying, \\"Lighthouses are more helpful than churches.\\" Lightning strikes to the Gay Head Light are physically documented by the cracked cast iron lightning rod ball displayed on the grounds of today's Martha's Vineyard Museum. The changes to the Gay Head Light; its buildings and grounds, and the presence of the lightning rod are clearly illustrated in the 1839 woodcut print shown lower right. Harmful lightning strikes to America's early lighthouses were not uncommon. Considering that the tall lighthouses were usually the only structures of any height for several miles, it made them susceptible to multiple lightning strikes storm after storm. In June 1766, the New York Mercury reported: \\"The 26th Instant, the Lighthouse at Sandy Hook was struck by Lightning, and twenty panes of the Glass Lanthorn broke to pieces; the chimney and Porch belonging to the kitchen was broken down, and some people that were in the House received a little Hurt, but are since recovered. ‚ÄòTis said the Gust was attended with a heavy shower of Hail.\\" The Sandy Hook Lighthouse was built in 1764, was octagonal in shape, and was made of local rubble stone. In 1842, the octagonal wooden lighthouse constructed in 1799 at Gay Head was reported by the civil engineer, I.W.P. Lewis, as being \\"decayed in several places,\\" and that both the lighthouse and its nearby Keeper's house needed replacement. In his capacity as a civil engineer, Lewis submitted reports on several lighthouses along the Northeast Coast, including Brown's Head Light; Portland Head Lighthouse; Owls Head Lighthouse and others. Lewis' wrote his noteworthy report about the Gay Head Lighthouse after also inspecting the Cape Pogue, Tarpaulin Cove lighthouses. All three wooden lights \\"...were found in a state of partial or complete ruin and all require rebuilding.\\" Lewis wrote his report about the Gay Head Light after visiting it in the fall of 1842. In his report, Lewis wrote that the Gay Head Keeper's house was \\"shaken like a reed\\" during storms. However, in spite of Lewis' negative report, replacement of the Gay Head Light and Keeper's dwelling was postponed. In 1844, the octagonal wooden light tower was moved back 75 feet from the eroding clay cliffs by John Mayhew of Edgartown at a cost of $386.87. When Lewis was traveling and inspecting lighthouses in 1842, America had 246 lighthouses and 30 lightships. c1839 woodcut print depicting changes in lighthouse grounds and outbuildings relative to documentation found in c1800 woodcut print. The early 1850s was a time of transition from the old lighthouse oversight regime under Auditor Stephen Pleasonton, to the new Congressional appointed Light House Board. During this transition phase, there were two simultaneous agendas to improve the light at Gay Head. One agenda was by the long-reigning (30 years) and outgoing head of the lighthouse oversight service, Stephen Pleasonton. The other agenda was by the new, Congressional appointed, Light House Board. In 1852 America had a total of 332 lighthouses and 42 lightships.Lighthouses of the Carolinas: A Short History and Guide (Terrance Zepke) It was in 1852 that Congress transferred oversight of the nation's lighthouses from Pleasonton to the professional Light House Board. However, in 1852, due to previous efforts undertaken during Pleasonton's reign ‚Äì the Congressional Light House appropriation bill approved $13,000 to refit and improve the existing 1799 wooden Gay Head Light. With the $13,000 already approved for improvements at the old wooden Gay Head Light, the newly appointed Light House Board found itself fulfilling Pleasonton's agenda for improvements in 1854. On May 26, 1854, the Gazette of Martha's Vineyard reported: \\"We learn that the Light House Board are about to remove the old lantern and lighting apparatus from Gay Head Light and to erect thereon a new lantern glazed with large-size plate glass. In this is to be placed 13 new lamps with the largest sized reflectors...The business of lighting our sea coast is in the hands of an active and efficient board of officers and great improvements are now being made...\\" By July, 1854, the $13,000 was spent and the new lantern apparatus installed in the wooden lighthouse tower. In July, 1854, the Gazette reported, \\"The old lantern...has been replaced by a new one which revolves in about 3 minutes and 58 seconds, with an interval between each flash of 1 minute 59 seconds. The new Light is of much greater power.\\" In 1854 the newly established U.S. Lighthouse Board moved forward with their plan to replace the \\"renovated and improved\\" wooden tower with a redbrick tower supporting a First-Order Fresnel Lens. 1854‚Äì1874 An official bill payment document dated December 4, 1860 from the \\"U. S. Light-house Establishment\\", for a bill submitted by Charles N. Tumbull in the sum of $8.50 for 3.5 days of labor and materials to repair the Gay Head Light in 1860. Even though the newly installed 1854 light was of \\"greater power,\\" the 1854 apparatus was considered inferior to the newly developed Fresnel technology. At the same time, the wooden lighthouse tower was judged to be in questionable condition, and the light's position was considered threatened by the eroding clay cliffs. In 1852, the Federal Lighthouse Board issued a 760-page report stating that Gay Head Lighthouse was ‚Äúnot second to any on the eastern coast, and should be fitted, without delay, with a first-order illuminating apparatus.‚Äù In 1854, just two weeks after the old wooden Gay Head Light structure was refitted with the new lighting apparatus ‚Äì Congress approved $30,000 for the construction of a new brick tower to fit a first-order Fresnel Lens, and to build a new keeper's residence also made of brick. As a result, the existing 51 feet tall conical brick tower that stands today was started in 1854 and lit in 1856. The bricks used to construct the light were composed of clay bricks manufactured at the nine-mile distant Chilmark brickyard. It was equipped with a whale oil fired first-order Fresnel Lens standing about 12 feet (4m) tall; weighing several tons (tonnes); and containing 1,008 hand-made crystal prisms. In August, 1854, the United States Congress approved the purchase of a first-order Fresnel Lens for the soon-to-be-built brick tower at Gay Head. Shortly after, the United States Lighthouse Board submitted a purchase order to Lepaute Manufacturing in France for the manufacture of the Fresnel Lens. Lepaute Manufacturing was founded in 1838 by the watchmaker/inventor, Henri Lepaute. Thus, the manufacture of the Fresnel Lens also incorporated a weighted clock mechanism to rotate the lens. In February 1855, upon completion of building the Fresnel Lens, and before shipment to America, Lepaute Manufacturing requested permission from the United States Lighthouse Board to exhibit the lens at the World Fair in Paris. The Lighthouse Board granted permission on March 19, 1855. When the Fresnel Lens was exhibited at the 1855 World's Fair, it won a gold medal at the Paris Exhibition of Industry.\\"Gay Head Light Gets The Wondrous Fresnel,\\" by: Arthur Railton, The Dukes County Intelligencer, Vol. 23, No. 4, May 1982 On May 13, 1856, the Fresnel Lens was shipped to New York from Le Havre, France to America. Le Havre is a coastal city with frontage along the English Channel. Soon after its arrival in New York, the Fresnel Lens and its accompanying apparatus was shipped from New York to Edgartown. Upon arrival in Edgartown, the Fresnel Lens was transported overland to its final destination in Gay Head. On July 18, 1855, Caleb King of Boston was awarded the contract to construct the new redbrick tower and its attached redbrick keeper's dwelling. The construction contract stipulated that Caleb King must complete the light- house at Gay Head by the December 1, 1855. At that time in history, Gay Head was listed as the ninth most important lighthouse location in the United States. Therefore, it deservedly became one of the first lighthouses in the United States to receive a Lepaute-manufactured first-order Fresnel lens. Caleb King, fulfilled his contract, and on December 1, 1856, the new Gay Head Lighthouse signal was activated. After illumination, the Gay Head Light Fresnel Lens received considerable publicity. This resulted in many tourists visiting the light via steamship and other transport systems of the period. As far as the fate of the old wooden Gay Head Light, we only have the following Gazette advertisement from spring of 1857: \\"AUCTION AT GAY HEAD! The old Lighthouse, a lot of Oil-Buts, and various other articles will be sold to the highest bidder at 12 M. April 14th. By order of Lieut. W. B. Franklin, Engr. Sec'y Light House Board.\\" As of this writing, no other historic information is available relative to what happened to the island's first Gay Head Light that was constructed of wood in 1799. Due to various factors, the Gazette reported no news of the transoceanic voyage of the Fresnel apparatus to docks in New York, nor of the Fresnel's arrival on Martha's Vineyard in 1856 during the months of June or July. Neither did the Gazette report any news or take any photographs of the transport of the Fresnel lens apparatus across the island, or of the construction of the new lighthouse and the installation of the Fresnel lens. The early 1856 transport of the Fresnel Lens and its supporting apparatus from the docks in Edgartown to the clay cliffs was reported in a reflective story published in the Vineyard Gazette on June 26, 1970: \\"...It took eight yoke of oxen to transport the heavy iron railing for the catwalks...but it took 40 yoke of oxen to move the 60 frames of glass prisms and the multitudinous collection of machinery necessary to operate the new light. The finely balanced lantern weighed over a ton all told. It must have been a slow ponderous procession that traveled the 20 some odd miles of hard packed dirt and sandy island roads from the Edgartown wharf to the clay cliffs...\\" Further attesting to the condition of Gay Head roads in the early 1800s, is Martha's Vineyard historian Charles Edward Banks' research published in 1911, ....on the Indian lands there are no made roads, and for the most part only horse paths.\\" This condition existed for about fifty *years more, when a continuation of the county road from the Chilmark line to the lighthouse was laid out. Its construction was without design and unscientific, and soon became a continuous sand rut for lack of repairs. In 1870, when the town was incorporated, the act provided that the county commissioners should forthwith \\"proceed to lay out and construct a road from Chilmark to the lighthouse on Gay Head, and may appropriate such sum from the funds of the county as may be necessary to defray the expense of the same.\\" It was further provided that it should be maintained for five years by the state. This legislation resulted in the construction of the present and only public highway in the town, which since 1875 has been a town charge.\\" What this and other early island stories about the Gay Head Light fail to document is the quarry source and transport of the heavy brownstone system that sits atop the brick structure to support the lighting room and its extended balcony. As well, it remains a mystery as to how the early lighthouse builders lifted and emplaced the huge, custom-carved brownstone pieces, as well as the Fresnel lens itself and its heavy cast iron operating apparatus and the internal staircase with its cast-iron landings. 1874‚Äì1988 On May 15, 1874, the Gay Head Light was changed from flashing white to \\"three whites and one red\\" to differentiate the light from the area's two other principal lights located at Sankaty Head and Montauk Point. All three lights had Fresnel lenses, however, the Gay Head Light was the only light of the 1st Order. The addition of the red flash signal required the exterior vertical installation of a red screen from top to bottom along every fourth row of prisms of the rotating Fresnel lens. The illuminator of the Fresnel was a lamp with five concentric wicks, the largest being five inches in diameter. The light consumed about two quarts of oil an hour, or about seven and a half gallons on the longest nights. Due to cost savings, the Gay Head Light was converted from increasingly expensive sperm whale oil to lard oil in 1867.Vineyard Gazette, January 1, 1869 In 1885, the Light was converted from lard oil to kerosene oil. Although the Fresnel Lens was invented in Europe in 1822, the U.S. Lighthouse Board did not allow it to be installed in America's lighthouses until the Fresnel underwent a series of tests in Navesink, NJ. Beginning in the early 1850s, Fresnel Lenses were installed in U.S. Lighthouses, with Gay Head Lighthouse receiving one of the first Fresnel Lenses of First Order in 1856. Due to the superiority of the Fresnel Lens to any other lighthouse optic available in the 19th century, the U.S. Lighthouse Board converted all U.S. lighthouses to the Fresnel Lens system by 1860. Relative to the subject of lighthouse illuminants ‚Äì the evolution of fuels used in America's lights went as follows: wood fires and candles were replaced by whale oil with solid wicks. Whale oil continued to be used via an improved mechanical delivery system when the parabolic reflector system was introduced around 1810. Whale oil remained the fuel of choice until coiza oil (pressed from wild cabbages) replaced whale oil in the early 1850s. However, due to certain challenges, America's farmers lost interest in growing and manufacturing coiza oil. In the mid-1850s, the U.S. Lighthouse Board switched to lard oil (made from animal fat). Kerosene started replacing lard oil in the early 1870s ‚Äì with full conversion to kerosene by the late 1880s.Kendall, Connie Jo. \\"Let There Be Light: The History of Lighthouse Illuminants.\\" The Keeper‚Äôs Log (Spring 1997) Electricity started to replace kerosene around the turn of the 20th century, with Gay Head Light being electrified in 1954.Betty Hatzikon letter (December 7, 1982), daughter of Gay Head Light's last Keeper, Joseph Hindley. Keeper Crosby L. Crocker served as lighthouse Keeper from 1892‚Äì1920. Crocker and his family were reportedly healthy when they moved into the brick Keeper's house in 1892. During the first fifteen months, Crocker had four of his children die under mysterious circumstances. Ten years after the death of his four children, his fifth child, George H. Crocker, died at age fifteen. On similar note, Edward P. Lowe (Keeper 1891‚Äì92), who lived at the light prior to Crocker, died after just one year of service. The cause of the deaths was attributed to toxic spores from mold and mildew growing on the damp brick walls inside the house. In 1899 the Lighthouse Board voted that the brick house was \\"too damp and unsanitary for safe occupation by human beings,\\" and recommended $6,500 for a new house made of wood. As a result, a spacious gambrel-roofed, double dwelling was constructed in 1902. Principal Gay Head Lighthouse Keeper, Charles Vanderhoop ‚Äì wearing his official lighthouse uniform. In 1920, Charles W. Vanderhoop, Sr. was appointed as the tenth Principal Lighthouse Keeper. Keeper Vanderhoop had the distinction of being the only Aquinnah Wampanoag Indian to officially tend the Lighthouse. During Vanderhoop's service, the Gay Head Light was well maintained and operated. This was due in large part to the fact that Keeper Charles Vanderhoop acquired valuable working knowledge of the Fresnel lens apparatus when he served as assistant Keeper at Sankaty Head Light. Keeper Charles Vanderhoop was renowned for his story-telling abilities ‚Äì which entertained visitors touring the Gay Head Lighthouse. According to Charles W. Vanderhoop, Jr., when his father gave former President Calvin Coolidge and his friends a tour of the lighthouse ‚Äì Coolidge nodded his head or smiled from time to time as his friends talked and asked questions. At the end of the tour, Coolidge lingered on the lighthouse balcony overlooking the clay cliffs and Elizabeth Islands. While doing so, Coolidge uttered one word, \\"Beautiful.\\" Gay Head was one of the last towns in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to receive electricity in the early 1950s. Shortly after the town received electricity, the Fresnel lens was replaced in 1952 by a high-intensity electrified Carlisle & Finch DCB-224 aero beacon. This beacon was custom-made for the Gay Head Light as a double-tiered cannon beacon to maintain the historic signal of \\"three whites and one red\\". By 1956 the Gay Head Light was fully automated ‚Äì negating the need for a lighthouse Keeper to occupy the property. The 1902 wooden gambrel-roofed Keepers house was razed circa 1960. When the original Fresnel lens was dismantled in 1952, it was transferred to Edgartown and mounted on top of a one-story brick structure with a glass lantern house enclosure at the Martha's Vineyard Museum in Edgartown, Massachusetts. Charles W. Vanderhoop, who served as the light's Principal Keeper from 1920 to 1933, had the honor of lighting the Fresnel lens at its new location in Edgartown during a dedication ceremony. In 1988, the high-intensity electrified beacon Carlisle & Finch DCB-224 aero beacon was replaced with a single-tiered double cannon high-intensity DCB-224 beacon. With the 1988 installation of the DCB-224 lens, the Gay Head Light's distinctively historic signal of \\"three whites and one red\\" was changed to \\"one white and one red.\\" Ownership of the double-tiered Carlisle & Finch DCB-224 aero beacon was transferred by the United States Coast Guard to Vineyard Environmental Research, Institute, whose board member, Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr., along with VERI President, William Waterway Marks, presented the light on a loan basis for public display at the Martha's Vineyard Museum. Saving the Gay Head Light 2007 ‚Äì Gay Head Lighthouse ‚Äì Winter Solstice with full moon Original 1856 Gay Head Light lightning rod assembly. Ben Franklin lightning rod spire protrudes from top of cast iron ball. The spire rod has jagged scars from lightning strikes, and the metal ball shows a fracture caused by lightning. All lighthouses on Martha's Vineyard are equipped with grounded lightning rods. From 1956 to 1985, the automated Gay Head Light was sparingly maintained by the United States Coast Guard. Due to US Coast Guard Congressional funding shortages through the 1970s and early 1980s, several lighthouses around the United States were designated for destruction because the structures were expensive to maintain, and most no longer served as vital aids to navigation. This obsolete designation was precipitated by enhanced satellite GPS and other new maritime navigation aids. In the mid-1980s, due to United States Coast Guard funding shortages, the Gay Head Light along with two other Martha's Vineyard lighthouses (East Chop Light and Edgartown Harbor Light) were listed for destruction. Documentation of lighthouses destroyed in recent history is available from Lighthouse Digest, which maintains a \\"Doomsday List\\" of threatened lighthouses. As in other similar lighthouse removal projects, the United States Coast Guard would dismantle or raze the existing lighthouse and, if deemed necessary, replace the light with a low-maintenance iron spindle structure top-mounted with a strobe light. The three threatened lights on Martha's Vineyard were spared through the objecting federal petition and Congressional testimony of Vineyard Environmental Research, Institute's (VERI) founding President, William Waterway Marks, and VERI Chairperson, John F. Bitzer, Jr. VERI was a nonprofit organization co-founded in 1984 by William Waterway Marks and Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr., to undertake cutting-edge environmental research of acid rain; sea-level rise; coastal erosion; shellfish resources; Great Pond, wetland, and barrier beach ecosystem dynamics, and aquifer (groundwater) protection. In 1984, VERI received the support of Senator Edward Kennedy and Congressman Gerry Studds during and after the Congressional hearings to save the three island lighthouses from being dismantled and/or razed. Following the Congressional hearings, the United States Coast Guard licensed the three lights to VERI in 1985 for thirty-five years. This lighthouse license gave complete control over the management and maintenance of Gay Head Light structure (except the aide to navigation) and its surrounding grounds. This was the first time in U.S. history that control of \\"active\\" lighthouses was transferred to a civilian organization. On similar note, this was the first time in the history of Martha's Vineyard that control of any of its five lighthouses was now in the hands of an island organization. After receiving the lighthouse license, the Institute undertook a series of fundraising activities that engaged the community of Martha's Vineyard, including local supporters and celebrities such as board members: Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr.; Jonathan Mayhew, whose ancestor's were the Vineyard's first European settlers; Vineyard Gazette co-owner, Jody Reston; philanthropist, Flipper Harris; Margaret K. Littlefield; the actress, Linda Kelsey; WHOI Director, Derek W. Spencer, and John F. Bitzer, Jr.. Speakers and performers appearing at these lighthouse events were historian David McCullough; Senator Edward Kennedy; Caroline Kennedy; Edward Kennedy, Jr.; Congressman Gerry Studds; singer/songwriter, Carly Simon; Kate Taylor; Livingston Taylor; Hugh Taylor; Dennis Miller from Saturday Night Live; Bill Styron's wife, Rose Styron ‚Äì who read one of her original lighthouse poems; United States Navy Rear Admiral, Richard A. Bauman; famed photographer, Alfred Eisenstaedt, and comedian, Steve Sweeney. The proceeds from the lighthouse benefits were applied to a major restoration of the Gay Head Light, which included: emergency pointing of brick walls; removal of pervasive toxic mold growing on the brick interior walls; installing new windows on the ground floor and two landing levels; replacing broken plate glass and sealing roof leaks in the lighting room; restoration of hardwood staircase rail; sandblasting, sealing, and painting of the historic rusted cast-iron spiral staircase and its three-story internal metal flooring and support structure. In 1987, the Gay Head Light was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (#87001464) as \\"Gay Head Light,\\" while under management of Vineyard Environmental Research, Institute (VERI) through its United States Coast Guard license number DTCGZ71101-85-RP-007L. Public access Circa 1913 ‚Äì Gay Head Lighthouse with visitors enjoying access when Crosby L. Crocker was Principal Keeper From the earliest days of its history, the Gay Head Light appears as though it welcomed visiting public. Early photographs depict visitors populating the lighthouse balcony and its surrounding grounds. In 1856, after the installation of the famous Fresnel lens, tourism to the lighthouse increased. Special steamship excursions from the Oak Bluffs Wharf took tourists to the Steamboat Landing dock below the Gay Head Cliffs, where waiting oxcarts provided transport to the lighthouse. Circa 1857, Harper's Magazine published an account of a visit to the lighthouse and its powerful new lens by writer David Hunter Strother: \\"At night we mounted the tower and visited the look-out gallery that belts the lighthouse at some distance below the lantern. Here we were surprised by a unique and splendid spectacle. The whole dome of heaven, from the centre to the horizon, was flecked with bars of misty light, revolving majestically on the axis of the tower. These luminous bars, although clearly defined, were transparent; and we could distinctly see the clouds and stars behind them. Of all the heavenly phenomena that I have had the good fortune to witness ‚Äî borealis lights, mock suns, or meteoric showers ‚Äî I have never seen anything that in mystic splendor equaled this trick of the magic lantern at Gay Head.\\" Public access was also documented by historian Edward Rowe Snow, who mentioned how Principal Keeper, Charles W. Vanderhoop, and his assistant, Max Attaquin, \\"...probably took one- third of a million visitors to the top of Gay Head Light between 1910 and 1933.\\" After the Gay Head Light was electrified and automated in the mid-1950s ‚Äì the lighthouse's Principal Keeper, Joseph Hindley, vacated the premises circa 1956, and the light was closed to public access. 1958 United States Coast Guard aerial photograph ‚Äì northerly point-of-view According to the United States Coast Guard aerial photograph (lower right), and other photographic documentation and research provided by Vineyard Environmental Research, Inst., the following structures were still standing in 1958: the three story Gambrel-style Keeper's house; a large barn; the square, brick, three-story WWII observation tower; a small, so-called guest house or utility building at the edge of the cliffs, and the WWII concrete bunker just below the guest house. Circa 1960, all buildings except the lighthouse and the concrete World War II bunker were razed. Since 1958, the WWII bunker has slowly slid down the face of the clay cliffs toward the beach at the bottom of the cliffs near the ocean, where it exists today in the ocean's intertidal zone at the base of the cliffs. In 1985, Vineyard Environmental Research, Institute (VERI), received a 35-year license from the United States Coast Guard to maintain the Gay Head Lighthouse and its surrounding real estate. In 1986, on Mother's Day, VERI reopened the Gay Head Light to the public for the first time since 1956. At the same time, the lighthouse was also made available for weddings and special functions. In 1985, when VERI's founder, William Waterway Marks became the light's Principal Keeper ‚Äì he appointed his friend, Charles Vanderhoop, Jr., as Assistant Keeper, along with abutting lighthouse property owner, Helen Manning. Charles Vanderhoop, Jr. was born in the lighthouse while his father, Charles W. Vanderhoop, was serving as Principal Keeper from 1920‚Äì1933. In 1929, Charles W. Vanderhoop gave a lighthouse tour to President Calvin Coolidge just after his presidency ended. Charles W. Vanderhoop was the only Wampanoag to serve in the position of Keeper until his son, Charles Vanderhoop, Jr., was appointed Assistant Keeper in 1986. The Gay Head Light was reopened to the public in 1986 for sunsets on weekends; island school children visits; special events and tours, and weddings. During the late 1980s, various other people from the community were also appointed as modern-day Gay Head Light Assistant Keepers on weekends and special occasions. In 1990, William Waterway Marks appointed Richard Skidmore and his wife, Joan LeLacheur, as Assistant Keepers. Richard and Joan became Principal Keepers in 1994 and remain in that position today. In 1987 VERI also opened the East Chop and Edgartown lights to the public for the first time in many decades. 1989 ‚Äì Charles Vanderhoop, Jr., Assistant Keeper (on left) ‚Äì educating Chilmark School students about Gay Head Light through VERI's lighthouse education outreach program. After the Gay Head Light opened to the public, bus loads of children from all of the island's schools began to visit the light as part of VERI's educational outreach programs. In 1994, VERI transferred their lighthouse license to the Martha's Vineyard Historical Society (MVHS), which is now known as the Martha's Vineyard Museum. At the time, William Waterway Marks was also serving as a MVHS board member, and was installed as the first Chairman of the newly formed MVHS Lighthouse Committee, where he served for four years from 1994 to 1997. Today the Gay Head Light is managed by the Martha's Vineyard Museum and is open to the public during the summer season, on special holidays, and for weddings and other private functions. In August, 2009, Principal Keeper, Joan LeLacheur, gave President Barack Obama and his family a private tour during their vacation on Martha's Vineyard. This lighthouse also appears briefly in the background of the movie Jaws as Chief Brody is driving to the beach. Through dedicated love, labor, and sacrifice of the Martha's Vineyard Community, the Gay Head Light survives today as an iconic symbol of the island's maritime history. While under the management and care of Vineyard Environmental Research, Inst., the Gay Head Light was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (June 15, 1987), and officially recognized by the name of \\"Gay Head Light\\". For additional information, see National Register reference number 87001464.,. This historic designation was accomplished while VERI was repairing and restoring the Gay Head Light under its United States Coast Guard License Number DTCGZ71101-85-RP-007L. Modern-day lighthouse ownership Alfred Eisenstaedt photographed Gay Head Light many times and was a staunch supporter of Vineyard Environmental Research Institute's efforts to save island lighthouses during the 1980s and early 1990s In May 2011, the Gay Head Light was presented in a Vineyard Gazette article as being available for \\"auction\\" in the near future. Both Gay Head Light and Edgartown Light were mentioned as being eligible for excess property designation by the United States Coast Guard (USCG), and the General Services Administration (GSA). Such \\"excessing\\" of a federal property makes the proposed properties eligible for ownership by local governments, nonprofits, and private interests. Since May 2011, the Martha's Vineyard Museum and the Town of Edgartown have entered into a dialogue with various federal agencies relative to a mutual town/Museum ownership/lease arrangement. According to an October 19, 2012 Vineyard Gazette published comment by David Nathans, Director of the Martha's Vineyard Museum, \\"...the Museum is not applying for ownership. The Town of Edgartown has applied for ownership, and the Museum is expecting to continue to lease the right and responsibility to steward, interpret and operate the Edgartown Lighthouse. This town and Museum relationship could be the model for the Gay Head Lighthouse as well.\\" According to the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act (LHPA), any excessed lighthouse is eligible for ownership transfer from the federal government to other federal agencies; state, regional, and local governments; nonprofits, and, as a last resort ‚Äì auction to private interests. As the current license holder of record ‚Äì the nonprofit Martha's Vineyard Museum may apply for ownership. As well, the Town of Gay Head and the Wampanoag Tribe may also file for individual or shared ownership/management of the Gay Head Light. In recent years, the Town of Gay Head, via application by the Martha's Vineyard Museum, has expended about $100,000 to help repair and maintain the Gay Head Light. This $100,000 was raised from local funds sourced via the Community Preservation Act (CPA). The CPA is a Massachusetts state law (M.G.L. Chapter 44B) passed in 2000 that enables adopting communities to raise funds to create a fund for open space preservation, preservation of historic resources, development of affordable housing, and the acquisition and development of outdoor recreational facilities. William Waterway Discovery of 1799 Gay Head Lighthouse Foundation On August 1, 2013, a federal \\"NOTICE OF AVAILABILITY\\" was published in fulfillment of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000. The introduction to this notice reads as follows: \\"The light station described on the attached sheet has been determined to be excess to the needs of the United States Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security. Pursuant to the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000, 16 U.S.C. 470 (NHLPA), this historic property is being made available at no cost to eligible entities defined as Federal agencies, state and local agencies, non-profit corporations, educational agencies, or community development organizations for educational, park, recreational, cultural or historic preservation purposes. \\"Any eligible entity with an interest in acquiring the described property for a use consistent with the purposes stated above should submit a letter of interest to the address listed below within 60 (sixty) days from the date of this Notice.\\" \\"Pursuant to Section 309 of the NHLPA, the light station will be sold if it is not transferred to a public body or non-profit organization. Today, due to erosion, the Gay Head Light is surrounded by approximately one acre of plateau land. The transfer of ownership of the Gay Head Light was voted by the LHPA and the GSA to be transferred to the Town of Aquinnah. After relocation of the lighthouse in June 2015 to a new location, the Town of Aquinnah via its \\"Save the Gay Head Lighthouse Committee,\\" continues to move forward with fundraising efforts to finance the restoration of the light and its grounds. Relocation of Gay Head Lighthouse in May/June 2015 Gay Head Lighthouse at New Location - June, 2015 The Gay Head Lighthouse Committee worked in conjunction with the town of Aquinnah and the Martha's Vineyard island community to raise approximately $3.5 million to relocate the lighthouse about from its former location. The lighthouse was relocated by Expert House Movers and the General Contractor, International Chimney. Prior to relocation, the inside of the lighthouse was reinforced with a combination of cement block; steel beams, and block and tackle equipment. Besides stabilizing the interior of the light - the outside brick wall of the level beneath the lighting room was reinforced with plywood held in place with tightened steel cables. A similar steel cable reinforcement scheme was also used to stabilize the light's granite foundation. A roadway was excavated from the light's existing location to its new location onto a 3-foot thick reinforced footing. A series of heavy steel I-beams established a support base and track on which the lighthouse was pushed and moved with pneumatic power. Due to the aide-to-navigation requirement that the elevation of the light's signal remain constant - the lower elevation of the new lighthouse location required the light be raised on a cement block foundation. The new cement block foundation along with the light's original granite stone foundation maintain the light's signal at its previous elevation. The new cement block foundation and old granite stone foundation are now buried beneath fill and topsoil. To minimize erosion of the cliffs due to potential drainage through disturbed soils of the excavated area - semi-impervious hardener was compacted (see photo foreground) with heavy vibrating rollers. Top soil and vegetation removed and saved from the original site were then installed to reestablish the vegetated landscape. In preparation of the relocation, the light's flashing red-and-white signal was extinguished by Principal Keeper Richard Skidmore on April 16, 2015. The light was returned to its functional brilliance at 6:08 PM on the stormy evening of August 11, 2015. The Gay Head Lighthouse is once again open for public visitation through the Martha's Vineyard Museum. The new location of the Gay Head Light is approximately 180 feet back from the eroding cliff's face. It has been estimated by engaged geologists that the lighthouse will not be threatened again for another 150 years. List of keepers Samuel H.

The district includes houses on William Street from Woodlawn Avenue in the north to several houses south of Camp Street. It represents the single best preserved area of mid 19th century houses in Vineyard Haven. History One of the earliest English settlements on the island of Martha's Vineyard (now in Massachusetts) was a place called Holmes Hole. Eventually incorporated as part of the larger town of Tisbury, Holmes Hole was eventually renamed Vineyard Haven, reflecting its status as the island's major port. Williams Street was the second street of note laid out in the town, running parallel to Main Street. The street was developed by Thomas Bradley, who also counted among his businesses a mill in West Tisbury. Laid out in 1831, a series of houses were constructed along the road between 1830 and 1860, most in the Greek Revival style. These houses were all built by local builders, apparently without the benefit of architectural guidance. Most of the houses have not had significant alterations, and some continue to be owned by descendants of the original purchasers. The first houses built were typically 1.5 story structures with 4 windows. The historic district encompasses all of the properties from Woodlawn Avenue in the north to Camp Street, extending about three houses south of the latter. There are only a few modern houses in this stretch, as well as an old schoolhouse. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

The district represents a well-preserved planned summer resort community of the late 19th century. Located in and around Iroquois Avenue, the district encompasses the northernmost portion of West Chop, a peninsula that separates Vineyard Sound and the sheltered waters of Vineyard Haven Harbor, an area that was developed by the West Chop Land Company in the 1880s. The land is now owned by the West Chop Land Trust and managed by the private West Chop Club. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. History For most of the colonial period, the West Chop area of Martha's Vineyard saw agricultural uses. These uses continued into the 19th century, primarily because the northern reaches of the point were held by a single landowner. West Chop Light was built in the area in 1817, and a Methodist summer camp meeting was held near the lighthouse in 1827. The area's rural character began to change in the 1870s with the rise of summer resort communities on the island. An initial attempt at development failed in the 1870s, but in the 1880s the West Chop Land Company began development of the area. The company laid out narrow winding roads. The company built a wharf, developed a stretch of beach for public use, and sold plots of land for development as summer cottages. In 1892 the company built the West Chop Inn. It built a clubhouse and cottages that it rented out, and also constructed two tennis courts for the use of its clients. By 1900 the resort community had grown to include two hotels, a post office, grocery store, and a variety of recreational facilities. The West Chop Land Company went bankrupt in 1911. The owners of the houses in the community banded together to form the West Chop Land Trust, which acquired the Land Company properties. The privately held West Chop Club was organized in the 1960s to manage the properties owned by the Trust. District elements The historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. It encompasses about , and includes five buildings and four structures: *The Cedars, a large Shingle-style building at Main and Iroquois *The Cottage, located directly east of The Cedars, is a simple rectangular single story Shingle style building *The Casino, a large two story building across from the West Chop Inn *The West Chop Inn, on Iroquois Street, a large T-shaped Shingle-style building *The West Chop Post Office, a white 1.5 story building which used to have its own zip code (02573) *The \\"Big Pier\\", built in 1888, juts into the Vineyard Sound *The Jetty, built in the first half of the 20th century, separates Vineyard Haven Harbor from Vineyard Sound, and marks the eastern end of the club's waterfront *Two clay tennis courts, built c. 1911, are located next to the West Chop Inn The district boundaries include the following non-contributing properties: *Two modern concrete tennis courts *A playground *A flagpole (a modern replacement for older wooden ones), and two nearby benches See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Dukes County, Massachusetts References External links *West Chop Club website Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Tourist attractions in Tisbury, Massachusetts Category:Shingle Style architecture in Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Dukes County, Massachusetts Category:History of Dukes County, Massachusetts ","title":"West Chop Club Historic District"},{"id":"17723074","text":"Syfy formerly known as the Sci Fi Channel.

The c. 1890s house is the first built by a member of the Vanderhoop family, which is prominent in the town politics of Aquinnah and in the tribal organization of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. It is now operated as a museum called the Aquinnah Cultural Center and features exhibits on tribal history and culture. History William Adrian Vanderhoop (b. 1816) was the first member of the Vanderhoop family to move to what is now Aquinnah, Massachusetts on the island of Martha's Vineyard, but was then a reservation of the Wampanoags of Gay Head. In 1837, he married a Wampanoag woman and raised a large family, whose descendants continue to be prominent in the affairs of the town and tribe. In 1869, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts began the process of incorporating the town of Gay Head (as Aquinnah was called before 1998) by dividing the tribal lands among its members. Vanderhoop purchased one of the tracts defined by the state from a tribal member in 1890 for $40, and immediately signed it over to his son, Edwin DeVries Vanderhoop. He was a whaling captain, and the first Wampanoag to sit in the state legislature. Sometime between 1890 and 1897 the younger Vanderhoop constructed a house on the property. With only modest changes to its structure, and the addition and loss of outbuildings on the property, it has retained its original character. The house was acquired by the non-profit Aquinnah Cultural Center, and has been converted into a cultural center and museum. Most of the land owned by Vanderhoops was acquired by the Martha's Vineyard Land Bank at the same time. Description The house is located on a windswept tract on the far west side of Gay Head, about one mile (1.6 km) west of the town center of Aquinnah. It marks the western end of South Road, the main road connecting Aquinnah to the rest of Martha's Vineyard. There are currently no outbuildings, although there had been in the past. The historic tract extends down to Rhode Island Sound, with expansive views of the ocean. The house sits near the road at a location that begins to drop off sharply toward the coast. The main body of the house consists of two large Cape style sections whose ridge lines run east-west, but at an offset from each other. Each section has a central chimney. The two sections appear to have been constructed relatively near each other in time, since the construction methods appear to be similar. It is possible that one of the two sections was built before 1890 and moved to the site. The north block of the house measures 24' by 16', with three window bays on the long dimension and two on the short. A two-story entry block projects from the center of the north elevation, and is flanked by porches. The main north block is offset by from the south block, which measures 22' by 16', and has a single-story block protruding from the center of its south elevation. Inside the house, the northern section contains a living room and parlor, while the southern section houses the kitchen, pantry, and dining room. Four bedrooms and a bathroom occupy the second floor. The walls and ceilings are plaster throughout the house, and the floors are painted pine. Modifications to the first floor have been limited: a fireplace was added to the living room, and doorways have been widened between the entry and living room, and between the living and dining rooms.

It was used from the 1970s until recently. It was designed to be used in conjunction with the L9 Bar Mine anti-tank mine, to make anti-tank minefields more difficult for enemy sappers to clear by hand. A FV432 would be fitted with a plough through which bar mines would be laid. A firing frame which held 18 clips of 4 barrels each would be fitted to the top of the vehicle. Each barrel contained 18 Ranger mines, for a total of 1,296 mines. The frame could fire in any direction (although mines were not usually fired over the front of the vehicle). As each section of the anti-tank minefield was completed, several of the barrels would be fired. A small propelling charge would launch the mines, scattering them behind or to the side of the mine-laying vehicle. The act of launching the mine from the tube would release a spring-loaded safety catch and start a timer which would arm the mine after 30 seconds. The mine was roughly the size of a tin of shoe polish, made of plastic and coloured olive green. There was enough metal in their fuze to make them detectable. Two inert training versions were available. One was bright orange to allow it to be easily spotted and recovered; the other was made from bio- degradable compressed peat. FV432, with Bar Mine plough and Ranger scattering frame The Ranger mine laying system could also be fitted to a four-tonne truck, Stalwart High Mobility Load Carrier or the combat support boat The mines were supplied by Thorn EMI and most were supplied before 1986. In June 1998, stocks of 1,110,000 mines were held. In accordance with treaties banning the use of anti-personnel mines, the UK has destroyed all its stocks of L10s by March 1999.

It is also refers to the feudal social systems that existed during the colonial era. The term walauwa is derived from the Tamil word valavu, which denotes a compound or garden, and by implication, a large house with aristocratic connotations. The pinnacle of walauwas in the Sinhala social stratum is the wasala walauwa. Wasala is derived from the Tamil vaasal, which means an entrance. In the Sinhalese social hierarchy, a wasala walawa would typically be the ancestral residence of a mudaliyar. Walauwas vary in style, elegance and uniqueness depending upon the financial resources of the individual families and in the village or area's social structure. Most walauwas tend to incorporate aspects of traditional pre-colonial Ceylonese architecture, as well as Dutch and later colonial influences. A walauwa usually consisted of a cluster of buildings linked by verandahs, with an internal courtyard (medamidula), which separated the private life of the family from the headman's public duties. The walauwa were traditionally associated with the homes of the courtiers (radala), members of the royal court in Kandy. It was displaced by their colonial equivalents following the dissolution of the Kingdom of Kandy by the British.

In Sinhalese, it gives a plural sound rather than the singular word \\"Walaw\\" which means \\"Mansion\\". The typical Sinhala term is 'Maha Gedhara'. The English word of \\"Walauwa\\" is, \\"Manor\\" or \\"Manor-House\\",and it's a large house with lands. The Walauwas and its owners were supported by the larger lands and estates they possessed. These were either land grants from Kings (since the beginning of the Sinhalese Kingdom until the Kandyan era) or government service (during the Colonial era) or acquired by successful enterprise and passed down though generations. Their owners were the landed elites of Ceylon, as such they gained a status of power and wealth. A notable feature of many of these walauwas, especially Kandyan walauwas was an interior open space/garden known as the 'medha midula'. There is another theory about Walauwas. \\"Walavum\\" means a place where a judgement is given. Those people who occupied the Walauwas had the authority to pass judgement over people with the authority provided by a Royal decree either Sinhala or English. The older walauwas were neither tiled (roof), very large or highly ornate as the king had placed certain restrictions and laws. Many of the walauwas beyond the jurisdiction of the king or after the fall of the Kandyan kingdom sprang up to be large and oranate, displaying architectural influences from beyond Sri Lanka and south India. Mansions replaced the walauwas in the urban areas towards the latter part of the nineteenth century. Though they were referred to as walauwas by the public, the owners usually referred to them with modern names. There are many large mansions of more recent origin which are not walauwas both in the Kandyan and the Low Country areas. This however has changed in the years after independence with the rise of a powerful middle class based on profession and enterprise. The elites held much power within the political cycles. The most significant change occurred in the 1970s with the socialist style land reforms that were bought into place. This limited private land ownership to fifty acres, and private home ownership to two houses. Most families sold off their lands or had them taken over by the government. They retained their Walauwas, yet over the years found it hard to maintain them, resulting in many falling into a dilapidated state, while some were razed to the ground such as the Maha Kappina Walauwa, and Ragama Walauwa which were constructed in the 16th century. Some were bought for state use or others have now been converted into hotels and Shopping complex such as the Ratwatte Walauwa, Rajamanthri Walauwa and the Nugawela Walauwa.

It is part of the red-light district. History The street was named in 1610 after the fact that Count Ernest of Schaumburg and Holstein-Pinneberg had granted religious freedom to non-Lutherans such as Mennonites and Roman Catholics to practise their faith here and commercial freedom for handcrafters not enrolled in the else compelling guilds. At that time this district was part of the city of Altona within the county of Holstein-Pinneberg, and did not yet belong to Hamburg. When the Duchy of Holstein-Gl√ºckstadt annexed Holstein-Pinneberg in 1640 the comital freedoms were confirmed. Non-Lutherans were forbidden to publicly practise their religions in Lutheran Hamburg proper. The street has still a Catholic church (St. Joseph), situated among rather unholy businesses. The Mennonite church, established in 1611, moved into another neighbourhood in 1915. In 1938, when the Nazis changed borders with the Greater Hamburg Act, the street became part of Hamburg.Greater Hamburg Act text In 1944, the German movie Gro√üe Freiheit Nr. 7 with Hans Albers was named after the road. In the 1960s, The Beatles played here, e.g. in Gro√üe Freiheit 36 (Kaiserkeller), Gro√üe Freiheit 64 (today Indra-Musikclub), and in Gro√üe Freiheit 39 (the Star-Club, 1962‚Äì1969). The street still hosts music clubs like Gro√üe Freiheit 36 and Gr√ºnspan. In the 1970s, several sex theatres (Salambo, Regina, Colibri, Safari) showed live sex acts on stage. , until its closure in 2013, the Safari was the only live sex theatre left in Germany. The popular table dance club Dollhouse now takes the place of the Salambo.

The current structure was built c. 1848, and occupies a site that has seen industrial use since the 17th century. The property is currently owned by the Martha's Vineyard Garden Club. History The Old Mill is located just outside the center of West Tisbury, Massachusetts, in the central-western portion of Martha's Vineyard. The site has seen industrial uses since the 1650s, not long after English settlers arrived on the island. The property was purchased in 1845 by Captain Thomas Bradley for $1,800, at which time it included a \\"dilapidated ... mill\\". Bradley constructed a new, 2.5 story mill building on the site. It was used as a woolen mill until about 1873. After that, the property went through a succession of owners and uses including a tea room, art gallery, and auction house. The building has been the headquarters of the Martha's Vineyard Garden Club since 1937. The club purchased the property in 1942, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Setting and architecture The mill building is a modest 2.5 story brick and wood frame structure on of land, most of which is south of the Edgartown-West Tisbury Road. The building sites near the road, just to its south, and is set into a south-facing hill. The mill pond is the only major part of the property that is on the north side of the road. A parking area near the mill is screened by trees, and most of the land is naturally landscaped. The mill itself consists of a rectangular main block, 7 bays wide and 4 deep, with an ell of 1.5 stories extending from its eastern elevation. Each floor of the building consists of a single open room. A stairway provides access between the first and second floors, and a modern pulldown ladder provides access to the top floor. A deck, a variant of an earlier one, adorns the east side of the building, as does a small modern addition providing modern plumbing facilities. The building is built on a foundation of rubble, with brick on the lower levels that are exposed from the hillside. The mill's power supply, Red Brook, flows through a conduit under the mill, although there are no visible signs remaining of how its power was harnessed.

Acquired in 2002 by the nonprofit Martha's Vineyard Preservation Trust, the building continues to be used for nonsectarian religious services, and also serves as a community center and performing arts space. History The area now called Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts on the island of Martha's Vineyard began to develop in the 1830s with the establishment of a Methodist summer camp meeting which became known as Wesleyan Grove. The popularity of the camp prompted the formation of the Oak Bluffs Land and Wharf Company to develop areas adjacent to the camp as a resort area. The chapel was built in 1870 as a non-denominational house of worship for vacationers who were not Methodist. The church, an eight-sided structure with an open internal plan, was designed by local architect Samuel Freeman Pratt, whose work for the Company included its headquarters building.

The cottage took shape in the 1870s as a combination of several smaller structures that were joined together by an addition. Doctor Tucker was a leading resident of Cottage City, as Oak Bluffs was then known, playing host to luminaries including Ulysses S. Grant. Tucker was also a leading figure in the Oak Bluffs Land and Wharf Company, which spearheaded development of the town outside the Methodist meeting camp known as Wesleyan Grove. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, for its association with Dr. Tucker, and as one of the most elaborate Victorian houses in the town. Description The Tucker Cottage is set on Ocean Avenue, a curving street which overlooks Ocean Park and Nantucket Sound. It is part of a neighborhood of large 19th-century summer cottages which are laid out on concentric roads arrayed around Ocean Park, a seven-acre park. Ocean Avenue is the innermost of these roads, directly abutting the park. Dr. Tucker was a Massachusetts native who made his fortune in the production and sale of patent medicines, and had been vacationing at Oak Bluffs for several years before he built his cottage in 1872. He was a major social force in the summer life of Oak Bluffs, was a cofounder of its Trinity Episcopal Church, and may have paid for the bandstand visible from his cottage. The cottage was originally in Stick style, and was designed by Hartwell and Swasey, but little is known of the original design, for the cottage was extensively remodeled in 1877 to designs by John Hammond, giving it its present Queen Anne styling. The cottage has an asymmetrical T shape with irregular massing. It is predominantly plank-framed, and has a variety of porches and belvideres; its most prominent feature is the tower at its northwest corner, which is high. Each of the tower's three levels has a porch with Stick-style balustrade, and the tower is topped by an open gabled roof with more Stick decoration. The central portion of the main facade is recessed from the tower, with a porch on the second floor above a first floor with a truncated overhanging roof line. The left (south) side of the main facade has a projecting gable section with porches above and below, and a small turret- topped side projection immediately behind it. The tower was destroyed during the New England Hurricane of 1938, and rebuilt in the 1980s. The exterior decorations include numerous wood carvings, including depictions of lion heads, doves, dragons, and falcons.

History The lighthouse in 2015 Naushon Island is one of the Elizabeth Islands, a chain of islands that separate Buzzards Bay from Vineyard Sound off the south shore of Massachusetts. The islands have been occupied by English colonists since the 17th century. Tarpaulin Cove is on the south-central coast of the island, a point where the coastline curves from a generally westward direction to the south. In 1759, Zaccheus Lumbert, a local tavern owner, established a light on the western shore of the cove, for the \\"public good of the Whalemen and Coasters\\". This light was maintained until 1807, when the government decided to establish a lightstation there. However, funding problems meant that a new light was not constructed until 1817, when a rubble tower was built on the site, and the light was formally manned. The rubble tower was replaced in 1856 by a brick tower built on a concrete foundation. The height of this tower varies among sources, some saying it was high, while others claim it was only . The cost of this tower's construction was $10,000. In 1890 a lightkeeper's house was constructed at a cost of $3,000; it was demolished in 1962, and only remnants of its foundation can be discerned. The tower itself was replaced in 1891 by a new brick tower high, with a cast iron lantern house, and a fog bell was also added to the facility. The fog station was destroyed by the 1938 New England Hurricane, and was not replaced. The light was automated in 1941, and In 1967 a fourth-order Fresnel lens was installed. The station continues to be an aid to navigation; the facilities are managed by the Cuttyhunk Historical Society. The lightstation was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

The house is one of the few remaining Federal period buildings in Vineyard Haven. It has had a succession of occupants and uses, and as of 2007 served as a retail establishment. History The house was built in 1796 on what was then known as ‚ÄúQuality Street‚Äú, next to the Mansion House hotel in Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts, the main port of the island of Martha's Vineyard. Originally built by Jirah Luce, it was occupied early by the highly respected Connecticut physician Dr. Rufus Spaulding (1760‚Äì1830) until about 1812, when he returned to his home state. Dr. Spaulding ran the house as an inn, and Spaulding himself was described by historian Charles Banks as \\"doctor, postmaster, justice, village librarian, inn-keeper, and Master of the lodge of Masons.\\" Other sources note that this house was at one time a tavern, and later became the first post office and library in the town of Tisbury. The house was inherited by Dr. Spaulding's daughter Sophronia and her husband, Thomas West. Another early resident was Stephen deNeuville (1778‚Äì1816), aka \\"Stephen New\\", a young French sea-captain. The house was inherited by his daughter Hannah Chase DeNeuville and her husband Orrick Peck Branscomb (1809‚Äì1859), a shoemaker and general store owner who moved to the island from Maine in the early 1830s. This house is often referred to as the ‚ÄúBranscomb House‚Äù in many older references. The house barely survived a major fire in 1883, which destroyed the entire downtown portion of Vineyard Haven right to the edge of this property. Retired whaling captain Gilbert L. Smith (1832‚Äì1928) bought the house in 1902. Mr. & Mrs. Henry A. Ritter purchased the house in the early 1900s. Henry Ritter was principal of the Tisbury School for many years and was remembered as an excellent teacher but a stern schoolmaster. By the 1920s the home was owned by Mrs. Evangeline Merrill Ritter, known to many as \\"the Vineyard Weaver.\\" The Ritter House was purchased by the Martha's Vineyard Historical Preservation Society in 1976, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. From 1981 to 1988 the Society rented the house out to the Tisbury Museum. The Museum merged with the Dukes County Historical Society in that year, and the Society undertook a restoration of the property. It has since been converted to a retail property.

Robbins has an international reputation in the fields of cognitive neuroscience, behavioural neuroscience and psychopharmacology. Robbins is Director of the University of Cambridge Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute (BCNI). He is a Fellow of Downing College and Past- President of the British Neuroscience Association (BNA), the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) and the European Behavioural Pharmacology Society (EBPS). Education Following admittance in Jesus College at the University of Cambridge, Robbins obtained his Bachelor of Arts (First Class Honours) in psychology in 1971. Following this, he received his PhD degree from the University of Cambridge in 1975 for an analysis of the behavioural effects of Dextroamphetamine. Robbins is a keen chess player and represented both England Juniors in 1967 and the University of Cambridge as an undergraduate. He was once ranked in the top twenty players in England and had one of his wins from a Varsity match in 1970 featured as a classic game in The Sunday Times. Career Robbins was appointed as a Demonstrator in the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Cambridge in 1973. He was subsequently promoted to Lecturer and Reader, before becoming Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience in 1997. Robbins was elected to the Chair, and therefore Head of Department, of Psychology in October 2002, stepping down from the latter role in 2017. The focus of Robbins' work is on the functions of the frontal lobes of the brain and their regulation by the chemical neurotransmitter systems in humans and other animals. This work is relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, depression, drug addiction, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Robbins also employs psychological paradigms for investigating cognitive functions, including planning, decision making, learning, attention and self-control, often with brain imaging. His research covers the mechanisms underlying possible cognitive enhancing effects of drugs and understanding the causation and neural basis of drug addiction and impulsive-compulsive behaviour. The work of Robbins and his collaborators led to the formation of the BCNI in 2005, which is jointly funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Wellcome Trust. Robbins is Director of the Institute, which focuses on translational work leading to the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Robbins Chaired the MRC Neuroscience and Mental Health Research Board between 1995 and 1999, and was co-leader of the UK Government 2005 Foresight Project entitled 'Drug Futures 2025?'. He has also consulted for the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on the state of UK research. Since 2005, Robbins has been a Fellow of the Royal Society. In addition, he is a Fellow of the British Psychological Society (since 1990) and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (since 2000). Robbins has published over 750 full papers in scientific journals, including Nature, Brain, Science and Nature Neuroscience. The ISI Web of Science credits Robbins with a Hirsch (h) index of 154 and is credited as one of the top cited authors in Neuroscience. He has been an editor of the journal Psychopharmacology since 1980, is a Member of the Editorial Board of the journal Science, and is Co-Editor-in-Chief of the journal Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences. In 2017-2018 he was a Guest Co-editor of a Theme Issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Robbins has Co-Edited 7 books, including Psychology for Medicine, The Neurobiology of Addiction and Decision Making, Effect and Learning. Inventions Robbins' research uses neuropsychological tests, such as the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), which he co- invented with Professor Barbara Sahakian in the 1980s. CANTAB is now used at over 700 research institutes worldwide and is backed by over 1,200 peer-review articles. Robbins serves as a Senior Consultant to Cambridge Cognition, a spin-out of the University of Cambridge. Cambridge Cognition now provides CANTAB. The CANTAB PAL touchscreen test, which assesses visual memory and new learning, received the highest rating of world-leading 4* grade from the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014. Following this award, CANTAB and CANTAB PAL were highlighted in the Medical Schools Council 'Health of the Nation' 2015 publication, which described CANTAB as a boost to the UK economy. Robbins is also a co-author of the neurochemical Functional Ensemble of Temperament model that mapped the functional roles of brain neurotransmitters to main aspects of behavioural regulation. Press Robbins has frequently appeared in press interviews to discuss his research such as The Guardian, BBC News, The Daily Express and the Naked Scientists podcast. He frequently engages the public in science, such as speaking at the Hay Festival and participating in a feature on smart drugs for BBC Online.

The Chantecler was developed in the early 20th century, at the Abbey of Notre-Dame du Lac in Oka, Quebec. It is extremely cold-resistant, and is suitable for both egg and meat production. History At the dawn of the 20th century, no breeds of chicken had been established in Canada, and Canadian farmers and poultry fanciers only had fowl of European and American derivation. This fact was noted by Brother Wilfrid Ch√¢telain, a Trappist monk and Doctor of Agronomy, as he toured the poultry flocks of the Oka Agricultural Institute, an agricultural school at his abbey which is affiliated with the Universit√© de Montr√©al.albc-usa.org In 1907, the Brother set out to remedy this void and create a practical chicken that would be suited to Canada's climate and production needs. Working at the Abbey of Notre-Dame du Lac in Oka, Chantelain first combined Dark Cornishes, White Leghorns, Rhode Island Reds, White Plymouth Rocks and White Wyandottes, creating the White variant of the Chantecler. It was admitted into the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection in 1921.Ekarius p. 51 By 1918, the breed was presented to the public. To this day, the Chantecler is one of only two breeds of poultry from Canada, and the only one known to have been created primarily by a member of a monastic order.Heinrichs p. 59 At the outset, it was only intended for the breed to be white in color; white birds are preferred for commercial meat production in the West, as they produce a particularly clean-looking carcass. In the 1930s, the Partridge Chantecler was generated by crossing Partridge Wyandottes, Partridge Cochins, Dark Cornishes, and the rose comb type of Brown Leghorns to produce a chicken more adapted to free range conditions. This variant was admitted to the Standard in 1935. There has also been a Buff variety present since the 1950s, but it has never been admitted to show standards. In 1979, the extinction of the Chantecler was publicized, with what was thought to be the last rooster of the breed dying at the University of Saskatchewan's Department of Animal and Poultry Science. However, despite the disappearance of the breed in institutional and commercial hatcheries, it was still maintained by a few small farms. In the 21st century, the breed persists, but is listed as Critical by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. Characteristics A White Chantecler hen at the Abbey in 1926 The Chantecler is a large chicken that lays respectably well and is a good meat producer. Roosters weigh around , and hens are .The breed possess yellow skin and beaks, and lay brown eggs. With plumage that lies tight against the body but has a good deal of fluff, and an exceptionally small cushion comb and wattles, the Chantecler is one of the most cold hardy chickens. They are gentle birds amenable to taming, but can be temperamental in confinement.

Early career  Alonso Miguel de Tovar was born in Higuera de la Sierra, near Aracena. in 1678, to a secondary and empoverished branch of the illustrious Tovar family, of the Lords of Tovar, later Marquesses of Berlanga. He trained in Seville under Juan Antonio Ossorio and Juan Antonio Fajardo, having executed numerous religious paintings, including Our Lady of Consolation with Saints Francis, James and a Clerical Donor (1720), in the Seville Cathedral, and St Francis Receiving the Stigmata (c. 1720), in the Royal Academy of San Fernando, Madrid. He was named pintor de c√°mara to King Felipe IV in April 1729, taking the place of Teodoro Ardemans. In both of these the influence of Murillo is discernible: the colouring is vivid and the drawing precise, if slightly rigid, and both works show what has been called a gentle and uncomplicated piety, differing to some extent from the tradition of Spanish religious painting. He painted a canvas of Nuestra Se√±ora del Consuelo in 1720 for a church in Seville. He returned to Madrid in 1734, where he died.  Career as court painter  Tovar was appointed court painter in 1729, when the Spanish court moved to Seville, taking the place of Teodoro Ardemans. There he collaborated with Jean Ranc, probably painting replicas of the latter's portraits. His own portraits include Portrait of a Young Girl (1732), now in Meiningen, at Schloss Elisabethenburg. In 1733 he travelled with the court when it returned to Madrid, and he may have worked as an assistant to Louis- Michel van Loo. Tovar also probably painted the theme of the Holy Shepherd, popular with Sevillian artists of his time. Of the paintings of the subject attributed to him, however, only the one in the church at Cortelazor, near Aracena, signed in 1748, is considered authentic.

He signed for Preston North End in 1884, Loughborough in 1895 and, finally Wigan County in 1897. Career One of the first Scotsmen to play for North End, Jack Gordon was working at Leyland as a joiner when he was first asked to play for the club in February 1882. He scored on his debut in a 7‚Äì0 win over Fishwick Ramblers, a local side who were then on a level with North End. Yet, despite impressing, he returned home to Port Glasgow where he worked in the shipyards and played football for Port Glasgow Athletic. Two years later he returned to Deepdale, the home of Preston North End, and after a handful of games at inside‚Äìright, switched to the wing where he turned up with Jimmy Ross. He scored many goals in North End's pre‚ÄìLeague days, including five in the 26‚Äì0 win over Hyde United. His pinpoint crosses led to Preston players scoring a large number of goals with their heads. Jack Gordon played in the 1888 FA Cup Final on the right‚Äìwing but was on the losing side. Preston North End lost 2‚Äì1 to West Bromwich Albion at Kennington Oval on 24 March 1888. Jack Gordon made his League debut on 8 September 1888 as a winger for Preston North End against Burnley at Deepdale. Preston won 5‚Äì2 and Jack Gordon scored Preston North End' second goal. Jack Gordon played in 20 of Preston' 22 League Championship matches. As a winger he played in a Preston North End midfield that achieved a big (three‚ÄìLeague‚Äìgoals‚Äìor‚Äìmore) win on 11 separate occasions. Jack Gordon scored ten League goals in 1888‚Äì1889. His ten goals included a hat‚Äìtrick on 3 November 1888 at Trent Bridge in a 7‚Äì0 win over Notts County. Gordon scored the Preston North End second, fifth and sixth goals. He also scored two‚Äìgoals‚Äìin‚Äìa‚Äìmatch on 22 September 1888 when he scored North End' second and third goals in 3‚Äì1 win over Bolton Wanderers. He played in all five FA Cup ties including the 3‚Äì0 Final win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Kennington Oval on 30 March 1889. Jack Gordon achieved League Championship and FA Cup Winners medals. (registration & fee required) Jack Gordon played 134 first‚Äìteam matches for Preston North End from 8 September 1888 until 24 November 1894 scoring 35 goals. 113 were played in League matches scoring 27 League goals. He also played for four seasons before the Football League commenced but can find no record of the number of games he played and goals scored from 1884‚Äì1888. In October 1891, he scored North End's first‚Äìever penalty in a 4‚Äì2 win at Blackburn Rovers. He won a second League Championship Winners' Medal for season 1889‚Äì90. He also played in all seven FA Cup ties, in season 1892‚Äì93, including a semi‚Äìfinal (and replay) against Everton. Preston North End lost the replay 2‚Äì1, Gordon scoring Preston' only goal.

Ernest Benn) Murder at School is a detective novel by James Hilton first published in 1931. It was released in the United States the following year under the title, Was It Murder?. Introduction Murder at School deals with the phenomenon of coincidence by posing the question of how likely it is that two brothers attending the same boarding school meet with two separate accidental deaths--and curious ones at that--within the same schoolyear. In the manner typical of the Golden Age whodunnit, the solution is only presented in the final pages of the novel. Throughout the book, an amateur sleuth and a Scotland Yard detective vie with each other to solve the riddle, with only one of them successful in the end. Murder at School remained Hilton's only detective novel-- a brief youthful foray into crime fiction he shares with writers such as C. S. Forester (Payment Deferred, 1926; Plain Murder, 1930) and C. P. Snow (Death Under Sail, 1932). Plot summary Oakington is one of the lesser-known public schools in England, and Dr Roseveare, its headmaster, has been trying hard for seven years to improve its reputation. When, in the winter term of 1927-1928, one of the pupils is killed in his sleep by an old gas fitting falling down from the ceiling he contacts Colin Revell, an Old Boy, to discreetly investigate the matter. Not entirely convinced that there was no foul play involved but unable to pin down a motive on anyone, Revell leaves again after a few weeks, and most of the evidence is destroyed by the installation of electricity in the whole building. A few months later Revell is shocked to learn that the deceased boy's brother has also died under mysterious circumstances--he seems to have jumped into the school's indoor swimming pool late at night after the water had been drained-- and travels to Oakington of his own accord. Now it turns out that the closest relative of the two brothers, who have been orphans for years, is actually a teacher at Oakington, and that he stands to inherit a small fortune. At the same time Revell falls in love with that teacher's beautiful young wife. Read on Over the decades, various crime writers have made use of the traditional school setting in one of their mystery novels.

In the fall of 1918, the recently renovated building of the Faculty of Architecture at the Warsaw University of Technology (Warsaw Polytechnic) was occupied by the Bolshevik army causing many Polish students enlisted to drive them out, and following this brief interruption, new professors arrived at the Faculty; including Sosnowski, who took the post of the Chair of Polish Architecture Division. In 1919, he became a professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic. In 1922, he initiated the establishment of the Association of Polish City Planners. In 1929, he founded the Department of Architecture of Poland at Warsaw Polytechnic. Sosnowski's projects were based on traditional historical forms, but he used new materials as reinforced concrete. He also developed proposals for communities that for the first time applied a new urban form of building around a lake or other feature. Sosnowski was one of the greatest Polish architects of the period that developed the Professors' Quarter in Warsaw. A unique complex of 21 houses built in the Powi≈õle district of Warsaw (within the triangular area delineated by the G√≥rno≈õlƒÖska, My≈õliwiecka, and Hoene- Wro≈Ñskiego streets). They were built between 1923 and 1926 by professors at Warsaw Polytechnic's Faculty of Architecture, with the idea for each architect designs a house for himself.

European Influences? Sosnowski's design for the Church of the Immaculate Conception (Sw.Jakuba), WarsawAlthough some basic information on historical Polish architecture is now more easily available, for the Western connoisseur it is still very largely a terra incognita. This seems particularly disappointing when one considers the work of a number of designers at the threshold of 20th century modernism. How many lavish books have there been devoted, during the last 50 years, to masters such as Victor Horta, Charles Voysey or Peter Behrens? But to find a broader appreciation of Sosnowski‚Äôs or Jan Koszczyc-Witkiewicz‚Äôs work, let alone adequate illustrations, is still virtually impossible for a non-Polish audience. The reasons for this lacunae are manifold. Firstly, for Western architectural historians, particularly German-language ones, such as Nikolaus Pevsner, who began his writings on the history of Modern architecture and design in the early 1930s, a Polish work worth noting could simply not be imagined. Polish art historians and their publishers have been very slow to produce thorough investigations and adequately illustrated books about those masters, and even what has been brought out during the last few years still appears to be destined entirely for internal consumption. A comprehensive and discerning book on Polish 20th- century architecture placed into a general Western context is still badly wanting. Here the aim is to signal some of the broader issues in the work of Oskar Sosnowski, arguably Poland‚Äôs most eminent designer in the period 1910-1940. What makes the task rather difficult is that neither the architect himself, nor Polish architectural critics of the time supplied us with much explanatory discourse. Sosnowski‚Äôs professed aim early on was to create a new ‚Äòold‚Äô national style, as did many of his colleagues in Poland and in most other countries.S.Muthesius, ‚ÄòNew International Forms or Traditionalist Polish Style? Aspects of Warsaw Architecture in the early twentieth century‚Äô, in: L. Campbell (ed.) Twentieth Century Architecture and its Histories, Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain Millennial Volume, 2000, pp. 223-250. German writers and architects had adopted a primitivist approach to village architecture from the 1890s and conceivably Sosnowski might have seen the publications advocating a ‚Äòfolkart‚Äô style for rural churches by the Berlin architect and publicist Oskar Hossfeld (e.g.in his Stadt und Landkirchen, Berlin Ernst 1905 and later eds.; many of his churches are found in the former Prussian parts of Poland). The question whether Sosnowski ever arrived at a new (or old) national style cannot be answered here. But in any case, his Warsaw church (Church of the Immaculate Conception (Sw.Jakuba) of 1909 shows an astonishing range in its formal language, from the immense spatial subtlety and complexity of the circular formations of the East end, to the deliberately brutal treatment of the brickwork in the massive tower.: Z.Sowi≈Ñska-Bania, Ko≈õci√≥≈Ç p.w.Niepokalnego Poczƒôcia Naj≈õwiƒôtszej Marii Panny w parafii ≈õw. Jakuba w Warszawie, in: Nasza Przesz≈Ço≈õƒá (Krak√≥w), no. 64, 1985, p. 167-198 (short French Summary). The latter points directly to his next phase of numerous fiercely experimental projects of c.1912-1915, which can only be labelled as a primitivist kind of expressionism, and as such we may see them as Hans Poelzig avant-la-lettre.Oskar Sosnowski. Tw√≥rczo≈õƒá plastyczna, Exhibition Catalogue, Muzeum Narodowe Warsaw 1995. Indeed, the latter‚Äôs work, from his early designs in Silesia to his late buildings in Berlin, forms the closest parallel to Sosnowski‚Äôs work. Mutual influences? unlikely. A comparison with Czech Cubist architecture of those years might also be illuminating.Andrzej K. Olszewski, Nowa Forma w Architekturze Polskiej 1900-1925, Wroc≈Çaw / Warsaw, Polska Akademia Nauk 1967, was the first to point the international links of ‚Äòthe new forms in Polish Architecture‚Äô. Magnum Opus St. Roch in Bia≈Çystok All this then led to Sosnowski‚Äôs magnum opus of the late 1920s, the Bia≈Çystok Church (St. Roch's Church in Bia≈Çystok).A.Dolistowski, ‚ÄòKo≈õci√≥≈Ç ≈õw. Rocha w Bia≈Çymstoku ‚Ä¶‚Äô in: Kwartalnik Architektury i Urbanistyki, Vol. 26 1981, part 3-4, pp 427-269. It has sometimes been compared to the work of the pioneer of reinforced concrete, Auguste Perret; but Sosnowski‚Äôs spatial imagination and his judicious use of crystalline Art D√©co motifs go far beyond anything one may find in the work of the French master. In a similar way one may draw again comparisons with German avant-garde design. One is reminded of the revolutionary drawings of the immediate post war years, by Wassili Luckhardt or Bruno Taut, but one would look in vain for a realisation of these dreams in Germany, in a manner that is both as daring and as controlled as Sosnowski‚Äôs church. Naturally, the medium- sized town of Bia≈Çystok could not afford the vast building of the kind which appeared in the architect‚Äôs painted dreams of the same years, but Sosnowski maximised the effect of the church on a hill as a Stadtkrone ‚Äì which is naturally something that can only be experienced on the spot. The quality of the interior space might be summarised by the way one can see it, almost simultaneously, as a dense forest of piers and as a continuous soaring of openings covered by the lightest kind of ceilings. From that point one may, finally, look forward to the way in which the mighty Polish Catholic Church took up the task and built, all over the country, its large number of fiercely inventive sanctuaries in the 1970s to 1990s.

Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 The 1-35 was first flown in 1973 and a total of 101 were completed by the time production was completed in 1982. Background By the early 1970s competition in the open, standard and 15 meter classes was dominated by fiberglass sailplanes. Schweizer Aircraft evaluated the use of fiberglass for sailplane construction but rejected it for several reasons:Schweizer, Paul A: Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States, pages 159-209. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1988. *The high cost of demonstrating to the Federal Aviation Administration that this new material could safely be used for aircraft primary structure. *Problems with crash resistance of fiberglass structures in high-impact accidents. *The unknown service life of fiberglass. *The large amount of manual labor required to do fiberglass lay-ups at that time and the associated cost. The company believed it could get performance equivalent to fiberglass from the material it knew best ‚Äì aluminum. Experiments with the laminar flow wing of the Schweizer SGS 1-29 in the late 1950s had shown there was potential for laminar flow around metal wings.Said, Bob: 1983 Sailplane Directory, Soaring Magazine, page 32. Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 One of the factors that convinced the company there was a market for a US-made competition sailplane was the loss of value of the United States Dollar in the early 1970s which had made European sailplanes prohibitively expensive to US buyers. Development Schweizer Aircraft started construction of the 1-35 prototype in late 1972 and it first flew in April 1973. The company carried out side-by-side comparisons with fiberglass sailplanes as part of 50 hours of flight evaluations before making the decision to proceed with manufacturing the design on 10 May 1973. The 1-35 is an all-metal aircraft with a monocoque fuselage. The wing has a single spar and the stressed skin features multi- stringers for stiffness, to best retain airfoil shape and laminar flow. The aircraft's elevator and rudder are fabric covered. The 1-35 carries 320 lb (145 kg) of water ballast in two wing tanks. Because the 15 Metre Class allows flaps, the SGS 1-35 is equipped with plain flaps that can be selected from ‚àí8 to +32 degrees for soaring and inter-thermal speed and +32 to +82 degrees for landing. The 1-35 received type certificate G4EA on 25 April 1974. The type certificate is currently held by K & L Soaring of Cayuta, New York. K & L Soaring now provides all parts and support for the Schweizer line of sailplanes. Variants ;1-35 The original 1-35 model has water ballast and retractable landing gear ;1-35A The \\"A\\" model incorporated several minor changes, including a sharper nosecone but retained the water ballast and retractable landing gear of the 1-35. ;1-35B There was no 1-35B model ;1-35C The \\"C\\" stood for \\"Club\\" as this model was intended to be a high-performance sailplane for recreational, as opposed to competition, flying. It was designed to appeal to private owners, commercial rental operations and gliding clubs. The \\"C\\" has fixed landing gear and no provisions for water ballast. Competition use The 1-35 was only competitive for a very short period of time in the early 1970s before European sailplanes such as the Schempp-Hirth Mini-Nimbus and the Glasfl√ºgel Mosquito, both introduced in 1976, out-classed it. The metal wing, while of good quality construction, just could not be made to hold an airfoil profile to the same accuracy as a fiberglass wing. The SGS 1-35 would mark the last attempt by the company to produce a competition sailplane. The 1-35 quickly found a home as a club and personal glider and, other than in national or world-class competition, has proved popular due to its rugged metal airframe and aesthetic appeal. In service In May 2008 there were still 81 1-35s registered in the USA including: *44 SGS 1-35 *2 SGS 1-35A *35 SGS 1-35C There are also five SGS 1-35s registered in Canada.

The most active toxin, resiniferatoxin, binds to pain receptors in the same way as capsaicin but much more powerfully. It stimulates the neurons to fire repeatedly, causing pain.

It is the only Bernese fountain to retain all original design elements,Caviezel et al. and is listed as a cultural heritage of national significance.Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance (1995), p. 105. Thanks to its namesake figure, Hans Gieng's famous statue of Lady Justice, the Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen surpasses all other Bernese fountains in artistic merit.Caviezel et al. Hofer, on page 320, notes that authors have agreed about this since the late 19th century. The iconic figure was copied throughout Switzerland up until the middle of the 17th century.Caviezel et al., 164. The statue is a copy of the original, which was largely destroyed by vandals in 1986. Fountain The fountain as seen from the west The fountain consists of an octagonal main basin and two smaller spillover basins. The main basin, made out of unadorned limestone plates held together with an iron ring, bears the date of one of the renovations, MDCCCXLV.Hofer, 318. In the centre of the main basin, bronze tubes emerge from the central pedestal, which was replaced in 1949. Atop it stands a narrow, festooned stone pillar decorated by an acanthus frieze. Statue The life-sized statue on the pillar is Iustitia, \\"Lady Justice\\", the personification of justice. She is portrayed standing in gracious counterpoiseCaviezel et al.; Hofer, 318. holding her traditional attributes‚Äîsword of justice in her right hand, a balance in her left hand and a blindfold over her eyes. Her costume is fashioned in an antique manner,Hofer, 318: \\"antikisierend\\". with sandaled feet, one knee bared, wearing a decorative golden suit of armour adorned with bas-relief arabesques over her blue robes. At the feet of Justice, four smaller busts crowd the pedestal: a Pope, an Emperor, a Sultan and a Schultheiss, whose golden chain of office is believed to have originally borne the Bernese arms. All figures have closed their eyes as in submission. They represent the Four Earthly Powers, the four forms of government according to Renaissance humanism: theocracy (the Pope), monarchy (the Emperor), autocracy (the Sultan) and the republic (the Schultheiss).Hofer, 319. Ursula Schneeberger believes this traditional interpretation to be erroneous; in her opinion, the figure represents a king. See Schneeberger, 158. Symbolism Manuel's drawing of a winged Justice, contemporary to Gieng's statue The ensemble represents the supremacy of Justice over all Earthly authorities;Hofer, 319 a variant of the medieval pictorial formula of virtue defeating vice.Schneeberger, 158. The contemporary belief in the divine nature of Justice is made more apparent in a 1558 Bernese drawing for a stained-glass window by Hans Rudolf Manuel; there, a winged Justice strides over the heads of princes whose symbols of power are broken.Schneeberger, 160. Divine Justice was a frequent element of political discourse in Reformation-era Bern.Schneeberger, 159. In the view of the reformators, doing justice according to God's word was the highest duty of all authority, superseding feudal rights. Such arguments were used, among others, to justify Bern's conquest of Vaud in 1536 from the dukes of Savoy. While the sword and scales are traditional attributes of Iustitia, the Bernese statue's blindfold is a novelty;Balances: Instruments, Manufacturers, History by Erich Robens, Shanath Amarasiri a. Jayaweera, Susanne Kiefer () only later did it become a common element in personifications of Justice and a general symbol for the principle of equality before the law. The blindfold implies that justice ought to be done without respect to rank or standing; that a just verdict is arrived at through introspection rather than with a view to outward looks. Gieng's Iustitia is a symbol of republican justice, and was a forceful public reminder of the Bernese Republic's authority through law. Influence Biel is one of many influenced by Gieng's work Gieng's Iustitia was greatly influential on fountain designers up until the middle of the 17th century. In Switzerland alone, eleven \\"fountains of Justice\\" remain, and several others have probably been destroyed.Hofer, 321. Direct copies exist in Solothurn (1561), Lausanne (1585), Boudry, Cudrefin and Neuch√¢tel; designs influenced by the Bernese statue are found in Aarau (1643), Biel, Burgdorf, Brugg, Z√ºrich and Luzern.Hofer, 319. History The fountain was constructed in 1543, essentially in its current state,Hofer, 314. to complement an older well at the Nydegg. Its current name is first recorded in 1687.Hofer, 316. Renovations are recorded in 1584, 1589, 1668 and 1687. The sword and balance were removed, allegedly by the invading French, in 1798 and disappeared for many years;Hofer, 317. they and the figures' other paraphernalia have frequently been replaced. The figure was repainted in 1890 by Christian B√ºhler and in 1925 by Victor Surbek. In 1949, parts of the pedestal were replaced. Vandalism The statue after its destruction in 1986 After having stood in place for 443 years, the statue was torn down after midnight on 13 October 1986 by means of a rope and tackle.Gamboni, 99. It was largely destroyed by the fall. The act was not claimed by anyone,Gamboni, 103. but was generally attributed to the Groupe B√©lier, a militant youth organisation advocating Jurassic separatism. At that time, the B√©liers frequently engaged in acts of vandalism to express the Jurassian separatists' outrage over allegations of irregularities in the plebiscites of 1974‚Äì75 that caused the Bernese Jura to not join the canton of Jura; and over what was, according to the separatists, a cover-up of these irregularities by the Bernese and federal authorities. Only one person was ever implicated in the destruction of the statue. Pascal H√™che, a 29-year-old mechanic and B√©lier, retracted his initial confession and pleaded not guilty to having participated in the attack.Gamboni, 101. The Bernese courts sentenced him to 22 months' confinement and to the payment of CHF 200,000 in damages; the judgment was upheld by the Federal Supreme Court in 1991 and 1992.Gamboni, 101. See also the court's judgments, BGE 117 IV 437 and BGE 118 IV 371 . Since the attack, the damaged statue has been in the process of restoration at the city's historical museum.

The ensemble used to rehearse as part of the National Children's Wind Orchestra for the main part, and only occasionally rehearsed as the smaller ensemble group. This changed when the group became a separate entity in 1998, although many of the players in the group today have been members of the NCWO prior to their membership of NYWE. The ensemble has been conducted since its inception by Phillip Scott, who continues to push the high playing standards with demanding, technical and time-consuming music, leading to the very high standard achieved by the group today. Many former members have gone on to pursue careers in musical performance, as soloists or in renowned ensembles around the world. Ever since its formation, the ensemble has worked on the principle of a single player to each musical part or voice. This approach is unique among British youth wind ensembles performing in the national and international arena, and it has helped NYWE establish an enviable international reputation. The group specialises in the performance of music which has appeared during the last twenty years, although music of earlier eras is also performed. The band has always used around 40 players. In 2007, the band had 43 players.Program for NYWE at WASBE Killarney, Ireland 2007. NYWE has frequented such musical conferences and events such as the WASBE (World Association of Symphonic Wind Bands and Ensembles) Conference in Sweden 2003, and Ireland in 2007. It was after NYWE's performance at the 2007 WASBE held at Killarney, Ireland, that the world-renowned conductor, adjudicator and lecturer Timothy Reynish described NYWE as \\"one of the best wind groups in the world, with a professionalism unique in the UK and I would guess anywhere\\". At the WASBE 2007 Conference the ensemble gave breathtaking performances of the very demanding Philip Grange clarinet concerto \\"Sheng Sheng Bu Shi\\" featuring soloist Sarah Williams (former Young Musician of the Year finalist), \\"Diaghilev Dances\\" by Kenneth Hesketh and the world premiere of Joseph Phibbs's \\"The Spiralling Night\\", before finishing their programme with a stunning performance of Michael Ball's \\"Omaggio\\". Throughout its time NYWE has performed several world premieres of high-profile pieces. NYWE regularly commissions world-renowned composers, most recently Joseph Phibbs, Michael Torke, Jacques Cohen and Anthony Bailey. In July 2009, NYWE gave the world premiere of Cloud Atlas, a major new work by Philip Grange, based on the 2004 Man Booker Prize shortlisted novel by David Mitchell at the 2009 Cheltenham Music Festival on 12 July 2009. NYWE attended the 2011 WASBE held in Taiwan, where they performed Percy Grainger's The Immovable Do, \\"The Ciphering C,\\" Richard Rodney Bennett's Trumpet Concerto (Huw Morgan, soloist), Anthony Gilbert's Dream Carousels, Chiu-Yu Chou's Dream Sun on the Sea, and Philip Grange's Cloud Atlas.http://www.wasbe2011.com/En/p10program/NYWEGB%20Approved%20Program.doc National Youth Wind Ensemble of Great Britain Approved Program for WASBE 2011 NYWE's final concert was at Saffron Hall in April 2018.

Background Produced by Srƒëan ≈†aper's Adrenalin production company and launched on 23 April 2007 at 10:30pm, the show featured interviews and comedy bits conducted and performed by host Marko ≈Ωiviƒá. Visually and conceptually, the programme very much resembled globally popular American shows of the same genre such as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. The show's launch came as part of the general upgrade in Fox televizija's production capabilities, a network that was itself started only months earlier. The network thus had high hopes for its late night show, and it delivered as it soon became the best rated programme on Fox televizija's entire schedule. Over the coming months, the show continued gaining viewers in the usually slow summer season. In total, 95 episodes of the Marko ≈Ωiviƒá Show were shot and aired. Controversial cancellation Viewers were surprised when the show was taken off the air in early September 2007, a move by Fox televizija that created a minor controversy in Serbian print media. The official statement released by Fox said the cancellation was \\"a temporary measure that came about through a desire to free up Fox televizija's fall schedule for more movies and series\\". However, the print outlets very much wondered why would a network that's struggling for viewership be taking its best rated programme off the air. Other Serbian print media outlets speculated that Fox televizija's decision to do so had been forced from the outside due to ≈Ωiviƒá's occasional political humour. Still, others reported that despite getting good ratings relative to other Fox televizija programmes, ≈Ωiviƒá's show still couldn't generate enough advertising revenue to justify his ‚Ç¨3,000 per month salary - furthermore, according to this source, when he was asked to take a pay cut ≈Ωiviƒá refused and the show was thus taken off the air. Despite the network's press statement that described the show's disappearance from its schedule as \\"temporary\\", Marko ≈Ωiviƒá Show never resurfaced over the coming months. Its destiny was finally sealed in mid November 2007 when its timeslot was taken over by a similarly set new talk show Oralno doba. ≈Ωiviƒá discussed his 2007 cancellation five years later in December 2012 as guest on Veƒçe sa Ivanom Ivanoviƒáem, one of the shows that succeeded his on the same network and in the very same television studio. Talking to the show's host Ivan Ivanoviƒá, ≈Ωiviƒá said: \\"Five years ago, it wasn't like it is now. We had many operational problems. The network's CEO back then, Dan Bates, an older American guy, ex- marine turned television executive, was very rigid and didn't have an understanding for some things.

Theonestus may have been a member of the early Christian community in Vercelli, living in an era earlier than that of Eusebius of Vercelli.San Teonesto Theonestus may have been a martyr, whose relics were buried in the cemetery where other Christians were buried, outside the city walls. It is believed that his whole body was conserved in the tomb dedicated to him. He is probably not the saint of the same name who was said to have been killed at Altinum by the Arians. This saint of Altinum, whose legend, in any case, is confused and contradictory, may have been confused for the martyr of Vercelli, whose historicity is more certain. Historicity The only ancient source that mentions Saint Theonestus is the Vita of Saint Eusebius of Vercelli. This text records the fact that Eusebius (d. 371 AD) wished to be buried near the relics of Theonestus, which lay outside of the city walls of Vercelli. Eusebius dedicated a basilica he built to Theonestus, and was interred in it. This text, however, was written in the 8th century, and thus its reliability as a source is doubtful; a basilica dedicated to Theonestus may have existed by the fourth century. When this basilica was progressively demolished in the 16th century, the sepulchers of Eusebius and Theonestus are purported to have been discovered. A cruciform inscription, now lost, read S. MARTIR THEONESTUS, and was judged to date from the 4th century. Veneration Theonestus' relics are now situated in the cathedral of Vercelli, in a niche over the altar of the Madonna dello Schiaffo. His cultus was never particularly strong, and he was not depicted in art with frequency, and also never came to be associated with any particular patronage.

In the 1930s and 1940s, it diversified into aircraft maintenance and manufacturing as well as air transport, establishing Hunting Aircraft in 1944 by the purchase of Percival Aircraft: this business was absorbed into the British Aircraft Corporation in 1960. At the end of 1945, Hunting entered the airline business and established Hunting Air Travel Ltd, a business headquartered at Luton Airport. The new airline began commercial operations from Bovingdon Airport at the start of 1946. In 1951, Hunting Air Travel changed its name to Hunting Air Transport. Another change of name occurred in late 1953, when Hunting Air Transport became Hunting-Clan Air Transport. This change of name resulted from the Hunting family's decision to split the group and to transfer their airline business to a new holding company which they had set up together with the Scottish Clan Line, a rival shipping company owned by the Cayzer family.

History Before 1900, limitations in transportation and storage limited the geographic scope of creameries. To that time, creameries were primarily local, gathering cream from nearby dairy farms and distributed the produce locally. Also, cream separation was inefficient, primarily relying on gravity or centrifugal force. Advances in the railroad network and cold storage and practical implementation of a hand cream separator permitted creameries to serve larger areas and achieve economies of scale. These large de-localized creameries were referred to as \\"centralizers\\" - especially by those who suspected them of anti-competitive practice. Blue Valley Creamery Company was founded by Huston Wyeth (1863‚Äì1925) and James A. Walker around 1900. Huston Wyeth's father, William Maxwell Wyeth, had built a hardware, saddlery and real estate empire in St. Joseph, Missouri. Wyeth took over the business and branched into other endeavors, including formation of the Artesian Ice & Cold Storage Company in 1892. James Walker had been involved in the dairy business since 1888. \\"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the committee, my name is J. A. Walker, 700 South Clinton Street, Chicago, Ill. I am vice president of the National Dairy Council, and vice president and treasurer of the National Dairy Show Association. I have been continuously connected with the creamery business since 1888. I am vice president of the Blue Valley Creamery Co., which has for the past 21 years been manufacturing creamery butter under the hand cream separator system, dealing directly with the farmers in the purchase of our cream. Our creameries and selling agencies are located in the following cities: Chicago, Ill.; Indianapolis, Ind.; Detroit, Mich.; Grand Rapids, Mich.; St. Joseph, Mo.; Sioux City, Iowa; Hastings, Nebr.; Parsons, Kans.; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Springfield, Ill.; Columbus, Ohio; Clinton, Ill; Louisville, Ky.; St. Louis, Mo.; Cleveland, Ohio; and New York City, N. Y. Our total sales for the year 1920 were $22,963,038.66.\\" Their respective experiences with cold storage and transportation on Wyeth's part and dairy on Walker's part likely contributed to the formation and success of the venture. The Blue Valley Creamery Company was incorporated in Missouri on May 1, 1900. Business was to be conducted in St. Joseph. Initial stock holders are listed as G. M. Johnson, James A. Walker and H.S.

According to the FTC, in 1918, Blue Valley Creamery Company was the fourth largest U.S. butter marketing company, producing 26,484,000 pounds, 3.2% of the total market. (Swift, Beatrice and Armour were larger.) Total sales for the year 1920 were $22,963,038.66. Blue Valley Creamery was acquired by Beatrice Creamery Company in 1939. Beatrice Creamery Company has purchased the business, good will, trade names, trade marks and other assets of the Blue Valley Creamery Company at above locations and will continue the business at said locations under the name of Blue Valley Creamery.Blue Valley \\"has been purchased by Beatrice Creamery Co. of the same city. The latter took over the fourteen Blue Valley plants as of March 1. Blue Valley products will continue to be distributed under that name.\\" This consolidation of the two Chicago-based centralizers raised regulatory eyebrows, but was not expressly challenged. \\"The facts in the files of the Commission indicate that the acquisition of the business and assets of Blue Valley Creamery Co. by Beatrice Creamery Co. had the effect of substantially lessening competition between the acquiring corporation and the corporation who assets were acquired in the manufacture and ...\\" Locations Blue Valley Creamery Company headquarters were in Chicago at 1137 West Jackson Boulevard. Some sources indicate South Jackson; 1920 and 1921 sources indicate an address of 700 South Clinton Street. A Blue Valley Creamery Institute was found at the same address. This building appears to have been later used by Archibald Candy Corp., maker of Fannie May and Fanny Farmer candies.

Based on the novel Beauty by Faith Baldwin, it stars Madge Evans, Alice Brady, and Otto Kruger. Plot Small town woman Letty Lawson (Madge Evans) moves to New York City and lives in a boarding house run by Mrs. Merrick (May Robson). Eventually she asks her friend and Mrs. Merrick's daughter, Carol (Una Merkel), to get her a job at her workplace, an exclusive beauty salon owned by Madame Sonia Barton (Hedda Hopper). Though both Carol and her brother Bill (Edward J. Nugent), who is in love with her, warn her that it is not a fit place for a young woman of good character, Letty insists she knows what she is getting into. After proving herself, Letty is sent on a house call to attend to spoiled, scatterbrained, chatty Mrs. Sherwood (Alice Brady). When she leaves, she discovers her hat has been chewed up by Mrs. Smallwood's Pekingese. Lawyer Mr. Sherwood (Otto Kruger) returns home and is quite fond of Letty and offers her to go and buy her an expensive replacement. By chance, she meets him again when they both seek shelter from a rainstorm in the same place. Smallwood is delighted when a fear of lightning makes Letty reflexively seek the comfort of his arms several times. They start seeing each other, though nothing very improper occurs. Meanwhile, Carol has a rich, older, indulgent boyfriend, Freddy Gordon (Charley Grapewin), while Jane (Florine McKinney), another salon employee, is secretly seeing Burt (Phillips Holmes), Madame Sonia's mining engineer son. Finally, Sherwood asks Letty to take the next step in their relationship. She asks for a week to think it over. Carol convinces Freddy to take her along on his business trip to Paris. While seeing her off aboard the ocean liner, Letty runs into the Bartons. When Letty later mentions that Burt is leaving on the same ship as Carol, Jane becomes very upset. It turns out that Burt had promised to marry her the next day after she told him she was pregnant. Though Letty tries to comfort her, late that night Jane leaps from her window to her death. Influenced by the examples of both Jane and Carol (after her first and only love turned out to be a married man who eventually went back to his wife, she became calculating and cynical), Letty turns Sherwood down. Then, she reluctantly agrees to marry Bill. Specifically requested by Mrs. Sherwood, Letty is forced by Madame Sonia to go to her home. When her client notices her engagement ring, she reveals that she is getting married soon. Mr. Sherwood coolly congratulates her. However, on the wedding day, she cannot go through with it. The next day, Mrs. Sherwood asks her husband for a divorce so she can marry Robert Abbott (John Roche), the architect of the new country mansion she had commissioned. She tells him that she will ask for no alimony, as she is independently wealthy. Sherwood is furious, as it is after Letty's supposed wedding, but is quite willing to let his wife go. Carol, having finally gotten Freddy to propose, goes house hunting. The real estate agent takes them to see the Sherwood mansion. When he reveals that it is being sold because the couple are divorcing, Letty rushes over to the real estate office to stop the sale and be reunited with her love.

DF-41 is the fourth and the latest generation of the Dongfeng series strategic missiles developed by China. The missile was officially unveiled at the China National Day military parade on October 1st, 2019. Design The missile reportedly has an operational range between . This makes it the second long- range missile in the world, second only to the Russian R-36M, which has a reported range of 16000 km. It is believed to have a top speed of Mach 25, and to be capable of MIRV delivery (up to 12). The development of the MIRV technology is reported to be in response to the deployment of the United States national missile defense system which degrades China's nuclear deterrence capability. The project started in 1986, and may now be coupled with the JL-2 program. Though there have been reports that the DF-41 can carry 6 to 10 warheads, analysts think it most likely carries only three warheads, with the additional payload used for many penetration aids. Richard Fisher, an expert on Asia-Pacific military affairs, says that a typical Second Artillery Corps unit has 6-12 missile launchers and may have an additional 6-12 \\"reload missiles\\", i.e. missiles to be launched after the first missile with which the launcher is equipped are launched, indicating 12-24 DF-41 missiles per unit. If a missile had 10 warheads, that would give a single SAC unit the capability to target the contiguous United States with 120-240 nuclear warheads. Development Air Power Australia reported that the DF-41 was cancelled pre-2000, with the technology developed transferred to the DF-31A. It was incorrectly anticipated that the DF-41 would be delivered to the Second Artillery around the year 2010. Some military experts had expected that it could be unveiled at the 2009 National Parade. However, rehearsals of the military parade did not feature this missile. The American conservative website The Washington Free Beacon reported in August 2012 that the DF-41 had its first flight test on July 24, 2012. In April 2013, Taiwan's National Security Bureau head reported to the Legislative Yuan that the DF-41 was still in development, and not yet deployed. The U.S. Department of Defense in its 2013 report to Congress on China's military developments made no explicit mention of the DF-41, but did state that \\"China may also be developing a new road-mobile ICBM, possibly capable of carrying a multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle (MIRV)\\", which may refer to the DF-41. Later in 2013 the Washington Free Beacon reported that the second launch test took place on December 13, 2013 from the Wuzhai missile launch center in Shanxi province to an impact range in western China, according to officials familiar with details of the tests. The Free Beacon reported in June 2014 that U.S. officials had said by then that the DF-41 was test launched twice since 2012. In August 2014, China Shaanxi Provincial Environmental Monitoring Center website accidentally made a news report about events of setting environmental monitoring site for DF-41 ICBM; the news report (and the whole website) was taken down shortly after getting public attention. The Free Beacon claimed that China had test-launched a DF-41 using multiple reentry vehicles for the first time on 13 December 2014. Later that month, China confirmed that the launch occurred, saying it has a legitimate right to conduct scientific tests within its border, that they were not targeting any country, and the development of the missile did not affect China's policy of not using nuclear weapons first in a conflict. The launch took place at the Wuzhai Missile and Space Test Center in central China and impacted in the west of the country.Chinese Military Confirms DF-41 Flight Test - Freebeacon.com, 26 December 2014 In August 2015, the missile was flight-tested for the fourth time. In December 2015, the missile was flight-tested for the fifth time. The flight test demonstrated the use of two multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles. The missile launch and dummy warheads were tracked by satellites to an impact range in western China. In April 2016, China successfully conducted the 7th test of DF-41 with two dummy warheads near the South China Sea, amid growing tensions between Washington and Beijing about the area. On January 23, 2017, China was reported to have deployed a strategic ballistic missile brigade to Heilongjiang province, bordering Russia, along with another strategic ballistic missile brigade deploying to Xinjiang.Say Hello to China's ICBMs, SpaceDaily.com, 2017-01-30 In November 2017, just two days before U.S. President Trump's visit to China, the DF-41 was tested in the Gobi desert. On October 1, 2019, China on its 70th anniversary displayed the missiles in a large military parade. Rail-mobile version On 5 December 2015 China conducted a launcher test of a new rail-mobile version of the DF-41, similar to the Russian RT-23 Molodets.

He is remembered for contributions made to the study of alpine flora. Life Hoppe, a merchant's son from Vilsen, Hanover, began his career as a pharmacy apprentice in Celle, and subsequently was an assistant pharmacist in Hamburg, Halle, Wolfenb√ºttel and Regensburg. From 1792 onwards, he studied medicine and natural sciences at the University of Erlangen, and following graduation returned to Regensburg as a physician. Here he taught classes at the Regensburg lyceum. He studied the flora of the Danube region surrounding Regensburg. In June 1798 he first explored the Untersberg massif near Salzburg, and almost each summer until 1843 continued his botanical excursions from Salzburg into the Eastern Alps. With bryologist Christian Friedrich Hornschuch (1793‚Äì1850), he published a treatise involving an extended scientific journey to the Adriatic coast and the mountains of Carinthia and Tyrol, called \\"Tagebuch einer Botanischen Reise nach den K√ºsten des Adriatischen Meeres und den Gebirgen von K√§rnten, Tirol und Salzburg 1799\\". He explored the region around Heiligenblut and the Grossglockner several times, where he found and described Eriophorum scheuchzeri, Sesleria ovata, Polytrichum sexangulare, Pedicularis asplenifolia, and Braya alpina. Work In May 1790, Hoppe had founded the Regensburgische Botanische Gesellschaft (Regensburg Botanical Society), the first botanical organization in Bavaria, and presently the world's oldest existing botanical society. Notable members included Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Alexander von Humboldt, and Justus von Liebig. From 1812 until his death in 1846, Hoppe was its chairman. He is credited for describing and naming over 200 plant species. Among his written efforts are a work on the flora of Regensburg, titled \\"Ectypa plantarum ratisbonensium\\" (1787‚Äì1793), and \\"Caricologia Germanica\\" (1835), a book of German caricology that he published with engraver Jacob Sturm (1771‚Äì1848). From 1818 to 1842, he was editor of the popular scientific journal Flora.BHL Taxonomic literature : a selective guide to botanical publications In 1825 he collaborated with Christian Friedrich Hornschuch, Jacob Sturm and Jacob Johann Hagenbach to publish an illustrated work on Alpine beetles entitled Insecta Coleoptrata, quae in itineribus suis, praesertim alpinis.Insecta coleoptrata, quae in itineribus suis, praesertim alpinis OCLC WorldCat Hoppe became an elected member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 1820.

It was released in 1978 on Columbia. Recording Although credited previously as co-producer with Ron Bledsoe, Family Album was the first Coe record with Billy Sherrill at the helm. The LP is best remembered for containing Coe's own version of \\"Take This Job and Shove It\\" and \\"Divers Do It Deeper\\". The former was released by Johnny Paycheck in October 1977 and became his signature tune. The song is a first person account of a man who has worked for fifteen years with no apparent reward, and it struck a chord with the public, even inspiring a 1981 film of the same name. Although Coe's name was credited, the assumption by many that Paycheck, an acclaimed songwriter himself, composed the tune would feed into Coe's growing bitterness with the industry as another one of his peers exploded in popularity. Coe was further disenchanted when pop star Jimmy Buffett accused him of plagiarising his hit \\"Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes\\" for Coe's \\"Divers Do It Deeper\\". The subject matter on Family Album runs the gamut for a country record, populated by songs about heartache, alcoholism, and adultery. It opens with the title track, a seven- minute recollection of childhood and family life with a spoken introduction similar to previous Coe recordings like \\"Daddy Was a God Fearing Man\\". \\"Guilty Footsteps\\" and \\"I've Got to Have You\\" are \\"cheatin' songs\\" with the narrator telling his lover, \\"I know you're worried about where you stand/The ring that he gave you is still on your hand.\\" \\"Million Dollar Memories\\" is a stellar approximation of the country songs Jerry Lee Lewis recorded on Mercury Records, with Coe mimicking Jerry Lee's vocal delivery and even saying \\"Think about it,\\" one of the Killer's favourite in-song expressions, while Nashville session pianist Hargus \\"Pig\\" Robbins cops Lewis's piano flourishes. Coe imitates Lewis directly on \\"Bad Impressions\\", a novelty song where Coe does credible impersonations of several country stars, including Hank Snow, Gary Stewart, and Bill Anderson. Coe composed seven of the ten tracks on Family Album himself, one of the exceptions being \\"Whole Lot of Lonesome\\", a rare co- write with George Jones. Appropriately, it is a despairing song of heartache. Within the song, Coe mentions the name \\"Tammy\\" before singing one of the choruses, a nod to Jones's ex-wife Tammy Wynette. Reception Family Album reached No. 47 on the country albums chart. The album's cover did not help its commercial potential, as pointed out in Thom Jurek's AllMusic review: \\"1978's Family Album features one of the most bizarre covers in David Allan Coe's - hell, anybody's - catalog. He is dressed in a minister's black, flowing robe with an Amish hat, a little blonde girl in his lap, his two - yes, two (of three at one time) - wives standing behind him, and behind them, a black Lincoln Town Car and Coe's Silver Eagle tour bus.

Completed in 1882 for a congregation founded in 1774, it is the town's best example of Stick style architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996, and continues in use by the original congregation. Architecture and history The Congregational Church of West Stockbridge is located in the village of West Center, on the east side of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 102) at its junction with Old Barrington Road. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gable-roofed cruciform plan. A single-stage belfry rises above one of the wings, capped by a pyramidal roof. The gable ends and tower have applied woodwork characteristic of the Stick style, and there are fields of decorative shingles beneath the stained glass windows that adorn the larger gable ends. The town's early Congregationalists were its first settlers, and both the town and congregation were organized in 1774. The Congregationalists met in private homes until 1789, when the town's meeting house was complete enough for use. This building was used by the town for civic purposes, and was shared with a local Baptist congregation until 1793. By the 1830s, the present town center had outstripped the village of West Center in importance, but a new congregation was organized in 1833 to serve the latter area. Its first building, constructed in 1843, was destroyed by fire in 1881. This church its second, was dedicated in February 1882, and was built by local contractor B. H. Hatch of Great Barrington. It was built in the then-fashionable Stick style, to a design by Pittsfield architect Charles T. Rathbun.

The grounds include a fine group of medieval outbuildings. It is a Grade I listed building. History and description Lypiatt Park was the manor house of Over Lypiatt, first recorded in 1220. In 1324 the manor was a possession of the Maunsell family, who probably built the extant chapel. In 1395 Richard Whittington, Lord Mayor of London, acquired the manor in satisfaction of a debt. An engraving by Johannes Kip for Sir Robert Atkyns' History of Glostershire of about 1710 illustrates the Tudor manor house, perhaps the house of Robert Wye, who owned the manor from c. 1505-44. The principal range contained a hall with service rooms to the east, and a three- bay parlour/solar block of living quarters to the west, with two irregular and incomplete courtyards. The northern court contained the chapel and the gatehouse (demolished). The chapel was altered in the early 16th century. It was acquired by marriage and inheritance by John Throckmorton who was implicated in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. In 1610 the house was bought by Thomas Stephens, whose descendants lived there for nearly 200 years. On 1 January 1645, the house was captured and burnt by Royalist troops evicting a Parliamentary garrison, but it was later repaired and reoccupied. Nineteenth century The house was sold in 1802 by Thomas Baghot-de la Bere, nephew of the last Stephens owner, to the local clothier and banker, Paul Wathen, who was High Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1810 and knighted in 1812. He employed Jeffrey Wyattville to add a new range at the west end of the house in a picturesque neo-Tudor style. Sir Paul Baghott was declared bankrupt in 1819, in the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars, when Lypiatt Park was sold in 1824 to William Lewis of Brimscombe, who made some further improvements. In 1841, the house was sold to Samuel Baker, who commissioned the Gloucester architect, Samuel Daukes, to make minor alterations. In 1846, it was sold again, this time to J. E. Dorington, whose son Sir John Dorington, 1st Baronet expanded the estate and employed Thomas Henry Wyatt to make further major alterations to the house in the Gothic Revival style in 1876-77. Twentieth century The Lypiatt Park estate was broken up and sold in 1919. W.J. Gwyn bought the house and most of the estate, and settled there in the late 1920s with his sister and brother-in-law, Judge H.B.D. Woodcock. The latter continued to live there after their death with his daughter, Isla Woodcock, until it was sold in 1951/2, when they moved to Jaynes Court, nearby. In 1959, by then in some disrepair, it was purchased by the Modernist British sculptor, Lynn Chadwick (1914‚Äì2003), whose expressionistic, figurative works in welded iron and bronze earned him international acclaim. Chadwick restored the house and died there on April 25, 2003, since when his heirs have put forward proposals to open to the public an area of the park in order create a permanent display for his sculpture collection. In 2018, Justin Hayward recounted that he wrote the Moody Blues hit Tuesday Afternoon on a Tuesday afternoon while visiting the park.

The Greek Revival building was constructed in 1839 as a Baptist church. After 83 years as a Baptist church meeting house, the building was converted into use as an Orthodox synagogue for 75 years. In 1995 the Sandisfield Arts Center formed as a non-profit to preserve the building. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Description and history The former Montville Baptist Church stands in a rural area of central Sandisfield, just east of the junction of Hammertown Road with Sandisfield Road (Massachusetts Route 57). It is a single-story wood frame structure, set on a granite foundation and covered by a gabled roof. Its exterior is finished in wooden clapboards. The front facade has corner pilasters rising to an entablature and fully pedimented gable, with a two-stage square tower rising above the roof ridge. The basement is fully exposed in the front, with the main entrance now consisting of four doors at the center of the basement level. Above this, a pair of pilasters flank a sign labeled \\"Sandisfield Arts Center\\", and rise to an entablature and cornice just below the main entablature. The interior provides a multifunction space in the basement level, with kitchen and dining area, while the upper area is a large open two-story space. A cabinet previously used as a Torah ark is set against the rear wall. The building was erected in 1839-42 by the local Baptist society, formed in 1829 through the merger of two older Baptist societies (founded 1779 and 1790). The Baptist congregation declined, and the church was turned over to county Baptist organization in 1894. It stood vacant and in declining condition until 1921, when it was acquired by a local Jewish congregation, established in the area after an influx of immigrants over the previous ten years. Under the auspices of the B'nai Abraham Orthodox Jewish congregation, the building was raised and the present foundation was installed. Corner stairs were added, allowing for separate access to the gender-segregated parts of the sanctuary. The synagogue closed in the 1940s due to declining participation. It was briefly revived in the 1980s, but failed due to insufficient numbers to meet Jewish laws. The building was formally turned over by the remnant congregation to the Sandisfield Arts Center in 1996.

The church was designed by H. Neill Wilson, and was completed in 1897. It is a good local example of Gothic and Romanesque architecture, and was the first church built to serve the mill workers in the city's north end. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The present church congregation is Presbyterian. Architecture and history Pilgrim Memorial Church stands in a mixed-use area north of downtown Pittsfield, on the west side of Wahconah Street south of its junction with Pecks Road and Pontoosuc Avenue. It is a modestly scaled stone structure, built out of local fieldstone and covered by a steeply pitched gable roof. The gable ends are slightly parapeted, and there are projecting gable sections at the northern end. The east-facing projection houses the main entrance, and has projecting stone buttresses. The south- facing sanctuary facade has three tall Gothic windows, the center one rising into the gable. The church's construction was an outgrowth of planning by local church leaders to provide services closer to where the city's workers lived. Plans for this site were drawn by local architect H. Neill Wilson, which included a chapel (seating about 300), and a larger sanctuary seating 450. Of the two, only the smaller chapel was ever built. The parish house was built in 1927, and was also designed by Wilson. Unlike the church, which was built in granite, the parish house is a single story tan brick building in a more utilitarian style.

History Early history The beginnings of the JELC go back to 1892 when the first missionaries to Japan were sent by the United Synod of the South, a predecessor of the Lutheran Church in America, arrived in Yokohama. The first worship service in Japan was observed on Easter Sunday of 1893 in the city of Saga on the island of Ky≈´sh≈´ under the leadership of James Augustin Brown Scherer and R. B. Peery assisted by a Japanese co-worker, Ryohei Yamanouchi (Â±±ÂÜÖÈáèÂπ≥).Evangelical Lutheran Church in America: Country Packets - Japan Evangelical Lutheran Church The first 16 believers were baptised within the first 2 years of the work and by 1898, the JELC was organized with 60 baptised members with the city of Kumamoto becoming the center of Japanese Lutheranism. The first expatriate workers were soon joined by missionaries from the American Danish Lutheran Church (1898) and Finland (1900).Deutsche Ostasienmission (German East Asian Mission) Partner - Japan Evangelical Lutheran Church (in German) The first church building was also consecrated in the city of Saga in 1900. In 1909, the Lutheran Theological Seminary was established in Kamamoto to train national workers and by 1920 congregations were being established in major cities like Tokyo, Osaka, and Kobe. In 1925, the Lutheran Theological Seminary was transferred to Nakano, Tokyo. Second World War Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, the (UCCJ) was formed under state pressure and all Protestant denominations were forced to merge with this new body.World Council of Churches: United Church of Christ in Japan All foreign missionaries were expelled from the country and some churches were closed in this period. The JELC ceased to exist and only reconstituted themselves upon the end of the war. Post war period The end of the Second World War saw an influx of foreign missionaries, particularly from the United States. As many as 12 different Lutheran denominations and mission societies established work in Japan. Former Lutheran members from the UCCJ met in Kamamoto in 1947 and decided to withdraw from the UCCJ and re-establish the JELC. The JELC worked in close cooperation with many of the mission agencies and in 1963, the Tokai Lutheran Mission of the Evangelical Lutheran Church merged with the JELC. In 1969, the Lutheran Theological Seminary was moved to Mitaka, Tokyo and in the same year the JELC embarked on a 5-year plan to achieve self-sufficiency and by 1974, the goals set forth had generally been achieved. Current developments In 1993, a Mission Centennial Assembly was held in Kumamoto. Despite having a comparatively small membership with most congregations having less than 50 members, the JELC has sent successive missionaries to serve among Japanese immigrants in Brazil, serving with the Evangelical Church of the Lutheran Confession in Brazil, as well as to the United States among expatriate Japanese. A ten-year evangelism and church restructuring program known as Power Mission 21 was adopted in 2002 to move the JELC into a new era of true independence through structural reformation and a renewed emphasis on evangelism. This includes an emphasis on youth evangelism as well as fostering the Christian growth of youth, the strengthening of the laity and lay led evangelism, clergy continuing education and a program for clergy review, as well as church/congregational restructuring in order to strengthen outreach.Asian Lutheran Communion: JELC Biennial Assembly & Power Mission 21 (PM 21) Structure & organization The current president of the JELC is the Rev.

The largest of these, with about 20,000 members, is the JELC. Other Lutheran churches include the Kinki Evangelical Lutheran Church, the West Japan Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Japan Lutheran Brethren Church, the Lutheran Evangelical Christian Church and the Fellowship Deaconry Evangelical Church (Marburger Mission). Cooperation among the various Lutheran churches in Japan is common, particularly with respect to outreach ministries. Church planting plans are mutually shared in order to avoid duplications. Most of the Lutheran churches have also joined together to form the , which publishes Christian books and materials; one notable endeavor being in the publication of a common Lutheran hymnal.

Established in 1850, it is good example of a rural cemetery, and is the resting ground of many prominent Pittsfield residents, with a number of architecturally significant elements. It also houses a number of Pittsfield's earliest burials, which were relocated here from a cemetery near the city center. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description Pittsfield Cemetery is located north of downtown Pittsfield, on west of Wahconah Street. This land includes a largely undeveloped tract between Onota Street and Valentine Road. The area between Wahconah Street and Onota Street is about , and is the area that was laid out in 1850. Laid out in the fashionable rural cemetery style, the cemetery features winding lanes for circulation, and plantings of specimen trees. The easternmost area of the cemetery, between Onota Brook and Wahconah Street, is an entry area with no burial sites. It includes the entrance arch, a two-story superintendent's house, and the Calvin Memorial Chapel. A structure originally built as a receiving tomb has been converted into a crematorium. History The cemetery was initially laid out in 1850, prompted by the city's growing population, and the fact that its principal burying ground at North and East Streets was full. Although the cemetery started without much fanfare or styling in 1850, over the next 100 years it acquired a number of interesting elements. Funds for the Allen Memorial Arch and Main Gate were donated in 1885 by Thomas Allen, Jr., and provide an imposing entry to the facility. A memorial to Allen elsewhere in the cemetery is believed to be the largest piece of red granite in the world. In 1900 the chapel was dedicated. In the 1930s cemetery officials added the Superintendent's Cottage and a Maintenance Garage. As the cemetery grew in the 1910s, the noted Olmsted Brothers landscape firm was retained to plan the layout of new sections of the cemetery.

No. 27, also known as Fire Station No. 27, on Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood. The museum houses old fire engines and fire apparatus, some dating from the 1880s. The museum also houses a reference library and fire safety learning center. The building was named a Los Angeles Cultural-Heritage Monument in 1976 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The Fallen Firefighters Memorial in front of the station consists of a memorial wall listing all of the Los Angeles firefighters who have died in the line of duty and five life-size statues of firefighters. History of Engine Co. No. 27 At , the Italian Renaissance revival building housing Engine Co. No. 27 was the largest fire station west of the Mississippi River when it opened in July 1930.Brochure from Los Angeles Fire Department Museum (2003) For more than 60 years, the old fire station served the Hollywood community, including the motion picture studios and the stars who lived in the Hollywood Hills. It was also used a movie location by, among others, The Three Stooges and Buster Keaton. The use of the building as both a movie location and a working fire station sometimes led to difficulties. In 1937, a real fire broke out while a Hollywood studio was filming the motion picture, Two Platoons, at Fire Station No. 27. The Los Angeles Times reported on the incident this way: > The entire crew was on hand as atmosphere and the equipment served as a > background. Dick Foran and Robert Armstrong were in the middle of a scene > when the alarm sounded. Moviemaking meant nothing in the life of Battalion > Chief Rothermel at that moment. Before (director John) Farrow could finish > the sequence, the fire engines were speeding on their way to a brush fire in > the Hollywood Hills. The movie company had to wait an hour before action > could be resumed. In 1950, the captain of Engine Co. No. 27, Michael J. Carter, died in the line of duty while supervising a firefighting effort at a recordmaking facility in Hollywood. Capt. Carter is one of the fallen firefighters now honored by the memorial located in front of Engine Co. No. 27. One firefighter, Lawrence T. O'Neill, served at Station 27 for 34 years starting in 1929. At the time of his retirement in 1963, O'Neill recalled the company's efforts in fighting the Paramount sound stage fire in 1929, the Consolidated Laboratories fire the same year, and dozens of other fires over the years. In 1976, an interagency dispute arose, as the Fire Department Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to oppose the designation of Station No. 27 as a Historic-Cultural Monument by the City's Cultural Heritage Commission. Fire Chief Kenneth Long expressed concerns that the designation would make it impossible for the city to rebuild the station or to sell it to build a new station elsewhere. Despite the fire department's opposition, Fire Station No. 27 was disengaged as the city's Cultural-Historical Monument #165 in October 1976. The historic designation saved Engine Co. No. 27 when the Los Angeles Fire Department announced plans in 1984 to demolish 16 old fire stations as part of the largest building program ever undertaken by the department. The station was also listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Rather than demolishing the old firehouse, a new fire station was built next door. The building was damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, but was restored to its earlier appearance for use as a museum honoring the Los Angeles Fire Department. Los Angeles Fire Department Museum Model T fire engine on display at museum The Los Angeles Fire Department Museum opened in October 2001‚Äîthe month after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, New York, and the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia. The walls of the museum are filled with historical photographs on the department's history. The museum houses several old fire engines, artifacts and historical firefighting equipment, some dating from the 1880s. There is also a research library and a learning center where fire and life safety lessons are taught. The benefactor of the museum is retired Los Angeles firefighter and Medal of Valor recipient, William Rolland. Rolland said of the museum: \\"I believe we must begin by educating our youth. A museum is not something you finish; museums are something you start. We will teach and educate children and their parents in fire safety awareness, emergency procedures and EMS technology of today.\\" When the Los Angeles Times published an article on the museum in 2003, it wrote: \\"With its high ceilings, six old-fashioned brass fire poles and nearly a dozen antique fire engines, the Los Angeles Fire Department Museum looks like a set from a Hollywood back lot. ... But Fire Station 27 has a greater purpose: keeping the flame of L.A. Fire Department history.\\" The Los Angeles Fire Department Historical Society also operates three other museums‚Äîthe Los Angeles Harbor Fire Museum, located at 638 Beacon St., San Pedro; the Plaza Fire House near Olvera Street in downtown Los Angeles; and the African American Fire Fighter Museum, located at 1401 S. Central Avenue. Fallen Firefighters Memorial Fallen Firefighters Memorial In front of the museum is the Fallen Firefighter Memorial. It includes a memorial wall with the names of every known Los Angeles firefighter who has died while on active duty. The memorial also includes a series of life-size bronze statues depicting five firefighters. Two of the firefighters are depicted attacking a fire, while a fallen firefighter is attended to by a fourth figure. The fifth figure is the fire captain, shown making a command decision and also caring for the downed firefighter. The statues was based on a concept and designed by Los Angeles Fire Captain Harold Dwayne Golden and created in Minnesota by Honors for Excellence. In 2005, firefighters staged a torch relay through the city to raise funds for the memorial that was then anticipated to cost $1.5 million. Each battalion in the Los Angeles Fire Department took turns running with the torch. At the time, firefighter Dominic Pascal said, \\"You don't want to forget your family members, and we don't want to forget ours. ... It's a significant, emotional event when you lose someone in a fire.\\" See also * Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments in Hollywood * List of Registered Historic Places in Los Angeles * Los Angeles Fire Department * Fire Station No. 14 (Los Angeles, California), NRHP-listed, historic all-black segregated fire station in South Los Angeles * Fire Station No. 23 (Los Angeles, California), NRHP-listed, built in 1910 in Downtown Los Angeles * Engine House No. 18 (Los Angeles, California), NRHP-listed, Mission Revival fire station built in 1904 in West Adams district * Engine Company No. 28, NRHP-listed fire station in Downtown Los Angeles built in 1912 * Fire Station No. 30, Engine Company No. 30, NRHP-listed, historic all-black segregated fire station and engine company in South Los Angeles * 'Ralph J.
