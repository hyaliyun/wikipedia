Founded in 1948 by Arnaldo Ramirez, the label specialized in the rural norte√±o music which had been abandoned by the major labels. By the early 1960s it was clearly the leading tejano music label. Falcon was responsible for numerous recordings by Los Alegres de Ter√°n, Chelo Silva, Ren√© y Ren√©, Roberto Pulido, and many other tejano and norte√±o artists of significance. Falcon's product gained international exposure through the syndicated television program Fanfarria Falcon. The label's activities wound down around 1990, and the recordings were purchased by EMI. The company's historical artifacts are held at the Jernigan Library at Texas A&M; University‚ÄìKingsville. History Falcon's founder Arnaldo Ramirez (1918‚Äì1993) became interested in the entertainment industry at an early age. He learned to become a master of ceremonies, and was a radio DJ in Harlingen, Texas, by the early 1940s. He concentrated on Spanish music, buying radio hours on stations in such towns as McAllen, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico. He then subcontracted some of his radio time to other disc jockeys, and eventually acquired funds enough to open his own recording studio. When his main station, XWAW, ceased operations as a border blaster, Ramirez came to realize there was a sizable audience for the music he was promoting. He set up a recording studio in McAllen, Texas, which was just a few miles from the Mexican border. Early recordings were often interrupted by traffic noise. Ramirez found this necessary as major labels such as RCA Victor, who had previously released numerous recording catering to the Chicano audience, left the genre as a result of World War II shellac rationing and did not resume recording regional music, concentrating instead on larger Hispanic markets in major metropolitan areas such as Mexico City. Ramirez's first record label was Mira, started in 1947 which specialized in Afro-Cuban music. The label started a \\"Mexican Series\\" featuring Pedro Ayala. The next year, 1948, Ramirez started Falcon records which featured Tejano culture. Falcon was dedicated to producing Spanish music, and in particular conjunto Tex-Mex music. Falcon concentrated artists from the local area, including from both sides of the United States-Mexican border, and many of them were undocumented migrants who moved back and forth across. These artists would often pick cotton by day, and make music at night. After signing Los Alegres de Ter√°n, Ramirez recognized conjunto as a powerful cultural development, and actively sought to find other artists in that genre. Falcon was one of the few local record labels catering to Spanish-speaking audiences that expanded beyond local distribution. Ramirez returned to Afro-Cuban music in 1952 when Orquesta Falcon was formed, a unit which eventually toured Cuba. In the 1950s the label was flourishing financially, but Ramirez's knowledge of copyright was insufficient and he found himself in some legal trouble. In 1954 the label signed Chelo Silva, a bolero singer whose style was a departure from the accordion-based groups for which Falcon was most known. Her Falcon recordings were distributed by Peerless Records in Mexico. In the early 1960s Ideal Records became moribund, and Falcon became the undisputed leader of tejano music labels. He started a Spanish-language musical television program named Fanfarria Falcon which was created to promote Falcon artists, but consequently gave Tejano artists heretofore unknown national and international exposure. This syndicated program aired from 1964 to 1981 on 214 stations within the United States including the major Chicago and Los Angeles markets, and was also available in much of Latin America. Despite this, the Falcon experienced diminishing profitability and Ramirez sold Falcon to California-based CENTRON in the 1960s. CENTRON was unsuccessful with the venture, and subsequently returned Falcon to the Ramirez family. Arnaldo Ramirez's son Arnaldo Jr. became an executive of the company. The operation grew to include offices and facilities in Austin, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, and San Antonio. Falcon recorded Ren√© y Ren√© after their 1964 hit \\"Angelito\\". Two unsuccessful singles released, and the remaining recordings were shelved. Recently returned from military duty, Arnaldo Jr. listened to the tape of the unreleased song \\"Lo Mucho Que Te Quiero\\" and decided to release it. The recording was Falcon's most successful recording selling more than four million copies. However, the record was released nationally on the White Whale label as Falcon's distribution did not reach English-speaking audiences. Falcon signed Roberto Pulido y Los Cl√°sicos in 1976, a move which proved highly beneficial to both parties. It became Falcon's best selling group in the 1980s, to the point that Ramirez called them his \\"bread and butter\\". The 1982 devaluation of the Mexican peso affected sales. Falcon's recordings were sold to the Mexican branch of EMI sometime around 1990. Name Ramirez named his company Falcon because he liked the action, aggression, appearance, speed and strength represented by that genus of bird. He also thought that the name sounded similar in both English and Spanish. Legacy Falcon's studio location was an optimal spot to record rural norte√±o music, which appealed to both the working class Hispanic population, as well as to more affluent members of the ethnicity who were seeking nostalgia. This was in contrast to their main competitor Ideal Records, who recorded a more urban, \\"sophisticated\\" brand of tejano music called conjunto that appealed to the bilingual and the educated. One of the first artists to sign to Falcon was Los Alegres de Ter√°n, who continued to record for Falcon for more than 30 years. The group's recordings played a crucial role for norte√±a music, as their music became popular throughout Mexico. Lydia Mendoza and her family made numerous recordings for Falcon between August 1950 until at least 1968. The exposure that resulted from Falcon's publicity enabled several Texas orquestras to not only survive but flourish, and a vibrant orquestra ballroom scene arose as a result, not only in Texas but across the Midwest. For many of its artists, Falcon provided an entry point towards recording with much larger record companies. In 1974 Falcon released Tortilla Factory's self-titled LP. This album was noted for fusing traditional polka-rancheras with jazz phrasing and improvisation, an important innovation within the la Onda movement. Ramirez disparaged some of his own product as una porqueria because of its origins among the very poorest classes. However, he also valued his product a culturally important to the working class, and as a tool to channel ideological currents. In 1994 numerous historical artifacts from the Falcon operation were acquired by the South Texas Archives of the Jernigan Library at Texas A&M; University‚ÄìKingsville. An exhibit featuring these artifacts was on display at the library in April and May 1996. Production details Falcon's records were pressed by Tanner and Texas from inception for twenty five years. When the Tanner pressing plant shut down in 1974, Falcon acquired its own pressing equipment and planned to print and manufacture record jackets in-house. Royalco International Corporation was formed to be the distribution channel for Falcon. Falcon Recording Company was a directly related but separate company that did the actual recording. This studio was also open for public use. Falcon's recordings were distributed throughout Latin and South America, but usually did not appear there on the Falcon label per se as governments required products manufactured by local industry. Instead, Falcons recordings would appear on local labels and Falcon would receive royalties and production credit. It was typical that Falcon would send out around 40 promotional records to radio stations for a release. Artists Subsidiaries By the 1980s, Falcon was running several subsidiary labels, which included: *ARV International *Bego Records (purchased) *CR Records *El Pato *Impacto *Bronco (Falcon's budget label) At its peak, there were nine subsidiary labels of Falcon.

The Gobron-Brilli√© brand acquired a certain fame. It participated in the Paris‚ÄìMadrid race of 1903, and set speed records, including that of being the first car to exceed 160 km/h (100 mph). In 1903 the UK agents for Gobron- Brilli√© were Botwood and Egerton. In 1905 the Gobron-Brillie British Motor Company was established. ;Eug√®ne Brilli√© In 1903, Eug√®ne Brilli√© ended his partnership with Gobron. He created the automobile company Eug√®ne Brilli√© and had cars of his design built by the workshops of Schneider & Cie at Le Havre (former Forge Artillery Workshops and Chantiers de la M√©diterran√©e, bought by Schneider in 1897). His brand was then offering passenger cars and utility cars. Schneider gradually took over the Brilli√© Company. ;Nagant-Gobron- Brillie In Belgium, Leon and Maurice Nagant of Liege made some Gobron-Brillie products under licence. =Locomotive= Brilli√© designed an experimental Naphthalene locomotive, which was built by Schneider in 1913. =Tanks= During the First World War, a meeting between Colonel Estienne and Brilli√© led to the development of a tank project in December 1915. In early January 1916, Marshal Joffre authorized the continuation of the project and, on 31 January, asked for the purchase of 400 of what were then called \\"land battleships\\" armed with 75 mm guns. These were the first French tanks, the Schneider CA1. =Death= Brilli√© died on 28 May 1940 in Seignelay (Yonne).

Life  = Family provenance and early years = Anneliese Stern was born in Berlin and then spent the first twelve years of her life growing up in Mannheim, to where her parents relocated soon after her birth. She grew up in a family atmosphere of intellectual creativity, in which the guiding vision was predominantly secular and left-wing.Anne-Lise Stern (with an introduction by Nadine Fresco and Martine Leibovici), Le Savoir-D√©port√© : Camps, histoire, psychanalyse, Paris, Seuil, coll. ¬´ La Librairie du XXIe si√®cle ¬ª, 2004 () Heinrich (later Henri) Stern (1893-1948), her father was a Freudian psychiatrist. He was also a passionate Marxist and Jewish. Her mother, born K√§the Ruben (1893-1968), who worked as a nurse, also came from a politically committed Jewish family. Her maternal grandmother, Regina Ruben, was a militant feminist and Marxist, and a \\"companion in arms\\" to Clara Zetkin and Rosa Luxemburg. During her childhood both Anneliese's parents were members of the Social Democratic Party, while her grandmother Regina, to whom Anneliese later dedicated some of her written work, had joined the more recently established Communist Party. = Flight from Nazi Germany = The Nazis took power in January 1933 and lost no time in transforming the country into a one-party dictatorship. Like populists through the ages, the Nazis had gained public support on the twin pillars of hope and hatred. The hatred, targeted on political opponents and Jews, became an underpinning of government policy very much more quickly than many had thought possible, and a few weeks after the Nazi takeover Heinrich Stern, by now serving on the local town council, was arrested. Three months later he was released without charge. On the day of his release the Sterns left Germany with their daughter, settling initially with relatives in Paris. Dr. Stern's secretary, K√§the Seitz, stayed in Germany and opposed the Nazis. She was killed by decapitation. = France and war = From Paris the Sterns moved to Blois in May 1933 and started to build new lives. Later they moved on to Lyon and from there to Nice. Anne-Lise quickly mastered the language and passed her school leaving exams (\\"Baccalaur√©at\\"). Towards the end of 1938 she and her parents were granted French citizenship. In the Autumn/Fall of 1939 France (and Britain) declared war on Germany: she had time to start her pre- university qualification year (PCB) at Tours, but in May 1940, after more than half a year of so-called phoney war (waiting), the German army invaded and rapidly over-ran the north of France. With millions of others, the Sterns hastily joined the exodus to the \\"free zone\\" in the southern half of the country which was governed for the next four years as an (initially semi- autonomous) puppet state from Vichy. By this time the Sterns were using French versions of their names. Henri Stern joined the French Resistance in the area round Albi. In 1943 Anne-Lise was living in Nice where she befriended Eva Freud, grand daughter to the iconic Sigmund Freud. The two of them worked together between November 1943 and March 1944 as secretaries at the municipal casino. Later in 1944 Eva died of sepsis following an abortion, having been denied hospital treatment. (Olivier Freud and his family, like the Sterns, classified as Jewish by the Nazis and by the Vichy authorities, were living as refugees in southern France.) Further to the west, Anne-Lise's father, Dr Henri Stern, was able to focus of food and care for internees at Gurs. The camp had originally been set up to accommodate returning \\"internationalist\\" fighters from the Spanish Civil War and was now being used to hold political and race based refugees from Nazi Germany. There was none of the systematic killing that was becoming a feature of the so-called death camps in Germany, and security, at least before 1942, was chiefly dependent on the extremely isolated position of the camp. There were stories of inmates freely visiting the nearest village during the daytime and returning to their camp accommodation in the evenings. But conditions were basic and food was in short supply. Henri Stern was able to extract from the camp his own mother and five other women from Mannheim. He accommodated them in a house which he rented for the purpose at Gelos near Pau. He also collaborated with the Abb√© Glasberg, a Resistance contact known to be working with the OSE and the Cimade, in order to try and rescue children who had been interned at Gurs. During the second half of 1942 a large German army was destroyed at Stalingrad and a massive Anglo-American army invaded North Africa. In France the German army reacted by taking over southern France from the Vichy government. In the streets it became progressively harder to avoid encountering Gestapo officers and their French collaborators. Anne-Lise Stern now lived under a false identity and, after the death of her friend Eva Freud, made her way at the start of 1944 to Paris. Here someone denounced her to the authorities as Jewish. She was arrested on 1 April 1944. = Concentration camps = Anne-Lise Stern was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau in Convoy 71, which departed from Drancy (near Paris) on 13 April 1944. Of the estimated 1,500 deportees it is believed 105 were still alive when the war ended in 1945. Her travelling companions included 34 of the children of Izieu, rounded up a week earlier on the orders of Klaus Barbie: the children were gassed on arrival at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Another of the travelling companions who survived the camps was Simone Jacob, usually identified in sources by her subsequent married name as Simone Veil. She remained at Auschwitz-Birkenau till the autumn of 1944. Faced with the relentless advance of the Soviet army, the authorities now took the decision to evacuate concentration camps in the eastern part of Germany, which included Silesia. She was included in a convoy sent to Bergen-Belsen. From there, with the other women from her block, in February 1945 she was transferred to Raguhn, a labour camp attached to Buchenwald. In April 1945, she was sent in a convoy which took a week to reach Theresienstadt. War ended in May 1945 and Anne-Lise Stern, liberated by the Red army, returned to France, arriving in Paris on 2 June 1945. Her parents had both survived the Holocaust years. Other family members had not. Her mother's sister Ilse was killed at Auschwitz. In Moscow another of her mother's sisters, the gynaecologist and noted abortion rights campaigner Martha Ruben-Wolff, had committed suicide in 1939 after her husband was unexpectedly branded an anti-Soviet spy and \\"purged\\". = Postwar years = During the summer of 1945 Anne-Lise Stern, still aged only 24, wrote several substantial essays about her concentration camp experiences. These were subsequently been grouped together and published in a single volume as \\"Textes du retour\\" (loosely \\"Essays on coming home\\"). Pierre Vidal-Naquet considered that the little compilation \\"matched the peaks of concentration camp literature, alongside francophone versions of works by Primo Levi, \\"Ravensbr√ºck\\" by Germaine Tillion, together with \\"le Grand Voyage\\" and \\"Quel beau dimanche\\" by Jorge Sempr√∫n. Despite her sudden success as a writer, and not withstanding the ringside seat she had been forced to occupy in respect of Josef Mengele's savagely cruel medical experimentation at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Anne-Lise Stern never turned aside from her long standing ambition to follow her father into the medical profession. As Anne-Lise Stern left Germany, her father made the opposite journey, appointed an army doctor and mandated to visit several of the Nazi concentration/death camps. Henri Stern returned with some remarkable reports, but was not able to complete the task before he died of cancer in 1948, supported by his daughter and aged just 55. = The unconventional psychoanalyst = Stern trained as a psychoanalyst, with Maurice Bouvet. Her later teachers and mentors included Fran√ßoise Dolto and Jacques Lacan. In 1953 she met Jenny Aubry, a pioneer in child psychoanalysis in France, and joined her team, working initially at the H√¥pital Bichat, and later at the Hospital for Sick Children in Paris. She focused primarily on hospitalised chronically psychotic children. She became convinced of a deep connection between holocaust experiences and the extreme mental suffering that it had led to in affected children, and accordingly took on the more difficult cases. Psychoanalysis, learned from leading practitioners of the time, became her life's passion. She was a particular admirer of Jacques Lacan, whom she credited with having re-established psychoanalysis after Auschwitz. In 1964 she joined Lacan's √âcole Freudienne de Paris. Prompted by the \\"events\\" (major street unrest and strikes) of May 1968, in 1969 Stern, with a group of supporters including the analysts Pierre Alien et Renaude Gosset, set up the \\"Laboratoire de psychanalyse\\", a treatment facility for destitute patients. The initiative was a consciously political one. Treatment sessions were provided for very low prices. Her mother had died in 1968, and she financed the project with the \\"reparations payment\\" which her mother had received from the West German government to compensate for the loss of her father's medical practice under the Hitler government. Between 1972 and 1978 she worked as a psychotherapist in the Department for Drug-Addicted Patients headed up by Claude Olievenstein at the Marmottan Hospital in Paris. In parallel with her hospital work, she was becoming increasingly well known within and beyond medical circles as a prominent participant at the √âcole Freudienne de Paris, through her contributions at symposia and through articles contributed to Les Temps modernes and other journals favoured by the intellectual classes. In 1979, alarmed by the public manifestations in France of Holocaust denial, began to conduct regular seminars under the collective heading, \\"The camps, history, psychoanalysis - their connections with contemporary events in Europe\\". The first of these were held at her apartment, after which the larger home of the psychoanalyst Dani√®le L√©vy, became the venue. Participants in those early days included Suzanne Hommel, Liliane Kandel, Maria Landau, Fernand Niedermann, Mich√®le Ruty, Fran√ßoise Samson, Nicole Sels, Michel Thom√© and Liliane Zolty.Dani√®le L√©vy, ¬´ Abord du camp de la mort. √Ä propos du travail d‚ÄôAnne-Lise Stern ¬ª, Che vuoi ? Destins des traces, no 23, 2005, p. 137-152 Stern used these seminars to study contemporary documents relating to the Holocaust. From 1992, on the initiative of Isac Chiva, the seminars were held for many years at the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales (\\"School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences\\") in a left bank quarter of Paris. In 2004 Anne-Lise Stern's book \\"Le savoir-d√©port√©\\" (loosely \\"The Deported Knowledge\\") appeared. Together with her psychoanalytical essays published between 1963 and 2003, it constitutes a coherent report of her experiences in the concentration camps. The narratives are factual, without gratuitous attempts at commentary or explanation. In other chapters she describes her teenage years before the war, including her truncated period of study at Tours and the most significant encounters that she had before her deportation to the camps in Germany in 1944. The book allows the reader to share the author's vision of a \\"rebirth experience\\" resulting from the deportation and its aftermath, which provided the all-embracing context for her subsequent work as a psychoanalyst. She presents the Holocaust not as an ill-defined form of \\"big history\\" to be argued over by history scholars, but as a psychiatric reality.  Output (selection)  * Le savoir-d√©port√©.

Apart from that, the Rotenese people also settled in islands surrounding Rote Island, such as Ndao Island, Nuse Island, Pamana Island, Doo Island, Heliana Island, Landu Island, Manuk Island, and other smaller islands. There are some who believed that the Rotenese people originally migrated from Seram Island, Maluku. They were thought to have arrived on the Rote Island during the reign of the Majapahit kingdom in the late 13th-16th century. It was during this time that there were references to the rulers of the Rotenese people. Initially, the Rotenese people founded settlements on the island of Timor, where they engaged in manual slash-and- burn farming and used irrigation system. Language The Rotenese language is part of the Austronesian languages, from the Southwest Malayo-Polynesian languages, which are made up of several dialects. The main dialects are Lole (Loleh), Ringgou, Termanu, Bilba, Dengka, Dhao, Tii (Thie), Oenale and Dela (Delha). Livelihood The Raja of West Rote on Dana island. The livelihood of the Rotenese people includes agriculture, animal farming, fishing, tapping Neera and palm crafting. Lands that are well irrigated is used as paddy field or water catchment. The main farming produce are rice, corn, cassava, sorghum, millet, as well as other commodities like pepper, peanuts, vegetables and coffee; while the main animal farming are buffaloes, cattle, horses and poultry. Rotenese women work on traditional weaving handicrafts, woven Pandan leaves, pottery and so on. Small trades are also common. Diet The most common diet of the Rotenese people are from tubers, porridge, and fish with spicy seasonings. Social structure A portrait of a Rotenese man with his women in full regalia. The kinship system of this people are nucleus family kinship or broad family with patriarchalistic in character, and also maintains an exogamy clan marriage customs. The formation of large families consist of the smaller clans called nggi leo; which in turn the formation of these smaller clans make up of the larger clans called leo. Religion The traditional beliefs of the Rotenese people centers on a creator known as Lamatuan or Lamatuak. This deity that is regarded as a creator, predestinator and the one who blesses, is symbolized by a three-branched pillar. Today, most Rotenese people practices Protestantism Christianity, Catholicism Christianity or Islam. Culture Traditional Rotenese clothing is a kain (a cloth of up to 2.5 meters long, wrapped around the waist, reaching to the knees or ankles), as well as jackets and shirts, with a specific style of a straw hat called ti'i langga. A typical family is small and based on patrilocal marriage; where the wife resides in the community of her husband.

Early years (1856‚Äì1902) Thad√©e Gabrielli was born on 7 August 1856 in Tralonca, Corsica. He came from an old family from the Corte region. His brother Louis Gabrielli also became an advocate, and was general councillor of Mo√Øta and Mayor of Zuani. Thad√©e Gabrielli had a classical education in Bastia, and studied law at the University of Aix-en-Provence. He obtained his license as a lawyer in 1879 and registered as an advocate at the bar of Corte in the Bastia Court of Appeal. On 1 August 1886 Gabrielli was elected general councillor for the canton of Sermano in a strongly contested election. He was reelected without opposition in 1892 and 1898. He was general councillor of Sermanu until 1919. He was very active in the general council as rapporteur on local roads, rapporteur general on the budget, member of the departmental committee and secretary or vice- president of the departmental assembly on several occasions. Gabrielli became a magistrate in August 1892. He was in turn state prosecutor at the Sart√®ne court and then the Ajaccio court. He married Lucie Campi (born 1871). In 1901 he became advocate general at the Bastia court of appeal. Politician (1902‚Äì1920) During the 1902 legislative elections out of loyalty to the Republican party he declined to oppose the incumbent deputy for Corte, Marius Giacobbi. Instead he ran as Republican candidate on 27 April 1902 in Sart√®ne and was elected by 5,955 votes against 748 to the runner-up Jean-Paul Susini, a nationalist. In the chamber he sat with the democratic union group. In 1905 he tabled a draft resolution in the National Assembly on completion of the railway on the east coast of Corsica. In 1906 he published the newspaper Le Petit Sartenais. During the 20 May 1906 general election Gabrielli won 4,228 votes against 4,085 for his only competitor, Quilichini. The election was protested but was confirmed on 9 July 1906. In 1909 Gabrielli ran in a senatorial by-election to replace two Corsian senators, Arthur Ranc and Emmanuel Ar√®ne, who had died. Gabrielli and Nicolas P√©raldi were elected, Gabrielli with 678 votes and P√©raldi with 530 against 259 for Dominique Forcioli, the nearest runner-up. During the triennial renewal Gabrielli, Paul Doumer and Antoine Gavini made a joint list, which was elected in full against the list of Paul de Casabianca. The former senators Casabianca and Giacobbi protested that the election had been marred by corruption, but did not give proof and the senate validated the election. Gabrielli was a moderate but convinced Republican. He spent much of his parliamentary career defending the interests of Corsica. He often intervened in debates, particularly concerning the budget, advocating forest roads and railways from Ghisonaccia to Bonifacio, the Castelluccio penitentiary in Ajaccio, sanitation on the east coast and military service. He was also interested in issues related to the sea in general, was a member of the navy committee and discussed subjects such as the law of towing, the naval code of justice and sale of land on litoral islands. He was a member of the postal committee and other committees. Later career Gabrielli resigned on 8 November 1920 ahead of the January 1921 renewal to accept a position as judge in the civil court of the Seine department. He spent six years as a judge before retiring on 8 August 1926. In 1937 he published a 239-page history of Corsica from its struggle for independence from Genoa to its annexation by France, and then its participation in the French government from the French Revolution to the time of writing. The work has been described as a \\"rather dry summary of facts and names\\". It is alleviated by a short but enthusiastic history of Napoleon.

The pilot project leading to the pilot data for CBAS was established in 2005 as a longitudinal follow-up of subjects at risk of Alzheimer disease dementia (AD). A major step forward occurred in 2011 after receiving a substantial funding from the European Regional Development Fund and the Czech Ministry of Health. This funding enabled to establish the International Clinical Research Center (FNUSA-ICRC) in Brno and also enabled to synchronize the efforts in clinical and translational research between the ICRC and the Cognitive Center at Department of Neurology of the Motol University Hospital in Prague. CBAS now recruits a large numbers of participants across the two sites and is the only longitudinal study of its kind in the Czech Republic. It is also about to become the largest study to study risk factors for AD in Central and Eastern Europe.  Study design  Participants undergo annual follow-up with clinical evaluations, multimodality brain MRI, comprehensive standardized neuropsychological testing including memory tests aimed to detect early cognitive decline and laboratory examination. The APOE, TOMM40 and BDNF genotyping is done at baseline. In a subset of participants, CSF and/or amyloid PET is performed. The majority of participants also undergo a unique translational, experimental neuropsychological protocol that has been inspired by animal research. This protocol consists of various tasks aiming to detect early cognitive and clinical impairment in AD spectrum. The strong translational aspect of this approach, which includes the use of the human analogue of the Morris Water Maze, is aimed at the identification of individuals at preclinical and prodromal stage of AD. Biological sample bank (DNA, CSF and plasma) matched with the CBAS clinical data is also a part of CBAS. From a biological point of view, one aim of CBAS is to biochemically characterize the subjects affected by AD dementia and related memory disorders. The search for new biomarkers has expanded in the last years in the attempt to characterize the disease stage and/or predict the disease course. The currently accepted view is that single measurement of biomarkers in plasma, serum or cerebrospinal fluid has been shown to be not sufficient per se and must be corroborated with combined biomarker measurements. Therefore, there is a focus on expanding the number of measurable biomarkers by including proteins related to the neuronal activity in the CNS, such as neurotrophic factors, enzymes regulating protein expression, and proteins related to neuronal/synaptic function, such as neurofilament light protein, neurogranin and contactin-2.  International collaboration  The CBAS team is well established and internationally recognized, and has multiple international collaborations including Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University (Boston), the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) and University of South Florida (Tampa, USA), as well as University of Queensland (Brisbane, Australia), Drum Tower Hospital and Nanjing University (Nanjing, China), University of Bonn, University of East Anglia (UK) and Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, Sweden).

More than 60 prisoners died in the 2013 Uribana prison riot. The organization Human Rights Watch states that because of poor training and insufficient numbers of guards, corruption and deterioration of infrastructure, armed gangs have seized control of inmate populations. Fire The fire began in the jail attached to the police station in Valencia, a city located about west of Venezuela's capital city, Caracas. The jail was built to contain only 60 prisoners, but when the fire broke out, it housed about 200. The fire reportedly began when, during a riot, prisoners in the jail inside the police station lit their mattresses on fire in an attempt to escape. Later reports stated that the fire began during a party thrown by the inmates. Gunfire was also reportedly heard during the riot that preceded the fire. However, the circumstances surrounding the fire have yet to be officially confirmed, and local officials initially only confirmed that some people had died in the fire. Later on the day of the fire, Tarek William Saab, Venezuela's lead prosecutor, stated that the death toll was 68, which included two women, most likely visitors; and Saab stated that an investigation would be started to ‚Äúclarify‚Äù the incident. Aftermath On the same day of the fire, relatives of the dead prisoners gathered at the police station where the fire occurred, but were dispersed by police using tear gas. The gas was used after the protesters attempted to push their way into the station and detention center in question, the Carabobo state police headquarters, with one officer being injured by a stone. The governor of Carabobo, Rafael Lacava, stated his \\"consternation\\" over the events, and the human rights body of the United Nations called for an investigation. In a released statement, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights also requested reparations for the victims' families. Political opponents of Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro have seized on the fire as evidence that Venezuelan society has declined under Maduro's leadership. Venezuelan opposition leader Henrique Capriles tweeted \\"How many more times are we going to see the same Dantesque scenes with the prisoners of the country?\\" Many of the dead prisoners were buried side by side, and three deep, in a mass grave separated by cinder blocks and marked by crosses.

Carbon fiber reinforced carbon matrix (C/C) can be used up to 3000 ¬∞C because carbon is the element with the highest melting point however C/C are ablative materials which dissipate energy consuming themselves. Carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide matrix composites (C/SiC) and Silicon carbide fiber reinforced silicon carbide matrix composites (SiC/SiC) are considered reusable materials because silicon carbide is a hard material with a low erosion and it forms a silica glass layer during oxidation which prevents further oxidation of inner material. Unfortunately above a certain temperature (it depends on environmental conditions of oxygen partial pressure) starts the active oxidation of silicon carbide matrix to gaseous silicon monoxide (SiO(g)), consequently loss of protection from further oxidation, which leads the material to an uncontrolled and fast erosion. For this reason C/SiC and SiC/SiC are used in the range of temperature between 1200¬∞ - 1400 ¬∞C. On the one hand CMCs are lightweight materials with high strength-to-weight ratio even at high temperature, high thermal shock resistance and toughness but suffer of erosion during service. On the other side bulk ceramics made of UHTCs (e.g. ZrB2, HfB2, or their composites) are hard materials which show low erosion even above 2000 ¬∞C but UHTCS are heavy and suffer of catastrophic fracture and low thermal shock resistance compared to CMCs. Failure is easily under mechanical or thermo- mechanical loads because of cracks initiated by small defects or scratches. The possibility to obtain reusable components for aerospace field based on UHTC matrix into fiber reinforced composites is still under investigation. The European Commission funded a research project, C3HARME, under the NMP-19-2015 call of Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development in 2016 (still ongoing) for the design, development, production and testing of a new class of ultra-refractory ceramic matrix composites reinforced with silicon carbide fibers and Carbon fibers suitable for applications in severe aerospace environments as possible near-zero ablation thermal protection system (TPS) materials (e.g. heat shield) and for propulsion (e.g. rocket nozzle). The demand for reusable advanced materials with temperature capability over 2000 ¬∞C has growing. Recently carbon fiber reinforced zirconium boride-based composites obtained by slurry infiltration (SI) and sintering has been investigated.

She showed considerable promise as a two-year-old in 1925 when she won three races including the Cheveley Park Stakes as well as finishing second in the Queen Mary Stakes. In the following spring she won on her seasonal debut and then recorded a popular and impressive victory in the 1000 Guineas. In her subsequent races she finished second in the Epsom Oaks, third in the Coronation Stakes and second in the Nassau Stakes. She was then retired to become a broodmare but died in 1934 at the age of nine. She was the first and only classic winner owned by King George V. Background Scuttle was a bay mare with a narrow white blaze bred at the Royal Stud at Sandringham by Major Fetherstonhaugh on behalf of King George V. She was sent into training with William Rose \\"Willie\\" Jarvis at his Egerton House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Captain Cuttle, who won the Epsom Derby in 1922, making her a representative of the Godolphin Arabian sire line. Captain Cuttle's subsequent stud career was disappointing and Scuttle was his only classic winner. Scuttle's dam Stained Glass showed promise but fractured her pelvis in a training gallop and it was only after lengthy rest and treatment that she was saved for broodmare duty. She was a great-granddaughter of Stone Clink, a top-class racemare who won the Northumberland Plate and the Cesarewitch Handicap in 1886. Racing career =1927: two-year-old season= On 20 May 1927 Scuttle was well-supported in the betting for the Fitzwilliam Stakes at Doncaster and won from eight opponents. She looked to be an unlucky loser when running second to Stadacona in the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot before winning the Berkshire Foal Plate at Newbury Racecourse. In October she was ridden by Joe Childs in the Cheveley Park Stakes and won at odds of 5/1 from Tetrill. On her final start of the season she finished unplaced in the Wilbraham Stakes at Newmarket. She ended the year with a record of three wins in five races and earnings of ¬£2,947. =1928: three-year-old season= King George V, who bred and owned Scuttle In the early spring of 1928 Scuttle was reported to be underweight and lacking in appetite but recovered after receiving \\"ultra-violet ray treatment\\" from the Jockey Club's veterinary surgeon Mr V. Pryde-Jones. The filly began her second season by winning the Brandon Handicap over nine furlongs at Newmarket in April. On 4 May, with Childs in the saddle, Scuttle contested the 115th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile and started at the 15/8 favourite against thirteen runners. The crowd at Newmarket included her owner the King and the Prince of Wales. The filly looked restless before the start and when the contest began she was left behind the other runners before settling towards the rear of the field. Grand Vixen set the early pace before giving way to Jurisdiction two furlongs out, at which point the favourite began to make rapid progress. Scuttle moved alongside Jurisdiction entering the final furlong and then \\"forged ahead\\" to win amid loud cheering and cries of \\"the King wins!\\" by a length with a gap of six lengths back to Lord Derby's Toboggan in third. Childs, who was given great credit for his calm and intelligent ride, commented \\"I knew this would come. I was in no hurry, especially as [she] is a good stayer\\". Scuttle was stepped up in distance at Epsom Racecourse on 8 of June and started favourite for the Oaks Stakes over one and half miles. She tracked Toboggan for most of the way but was unable to make any impression on her rival in the straight and finished second, beaten four lengths by the winner. At Royal Ascot late that month, Scuttle was dropped back in distance for the one-mile Coronation Stakes and finished third behind Toboggan and the lightly-weighted outsider Romany Queen. At Goodwood Racecourse in late July or early August, she was beaten in the ten-furlong Nassau Stakes by the Alec Taylor Jr.-trained La Sologne, to whom she was conceding sixteen pounds in weight. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Scuttle an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Scuttle was retired to become a broodmare at the Royal Stud. She produced at least two live foals: *Fairlead, a bay filly, foaled in 1932, sired by Fairway. *Canvas, bay filly, 1933, by Solario. In March 1934 Scuttle developed a rupture after producing a filly- foal by Singapore. A haemorrhage ensued and despite the attendance of a leading veterinary surgeon, she died shortly afterwards. Pedigree * Scuttle was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Sainfoin, meaning that this stallion appears twice in fourth generation of her pedigree.

It follows the process of rediscovering women's histories, focusing on the Glasgow Rent Strikes of 1915 and four of the women involved: Helen Crawfurd, Agnes Dollan, Mary Barbour, Jean Fergusson. The title plays on the name Red Clydeside, given to the period of political radicalism in Glasgow and other urban areas along the River Clyde during the 1910s, 1920s and 1930s, but suggesting the involvement of women.  Synopsis  The film follows the literal and metaphorical journey of the filmmakers as they attempt to unearth the details of women's political involvement in the Glasgow Rent Strikes, by visiting archives in Glasgow and London and through oral history interviews with several Glaswegian women who recall the period. We are shown both how women's contributions are often undervalued by archives and how personal narratives from marginalised voices can enrich our understanding of events. The film's interviews with descendants of the strikers establish the link between the Glasgow rent strike and the women's movement of the 1910s. The astonishing extent of this mobilisation of women offers dramatic evidence of the political nature and potential of a supposedly unpolitical hearth, although the intimacy of the film's scope, and its focus on particular and personal accounts, prevents it from describing interactions between the women's movement, class struggle and the politics of European nation states. The interviewees do, however, describe their own lives and education as an informed and highly conscious political upbringing.  Participants  The filmmakers speak to seven women during the course of the film. * Jessie Findley - ‚Ä≥a political activist all her life‚Ä≥ * Margaret Young, Kathy Mailer, Sadie Fulton - their ‚Ä≥parents were politically active during the period‚Ä≥ * Mary and Jessie Barbour - granddaughters of Mary Barbour * Elspeth King - ‚Ä≥a feminist historian, [who] had researched the early Scottish women‚Äôs movement‚Ä≥ and curator at The People‚Äôs Palace in Glasgow, which ‚Ä≥has a collection of suffrage material‚Ä≥  Reception   Funding  The production cost around ¬£55,800 and funding was received from several sources, including the British Film Institute, Sheffield City Council and income generated by the Co-Op's speaking and distribution fees.

The clubwomen also supported the war effort during World War I and provided social service assistance to Indianapolis's impoverished residents and its African American youth. By 1960, when tuberculosis was no longer a major health threat, the club continued its support of the local black community in other ways, such as a visiting nurse program and scholarships to students graduating from Crispus Attucks High School students. In the mid-1960s, after its membership significantly declined, its records were donated to the Indiana Historical Society. Founding In the tradition of many other black women's clubs in the early twentieth century, Lillian Thomas Fox, along with Beulah Wright Porter, and other prominent women of Indianapolis's African American community organized the Woman's Improvement Club in 1903 as a literary group at Fox's home. The club offered its members an opportunity for self improvement and personal growth.Emma Lou Thornbrough, \\"The History of Black Women in Indiana\\" in Membership Fox, an African American journalist for the Indianapolis News and a local civic activist, was the primary leader and founder of the group. She also served as its president. Porter, a former teacher and Indianapolis physician, was a principal in the Indianapolis Public Schools. Her medical training was very beneficial to the club in its philanthropic work with tuberculosis patients. Several of the club's early members were recognized as prominent members of Indianapolis's black community, such as Fox, Porter, Ada Harris, Ida Webb Bryan, Roxie Belle, and Cora Jackson, among others. A few of its first members were professional women, some were educators, and a few were married to professional men (businessmen, physicians, and clergymen). Other members were household servants, cooks, seamstresses, or other domestic workers. By 1920s the club's members were mainly teachers and social workers.Ferguson, pp. 242‚Äì43. According to the club's constitution and bylaws, WIC membership was limited to twenty. The club's small size meant the close- knit group had to work closely together on projects. Membership in the exclusive club was passed from mother to daughter.Hine, pp. 36, 46. Early WIC members \\"believed firmly in middle-class values and the middle-class way of life.\\" They were also active in other local literary clubs, religious groups, and black organizations that held gatherings in Indianapolis, such as the Knights of Pythias, Afro-American Council, and Anti-Lynching League. Their involvement with other civic groups, as well as the local black community's physicians, businessmen, and church leaders helped widen the clubwomen's contact base and obtain support for WIC projects. Club members also supported women's suffrage.Ferguson, pp. 239, 244, 252, 254. Early activities The clubwomen studied topics related to \\"racial pride and solidarity\\" and women's issues. They read the literature of African American writers, the poetry of Phyllis Wheatley, and learned about the lives of black missionaries, evangelists, inventors, and social and political leaders. The members also sponsored educational lectures to raise money for club projects. Prominent black speakers included Mary Church Terrell, the first president of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs; W.E.B. Du Bois, the author of The Souls of Black Folk and magazine editor for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells.Hine, p. 38.Ferguson, pp. 244‚Äì45, 250. In 1904, its second year of existence, the club expanded its scope beyond literary studies to include philanthropic work. Its members began by focusing on the care of African American tuberculosis patients in Indianapolis. At that time city hospitals were segregated and primarily served the white community. There were no facilities to care for black tuberculosis patients, even though the disease had a high mortality rate among African American living in urban areas.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., pp. 129, 220.Hine, p. 37. =Health care initiatives= By 1904 the WIC expanded its mission to include community service, with its major goal centering on improving health care for Indianapolis's black community. The club spearheaded efforts to combat tuberculosis and provide health care to African Americans afflicted with the disease. The clubwomen began by raising funds to send small groups of the city's at-risk black children to the country to regain their strength. Suffering from poor health and inadequate nutrition, these children were deemed to be the most likely to be infected with tuberculosis. The club also established local nurses' training programs. In the early twentieth century nurses' training programs in Indianapolis hospitals were segregated, forcing African American students to leave the area to gain similar experience. =Oak Hill Camp= With no government-funded support, the club obtained permission from William Haueisin, a local white businessman, to established Oak Hill Camp on his property in 1905. The fresh-air camp for tuberculosis patients is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States. Oak Hill Camp was modest in size. It included just three tents with board floors and a temporary frame building that had a partition down the middle to separate the camp kitchen from the living quarters of the camp's matron/cook/nurse. The facilities operated only during the summer months from 1905 to October 1916, treating six patients at a time. The volunteer-run camp was chronically short of cash, but the WIC continued to operate it though numerous fundraising activities at local churches, donations from the community, and personal contributions from WIC members until it permanently closed in 1916. Encroaching development in the area, lack of adequate funding, and changes in trends for treating tuberculosis patients are cited as the likely causes for its closure.Ferguson, pp. 251‚Äì52, 255. =Other projects= After Oak Hill Camp closed in 1916, the clubwomen continued to raise funds care for the city's black tuberculosis patients and other projects.Hine p. 39. Between 1916 and 1918 the club raise funds by sponsoring numerous lectures to increase awareness and educate the community about tuberculosis and other community health concerns. Examples of the clubwomen's other projects include working with Mary Cable, principal of Indianapolis Public School Number 24, to open it as the city's first fresh-air school for African American students in 1916. The clubwomen also persuaded Van Camp Packing Company leaders to change its discriminatory practices and establish a division at its Indianapolis plant staffed with African-American women. In addition, the women hired WIC-member Daisy Brabham in 1918 as its first salaried visiting nurse/social worker.Ferguson, pp. 240, 255‚Äì57, 259.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 223. Between 1910 and 1920, when health care facilities in Indianapolis were segregated and the city's black population was rapidly increasing, facilities in Indianapolis that provided care for black tuberculosis patients were limited. Sunnyside Sanitarium admitted only nineteen blacks in 1918. (The hospital opened in 1917 and was the only one in Marion County to provide care for tuberculosis patients.) Public funds were not allocated to assist black tuberculosis patients in the county until 1919. Despite challenges and setbacks, the WIC continued its efforts to provide tuberculosis care for blacks by becoming involved in year-round social work.Ferguson, pp. 248‚Äì49.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., pp. 128, 220. Wartime support In addition to its health care initiatives in Indiana, the all-black women's club supported the United States and its allies during World War I. The women raised funds for the War Chest Board and contributed to the National Colored Soldiers Relief Committee and Colored Soldiers Comfort Home. The club's fundraising efforts also assisted the orphans of black soldiers. Ongoing community service After World War I the WIC continued its crusade to provide health care for African Americans suffering from tuberculosis. After earlier efforts proved to be unsuccessful, the clubwomen finally got the Indianapolis Flower Mission Hospital to agree to open a room for black tuberculosis patients in 1918, and secured funding from the War Chest Board to help finance it. In 1919 the clubwomen successfully petitioned the Marion County commissioners to appropriate funds to care for black tuberculosis patients at Sunnyside; however, the hospital's reports did not show any increase in the allotment until 1926 and continued to allot beds to black on a pro-rata basis of one-tenth of the county's population.Ferguson, pp. 259‚Äì60. To help compensate for the continued shortage of hospital beds for black tuberculosis patients, the club began providing care at the former Sisters of Charity Hospital in 1922. It operated the facility for two years before purchasing a home on Agnes Street in 1924. The Agnes Street Cottage had space to care for six patients at a time; about thirty-five patients per year. In 1938 WIC members persuaded the city's Flower Mission to establish a segregated wing at City Hospital to care and treat black tuberculosis patients. In addition to its assistance to tuberculosis patients, WIC expanded its social services in the 1920s. The clubwomen provided aid to indigent blacks facing eviction and food to the city's impoverished and underfed African American children. The women also sent some of these children to summer camps in the country. Later years With the development of new medicines and treatments, tuberculosis was no longer a major health threat by 1960. Although the club discontinued tuberculosis-related work, it continued to support the local African American community in other ways. The clubwomen paid a visiting nurse to provide advice to black families and to help them get medical care and social services. The club also provided scholarships to students graduating from Crispus Attucks High School continue their education. By the mid-1960s, with membership significantly declining, the club's records were donated to the Indiana Historical Society.\\"Historical Sketch\\" in Legacy While other community groups participated with the Woman's Improvement Club, it is the group considered to be the initiator and leader of the effort to provide tuberculosis facilities for black patients in Indianapolis. Between 1905 and 1935 the club provided health care to the city's African-American community, especially its tuberculosis patients, assisted its impoverished residents, and aided at-risk youth.Ferguson, p. 261.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 597. While the club provided its members with opportunities for personal growth, educational improvement, and community service, it approached tuberculosis work in the \\"professional and scientific manner that prevailed during the Progressive Era.\\" Notes References  * * Thornbrough, Emma Lou, \\"The History of Black Women in Indiana\\" in Category:African-American women's organizations Category:Women's organizations based in the United States Category:Women's clubs in the United States Category:African-American history of Indianapolis ","title":"Woman's Improvement Club (Indianapolis)"},{"id":"56975236","text":"Kull is a surname.

It is one of the historic Five Manors of Fulbourn and recorded to have existed 1066 AD to 1539 AD. Moat of the former Zouches Castle.  Creation  The eponymous manor was built by Alan la Zouche, Earl of Brittany (the same family that held Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire) in the 13th century on an earlier site. The moat ditch and platform are likely to have been constructed in the 12th or 13th century, obscuring who exactly built the structure. It came in the hands of the Zouches in 1230, following peace with Brittany. Alan la Zouche, then viscount of Rohan, granted his Cambridgeshire lands to Roger la Zouch. The Zouches and their successors continued to hold Zouches Manor of the honor of Richmond into the 15th century in socage, rendering two gilt spurs yearly into the 15th century. After 1500 the tenure was reckoned as knight service.  Dunmowes Manor  It later came into ownership by the Dowcra family when it was known as Dunmowes Manor. There is ambiguity over whether Zouches Manor and Dunmowes Manor are the same or whether the latter was built by the Dockra family in the 16th century on the site of the former. The Dockra (or Dowcra) family has extensive history in the area. Dunmowes Manor took its name from the Norman surname Dunmowe (Saxon 'Dommauua', modern English 'Dunmall'). The Domesday Book recorded the family as holders of a family seat as Lords of the Manor of Dunmow. It is unclear if this is Dunmowes Manor in Fulbourn or the Essex villages 30 miles away at Great Dunmow and Little Dunmow. The site has been extensively archaeologically researched.  Location  The location commands access to the village and the upland areas from The Fens and was probably chosen to defend against attack from the Fens during troubles such as the First Barons' War in the 13th century and the battles between the Romano- British (to the south), Anglo-Saxons (in East Anglia) and Belgae & Norman invaders.

The Bulldogs win over Valparaiso Feb. 16 was the team's 20th win of the season to mark the sixth 20-win season in program history. This accomplishment came after inheriting the second-fewest returning letterwinners in the nation thanks to Niko Medved gutting the program before moving on after one season with a senior-laden roster he inherited. DeVries' ability as a master tactician was further proven when starting point guard and potential MVC Larry Bird Player of the Year candidate Nick Norton suffered a season-ending knee injury in the first game of the MVC season. Despite a sense of complete despair from the Bulldog faithful, DeVries' team proceeded to win four of its next five games to move into a tie for third place in the league standings.

Under his leadership, membership of the union fell, but its financial position improved, as he merged small branches and ensured that all subscription income came to the National Office before a percentage was returned to branches. The union introduced incentives for young musicians to join, removed its joining fee, and increased insurance coverage and legal services for members.

History Saint Sinach Macdara, patron saint of seafarers, is believed to have built a wooden church on the island in the sixth century. It was replaced by the present stone building in the 10th century. The roof stones were cut to mimic wood shingles. Local fishermen traditionally dipped their sails three times while passing the island. A wooden statue of the saint was paid special reverence by locals; in an act of iconoclasm the Archbishop of Tuam ordered it buried. Every 16 July, local people make a pilgrimage to the island for a mass and blessing of boats (including the famous Galway hookers). Devotions were also formerly held on 28 September.

The dorsal fin has 73‚Äì86 rays, the anal fin has 61‚Äì74 rays and there is a well developed pectoral fin on each side of its body which has 7‚Äì10 rays. There are numerous, small, hair like fringes on the blind side of the head and the distance between the upper eye and the dorsal profile of the head is obviously greater than the diameter of the eye. The anterior nostril on the blind-side is surrounded by a small ridge but it is not enlarged. The caudal fin is attached to the last rays of the dorsal and anal fins by a narrow membrane. The lateral line is made up of 120‚Äì138 pored scales. It is greyish brown in colour on the eyed side marked with numerous blue spots, the spots tend to disappear in dead specimens. The pectoral fin on the eyed side has a nearly black membrane contrasting with cream coloured fin rays while the caudal fin is plain. The blind side is whitish. The main identifying feature which separates this species from the common sole is the black colour of the membrane between the rays on the pectoral fin on its eyed-side whereas the common sole has a neat black spot close to the margin of the eyed side pectoral fin. It grows to a standard length of 60 cm but is more usually 45 cm. Distribution Solea senegalensis occurs in the eastern Atlantic from southern Great Britain and Ireland, where it is rare, to Angola, including the Canary Islands. It is found in the western Mediterranean as far east as Tunisia. Habitat and biology Solea senegalensis is a demersal marine flatfish which occurs on sandy or muddy bottoms, these can be in varied habitats from brackish lagoons and shallow waters to coastal regions where the water can be 100 m in depth. The adults feed mainly on small benthic invertebrates, especially polychaetes and bivalves, with some small crustaceans. Females attain sexual maturity at around 3 years of age and a total length of 32 cm. Spawning takes place during the summer peaking in June around the Iberian Peninsula and in the Bay of Biscay when the water temperature is between 15 ¬∞C and 20 ¬∞C. Taxonomy Over much of its range S. senegalensis is sympatric with the rather similar common sole and has been considered a subspecies by some authors in the past, Solea vulgaris melanochira. It is however more closely related to the east Mediterranean Egyptian sole (Solea aegyptiaca) than it is to the common sole, and where these two species' ranges meet there is a hybrid zone, with hybrids being detected from the Gulf of Lions and the coats of Tunisia. S. senegalensis is thought to have invaded the Mediterranean from the eastern Atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar, a phenomenon knows as Herculean migration after the Pillars of Hercules. Human interaction In Europe both the common sole and the Senegalese sole are landed and marketed and there is little distinction made between them in statistics. There are, however, different geographical preferences with the common sole being preferred in northern Europe and the Senegalese sole being preferred in more southerly areas and these preferences are reflected in the higher market price for common sole in northern and western Europe while Senegalese sole is more valuable in southern Europe. Off Mauritainia there is an artisanal fishery for this species and the Artisanal catch between 2006 and 2010 fluctuated between 117,328 kg to as low as 9,049 kg but information on fishing effort is lacking. It is widely produced in extensive aquaculture in Portugal and Spain. Abstract The flesh is sold fresh, normally as fillets with smaller fillets going to domestic consumers and larger fillets to commercial markets such as hotels and restaurants.

Most noted for her human rights work with women, she established the first emergency shelter for women in Thailand and wrote legislation to protect women's rights. She established the Mahapajapati Theri College, the first college to train women as Buddhist nuns in southeast Asia. Early life Kanitha Samsen was born on 4 November 1922 in Bangkok, in the Kingdom of Siam to Thanom and Mangorn Samsen. She was one of two daughters of the couple and her father was a well-known lawyer, who served as a senator during the transition to a constitutional monarchy. Her parents encouraged both Kanitha and her sister, Kanok, in their education. Samsen began her studies at St. Francis Xavier Convent School and later attended St. Yoseph Convent School, before enrolling in law school at Thammasat University. After working for two years as a counselor with women who had suffered abuse and discrimination, Samsen moved to Washington, D. C. to study international law at American University and Columbia University in New York City. She then moved to Switzerland and studied international relations at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies for the year in 1949. Career Returning to Bangkok, Samsen took a job at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where she met Adul Wichiencharoen, whom she would marry in 1950 and with whom she would subsequently have three children: Aim, Anik, and Art. In 1953, Wichiencharoen returned to the United States to study social welfare at Howard University in Washington, D. C. Upon her graduation, in 1955, she returned to Thailand and worked as a supervisor at the Standard Vacuum Oil Company. She also worked for USAID and then as the legal advisor to the Tourist Authority. In 1961, she began a three-year term as president of the Women Lawyer's Association of Thailand, traveling abroad as her duties required. As she visited other countries, she sought out women's shelters, intent on finding ways to improve services to women. She also instituted Saturday workshops where women lawyers gave pro bono legal advice to the public as a way of offering community assistance. Becoming the executive secretary of the Thai- American Technical Cooperation Association in 1963, she would serve in that capacity for the organization for the next twenty-one years. In addition, she advised as a legal counselor to the United Nations, various developmental NGOs and the petroleum industry. In 1969, Wichiencharoen was selected as president of the International Women's Association of Thailand. Participating in the Thai women's rights movement actively throughout the 1970s, in 1974, Wichiencharoen became a founder of The Association for the Promotion of the Status of Women (APSW). The association, made up of both women and men began campaigning to revise and amend laws to provide better protections for women and children. She served as president of the organization and simultaneously became chair of the National Council of Women's standing committee on Women and Labor. Because there were no facilities available in Thailand to assist abused, unemployed and elderly women, Wichiencharoen opened her home to serve as an emergency shelter. When the police did not know what to do with endangered women, they brought them to her. She traveled extensively studying the situation of women around the world, participating in numerous conferences and academic experiences, such as a 1961 study of the family and youth courts of Japan; a 1977 assessment of the Australian family court and women‚Äôs shelters; a 1979 study tour which included observations at the Kansas City Women's Center, shelters in San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and a rape crisis center in New York; 1987 participation in the Federation of Soviet Women Congress in Prague; 1988 lecturer at the Nordic forum and Swedish Women‚Äôs Association, among many others. In 1980, in response to needs identified by the Lawyer's Association, Wichiencharoen began a funding drive to establish a permanent women's shelter. Raising ‡∏ø50,000 ($2,000 US), APSW set up a shelter in the building of the Lawyer's association, offering housing, meals and medical referrals. The first women's shelter in Thailand, the Emergency Home and Relief Fund for Women and Children in Distress overflowed with clients. By 1986, they had outgrown their original space and opened a second and then a third home in the Donmuang District of Bangkok. Recognizing that their assistance was being provided after-the-fact, Wichiencharoen began raising funds to open an educational facility. The Women's Education and Training Center (WE-TRAIN), providing educational as well as vocational training, was established in 1988. Long wanting to develop a clinic to assist with pregnant women, in response to the growing needs of women after the HIV/AIDS epidemic was identified in the 1980s, a clinic was finally established. In 1990, Wichiencharoen founded a policy research center to analyze and advise on socio-economic and political issues impacting women's lives. The Gender and Development Research Institute (GDRI), was established as an NGO, and works across the spectrum of social class to improve the welfare of women. Long aware of the discrepancies in the Buddhist faith regarding women in the ministry, and the subservience required of nuns to monks, Wichiencharoen became ordained as a maechee or \\"lay nun\\" in Sri Lanka in 1993. Keeping her title, khunying, the equivalent of the British dame, she received criticism from the media, but because the king had bestowed the title and failure to use it would be a sign of disrespect, she took the name Maechee Khunying Kanitha. As she was still involved in the advocacy work of APSW, she also did not choose to live in the samnak chii with the other nuns, but established a separate cottage where she lived with a few other members of the community. In 1996, she drew up and lobbied for passage of the Nun's Bill of Rights advocating that women in religious orders should have political autonomy protected by law and have sole authority for allocating their funding ad determining ordination or censure of members. Though the bill failed, she continued to press for measures to improve the perceptions and opportunities of nuns. In 1999, Maechee Khunying Kanitha, working with the Thai Nun's Institute and APSW founded the first college, Mahapajapati Theri College, to offer women a bachelor of arts degree in Buddhism and philosophy. Death and legacy Wichiencharoen died on 13 May 2002 from cancer. She is recognized as a pioneer of women's rights advocacy in Thailand In 1990, at the festivities held at the Sorbonne in honor of International Women's Day, Wichiencharoen was honored as an outstanding advocate for women and in 1995, she received an honorary doctorate in Philosophy, Sociology and Anthropology from Ramkhamhaeng University.

Choi (born June 2, 1970) is an American attorney and politician who has served as the county attorney of Ramsey County, Minnesota, since 2011. He served as Saint Paul City Attorney from 2006 to 2010. Choi is a first- generation Korean-American immigrant and the first Korean American to serve as a county attorney in the United States. He has gained attention for his office's successful prosecutions of human trafficking and for his support of criminal justice reform efforts.  Early life and career  Choi was born in Seoul and immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1973. The family resided for a time in Saint Paul's Skyline Tower, the largest subsidized housing complex in the United States west of Chicago. Choi is a graduate of St. Thomas Academy and Marquette University. In 1995, he received a juris doctor from Hamline University Law School and graduated from the University of Minnesota Humphrey School of Public Affairs as a Humphrey Fellow. Prior to graduating from law school, Choi was a legislative aide to Saint Paul City Council member Bob Long and was active in Twin Cities politics. Between 1995 and 2006, Choi practiced commercial litigation, government relations law, and municipal law with the Twin Cities firms Hessian, McKasy, & Soderberg and Kennedy & Graven, where he became a partner at age thirty. In 2006, he was appointed by Mayor Chris Coleman as Saint Paul City Attorney. As city attorney, Choi served as the city's chief legal counsel and supervised misdemeanor prosecutions.  Tenure as county attorney  In 2010, Choi stepped down as city attorney to run for Ramsey County Attorney, an office vacated by the retiring Susan Gaertner. He received the Democratic-Farmer- Labor Party's endorsement and won the August 2010 primary election over attorney David Schultz and Roseville City Council member Tammy Pust, ultimately prevailing over Schultz in the November general election. Choi was reelected without opposition in 2014 and reelected in 2018 over Luke Kyper Bellville with 78.4% of the vote. As county attorney, Choi oversees all felony prosecutions in Ramsey County, serves as the county's chief legal counsel, and manages the county's child support services. He has embraced criminal justice reform initiatives, establishing a veterans' treatment court, engaging in community prosecution efforts, and working to reduce racial disparities. Along with other reform-minded prosecutors, he has participated in the Institute for Innovation in Prosecution. Choi has also aggressively prosecuted human trafficking and other cases of violence against women, earning recognition from other county attorneys in Minnesota for these efforts. Since taking office in 2011, Choi has overseen several high-profile prosecutions. In 2015, he announced the indictment of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis for crimes related to the coverup of sexual abuse cases. In 2017, Choi's office prosecuted St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez for manslaughter after the death of Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota.

It is one of the most notable buildings designed by influential Santa Fe architect John Gaw Meem and is claimed by some sources to be the largest adobe building in the United States. It is also notable for its historic altar screen, the Reredos of Our Lady of Light, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The reredos was carved in 1761 and originally hung in La Castrense, a military chapel on the Santa Fe Plaza. It has been described as \\"one of the most extraordinary pieces of ecclesiastical art in the country\\". with The church was dedicated in 1940. History The church was commissioned by Archbishop of Santa Fe Rudolph Gerken in 1939 and completed in 1940. The project served three purposes: to provide a new parish church on Santa Fe's east side, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Francisco V√°zquez de Coronado's expedition to New Mexico, and to provide a permanent home for the Reredos of Our Lady of Light. The stone reredos was carved in 1761 and was originally installed in the Chapel of Our Lady of Light, also known as La Castrense, on the Santa Fe Plaza. More recently, it had been stored for decades under less than ideal circumstances in a rarely visited room of St. Francis Cathedral. The new church allowed it to be returned to full public display for the first time since 1859. The church was one of the most ambitious adobe buildings ever undertaken in New Mexico, requiring 150,000‚Äì200,000 individual adobes. Around 120 laborers worked onsite to manufacture and lay the adobes and cut logs and branches into vigas and latillas. A total of 222 large logs were required for the ceiling. The church was dedicated on June 27, 1940. Architecture Cristo Rey Church was designed by John Gaw Meem in the Pueblo Revival style, drawing inspiration from New Mexico's historic Spanish missions. In particular, the design borrows elements from San Estevan Del Rey Mission Church at Acoma Pueblo and San Jos√© de Gracia Church in Las Trampas. Like its antecedents, the church is built from adobe, though it is supported by a hidden steel frame rather than relying completely on traditional building techniques. The building is massive in scale, long, wide, and high, and the adobe walls are up to thick in places. Architecture critic Chris Wilson described the building as \\"the last, great adobe mission\\". The facade is asymmetrical, with two battered towers of different heights separated by a recessed balcony above the main entrance. Inside, the church follows a traditional Latin cross plan with an aisleless nave, transept, and polygonal apse. The ceiling is supported on massive, corbeled vigas in the traditional manner, and there is a clerestory above the altar to illuminate the Reredos of Our Lady of Light which is installed at the west end. The pews, confessionals, and doors are all wooden and were made by students at the Lourdes trade school in Albuquerque.

The Sponsored Point of View panel discusses this problem in 2012 Conflicts of interest (COIs) often arise in academic publishing. Such conflicts may cause wrongdoing and make it more likely. Ethical standards in academic publishing exist to avoid and deal with conflicts of interest, and the field continues to develop new standards. Standards vary between journals and are unevenly applied. According to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, \\"[a]uthors have a responsibility to evaluate the integrity, history, practices and reputation of the journals to which they submit manuscripts\\". Conflicts of interest increase the likelihood of biases arising; they can harm the quality of research and the public good (even if disclosed). Conflicts of interest can involve research sponsors, authors, journals, journal staff, publishers, and peer reviewers.  Avoidance, disclosure, and tracking  The avoidance of conflicts of interest and the changing of the structure of institutions to make them easier to avoid are frequently advocated for. Some institutional ethics policies ban academics from entering into specific types of COIs, for instance by prohibiting them from accepting gifts from companies connected with their work. Education in ethical COI management is also a tool for avoiding COI problems. Disclosure of COIs has been debated since the 1980s; there is a general consensus favouring disclosure. There is also a view that COI concerns and some of the measures taken to reduce them are excessive. Criticisms of disclosure policies include: *authors disclosing COIs may feel pressured to present their research in a more biased manner to compensate; *disclosure may discourage beneficial academic‚Äìindustrial collaboration; *disclosure may decrease public trust in research; *researchers who have disclosed their COIs may feel license to behave immorally; *disclosure may be taken as a sign of honesty or expertise and thus increase trust; *some types of COI may be more likely than others to go unnoticed or unreported; *awareness of a COI does not make people immune to being influenced by bias; generally, people do not sufficiently discount biased advice; *disclosure discourages the judging of work purely on its merits; *disclosure causes more intense scrutiny for wrongdoing. While disclosure is widely favoured, other COI management measures have narrower support. Some publications hold the opinion that certain COIs disqualify people from certain research roles; for instance, that the testing of medicines should be done only by people who neither develop medicines nor are funded by their manufacturers. Conflicts of interest have also been considered as a statistical factor confounding evidence, which must therefore be measured as accurately as possible and analysed, requiring machine-readable disclosure.  Codes of conduct  Journals have individual ethics policies and codes of conduct; there are also some cross-journal voluntary standards. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) publishes Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly work in Medical Journals, and a list of journals that pledge to follow it. The guideline lays down detailed rules for conflict-of-interest declaration by authors. It also says; \\"All participants in the peer-review and publication process‚Äînot only authors but also peer reviewers, editors, and editorial board members of journals‚Äîmust consider their conflicts of interest when fulfilling their roles in the process of article review and publication and must disclose all relationships that could be viewed as potential conflicts of interest\\". These recommendations have been criticized and revised to remove loopholes allowing the non-disclosure of conflicts of interest. The Council of Science Editors publishes a White Paper on publication ethics. Citing the ICMJE that \\"all participants in the peer- review and publication process must disclose all relationships that could be viewed as potential conflicts of interest\\", it highly recommends COI disclosure for sponsors, authors, reviewers, journals, and editorial staff. The Good Publication Practice (GPP) guidelines, covering industry-sponsored medical research, are published by the International Society of Medical Publication Professionals. The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) publishes a code of conduct stating, \\"[t]here must be clear definitions of conflicts of interest and processes for handling conflicts of interest of authors, reviewers, editors, journals and publishers, whether identified before or after publication\\". The Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association's Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing is intended to separate legitimate journals from predatory publishers and defines a minimal standard; clear and clearly stated COI policies. A 2009 US Institute of Medicine report on medical COIs states that conflict-of-interest policies should be judged on their proportionality, transparency, accountability, and fairness; they should be effective, efficient, and targeted, known and understood, clearly identify who is responsible for monitoring, enforcement, and amendment, and apply equally to everyone involved. Review by conflict-of-interest committees is also recommended, and the lack of transparency and COI declaration in developing COI guidelines criticized. , journal COI policies often have no enforcement provisions. COI disclosure obligations have been legislated; one example of such legislation is the US Physician Payments Sunshine Act, but these laws do not apply specifically to journals.  COIs by agent  = COIs of journals = Journals are often not transparent about their institutional COIs, and do not apply the same disclosure standards to themselves as they do to their authors. Four out of six major general medical journals that were contacted for a 2010 COI study refused to provide information about the proportion of their income that derived from advertisements, reprints, and industry- supported supplements, citing policies on non-disclosure of financial information.  Owners and governing bodies  The owner of an academic journal has ultimate power over the hiring and firing of editorial staff; editors' interests in pleasing their employers conflict with some of their other editorial interests. Journals are also more likely to accept papers by authors who work for the journals' hosting institutions. Some journals are owned by publishers. When journals print reviews of books published by their own publishers, they rarely () add COI disclosures. The publishers' interest in maximizing profit will often conflict with academic interests or ethical standards. In the case of closed-access publications, publishers' desire for high subscription income may conflict with an editorial desire for broader access and readership. There have been multiple mass resignations of editorial boards over such conflicts, which are often followed by the editorial board founding a new, non-profit journal to compete with their former one. Some journals are owned by academic societies and professional organisations. Leading journals can be very profitable and there is often friction about revenue between the journal and the member society that owns it. Some academic societies and professional organisations are themselves funded by membership fees and/or donations. If the owners benefit financially from donations, the journal has a conflict between its financial interest in satisfying the donors‚Äîand therefore the owners‚Äîand its journalistic interests. Such COIs with industry donors have drawn criticism.  Reprints  A reprint is a copy of an individual article that is printed and sold as a separate product by the journal or its publisher or agent. Reprints are often used in pharmaceutical marketing and other medical marketing of products to doctors. This gives journals an incentive to produce good marketing material. Journals sell reprints at very high profit margins, often around 70%, . A journal may sell a million dollars worth of reprints of a single article if, for example, it is a large industry-funded clinical trial. The selling of reprints can bring in over 40% of a journal's income.  Impact factors, reputation, and subscriptions  If a journal is accused of managing COIs badly, its reputation is harmed. The impact factor of a journal is often used to rate it, although this practice is widely criticized. A journal will generally want to increase its impact factor in hope of gaining more subscriptions, better submissions, and more prestige. As of 2010, industry-funded papers generally get cited more than others; this is probably due in part to industry-paid publicity. Some journals engage in coercive citation, in which an editor forces an author to add extraneous citations to an article to inflate the impact factor of the journal in which the extraneous papers were published. A survey found that 86% of academics consider coercive citation unethical but 20% have experienced it. Journals appear to preferentially target younger authors and authors from non-English-speaking countries. Journals published by for-profit companies used coercive citation more than those published by university presses. Journals may find if difficult to correct and retract erroneous papers after publication because of legal threats.  Advertising  Many academic journals contain advertising. The portion of a journal's revenue coming from advertising varies widely, according to one small study, from over 50% to 1%. As of 2010, advertising revenues for academic journals are generally falling. A 1995 survey of North American journal editors found that 57% felt responsible for the honesty of the pharmaceutical advertisements they ran and 40% supported peer-review of such advertisements. An interest in increasing advertising revenue can conflict with interests in journalistic independence and truthfulness.  Sponsored supplements  As of 2002, some journals publish supplements that often either cover an industry-funded conference or are \\"symposia\\" on a given topic. These supplements are often subsidized by an external sponsor with a financial interest in the outcome of research in that field; for instance, a drug manufacturer or food industry group. Such supplements can have guest editors, are often not peer-reviewed to the same standard as the journal itself, and are more likely to use promotional language. Many journals do not publish sponsored supplements. Small-circulation journals are more likely to publish supplements than large, high-prestige journals. Indications that an article was published in a supplement may be fairly subtle; for instance, a letter \\"s\\" added to a page number. The ICMJE code of conduct specifically addresses guest-editor COIs; \\"Editors should publish regular disclosure statements about potential conflicts of interests related to their own commitments and those of their journal staff. Guest editors should follow these same procedures.\\" It also states that the usual journal editor must maintain full control and responsibility and that \\"Editing by the funding organization should not be permitted\\". The US Food and Drug Administration states that supplement articles should not be used as medical-marketing reprints but it had no legal authority to prohibit the practice.  Publishers  Publishers may not be strongly motivated to ensure the quality of their journals. In the Australasian Journal of Bone & Joint Medicine case, the printer Elsevier Australia put out six journal-like publications containing articles about drugs made by the Merck Group, which paid for and controlled the publications. = COIs of journal staff = Personal conflicts of interest faced by journal staff are individual. If a person leaves the journal‚Äîunlike the COIs of journals as institutions‚Äîtheir personal COIs will go with them. , COIs of journal staff are less commonly reported than those of authors. For instance, one 2009 World Association of Medical Editors (WAME) policy document states, \\"Some journals list editors' competing interests on their website but this is not a standard practice\\". The ICMJE, however, requires that the COIs of editors and journal staff be regularly declared and published. One 2017 Open Payments study of influential US medical journals found half of the editors received payments from industry; another study that used a different sample of editors reported two-thirds. , systems for reporting wrongdoing by editors often do not exist. Many journals have policies limiting COIs staff can enter into; for instance, accepting gifts of travel, accommodation, or hospitality may be prohibited. , such policies are rarely published. Most journals do not offer COI training; , many journals report a desire for better guidance on COI policy. = COIs of peer reviewers = The ICJME recommendations require peer reviewers to disclose conflicts of interest. Half to two-thirds of journals, depending on subject area, did not follow this recommendation in the first two decades of the 21st century. , if a peer reviewer fails to disclose a conflict of interest, the paper will generally not be withdrawn, corrected, or re- reviewed; the reviews, however, may be reassessed. If peer reviewers are anonymous, their COIs cannot be published. Some experiments with publishing the names of reviewers have been undertaken; in others, the identities of reviewers were disclosed to authors, allowing authors to identify COIs. Some journals now have an open review process in which everything, including the peer reviews and the names of the reviewers, and editor and author comment, is published transparently online. The duties of peer review may conflict with social interests or institutional loyalties; to avoid such COIs, reviewers may be excluded if they have some forms of COI, such as having collaborated with the author. Readers of academic papers may spot errors, informally or as part of formal post-publication peer review. Academics submitting corrections to papers are often asked by the publishers to pay over 1,000 US dollars for the publication of their corrections. = COIs of article authors = Authors of individual papers may face conflicts with their duty to report truthfully and impartially. Financial, career, political, and social interests are all sources of conflict. Authors' institutional interests become sources of conflict when the research might harm the institution's finances or offend the author's superiors. Many journals require authors to self-declare their conflicts of interest when submitting a paper; they also ask specific questions about conflicts of interest. The questions vary substantially between journals. Author declarations, however, are rarely verified by the journal. As of 2018, \\"most editors say it's not their job to make sure authors reveal financial conflicts, and there are no repercussions for those who don't\\". Even if a conflict of interest is reported by a reader after publication, COPE does not suggest independent investigation, . As a result, , authors often fail to declare their conflicts of interest. Rates of nondisclosure vary widely in reported studies. The COPE retraction guidelines state, \\"Retractions are also used to alert readers to ... failure to disclose a major competing interest likely to influence interpretations or recommendations\\". , however, if an author fails to disclose a COI, the paper will usually be corrected; it will not usually be retracted. Paper retractions, notifications to superiors, and publication bans are possible. Non-disclosure incidents harm academic careers. Authors are held to have collective responsibility for the contents of an article; if one author fails to declare a conflict of interest, the peer review process may be deemed compromised and the whole paper retracted. The publisher may charge authors substantial fees for retracting papers, even in cases of honest error, giving them a financial disincentive to correct the record. Public registries of author COIs have been suggested. Authors face administrative burdens in declaring COIs; standardized declarations or a registry could reduce these.  Ghost authors and non-contributing authors  Ghost authorship, where a writer contributes but is not credited, has been estimated to affect a significant proportion of the research literature. Honorary authorship, where an author is credited but did not contribute, is more common. Being named as an author on many papers is good for an academic's career. Failure to adhere to authorship standards is rarely punished. To avoid misreported authorship, a requirement that all authors describe the contribution they made to the study (\\"movie-style credits\\") has been advocated for. Ghostwriters may be legally liable for fraud. The ICMJE criteria for authorship require that authors contribute: > * Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the > acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; and * > Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual > content; and * Final approval of the version to be published; and * > Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that > questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are > appropriately investigated and resolved. The ICMJE requires that \\"All those designated as authors should meet all four criteria for authorship, and all who meet the four criteria should be identified as authors. Those who do not meet all four criteria should be acknowledged.\\" Academics who have had publication ethics training and those who are aware of the ICMJE authorship criteria are more stringent in their concepts of authorship and are more likely to consider breaches of authorship as misconduct, as are more junior researchers. Awareness is low; one study found only about half of researchers had read the ICJME criteria. = COIs of study sponsors = If a study requires outside funding, this can be a major source of conflicting interests; for instance in cases where the manufacturer of a drug is funding a study into its safety and efficacy or where the sponsor hopes to use the research to defend itself in litigation. Sponsors of a study may involve themselves in the design, execution, analysis, and write-up of a study. In extreme cases, they may carry out the research and ghostwrite the article with almost no involvement from the nominal author. Movie-style credits are advocated as a way to avoid this. There are many opportunities for bias in trial design and trial reporting. For instance, a trial that compares a drug against the wrong dose of a competing drug may produce spuriously positive results. In some cases, a contract with a sponsor may mean those named as investigators and authors on the papers may not have access to the trial data, control over the publication text, or the freedom to talk about their work. While authors and institutions have an interest in avoiding such contracts, it conflicts with their interest in competing for funding from potential study sponsors. Institutions that set stricter ethical standards for sponsor contracts lose contracts and funding when sponsors go elsewhere. Sponsors have required contractual promises that the study is not reported without the sponsor's approval (gag clauses) and some have sued authors over compliance. Trials may go unpublished to keep commercial information secret or because the trial results were unfavourable. Some journals require that human trials be registered to be considered for publication; some require the declaration of any gag clauses as a conflict of interest; since 2001, some also require a statement that the authors have not agreed to a gag clause. Some journals require a promise to provide access to the original data to researchers intending to replicate the work. Some research ethics boards, universities, and national laws prohibit gag clauses. Gag clauses may not be legally enforceable if compliance would cause sufficient public harm. Non- publication has been found to be more common in industry-funded trials, contributing to publication bias. It has been suggested that having many sponsors with different interests protects against COI-induced bias. , there was no evidence for or against this hypothesis. Effect on conclusions of research There is evidence that industry funding of studies of medical devices and drugs results in these studies having more positive conclusions regarding efficacy (funding bias). A similar relationship has been found in clinical trials of surgical interventions, where industry funding leads to researchers exaggerating the positive nature of their findings. Not all studies have found a statistically significant relationship between industry funding and the study outcome.  Interests of research participants  Chronically ill medical research participants report expectation of being told about COIs and some report they would not participate if the researcher had some sorts of COIs. With few exceptions, multiple ethical guidelines forbid researchers with a financial interest in the outcome from being involved in human trials. The consent agreements entered into with study participants may be legally binding on the academics but not on the sponsor, unless the sponsor has a contractual commitment saying otherwise. Ethical rules, including the Declaration of Helsinki, require the publication of results of human trials. participants in which are often motivated by a desire to improve medical knowledge. Patients may be harmed if safety data, such risks to patients, are kept secret. Duties to human-research participants can therefore conflict with interests in non-publication such as gag clauses.  Publication of COI declarations  Some journals place COI declarations at the beginning of an article but most put it in smaller print at the end. Positioning makes a difference; if readers feel they are being manipulated from the beginning of a text, they read more critically than if the same feeling is produced at the end of a text. According to the ICMJE, \\"each journal should develop standards with regard to the form the [COI] information should take and where it will be posted\\". It is often placed after the body of the article, just before the reference section. Some COI statements, like those of anonymous reviewers, may not be published at all. COI statements are sometimes paywalled so they are only visible to those who have paid for full text access. This is not considered ethical by the Committee on Publication Ethics. In 2017 PubMed began including COI statements at the end of the abstract and before the body of the article after receiving complaints that because COI declarations were only included in full article texts, they often went unseen in paywalled articles. Only COI statements that are appropriately formatted and tagged by the publisher are included. Science journalism rarely reports COI information from the academic article reported upon; in some studies, fewer than 1% of stories included COI information.  False statements of COIs  Failure to disclose a conflict of interest may, depending on the circumstances, be considered a form of corruption or academic misconduct.

The company based in Chantilly, Virginia was formed in 2012 as a spin-off of the services division of L-3 Communications Holdings. As of 2017, Engility reports an annual revenue of about $2 billion. On September 10, 2018, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) announced it was buying Engility for about $2.5 billion.  History  Engility, previously known as L-3 Services, Inc., became an independent publicly traded corporation in July 2012 as part of a spin-off transaction by L-3 Communications Corporation. At the time of the spin-off, the new company was estimated to have an annual revenue of $1.6 to $2 billion and employed about 9,000 to 10,000 people. The L-3 Services Group EVP, Tony Smeraglinolo, was announced as the CEO of the new defense contractor firm. Following the spin-off from its New York-based parent company, Engility established its headquarters in Chantilly, Virginia, in the Washington metropolitan area. The new company acquired much of L-3's services business, while its former parent company retained most of the products business. In January 2013, the Associated Press reported that Engility had paid a $5.28 million settlement to 71 former inmates of Abu Ghraib prison. The company had inherited lawsuits from L-3 Services Group which in turn had inherited them when L-3 Communications acquired Titan Corporation. The contract with the U.S. Military called for Titan to provide translators to support the personnel in the Iraqi prison. In December 2013, Engility agreed to acquire the Andover, Massachusetts,-based Dynamics Research Corporation. Valued at $120.9 million, the deal was completed in January 2014, beginning a full integration of the two companies. In October 2014, Engility announced that it planned to acquire another Chantilly, Virginia-based defense contractor, TASC, Inc. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and General Atlantic, the private equity firms which previously owned TASC, gained a 51% stake in Engility Holdings as part of the merger. The all- stock acquisition deal was valued at $1.1 billion. Engility completed the acquisition of its rival in February 2018 with the final price for the deal reported as $1.3 billion. After the merger, the company announced that TASC's chief executive, John Hynes, had joined Engility as the chief operating officer. The TASC brand remained in operation as a subsidiary of Engility.  Operations  Since the spin-off from L-3, Engility has been based in Chantilly, Virginia, located in the Washington metropolitan area. In March 2013, Engility implemented a significant reduction in its auxiliary workforce, cutting about 40 percent of its accounting, human resources, and payroll departments, reducing its total of 7,800 employees by 4%. After the merger with TASC in early 2015, however, the company was estimated to employ about 11,000 people, of which 4,000 are located near the nation 's capital. As of March 2016, the Engility appointed a former Raytheon employee Lynn Dugle as chief executive. In June 2017, the company eliminated the positions of president and COO previously held by former-TASC CEO John Hynes, who also left the company at the same time. That same month, the company won a contract from the US Air Force to consult on review and evaluation of the space vehicles and missile equipment located at Los Angeles Air Force Base. In November 2017, the US Navy granted Engility a modernization contract valued at $30 million. In March 2018, Engility reported a revenue of $1.93 billion and net loss of $35.2 million in the previous year.

Many classic art and foreign-language films, including those by Jean Cocteau, Sergei Eisenstein, Federico Fellini, Abel Gance, Fritz Lang, and Orson Welles, were featured at the theater. Later, Andy Warhol presented many of his notable films (including Flesh (1968) and Lonesome Cowboys (1968) and others) in this building (as well as in other area theaters, including the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre) in the late 1960s. Other notable films were also shown at the theater, including Boys in the Sand (1971) and Him (1974). History Originally, the theater was built to be a horse stable in 1888 by Charles T. Barney, a banker who later became president of the Knickerbocker Trust Company. The upper stories were rented out as The Holbein Studios, and were occupied by artists, such as John Singer Sargent, impressionist painter Childe Hassam, and portrait artist Cecilia Beaux. Later, in the late 1920s, the stable building was converted into a movie theater. Warhol years Andy Warhol As an advertisement illustrator in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was Gerard Malanga. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at \\"The Factory\\", Warhol's aluminum foil- and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included Freddie Herko, Ondine, Ronald Tavel, Mary Woronov, Billy Name, and Brigid Berlin (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 67. During the 1960s, Andy Warhol groomed a retinue of bohemian and counterculture eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation \\"Superstars\\", including Nico, Joe Dallesandro, Edie Sedgwick, Viva, Ultra Violet, Holly Woodlawn, Jackie Curtis, and Candy Darling. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some‚Äîlike Berlin‚Äîremained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer John Giorno and film-maker Jack Smith, also appear in Warhol films (many presented at the 55th Street Playhouse and the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre) of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time. Less well known was his support and collaboration with several teen-agers during this era, who would achieve prominence later in life including writer David Dalton, photographer Stephen Shore and artist Bibbe Hansen (mother of pop musician Beck). Controversy In June 1970, the 55th Street Playhouse began showing Censorship in Denmark: A New Approach, a film documentary study of pornography, directed by Alex de Renzy. According to Vincent Canby, a New York Times film reviewer, the narrator of the documentary noted that ‚Äúpornography is more stimulating and cheaper than hormone injections‚Äù and \\"stresses the fact that since the legalization of pornography in Denmark, sex crimes have decreased.\\" Nonetheless, on September 30, 1970, Assistant District Attorney, Richard Beckler, had the theater manager, Chung Louis, arrested on an obscenity charge, and the film seized as appealing to a prurient interest in sex.

The current dam is the third structure to be built across the Great Falls at South Hadley. The dam, along with the Canal System, is recognized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers as a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark for its use by Clemens Herschel in the development of the Venturi meter, the first means of measuring large-scale flows, and the McCormick-Holyoke Turbine by John B. McCormick, also known as the Hercules Turbine, which doubled the efficiency of turbines to more than 80% in its time. Background Canal System's original gatehouse The river between Holyoke and South Hadley contained what was known as the \\"Great Falls\\" a natural 53 ft drop in the river approximately 86 miles upstream of the Atlantic ocean. Following the success of the textile mills in the planned industrial city of Lowell, Massachusetts a group of investors sought to imitate this city along a natural curve in the Connecticut River. George C. Ewing a sales representative of Fairbanks and Co. marked what was then known as West Springfield, as a site for future development. By the fall of 1847 Ewing, acting as land agent for the investors involved, obtained possession of 1200 acres of land on the right bank of the Connecticut river at Hadley Falls for the purpose of establishing an industrial city. A charter was obtained from the Massachusetts Legislature in the winter of 1847-1848 under the name of the ‚ÄòHadley Falls Co.‚Äô with a capital of four millions of dollars. In the summer of 1848 a timber crib dam was constructed across the Connecticut River at the Great Falls. The engineer of the first two dams, as well as the layout of Holyoke's grid and canals was Philander Anderson, C.E. First Dam Constructed using a timber frame the dam was filled with rubble and stone and was completed in a matter of months. Upon completion the gates were closed at 10AM and the reservoir behind the dam began to fill. As recorded in Harper's Weekly, ‚ÄúThe engineer took great pride in his work, and when it was finished, and the gates shut down, he is said to have irreverently exclaimed: ‚ÄòThere! Those gates are shut, and God Almighty himself can not open them!‚Äô‚Äù By noon the timber dam had sprung massive leaks, and the footing began to show signs of weakness at 2:00PM. The dam had not been properly secured to bedrock and at 3:20PM the dam gave way and a torrent of water, logs and debris headed downstream towards Chicopee, Massachusetts. A foreman sent a telegram to investors in Boston which read, \\"3:20 p.m., your dam has gone to hell by way of Willimansett.\\" Writing in 1929, one Arthur E. Ferry recalled the scene as he had experienced it as a child- > ‚ÄúSome comical things happened on the day mentioned. For instance: After the > gates in the dam were closed, the water soon drained off from the river bed, > and men and teams were in there getting out building stones, and many people > were walking about, picking up shells and relics, until warning was shouted > that they were in danger, and then there was a lively scramble to get to > safety. I have in mind several Belchertown men who were in there, but > especially do I remember Mr. James H.

Initially built as effectively a wall of wooden timbers, concerns eventually arose that the water's velocity pouring over the dam was eroding the rocks upon which it stood, and it was described by a paper of the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia as \\"simply built with the wrong face up stream\\", where a sloping structure in the opposite direction would have been ideal. Furthermore the vibration of the waterfall on the rocks led to synchronous vibrations in doors and windows on many of the surrounding mills and worker housing. To remedy this, from 1868 to 1870 an apron was constructed of large timbers and rocks which mitigated the aforementioned vibrations, however the angle at which it sloped and the geology of rocks immediately below only ensured that the erosion continued. As early as 1884 the Holyoke Water Power Company, manufacturers, and city officials called for the construction of an improved stone structure which would address these issues and ensure the sustainability of the hydropower in the future, a considerable undertaking at the time as the wooden dam was then the 2nd largest dam in the country at that time by length, exceeded only by the Fairmount Dam in Philadelphia. In a conference with the city's manufacturers that year, the Water Power Company announced it had begun a fund toward the development of the replacement dam, which would not see construction commence until 11 years thereafter, and completed in nearly 16. Present structure A cross-section photo of stone dam during construction in the late 1890s Construction of the third and current dam began in 1895, with the final stone laid on January 5, 1900. At the time of its construction it employed a narrow gauge railroad for movement of base stone, as well as what was then the longest cableway in the world, suspended from either end of the Connecticut River to move stones into the higher reaches of the structure.

The hypothesis, published on 27 April 2017, suggests that advanced alien civilizations may be storing energy and aestivating (hibernating in times of heat instead of cold), until the universe cools to better make use of the stored energy to perform tasks. As the universe cools, the potential work producible by stored energy can increase by a multiplier of 1030 per Landauer's principle. If the goal of an advanced civilization is to maximize the number of calculations done, to generate information processing for tasks like mass-producing simulations, then aestivation would be purposeful to achieve this end. Intentions of alien civilizations Advanced alien civilizations may have other intentions. If the intent is creating large amounts of \\"happiness\\", then energy resources may be used to generate perfect computer simulations of \\"the maximal number of maximally happy minds\\". If the intent is knowledge, resources may be focused on information storage. Such civilizations may go through a time of exploration and then remain dormant until the conditions of the universe are more energetically favorable to best achieve their objectives. Dispute The theory has been disputed by a subsequent paper by Charles H. Bennett, Robin Hanson and Jess Riedel, who claim the notion that more computations could be performed later in the universe's history is based on a misunderstanding of the physics of computation.

According to the historian Frank Owsley, he became \\"the most ardent advocate of war against the white man, as he believed in the supremacy of the Creek culture over that of the whites\\". He traveled to London as a representative of several related tribal groups, unsuccessfully seeking British support against the expansionism of the United States, then was captured and hanged by General Andrew Jackson shortly after his return to Spanish Florida. Name His native name has been written with a variety of spellings in English: Hilis, Hildis, and Hidlis. His last name is found as Hadgo, Hadsho, and Haya. There are also combined forms found, such as Hillishago and Hillishager. \\"The English always referred to him as Hidlis Hadjo.\\" In a letter, Andrew Jackson called him \\"Hillishageer\\". In traditional Creek orthography, his name would be Heles-haco /hilis-hat Éo/ ‚ÄúCrazy Medicine‚Äù composed of the medicinal prefix heles- and the war title haco ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù.Martin, Jack. Creek Dictionary p. 46, 49 Parents and early life Francis was a m√©tis, with a white father and Creek mother. The Creek mother herself might be a m√©tis, as much intermingling of white and Creek took place. White husbands were valued; there was no stigma and no stated view that a Creek woman should take a Creek husband. As was normal among the matrilineal Creeks, because of his Creek mother Francis was accepted as a member of their tribe or nation. Francis and others like him became military leaders, passionate defenders of the Creek cause, apparently to demonstrate their legitimacy to the full- blooded Creek. Francis refused to wear white man's clothing during his visit to New Orleans. He was a trader and metal artisan, the latter skill learned from his father, David Francis, a South Carolina frontier blacksmith and silversmith. He \\"lived among the Alabama and Coushatta people near the point where the Cousa and Tallapoosa Rivers joined to form the Alabama\\", near modern Montgomery, Alabama. Little is known about his mother or his childhood. He was married to Hannah Moniac, half-sister of William Weatherford and aunt of David Moniac, the first Native American to graduate from the U. S. Military Academy at West Point. David's father and Hannah's half-brother was \\"the prosperous and well-known Creek businessman Samuel Moniac. She was a relative of Creek leader Alexander McGillivray,\\" who led the faction of \\"southern\\" Creeks that were more receptive to U.S. civilization. Influence of Tecumseh and Seekaboo Tecumseh, a leader from further north, in 1811 traveled throughout the lands west of the Appalachian mountains; settlement by whites was just beginning. With some encouragement from the British, with whom he had contact in Canada, he attempted to create a pan-Indian confederation, from north to south, that could force the new Americans to remain east of the mountains. His greatest success was among the Creeks to which he may have been linked through one or both of his parents. (His tribal origins are not known with certainty.) His credibility was enhanced by the New Madrid earthquakes and the Great Comet of 1811. Among the Creeks, his greatest influence was on Francis. Although Tecumseh's visit was brief, and he was widely credited later with incendiary speeches now believed to be forgeries by whites, he left behind his partner the prophet Seekaboo (also spelled Sukaboo). One source says that he was a Shawnee, another that he was probably a Creek. Francis had extensive conversations with him. \\"The first recorded public fact of his life is being created a prophet, which was about the latter part of 1812. It took Sukaboo, the great Shawnee prophet, ten days' work to endow Francis with prophetic powers. When that was completed, Francis was considered the greatest prophet in the Creek Nation. He himself now assumed the role of prophet-maker, [and] made many prophets.\\" Red Stick leader Francis, as Prophet, was a leader of the Red Stick (\\"northern\\") faction of the Creek Indians, who opposed American expansion into their lands. He \\"hated the white man and his culture.\\" He particularly disapproved of the husbandry of domestic animals, to the point of slaughtering his own (and burning his house) when he decided, about 1812, to give up the ways of whites. He began to have visions \\"and began to preach with the fervor of a new convert.\\" He founded a new village, Holy Ground, on a bluff above the Alabama River. Opposition by the \\"Lower\\", or southern, Creeks, who favored accommodation to the whites led to civil war, without a clear victor. Francis, who was called later \\"the principal instigator of this Creek war\\", led the attack on Fort Sinquefield, killing at least 13, two days after his Red Stick allies Peter McQueen and William Weatherford attacked Fort Mims in which over 250 men, women, and children were slain. The U.S. response did not take long in arriving, additional troops having been assembled. The U.S won a decisive victory over the Creeks in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814). Francis and some 1000 other Red Sticks and their allies fled to northern Florida, into the semi-wilderness of the Florida panhandle, where they soon aligned with British forces, which openly recruited Indian allies, and became known as Seminoles. At the center of the wilderness was the strong new fort at Prospect Bluff, where Francis and Peter McQueen both wore British uniforms. It was built by the British after their defeats at the Battle of New Orleans and the Battle of Pensacola (1814) and intended as a base for operations against the southern United States. There were so many Creek refugees there (\\"virtually the entire surviving population of Redsticks\\") that famine was a real concern; the British were unprepared for that number of refugees. No food was available for purchase, and crops couldn't be raised without months of delay. Food had to be brought in from other British posts. Trip to England When Colonel Edward Nicolls, the commander at Prospect Bluff, was returning to England, after the end of the War of 1812 in February of 1815, he took Francis with him, as Francis insisted on (and Nicolls discouraged). Before leaving, Francis disposed of the eight slaves he had, probably the same eight his daughter later claimed. The purpose was to get British agreement to the Treaty of Nicolls' Outpost, which Nicolls, on his own initiative and without authorization (in fact, the British knew nothing of it until Nicolls and Francis arrived in England), had negotiated between the Creek Indians and the British Crown. The Treaty recognized the Native Americans as subjects of the Crown, that is, as British citizens. Francis took his son Earle with him, hoping the son could stay and get some education. A fascinating document that has just come to light (a listing of crown expenditures on Francis's behalf) reveals that besides his son, he was accompanied by a servant and an interpreter. (This conflicts with reports elsewhere that Francis was fluent in English and Spanish, as well as \\"Alabama\\" and \\"Muscogee\\".) Arriving in England on August 14, 1815, he stayed with Colonel Nicolls at his home near Eltham, Kent (near London). \\"Nicolls found it necessary to support the Indians [Francis and his son Earle] from his own funds, even to the point of buying them winter clothes.\\" Francis was forbidden from travelling back to Florida until December 30, 1816, which was ordered by Earl Bathurst to prevent the visit from causing tensions with the United States after the Treaty of Ghent. Earle remained in England, and Col. Nicolls made several requests for a subsidy for the boy's keep and education, but his requests were to no avail. There is no record as to what ultimately happened to the boy. The government representative in charge of American policy, Earl Bathurst, refused to see him until a year had gone by, and the meeting was to tell Francis the Creeks should make peace with the Americans, as he could give no support if another war between the two parties occurred in the future . Nicolls was chastised for exceeding his authority; he was posted, apparently as punishment, to remote Ascension Island, and later to Fernando Po. Bathurst gave Francis \\"a brace of pistols\\", a commission as a brigadier general, and sent him home but not without Francis meeting several prominent people, the story of which has not been written. A hint of it is in this report in the American press: His shoulder bag is in the British Museum. Also in the British Museum are \\"a long hunting shirt of deer skin, moccasins, leggings and a belt\\". The following spring he received ¬£200 of \\"clothing and agricultural implements\\" of which a list has survived. Hanging by Andrew Jackson Francis arrived at Nassau, Bahamas in January 1817, where the governor, by order of Lord Bathurst, gave him another ¬£100 in cash. He returned to Florida in 1817 to settle at his new home on the Wakulla River, near the fort San Marcos de Apalache (modern St. Marks, Florida). His daughter Milly Francis in 1818 famously rescued a U.S. soldier, Douglas McCrimmon, who had been captured by the Indians, a story that received national newspaper publicity. After his release, McCrimmon told General Andrew Jackson in person (Jackson was on a ship off St. Marks) that Francis was nearby. Jackson lured Francis aboard the U.S. schooner Thomas Shields by falsely flying a British flag. He was placed in irons and immediately hung at St. Marks by Jackson, without a court-martial or any other legal proceeding, in sharp contrast with the \\"court of inquiry\\" he set up in the Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident. His daughter witnessed his hanging, and unsurprisingly turned down McCrimmon's later offer of marriage, possibly as a result of the betrayal.

Meadow was shot nine times and had attempted to avoid the shooter while struggling to get into a classroom. Teachers and students were not able to open the classroom door. Her father told CBN that as the shooter returned, Meadow covered another student (who died in the shooting) in an attempt to protect her. She was then shot five more times, killing her and the other student she shielded, Cara Loughran, a freshman. Meadow's death prompted her father to found Meadow's Movement, a movement fighting for increased school security to prevent future school massacres. Meadow had planned to attend Lynn University in the fall and spoke about becoming a lawyer. President Trump and others.  Activism  On February 21, 2018, Andrew and his two sons attended a White House listening session hosted by President Donald Trump that consisted of siblings and friends of slain victims along with survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. He spoke extensively on the topic of school security, claiming that schools do not have the same level of security as airports, stadiums, and embassies. Pollack raised that the September 11 attacks happened once and that measures were put in place to prevent it from ever happening again, also stating \\"There should have been one school shooting, and we should have fixed it!\\" On April 20, 2018, Pollack launched his nonprofit organization Americans for Children's Lives and School Safety (CLASS).

Political activism and career  Ryan Petty ran for Broward County School Board in 2018, narrowly losing in the primary to incumbent Donna Korn. In an unusual turn of events, Petty was endorsed by two sitting U.S. Senators Orrin Hatch and Marco Rubio, unusual for a local school board race. Senator Rubio credited Petty for his work to improve school safety and his help in passing the STOP School Violence Act. Governor-elect of Florida Ron DeSantis, a Republican, included Petty on his Transition Advisory Committee on Public Safety.  Activism  In February 2018, Ryan and his son Patrick Petty accompanied Governor Rick Scott to Tallahassee to speak to the Florida House and Senate about the impact to their family of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and the need for legislative reform targeted at improving school safety. Petty spoke to both chambers asking them to set aside political differences to make our schools safe. \\"If this evolves into a gun control debate, we are going to miss our opportunity to get something done,\\" Petty said. \\"[The] message is simple, this time must be different we have an opportunity to get our schools secure.\\" Petty has been praised for his ability to work across the aisle to tackle the issue of school shootings in the United States, meeting with lawmakers and other officials in Florida and Washington, D.C. In April 2018, Petty and his wife Kelly launched a nonprofit organization, The WalkUp Foundation; which is dedicated to improving the culture in our public schools by funding programs that influence engagement within the student body. The WalkUp Foundation also funds early identification & threat assessment programs, which has been demonstrated to help prevent acts of school violence. In partnership with the U.S. Secret Service and The Columbia Lighthouse Project at Columbia University, The WalkUp Foundation is working to ensure that school districts are equipped with best practices and training for proactive threat assessment.

Its first shafts were sunk in the early 1850s and it had a life of almost 130 years, surviving to be the last deep mine operating on the Burnley Coalfield. Geology The Burnley Coalfield, separated from the South Lancashire Coalfield, is in the form of an oval bowl extending north- east from Blackburn, past Colne to the Pennine Hills. Bounded by the Pendle monocline to the north and the Rossendale Valley anticline to the south, the coalfield is dissected by a series of predominately north-westerly trending faults, the most significant fault is the Cliviger Valley Fault at Burnley with a throw of up to in Cliviger valley. The intersecting Theiveley Lead Mine Fault is one of a smaller number of easterly aligned structures. Unlike South Lancashire, only the Lower Westphalian coal measures are available. The hills above are formed of Carboniferous sandstones, ranging from millstone grits to finer grained stone such as the Dyneley Knott flags and the Dandy Mine Rock. The drift cover consists primarily of glacial till deposits, which cause poor- drainage soils. Hapton Valley worked the Upper Mountain and Lower Mountain / Union seams in a syncline that extends from the Thieveley Fault, north-west to Higham where it outcrops. The area is split centrally by the Deerplay Fault with a throw of up to , which runs from White Hill (near Crown Point), under the eastern side of Hameldon and Burnley's Lowerhouse district. The coal extracted from the Upper and Lower Mountain seams was ideal for producing high grade metallurgical coke which was in high demand in industry. Early history The confluence of Hapton Clough and Habergham Clough in Spa Wood. Beginning in 1853 at Spa Wood, two shafts where sunk to a depth of for the Exors of John Hargreaves Ltd. The site was on a spit of land between Hapton and Habergham Cloughs, just south of where they combine to form Green Brook. The shafts were on the north-west side of the Deerplay fault and although the Lower Mountain mine was reached, the pit was sunk in an area where it merges with the Upper Foot mine. The difficult geological conditions led to both shafts being partially filled, and the Upper Mountain mine being worked. Coal was transported underground, raised to the surface and delivered onwards on a network of tram roads, known locally as ginny roads or tracks, by wheeled iron tubs drawn by an endless-chain system which was driven by a stationary steam engine. The tubs ran along circuits made of 22 inch gauge, angle-iron tracks but as the seam only averaged in height, shorter tubs with half the capacity were used underground. Two drifts cut into the hillside connected the underground system to the surface and provided access for the miners. On the surface, the ginny track delivered the coal to a coking plant at Barclay Hills Colliery to the northeast, and ultimately connected to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Gannow in Burnley. By 1868, the underground tracks had reached and in length and about 370 tonnes of coal per day was raised. but sometime later, problems with faulting and water ingress led to mining being stopped. Expansion In the 1880s the shafts were increased in diameter and larger pumping equipment was installed and mining resumed by 1890. The horizontal, condensing steam engine powered four bucket-lifts but a system of specially designed automatic fill and empty barrels was also employed to raise 1,000,000 gallons of water per day from the workings. By 1908 work had commenced on two new shafts (No. 3 and No. 4) 200 metres north-west. They were completed to a depth of by 1910. Manpower was transferred from the old site, with Spa Pit (No.1) closing in 1935. No. 2 shaft continued to be used for pumping. In the early 1940s a small surface drift was driven from Thorney Bank Clough behind the Hapton Inn to speed-up access for the miners. Later years Buildings at the former Thorny Bank Colliery. After nationalisation in 1947, the National Coal Board decided to develop Thorny Bank Colliery to the west which began operation in 1952, utilising the Thorney Bank Clough drift for ventilation. They still saw a future for Hapton Valley, and investment followed, moving its area of operation to the east. In the early 1950s new tub circuits with an increased capacity were installed and work on new drifts heading east from the pit bottom, cutting through the Deerplay Fault, was completed in 1954. The same year a 3300 volt, 200 horsepower electric winder replaced the old steam- driven one. In October 1957, work had to be stopped for several months on one of the new eastern faces after only two weeks in operation because of water ingress estimated at between 700 and 800 gallons per minute. Pumping equipment costing ¬£10,000 was required to bring the problem under control. The ginny track system came to an end for the transport of coal in 1958 when it was replaced by a system of conveyors. In 1961 one final surface drift was cut and future operations were mechanised. In 1962 the colliery employed 67 on the surface and 386 men below ground working two faces in the Union seam where production had increased to approximately 700 tons per day. No. 3 shaft was the main winding shaft, No. 4 was equipped with an electrically-driven exhausting fan and used for winding men only. A second exhaust fan was located about half a mile along the main return airway but its use was discontinued after the completion of the surface drift. The method employed at the time (longwall mining) involved digging two tunnels at either side of the coal face, the intake and return gates, for access and ventilation. To facilitate the placement of a conveyor and electric cutting machine, recesses were cut into each end of the face, known as stables. As the coal was removed and the conveyor advanced, the waste rock was packed into each side of the void and the props removed to allow the roof to cave-in in a controlled manner. The primary means of breaking rock and coal was explosive shot cartridges detonated in a series of boreholes. A coal plough was used in the Upper Mountain mine and an Anderton Shearer Loader in the Union. In 1978‚Äì79, the colliery's most productive year, 237,425 tonnes of coal were raised. Closure Buildings on the Hapton Valley site today. Hapton Valley survived to be Burnley's last deep mine, operating into the 1980s. By this time the risks associated with mining near flooded workings was considered too great and Hapton Valley Colliery was closed on 26 April 1982. The winding gear was demolished at the start of 1983 but many surface buildings survived and the surface drift and shafts were capped. It has been estimated that the proximity of the Deerplay fault, which created a 450-metre-wide barren zone, effectively reduced the exploitable reserves by 1,500,000 tons. Incidents A warning of the dangers of mining occurred in 1855, when a 14-year-old boy was killed and his two companions injured by an explosion that occurred when they entered one of the old workings using a candle for light. The seams worked at Hapton Valley were \\"gassy\\", with very high levels of firedamp recorded at the face. Although the use of powerful ventilation may have been linked to an increased occurrence of pneumoconiosis (miner's lung) in the Burnley Coalfield, no major explosions were recorded in the district until the 1960s. Occasional serious incidents had occurred such as the 1856 death of a banksman who was repairing the steam engine, and a fire which destroyed the winding house in 1908. Two ignitions of gas occurred at number one coal face during the summer of 1960 and work there was subsequently discontinued. A third ignition occurred in the return gate stable on number two face on 4 April 1961. Then just after 9:45AM on 22 March 1962, an explosion in number two district killed 16 men instantly and 3 of the 16 seriously injured men died in hospital. The official report stated that the explosion likely caused by a firedamp ignition, possibly combined with coal dust, originating either in the return gate stable or at a point in the return gate between from the face. While the ignition was probably the result of shotfiring, or from a flash produced by a thermite reaction involving aluminium foil and rusty iron, the source of the gas was not conclusively identified. The victims are remembered with plaques at St Mark's Church on Rossendale Road, and at Burnley Miners Club, which holds an annual reunion.

The side profile closely resembles the Toyota Corolla from the 2000s throughout the FC, FC2, and FC3 facelifts. The FC2 has completely redesigned front and rear DRGs which requires new front and rear fenders. However, the rest of the vehicle especially the side profile remains unchanged due to the base being the old FC platform. The FC2 is sometimes referred as the second generation Geely Yuanjing or Geely Yuanjing II. Third Generation (FC3,2018-) The second facelift was done in late 2017, code-named the FC3. Just like the previous facelift, the platform remains unchanged, and this time the old front and rear fenders of the FC2 were also preserved as the edge of the front and tail lamps remains unchanged. Changes on the front are subtile while the tail lamp was redesigned to be positioned horizontally and keeping the original boundaries of the FC2 generation, the rear license plate was also moved downwards onto the rear bumper.

It is the ester of ethoxyethanol and acetic acid. A colorless liquid, it is partially soluble in water.  Properties  2-Ethoxyethyl acetate is a liquid at room temperature that is used as a solvent. It can be absorbed through inhalation, ingestion, and dermally and should be avoided. It may form an explosive mixture with air. It is also incompatible with strong acids, strong alkalis and nitrates. It may form unstable peroxides and it can soften many plastics, attack plastics, rubber and coatings.  Uses  2-Ethoxyethyl acetate has been used to dissolve polyester and short oil alkyd resins. It has also been used in coatings, dyes, insecticides, soaps and cosmetics. It is also a solvent for nitro-cellulose and is being used for the same applications as ethyl glycol In automobile lacquers it has been used to reduce evaporation and to impart a high gloss.  Metabolism  2-Ethoxyethyl acetate is rapidly metabolized to 2-ethoxyethanol in the blood via hydrolysis. Then, 2-ethoxyethanol is metabolized, mainly by alcohol dehydrogenase, to 2-ethoxyacetaldehyde, which is further metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to 2-ethoxyacetic acid (2-EAA) in the liver. These two compounds are the likely active metabolites, which are thought to be involved in some of the toxic effects. Also in the liver, ethylene glycol is produced. All this reactions belong to the phase I of the biotransformation process. In rats, EAA can be conjugated with glycine or may suffer O-deethylated. After this, it can be metabolized to carbon dioxide. An extra pathway in these animals involves microsomal P450 mixed function oxidases, with deethylation producing acetaldehyde and ethylene glycol.  Safety  2-Ethoxyethyl acetate can cause a slight skin and eye irritation after exposure. High exposure can lead to kidney damage and paralysis. In animals, reproductive and teratogenic effects have been observed.

Life  Carl Elsener was the grandson of Karl Elsener (1860-1918) and the son of Carl Elsener (1886-1950). Karl Elsener had opened a factory in Ibach for the production of knives and surgical instruments, from which the knife factory Victorinox developed. Carl Elsener led the company initially with his father and his brother Eduard Elsener (b. 1926). After the death of his father in 1950, he took over the management. The Swiss Army Knife is considered to be one of his works. Under the leadership of Carl Elsener Sr., the Messerfabrik became the largest company in the canton of Schwyz. In 1938, Elsener joined the company, which at the time had employed 80 people. At the time of his death, there was well over a thousand employees. Elsener is described as a boss who was able to operate almost all the machines himself, who was traveling in the \\"Lismerli\\" or in the blue work coat and who cycled to the factory. He never owned a car. A few years before his death, he felt healthy enough to put in an 80-hour week. In October 2000, Elsner founded together with his brother Eduard Elsener and his son Carl Elsener Jr. as a successor solution, the Victorinox Foundation to ensure the continued existence and further prosperity of the company. The Foundation holds 75 percent of the shares of Victorinox AG, another 15 percent belong to the non-profit Carl u. Elise Elsener-Gut Foundation. The Elsener family owns 10 percent of the shares. After Carl Elsener Sr. died, his son Carl Elsener Jr. (* 1958) has been managing the company since 2007.  Awards  * 2011: Cutlery Hall of Fame Award of Magazine Blade.

It was broadcast on the Mutual Broadcasting System from July 2, 1950, until December 30, 1951. Schedule Hashknife Hartley began as a summer replacement series, filling the time slot of Juvenile Jury. Paired with Hopalong Cassidy in the following half-hour, the substitution gave Mutual a one-hour Western block on Sunday afternoons. In September 1950, the block was extended to 90 minutes when Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders was added in the half-hour before Hashknife Hartley. Format The program featured the adventures of Hashknife Hartley and Sleepy Stevens, characters created by W.C. Tuttle, who served as narrator. Hartley was a western detective, and Stevens was his sidekick; the pair traveled around the old West, solving crimes in various towns. Hashknife The word \\"hashknife\\" has two meanings in the context of western adventures. A hashknife was a tool that camp cooks used to slice beef cubes in preparation for making corned beef hash. That implement also was the basis for a cattle brand that was designed to foil rustlers by making it difficult to superimpose a new brand over the existing brand. The Vandevert family, which developed the brand, became known as \\"the Hashknife Outfit\\", and in turn that group inspired the printed stories and the radio program. Personnel Frank Martin in the title role and Barton Yarborough as Stevens had the only two regular roles in the series. Don McCall was the announcer. Tom Hargis was the producer and director. Writers Fred Luke and Burt Kennedy adapted Tuttle's stories into scripts.

Plot The action takes place in Belarus in the 1980s. The young graduate student Anna comes to her native village to her grandmother's house which she has not visited in 12 years. In the peaceful village she is preparing to write her thesis. Suddenly, two strangers appear in the house and claim that the landlady of this house rented it yesterday to them for two weeks. Events develop and it turns out that strangers got into the twentieth century from the future ‚Äî the 28th century, with the help of a time machine. Historian Kin and physicist Jules are searching for unrecognized geniuses whose life ended before their time. Their goal is to send such geniuses to the future, without changing the course of history (that is, to evacuate them at the time they are supposed to die). Here they have an intermediate stop and they need to go further, in the 13th century, to find there a certain boyar Roman, who lived at that time in these parts, and take him with them to the future. From the chronicles it is known that he invented gunpowder and the printing press, and, apparently, died when the city was taken by the Crusaders. From their point of view, he is a genius, and according to his contemporaries he is a sorcerer. Involuntarily Anna becomes involved in an amazing and dangerous adventure. Jules and Kin, with the help of special equipment, receive an image and sound from the past. They see that the town of Zamoshe, where boyar Roman lives, will soon be attacked by crusaders. After finding out the situation, Jules goes after the genius, but in the past he is discovered. The only one who can come to his rescue is Anna. She proposes to send herself to the past and using her similarity to princess Magdalena to help him escape from the prison. The true genius, as it turns out to be, is not Roman, but his ugly and at first inconspicuous assistant Akiplesha. He is saved immediately before the final destruction of the city. Anna is also safely transferred back in her time.

The solution combines all of the functionality of social media in one place, and will never share or sell information. The user controls the sharing. Background Idka was founded upon the belief that the advertising-driven model cannot be fixed, contrary to what Facebook and others have said. Idka is the antithesis to the 'Stalker Economy', the foundation of today's social networking, were the users themselves are the product. The built-in drivers of the advertising model will inevitably lead to serious privacy violations, but more than that, it creates a problem for a free democratic way of life. The problem of tailored news (echo chambers), dark posts, political ‚Äònudging‚Äô and covert political campaigning, profiling and surveillance is real and has already had discernable impact. Description Idka has been created as a product in its own right, where users pay a small monthly subscription for a service with short, understandable, and fair user terms. The service is free of advertising, news streams, and manipulation. Idka centers on privacy and security, so encryption and 2-factor authentication is central.

He is best known for his early X-ray experiments and later wireless experiments, among the earliest in Australia. He experimented on his own account and together with George Augustine Taylor. There are no primary references to George Taylor experimenting with wireless telegraphy himself. Kirkby was the technical genius behind Father Shaw and his Australian Wireless Company. Early life and family Edward Hope Kirkby was born on New Year's Eve 1853 on the Ship ‚ÄúHope‚Äù 16 days out of Port Phillip, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. His father, George Williams Kirkby, was migrating to Australia with his second wife, Charlotte Augusta Collins, and his three sons from his first wife, Eliza Kempson, who had died in childbirth. The voyage was to take 100 days. The family settled in Sandhurst Victoria, later renamed Bendigo. George was to take up business as a cordial, soft drink manufacturer supplying the miners in the gold fields. These were tumultulous times on the gold fields, with the Eureka Stockade rebellion occurring later in 1854 as the miners rose up in protest at the cost of licences. A further five siblings were born here. It was here that Edward took up his profession of Jeweller watchmaker. His later interest in fire protection may have occurred when he witnessed the burning down of the Beehive building, home of the Bendigo stock exchange. In the early 1880s he studied electricity and magnetism at the Bendigo school of mines, winning awards and later presenting papers on the subject. He married Jane Gill in Melbourne, daughter of the farrier Jonathan Gill of the old forge in Mt Alexander Rd, Ascot Vale. They initially settled in Sandhurst, where their first son, Frederick Strauss Kirkby, was born. They moved to Williamstown in 1882‚Äì1883, where he set up shop in Nelson Place. A further three sons were born here to Edward and Jane. He applied for his first patent in 1888 for a timekeeping system for VFA matches. In 1893 he applied for his second patent for a system of street fire alarms incorporating the switchboards and communication equipment associated with these alarms. It was adopted by the Melbourne Fire Brigade and other cities. Thus began his life of invention. In 1901 he moved from Williamstown to the city, operating as a manufacturing electrician making his systems of fire protection and X-ray apparatus, all the while pursuing his interest in wireless telegraphy. By 1907 Wormald Bros had become his agent making his systems of fire protection. Dissatisfied with their performance, he moved to Sydney NSW with two of his sons, setting up business in the city manufacturing X-ray and medical apparatus. Evevtually he had a falling-out with Wormald Bros, who were getting rich at his expense, and they dissolved their partnership. Looking for a place to manufacture his systems of fire protection, he approached his friend Father Archibald Shaw, a Catholic priest in the Order of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, the assistant procurator to Father Guis at the orders house in ‚ÄúAscot‚Äù in Dutruc St Randwick to build a factory on land owned by them. They refused and built it themselves and let it to Kirkby, who moved in with his men and tools and began manufacturing his systems of fire protection. Father Shaw knew of his expertise in wireless and asked him to manufacture wireless for him to sell to raise funds for the missions. How lucky was Shaw to have an expert on wireless telegraphy, invention, manufacturing capability experienced in patent application landing on his door step. A gift from heaven answering all his prayers. Sombegan the Shaw Wirless Works or the Randwick Wireless Works. In 1911, Edward‚Äôs wife and the rest of his family moved to Sydney. Kirkby sold out of the works to a new company and moved back to the city. He moved into a house at 1 Burton St, Randwick, where his wife died on 26 July 1915, buried on 27 July, and Edward dropped dead from a heart attack at his place of work on 28 July. They are buried together at Waverley Cemetery. So ended a life of invention largely unrecognised as biographers of George Taylor and Archibald Shaw claimed all the credit for them for Kirkby‚Äôs endeavours. Professional career Edward Hope Kirkby was a jeweler watchmaker in Williamstown who eventually became a manufacturing electrician making systems of fire protection, in 1908 he invented and patented the first automatic sprinkler alarm.AOJP patent 11477 14 May 1908 =X-ray experiments= He is first recorded as experimenting with X-ray in September 1896 Williamstown Chronicle 19 September 1896 This is only 9 months after Roentgen presented his discovery of X-rays. He is reported as experimenting with the medical staff at Williamstown Hospital later that yearWilliamstown Chronicle 28 November 1896 In 1900 Dr Clenndinnen was party to demonstrating X-ray at Bendigo School of Mines using a Kirkby manufactured X-ray coil, said by him that it was an excellent one.Bendigo Advertiser 29 August 1900 Kirkby eventually moved to Sydney in 1907 where he set up business manufacturing X-ray apparatus and consulting with the medical professionSalute to the X-ray Pioneers of Australia J.P.Trainor 1946 =Wireless experiments= He was first recorded practically demonstrating wireless telegraphy along with X-ray in 1899 He was demonstrating experiments in X-ray and wireless at the Federal Exhibition and Palace of Amusements in 1903 Argus 1st January 1903 In early 1905, the use of wireless telegraphy in Europe had increased to the extent that there was much concern by the British Admiralty about mutual interference between neighbouring operators, particularly nearby ships using different transmission systems. This concern was reflected in Australia. The Australian Postmaster-General's Department was not considered a reliable source for comment and an Australian reporter chose to interview Kirkby an expert on the subject. Kirkby correctly identified syntony (as it was then known) or frequency selective transmission and reception as the technological solution to the problem. Again in January 1905, the highly mobile Kirkby he conducted a demonstration of wireless perhaps better attributed to quackery rather than wireless experimentation, where \\"on the occasion of the installation of a high frequency electrical apparatus at Elsinore, Glebe Road, Glebe Point. In the darkened room, Mr. Kirkby, who erected the apparatus to the order of Mrs. Clark, showed the visitors the wonders of the high frequency system by which the electric fluid permeates the whole body appearing in jets at all points from the head to the toe of the boot. With all its force the current can be applied to infants, and its curative agency is now established among leading physicians.\\" However later he did undertake some more traditional wireless experiments and we hear no more of such unfortunate diversions. Kirkby continued to lecture and demonstrate wireless telegraphy and X-rays. In February 1905, at a meeting of the Accountants and Clerks' Association in Melbourne, it was reported: \\"After the completion of other routine business, Mr. E. H. Kirkby, electrician, was introduced, and delivered a lecture on Some of the Latest Phases of Electrical Science, illustrated by experiments, which included wireless telegraphy, X-rays and other wonders of this science, which were highly appreciated by all present. A vote of thanks to the lecturer concluded the meeting.\\" In a visit to Adelaide, South Australia in August 1907, a city which was otherwise dormant to wireless telegraphy following the passing of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905, Kirkby is reported demonstrating the technology to a local reporter: \\"At the U.S.A. depot, Gawler-place, yesterday, a representative of \\"The Advertiser\\" was shown a complete model of the wireless telegraphic apparatus by the manager, Mr. H. E. Kirby (sic). The instrument is of a kind used on the large Liverpool American mailboats. It consists of a transmitter, and a receiver, fitted with all the necessary parts, including the tapping key, batteries, spark-inductor, coherer, relay electric bell, connecting peg, batteries, connector for Morse writing apparatus, and air wire. The machine works accurately at a distance of 17 to 20 yards, and with more powerful batteries would doubtless transmit messages to a greater distance. Mr. Kirby first of all started the bell ringing on the receiver when the two parts were in the same room, but to demonstrate the principle more fully he carried the receiver into the next shop, a thick wall dividing the rooms, and then operated again, the bell responding to every touch upon the tapping key. Kirkby participated as an operator of one of the two wireless stations established by Australian land military forces at their annual Easter encampment. Likely some of the equipment had been manufactured by Kirkby. The experiment was widely reported (with apologies for the language of the day): \\"The present Heathcote camp may be an historical one, since it has witnessed the first recorded successful use of a wireless telegraph installation in the Commonwealth under military conditions. The recent formation of the Wireless Institute enabled Lieut. G. A. Taylor, A.I.C., to make the arrangements in conjunction with Captain Cox- Taylor, of the Garrison Artillery, who watched the experiment closely, and interestedly with a view to the possible future military development of wireless telegraphy in the Commonwealth. Conditions which would most probably be met with on active service were scrupulously observed by those in charge of the operating stations; indeed, in the determination to impart the utmost realism to the undertaking discomforts innumerable were cheerfully faced by the corps. The surrounding district was depended upon for the supply of most of the paraphernalia. For the masts to support the aerials three saplings were lashed together in each instance, giving an altitude of some 50 or 60 feet. The aerial wires at A station were conveyed to a military tent where the operating appliances were installed, and at station B, to a cave under the crest of the hill beneath the line of targets, some four miles to the south- west. The latter position was of very great interest, inasmuch as on the rocks flanking the cave some queer aboriginal carvings and a deep V cut in a sandstone, used evidently by ancient black warriors to sharpen their implements of war, were discovered. A coincidence was actually established between the ancient, barbarous, warlike messages and the most modern means of communication between fighting forces. The outlying station was in charge of Mr. Reginald Wilkinson, and at the main station Mr. Kirkby operated, while the enthusiastic hon. secretary, of the Wireless Institute, Mr. W. H. Hannam, supervised the apparatus. Considerable time was spent in getting connection between the stations, and the call letter V was continually flashing throughout Saturday and Sunday, until it was at last picked up by the head station, in the small hours of Monday morning. Tuning being now consonant, signals were continually exchanged. The University Scouts took deep interest in these experiments, and lent valuable assistance.\\" Still promoting the patriotic benefits of wireless, in July 1910, Kirkby and Taylor lectured and demonstrated wireless at a meeting of the United Service Institution in Sydney: \\"Some very interesting experiments were shown last evening by Lieutenant G. A. Taylor and Mr. Kirkby, whose apparatus was commended by Dr. Bell as the equal of any in the world. At the conclusion of a lecture by the former a button was pressed, and by means of wireless a flag was run up, a breeze set blowing, a gun fired, and a gramophone played God Save the King.\\" The lecture was so well received that Taylor and Kirkby responded with a repeat of the lecture and demonstration at King's Hall, Phillip St, Sydney on 31 August 1910, with proceeds going to the Sydney Hospital radium fund. Taylor only lectured, Kirkby manufactured the equipment and demonstrated it, Taylor was the publisher of the magazine Construction for the Master Builders Association. The only reference to Taylor‚Äôs wireless experimentation without any citations or references was by his biographer Giles in 1954. This may have kept Florence, Taylor‚Äôs wife, happy as she had commissioned the article that appeared as a supplement to the magazine. =Father Shaw and Australian Wireless Co= Wormalds Bros manufacturers of fire protection equipment were getting rich at his expense. and he dissolved his partnership with them. He was looking for a place to manufacture his apparatus. He was friends with a Catholic priest Father Archibald Shaw MSC. He and his superior, Father Guis, built a factory for Kirkby on their land at the procure where Kirkby began manufacturing his fire systems of fire protection. The procure was always short of money, and Shaw asked Kirkby to make wireless for him. He did and they became very successful, forming a company the Maritime Wireless Company of Australasia.letter Father Guis to Father Field ‚Äì archives of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart Roma St Kensington NSW 7 May 1911 Personal life Late life and legacy References Artifacts * Museums Victoria Telegram from Jenvey to Chambers, advising major improvement in signals, 1900 Museums Victoria Publications * Jenvey, H.

Background  His writing life began inauspiciously in Theodore Roethke's poetry seminar at the University of Washington. Haag recalled handing his teacher a poem and Roethke's reading \\"as far as the fourth line, which he slashed away with a great green stroke\\" from his fountain pen. Haag's next attempt went a little better, as Roethke made it halfway through the poem. While still an undergraduate, he began to place poems in reputable national periodicals, including The New Yorker. His publications brought fellowships. He went to England in 1959-60 as a Fulbright Scholar, studying at Reading University. There his first collection, The Mirrored Man: Twenty-Three Poems, appeared in 1961. In 1962, he played the lead part of Bartleby in a film adaptation of Herman Melville's story \\"Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall-Street.\\" Returning to the United States with a master's degree, he accepted a position in the English Department at Penn State University. He continued to publish as he taught. His second collection, and his best known, The Brine-Breather, appeared from Kayak Books in 1971. The poems are mostly metaphysical meditations on the curiosities of marine biology, bringing the sea cucumber, queen conch, and others to light. Mariners in their ships he treats with searching, Roethke- like precision and quirky scientific observation. Haag's later poems reflect the experience of his life. He lived in rural Milesburg, ten miles from the University where he taught. He raised orchids and cultivated mushrooms, and these appeared increasingly in his poems. His final collection, Stones Don‚Äôt Float: Poems Selected and New, appeared in 1996 from Ohio State University Press, having won the Press's Journal Award in Poetry.

He works in an elaborate style with water color and precise detail. Kelley is known for his work on James Bowen's Bob the Cat series and A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo, a best-selling children's book written by Jill Twiss.  Early life and education  Kelley was born in Texas and later moved to Florida. He earned a degree in studio art. As an illustrator, he is mostly self-taught, receiving his education from another artist. He regards Albert Uderzo, Peter de Seve, Rien Poortvliet, Jon J. Muth, John Pike, Victor Ambrus, Lisbeth Zwerger, Brian Wildsmith and John Burningham as his artistic influences, as well as television cartoons and animated movies.  Career  = Bob the Cat series = In 2014, Kelley illustrated two books in James Bowen's best-selling Bob the Cat series. This series started in 2013 with A Street Cat Named Bob, a book relating the real-life events of Bowen taking in a wounded stray cat, nursing him back to health, and getting over his own addictions in the process. It was followed by a sequel called The World According to Bobb and children's versions of both books. The two books illustrated by Kelley are intended for young children. My Name is Bob is an imagined prequel about Bob's life prior to Bowen's first book, telling the story of how the cat ended up on the streets. In Bob to the Rescue, Bob helps a homeless puppy find its owner. = Grover Cleveland, Again! = In 2016, Kelley created the graphics for children's educational book Grover Cleveland, Again! A Treasury of American Presidents written by the documentary film maker Ken Burns' and which profiles each of the Presidents of the United States. The book was included in the 2017 Notable Social Studies Trade Books for Young People reading list of exceptional books for use in social studies classrooms, created by the National Council for the Social Studies and the Children's Book Council. It was nominated for the 2016 Children‚Äôs and Young Adult Bloggers Literary Awards, an annual award for juvenile and children‚Äôs books that successfully combine literary merit and popular appeal. = Please Please the Bees = Please Please the Bees (2017) was Kelley's debut as a children's writer, telling the story of a grumpy bear who learns a lesson when the honey bees in his garden go on strike, demanding improvements in their living and working conditions. It received positive reviews and garnered a 4.2 out of 5 star rating on Goodreads. It was awarded the 2017 Frances and Wesley Bock Book Award for Children's Literature, an award for books that promote a moral attitude and appeals to young children's sense of wonder and curiosity. = A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo = In March 2018, Kelley illustrated a children's book called A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo under the pseudonym EG Keller. The book, written by Jill Twiss, is about a fictional day in the life of Marlon Bundo, the real-life pet rabbit of the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence. The story details the same-sex romance between Marlon Bundo and another rabbit named Wesley. It was conceptualized as a loose parody of Marlon Bundo's: A Day in the Life of the Vice President, written by Charlotte Pence and illustrated by Karen Pence (Mike Pence's daughter and wife, respectively). Their book also tells about a fictionalized day of the Pence family's pet rabbit, but without LGBT themes. A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo was launched during an episode of the satirical talk show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver with the intent to mock Pence's staunch opposition to same-sex marriage. Rather than a straight-up parody of the Pences' book, A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo is an actual children's story about marriage equality and democracy. It nevertheless contains some stabs at Mike Pence. The book became an immediate bestseller, receiving notable praise and selling much better than expected. All profits from the book are being donated to The Trevor Project and AIDS United.

The Levin College offers undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral degrees, as well as professional development programs. Its urban policy research centers and programs provide communities with decision-making tools to address their policy challenges. The Levin College is recognized for offering highly ranked programs in local government management, urban planning and policy, economic development, and community development. The Levin College is located on the Cleveland State University Campus housed on the historic Euclid Avenue in The Playhouse Square District in downtown Cleveland. In 2016, Roland V. Anglin, previously the senior advisor to the chancellor and director of the Joseph C. Cornwall Center for Metropolitan Studies at Rutgers University-Newark, was named dean.  History  In 1967, following the Hough riots and student protests on campus, Dr. Thomas F. Campbell and a group of Cleveland State faculty formed the Ad Hoc Committee on Urban Studies and called on the university to form an urban institute to \\"bring together faculty from a wide range of specializations to work on urban problems in an interdisciplinary setting, designed in particular to facilitate communication between specialists with common interests in urban problems... linking academic specialists with the political and economic leadership of a large metropolis.... [including] a full range of undergraduate courses focusing on urban problems, particularly in the social sciences.\\" The Institute of Urban Studies first offered classes in the fall of 1968 with the financial support of the Gund Foundation. The program was one of the first members of the Council of University Institutes of Urban Affairs, which became the Urban Affairs Association in 1981. In 1969, Maxine Goodman Levin, founder of the Cleveland Landmarks Commission and the Cleveland Restoration Society, and a real estate developer, established the Albert A. Levin Chair of Urban Studies and Public Service in honor of her late husband. It was the first endowed chair in the country to allow the chair holder to combine classroom teachings with public service to study and work at finding solutions to urban problems.

Their music has been noted as an important late-stage development in Cambodian rock of the 1960s and 70s, a thriving music scene that was abruptly crushed by the Khmer Rouge communists in 1975. Some members of the band did not survive the ensuing Cambodian genocide. The band has gone through multiple lineups, with singer/guitarist Touch Seang Tana the only consistent member. Formation Drakkar formed in 1967, amid the flourishing Phnom Penh music scene, to perform rock music inspired by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones as well as early Cambodian guitar bands like Baksey Cham Krong and Apsara.John Pirozzi and LinDa Saphan, liner notes, Don't Think I've Forgotten, soundtrack, 2015. As with many of their contemporaries like Sinn Sisamouth, Ros Serey Sothea, and Pen Ran, Drakkar was influenced by pop records imported from France and Latin America that had become popular among musicians in the capital. The band initially comprised singer/rhythm guitarist Touch Seang Tana, singer/lead guitarist Touch Chhatha, singer/bassist Mam Molivan, and singer Tan Phanareth, and changing temporary drummers. This first lineup did not record any original music, and the members, all in their teens or early twenties, disbanded and took military or government jobs. Reformation and popularity In 1971, Tana assembled a new lineup with lead guitarist Som Sareth, drummer Ouk Sam Art, and bassist Oer Sam Ol. By this time, the Cambodian music scene was further influenced by Western rock and roll and soul music via U.S. armed forces radio that had been broadcast to troops stationed nearby during the Vietnam War. Drakkar toured U.S. military bases in South Vietnam that year, after which original lead guitarist Touch Chhatha rejoined. This version of the band was heavily influenced by the hard rock sounds of bands like Deep Purple and Grand Funk Railroad, and regularly performed covers of songs by those and other bands. Their sound at the time has been compared to Led Zeppelin, Santana, and Jimi Hendrix. The band's hippie attire and long hair were noted as symbolic of changing times and American influences in early-1970s Cambodia. Guitarists Touch Chhatha and Touch Seang Tana attracted attention, not all of it good, for their unusually aggressive guitar playing, while drummer Ouk Sam Art caused minor scandals by playing shirtless. Tana noted in the documentary film Don't Think I've Forgotten that Cambodia was not yet ready for western-style hard rock at the time. Khmer Rouge era Drakkar became popular in Phnom Penh during the later stages of the Cambodian Civil War, when the city was under threat from both American bombing campaigns and attacks by Khmer Rouge insurgents. Due to wartime curfews, the band had to play in clubs during the day and often heard nearby gunfire and explosions during their performances. The band recorded a self-titled album with primitive technology in 1972-1973, and released it in early 1974. The album, which was rereleased decades later as Drakkar '74, sold over 20,000 copies, making it the highest-selling full- length album in Cambodian history up to that point. Plans to further promote the album were halted in April 1975, when the Khmer Rouge defeated the Khmer Republic army and gained control of the country. The members of Drakkar are assumed to be among the two million residents of Phnom Penh who were forced to leave the city and become farm workers to fulfill the Khmer Rouge's visions of agrarian socialism and the eradication of all foreign influences (including music) from Cambodian society. Group members Oer Sam Ol and Som Sareth disappeared during the ensuing Cambodian genocide and their exact fates are unknown. Singer/guitarist Touch Seang Tana was imprisoned in a work camp, and claims that he survived the genocide by singing Santana songs to Khmer Rouge soldiers on demand while passing himself off as a common peasant. Guitarist Touch Chhatha was one of many professional musicians who were forced to play patriotic and traditional music for Khmer Rouge troops practically every day. Post-Khmer Rouge and reunion Touch Seang Tana performing with the modern version of Drakkar in 2015. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979, drummer Ouk Sam Art and guitarist Touch Chhatha returned to music work for Cambodia's National Radio station, while Tana became an accomplished manager of fisheries and environmental conservation for the post-Khmer Rouge Cambodian government. Conservation work continued to be a theme in Tana's life. he was the Chairman of the Cambodian Government's Commission for Dolphin Conservation and Development of the Mekong Dolphin Ecotourism Zone (the \\"Dolphin Commission\\"). Information about many Cambodian musicians of the 1960s and 1970s, and many of their recordings, were lost during the Khmer Rouge regime. Interest in that scene's musicians was revived, especially among western rock fans, in the late 1990s with the release of compilation albums like Cambodian Rocks (1996). Filmmaker John Pirozzi was introduced to the music while making City of Ghosts, and subsequently featured Drakkar and several of their contemporaries in the 2015 documentary Don't Think I've Forgotten (2015). The Drakkar song \\"Crazy Loving You\\" has appeared on several compilations, including the Don't Think I've Forgotten soundtrack in 2015, and the song \\"Do You No Wrong Again\\" (credited to Thra Kha Band) has appeared on compilations like the 2011 CD Cambodia Rock Spectacular! from Lion Productions. Surviving members of Drakkar first regrouped for a reunion concert in Singapore in 2011. They also performed in 2014 and 2015 to commemorate the release of Don't Think I've Forgotten and announced plans to record a new album. The 2014 performance featured a guest appearance by Chhom Nimol of the Cambodian/American band Dengue Fever. Nimol, whose band was inspired by and frequently covers late-60s and early-70s Khmer pop music, proclaimed \\"I never dreamed I would play with those musicians. They are like my teachers, my masters.\\" A new version of the band led by Touch Seang Tana began performing regularly under the name Drakka Band in 2015. Master tapes for Drakkar's 1974 album were unearthed during this period, and in 2014 it was released as Drakkar '74 by Metal Postcard Records. Personnel at the label had been inspired by Cambodian Rocks and Don't Think I've Forgotten to track down the master tapes and remaster them for the digital market. Upon its release, one music historian noted the album's historical importance and hailed it as \\"The Holy Grail of Cambodian Psych.\\" References Category:Cambodian rock music groups Category:Khmer-language singers Category:People executed by the Khmer Rouge Category:Khmer people Category:Murdered entertainers Category:People who died in the Cambodian genocide ","title":"Drakkar (band)"},{"id":"56978175","text":"The Carl H.

The first fortifications were built in 1793 to protect the Bay of Cherbourg from English attacks. The current fort, at the top of the mountain, was built between 1853 and 1857 under Napoleon III. In 1928, the Navy built extensive tunnels under it to store equipment. During the Second World War, the Todt Organisation built several tunnels, installed casemates for artillery, and built gun emplacements. The fort was captured after fierce fighting by the U.S. Army on June 26, 1944. After the war, the Navy took possession of the site and set up its command post in the first maritime region until 1988, when part of the site became a naval communications center. The School of Military Applications of Atomic Energy uses some of the facilities. The fortifications at the top of the mountain now house the Cherbourg Liberation Museum, and the tunnels leading to the German gun emplacements are open to the public.

She was a cousin and confidante of Empress Elizabeth of Russia, and chief lady-in-waiting to the future Catherine the Great. She played an important part in the early married life of Catherine, and is given a prominent place in Catherine's memoirs. Life Maria Semenovna Choglokova was the 4th of five children and the second eldest of three daughters of count Simon Hendrikov and Kristina Skavronskaia and thus the maternal first cousin of Empress Elizabeth. In 1742, she married Nikolai Naumovich Choglokov (1718-1754). She had married for love, was thus faithful to her spouse without difficulty and gave birth regularly - she was to have four daughters and four sons during her marriage. After the marriage of Grand Duke Peter to Catherine in 1745, Choglokova was appointed chief lady-in- waiting and mistress of the household of the Grand Duchess in succession to Maria Rumyantseva, and her spouse was given the equivalent position of Chamberlain to the Grand Duke. They were appointed by recommendation of Pyotr Bestuzhev-Ryumin because of the happiness and fertility of their marriage, and was to act as an example for Peter and Catherine, whose procreation was politically important. Their task was to supervise the young couple and their behavior in all aspects and make sure that their marriage resulted in procreation of heirs to the throne and their behavior was suitable in the eyes of the public. Choglokova, for example, was always to make sure that Catherine never neglected her religious duties, and or placed herself in any situation with men that could damage her reputation. In 1752, a change occurred in the behavior of Choglokova. Until then concerned with the marital virtue of Catherine, according to the first version of Catherine's memoirs, edited by Alexander Hertzen, Choglokova had a conversation with Catherine in which she assured Catherine that adultery could be acceptable if circumstances made them necessary.Catherine II, Cruse, Mark. & Hoogenboom, Hilde., The memoirs of Catherine the Great [Elektronisk resurs], 1st ed., Modern Library, New York, 2005 She asked Catherine if she would prefer Sergei Saltykov or Lev Naryshkin, and when Catherine answered that she preferred the former, Choglokova stated that Catherine could trust her and her love for her country, and that she could be assured that she would be of no trouble to her.Catherine II, Cruse, Mark. & Hoogenboom, Hilde., The memoirs of Catherine the Great [Elektronisk resurs], 1st ed., Modern Library, New York, 2005 There is a version of Catherine memoirs that Choglokova only advised her to obtain a platonic lover to make Peter jealous, to consummate their marriage with Peter and to obtain a legal heir to the throne. This conversation is famous and has been interpreted as an indication that Choglokova acted on the orders of Empress Elizabeth, who was tired of the slow procreation of Peter and Catherine and would allow for Catherine to become pregnant from Peter by any means to get rid of both Catherine and Peter ASAP as heirs involved in military plots against Elizabeth.Catherine II, Cruse, Mark. & Hoogenboom, Hilde., The memoirs of Catherine the Great [Elektronisk resurs], 1st ed., Modern Library, New York, 2005[http://history-gatchina.ru/article/pavel_birth.htm M. Safonov. The origin of Paul I. The history of Gatchina. During the last years of their service at court, the Choglokov marriage itself fell apart, and after her husband had committed adultery, Choglokova did the same. She was widowed in 1754 and was relieved of her court office, and her and husband was replaced in their respective offices at court by another couple: Catherine Ivanovna Kasturina (1718-1790) and Alexander Shuvalov. She remarried A. I. Glebov. Fiction She was portrayed by Katya Galitzine in Young Catherine (1991).

Built in 1876, the Hinds Hotel is a former hotel, antique store and plant nursery. Today, it serves as a private commercial business and home. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has been named a California Historic Landmark and a Sonoma County Historic Landmark. History The 32-room Hinds Hotel was built in August 1876 by Hollis B. Hinds.Lang and Schultz, 11. A farmer, Hinds moved to Sonoma County in 1863 from Tennessee. He built the hotel upon the announcement that the North Pacific Coast Railroad would start serving Freestone, which would serve as the terminus. The hotel was frequently used by carpenters working on the railroad line. According to first hand reports, the innkeeper at the Hinds Hotel intentionally had parts of a nearby bridge, that the carpenters were building, burned at night, delaying the completion of work in order to retain his client base longer. The innkeeper would serve time in jail for his efforts. As of 1910, the building was called Park House and in the 1930s it was called the Wayside Inn. By 1930, railroad service had stopped and the train tracks were removed in Freestone. By the mid-20th century, the property served as a plant nursery. The building, as well as the surrounding 22-acres, was purchased by Tom Golden and Jim Kidder in 1970. The building served as their private home. The home served as the \\"social headquarters\\" during the design and installation of the landmark installation art piece, Running Fence by Christo and Jeanne-Claude. In 1974, the Sonoma County Landmarks Commission designated the Hinds Hotel as a historic landmark. The Hinds Hotel is a part of the Freestone Historic District.Lang and Schultz, ii. Architecture A two-story wood frame building, the hotel is built in the Gothic Revival style. It was originally built as an L shaped building. Prior to 1902, a balcony was added to the building. The original three step platform in the front of the building was restored. The building is built using shiplap siding. Flat trim surrounds the six over six double hung sash windows. The entry doors on the lower floor are symmetrically placed and are embellished with stained glass. The side door entry has a single, paned door with colored glass sidelights and traces. The gable has center gables in two main sections of the front facades. The roof is trimmed with a plain cornice and wide frieze board. The board extends down the corners to the trim around the top of the platform. There are Gothic windows under the center gables, comprising a central pointed arch glass door with narrower, shorter pointed arched windows at each side, which are topped with label molding.

It was released on 18 May 2017 as an early access title for Windows, macOS and Linux.  Plot  While Ravenfield has no plot per se, during the 2019 Halloween Event, SteelRaven7 hinted at the possibility of an underlying plot in the game. It is speculated that more will be revealed in future updates to the Conquest game mode. In July 2020 an update was released overhauling the Spec Ops game mode. It also introduced the first named characters, TALON team. TALON team is a 4 man special forces unit in the Eagle army.  Gameplay  The game incorporates rag-doll-like physics, with many options to give users the ability to control the AI, including a 'battle plan', and many other game factors such as AI count. Ravenfield consists of multiple team game modes that revolve around capturing check points and gaining the most points by killing the enemy team. The game pays homage to large scale multiplayer first-person shooter games such as the Battlefield franchise and Star Wars: Battlefront franchise. As such the game has a focus on large scale maps and vehicle based combat with the teams controlling the more powerful vehicle spawn points often gaining the advantage in battle. The game is available on Steam and is currently in Early Access although it is reaching the end of its development. The game also supports mods VIA the Steam Workshop, with community members designing their own maps, weapons, vehicles and accompanying lore. A second mode has been released, titled Conquest, that combines the preexisting elements of large scale combat with turn based strategy, similar to the Galactic Conquest mode seen in Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game).  Reception  Christopher Livingston of PC Gamer called the game \\"glitchy‚Äù and \\"fun\\". The game boasts a 96% positive review score on Steam, and a 4.8/5 on itch.io. Nathan Grayson of Kotaku criticized Ravenfield as \\"glitchy\\" and \\"barely functional in some places\\"; however, he noted its ability to support a high number of computer-controlled players and expressed fascination with its good reception by players on Steam. The game supports Steam Workshop, and creators from the community have added new weapons, vehicles, maps, and features that add to and expand the game's vanilla feel, which was well received by players.

He is a senior fellow of the St. Paul Center in Steubenville, Ohio, and was formerly on the faculty of Wyoming Catholic College. He is also the author of three books about traditional Catholicism: Resurgent in the Midst of Crisis, Noble Beauty, Transcendent Holiness, and Tradition and Sanity. Life and career Kwasniewski was born on 22 March 1971 in Arlington Heights, Illinois. He grew up in New Jersey. At the Delbarton School in Morristown, he received his first serious tutelage in music. After a year at Georgetown University, Kwasniewski matriculated as a freshman at Thomas Aquinas College in California, where he earned a B.A. in liberal arts in 1994. He subsequently studied at The Catholic University of America, focusing on ancient Greek philosophy and medieval scholasticism. He received his M.A. in philosophy in 1996, writing a thesis on \\"The Dialectic of Reason and Faith in Descartes's Meditationes de prima philosophia\\" and his Ph.D. in the same discipline in 2002, with a dissertation on \\"The Ecstasy of Love in Thomas Aquinas\\". He served as Assistant Professor of Philosophy from 1998 to 2006 at the International Theological Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family in Austria (then in the town of Gaming) and as an adjunct instructor in music appreciation at the Franciscan University of Steubenville's Austria Program located on the same campus. In 2006, he joined the founding team of Wyoming Catholic College in Lander, Wyoming, where he served as assistant academic dean and director of admissions, and then as choirmaster and Professor of Theology and Philosophy. He also taught music and art history in the college's fine arts curriculum. At the end of the academic year of 2017‚Äì18, Kwasniewski left Wyoming Catholic College. He accepted the position of senior fellow at the St. Paul Center in Steubenville, Ohio, and is currently working as an independent writer, editor, publisher, and guest lecturer, giving talks and workshops on the traditional liturgy of the Catholic Church. Kwasniewski is a board member and scholar of the Aquinas Institute in Green Bay, Wisconsin, which is publishing the Opera Omnia of St. Thomas Aquinas. He is also a fellow of the Albertus Magnus Center for Scholastic Studies. Public reception Kwasniewski's books, lectures, and articles have meet with both considerable praise and opposition. Major prelates and Catholic magazines and websites have praised Kwasniewski for his insights into the crisis in the Church, while others have criticized him for insubordination to the present wishes of Church leaders. Some, like Fr. Anthony Ruff, OSB, of the PrayTell blog, have criticized Kwasniewski for an intransigent defense of traditional things, especially preconciliar, and for his apparent rejection of the reforms intended by the Second Vatican Council. Ruff, in particular, argues that Kwasniewski depends excessively on the Council of Trent, whose doctrine was, according to him, completed and corrected by Vatican II. Jonathan Daly maintains that Kwasniewski's vocal preference for traditional worship is itself characteristically modern because it is a lifestyle and worldview choice over against other options that have more to recommend them, such as the contemporary magisterium. Support for Kwasniewski's positions and writings has also been substantial. In 2016, the international Catholic TV station EWTN broadcast a TV interview with Kwasniewski on their popular \\"EWTN Live\\" channel and also began carrying his book Resurgent in the Midst of Crisis in their online catalog. That same year, TV Infobar made available the video of the book launch of the Czech translation of Resurgent, at which Cardinal Burke introduced the book, calling it \\"very readable and very accessible\\" and thanking Kwasniewski \\"for giving us this work.\\" Other positive publicity for this book included The New Oxford Review, which claims that \\"Kwasniewski accurately sums up the current situation in the Church\\" and that Resurgent is \\"a starting point for serious discussion\\" for \\"revitalizing the Church\\". His book Noble Beauty, Transcendent Holiness was praised by The Catholic Herald in Britain and the National Review, both of which published favorable reviews. Fr. Zuhlsdorf also reviewed the book favorably, claiming that \\"He writes with clarity and great force, which surely reflect both his deft mind and his convictions.\\" In 2016, it was revealed that Kwasniewski was among the clergy and theologians who signed the \\"Letter of the 45\\", a letter to all the Catholic cardinals which asked them to \\"respond to the dangers to Catholic faith and morals\\" which they alleged that Pope Francis' Amoris Laetitia had posed. Kwasniewski was also a signatory of a letter in support of the four Dubia cardinals. In April 2019, Kwasniewski was among 19 Catholic scholars and clergy who signed a 20-page open letter making a formal accusation of heresy against Pope Francis. Music In addition to being a teacher and writer, Kwasniewski has enjoyed a parallel career as a choirmaster, cantor, and composer of about 150 works of music. After studying composition and conducting with Roy Horton and voice with Carol Horton at Delbarton School in Morristown, New Jersey, Kwasniewski became assistant choir director at Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, California (1990‚Äì1994). He served as director of the Schola Cantorum at Old St. John's Catholic Church in Silver Spring, Maryland (1994‚Äì1998), director of music at the International Theological Institute in Gaming, Austria (1999‚Äì2006), and founding choirmaster and schola director at Wyoming Catholic College (2007‚Äì2018). Kwasniewski's Mass settings, motets, hymns, carols, antiphons, and acclamations have received numerous performances from 1990 to the present. His Mass settings include Missa Spiritus Domini (1994), Missa Spe Salvi (1995, rev. 2012), Missa Brevis √† 3 (1997), Missa Hereditas Mihi √† 3 (2016), and Missa Honorificentia Populi Nostri (2017). His Seven Mandatum Antiphons (2010) were dedicated to Arvo P√§rt on the occasion of his 75th birthday; the maestro personally accepted the dedication. Many of these works can be found in his book Sacred Choral Works, which was highly acclaimed when it first appeared in 2014. Ensembles that have performed Kwasniewski's choral music include the Ecclesia Choir (dir. Timothy Woods), the Vittoria Ensemble (dir. Rick Wheeler), the Scottish ensemble Cantiones Sacrae (dir. Graeme Adamson), and Cantus Magnus (dir. Matthew Schellhorn). Kwasniewski has also written a three-movement wind quintet Fire and Flame, premiered by the Antero Winds in 2012; an Ave Maria for SATB, winds, and strings; a violin sonata; organ accompaniments for English plainchant; and pieces for brass quartet and string quartet. He has published numerous articles on music, especially on the recovery and renewal of sacred music in the contemporary church.

One of the most prominent communist trade union leaders in the United Kingdom, he left office after being convicted of involvement in rigging an election. Foulkes completed an apprenticeship as an electrician and joined the Electrical Trades Union. He also became active in the Labour Party, and at the 1929 UK general election was an election agent for the party. However, soon after the election, he instead joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Foulkes gradually came to prominence in the ETU, initially becoming a shop steward, then serving on branch and district committees before working full-time for the union as an official based in Merseyside. In 1942, he was elected as the union's national organiser, in which role he became known for his negotiation skills. This led him, in 1946, to win election as the union's General President. In 1954, he led a major one-day strike of electricians. He also served as President of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions in 1959/60. In 1959, the union's general secretary, Frank Haxell, also a CPGB member, narrowly won a bid for re-election against Jock Byrne. Byrne and Frank Chapple took Foulkes, Haxell and thirteen other CPGB members to court, alleging that the election had been fixed. In 1961, they won the case, and Byrne was installed as general secretary.\\"Mr Frank Haxell\\", The Times, 31 May 1988 Foulkes argued that he had no knowledge of any fraud and so should retain his position, but he lost a second court case in 1962 on the grounds that, given his oversight role, he should have been aware that the election was rigged. He then decided to take early retirement, receiving a pension from the union despite the opposition of its new leadership.

Production The game is a remake of a 1991 game entitled A.D. 2044: Seksmisja developed by R.M.P. Software and published by LK Avalon, released to Atari 8-bit computers. It was a simple point and click adventure game created by Roland Panto≈Ça. The new game is based on the same narrative, but with updated graphics. It was the first Polish computer game released on two CDs and to have rendered three-dimensional graphics. The game was accompanied by a promotion in mass media that was unprecedented in scale for the country. While the game was originally released in Polish, English subtitles were finally added to the game in 2017. Plot and gameplay Based on the film Seksmisja by Juliusz Machulski, the game is set in a future post- apocalyptic world where women rule the planet. This is caused by a radical women's group who capture some nuclear weapons and demand equal power from men, who respond by sending missiles which causes a nuclear winter. A thousand women survive by being in an underground bunker. In 2044, they discover a single male who was preserved in a hibernation capsule. The player is this male who escapes capture and begins to explore the environment. The game plays like a point and click adventure. Players collect and manipulate items and click on hotspots. A male voice narrates the story and also provides hints. Critical reception Gra.pl felt the 1991 version should be treated as a mere \\"interesting curiosity\\" in comparison to the more \\"interesting and better developed\\" one from 1996. Metzomagic noted the game window was more generous that in other games, reaching around two-thirds of the screen.

The rock forming the canyon is crystalline basement. One feature of the canyon is a dry waterfall. The canyon is bridged by a wooden railroad trestle, the Goat Canyon Trestle, which is the world's largest curved all-wood trestle. The canyon is accessible by trail by traveling west from Mortero Palms. Flora and fauna Goat Canyon is named after desert bighorn sheep that live within and around the canyon. During a desert bloom, which occurred in 2017, monkey flowers were observed flowering in the canyon. The endangered species least Bell's vireo migrates through the area around the canyon. Human history Panoramic photograph of Goat Canyon Trestle and Tunnel number 15 Prior to Spanish governance, there was Native American activity in the area around Goat Canyon; the impact of this activity includes petroglyphs and pictograms in Carrizo Gorge. Alt URL The last Native Americans to live in the area were the Kumeyaay. Later cattle ranchers utilized the area. Beginning in 1912, construction began on the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway in the area. The Carrizo Gorge portion of the line, including Goat Canyon, was the final portion to be completed. A railroad tunnel of The San Diego and Arizona Railway, Tunnel number 15, was built into the side of the canyon but it collapsed in 1932. The collapse was caused by an earthquake, which dramatically changed the inclination of Tunnel number 15. After Tunnel number 15 collapsed, it was decided that it would be bypassed using a wooden trestle. During the construction of the trestle, segments were lowered into the canyon from the partially completed trestle. Construction workers took breaks in a portion of the collapsed tunnel that they called the \\"mud shed\\". The trestle was completed in 1933. In 1976 Hurricane Kathleen's effects impacted the region around the canyon, destroying tracks and other trestles in Carrizo Gorge; the trestle over Goat Canyon was also damaged, with some of its footings destroyed during the hurricane. By 1981, repairs from the hurricane damage were completed. Heavy rains returned to the area in 1982 and 1983; this led to rail service being discontinued over Goat Canyon and through Carrizo Gorge. After repairs were again completed, trains once again ran over Goat Canyon in 2004. In 2008 the trains once again stopped running over Goat Canyon. =Popular media= In 1999, Huell Howser traveled to the canyon to visit the trestle over it. In 2017, the canyon was depicted in a \\"Mysteries of the Abandoned\\" episode on the Science Channel.

She was born in Chatelet, Belgium and emigrated to Canada in 1947 at the age of 28. Her artistic style consisted of combining the elements of urban life and nature. Kerwin was a member of five different Canadian art societies, including the Royal Canadian Academy of Art. Kerwin's works were exhibited in public and private collections in Canada as well as internationally in Belgium, France, England, Brazil, and the United States. The Art Gallery of Northumberland houses several of her works in their permanent collection. Kerwin was awarded a Medal of Service from the City of Toronto for her contributions to the local art scene. Career Kerwin was a volunteer at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario. She went bi-weekly to the Discovery Gallery, drawing different artifacts, such as Egyptian mummies and prehistoric plants, to test her skills. Her drawings were reproduced on labels for visitors to provide quick identification of the specimens in the gallery. Kerwin enjoyed her volunteer work here saying, \\"I could live another 30 years to work on all the exhibits in the Discovery Gallery‚Ä¶.I find it a stimulating challenge\\". The museum curator, Ruth Freeman, saw her drawing and began assigning her to draw the artifacts that could be touched in the exhibit from all 19 curatorial departments. She was bilingual in French and English which helped her create labels for the drawings in both languages.Kritzwiser, Kay. \\"Drawings that Trace History's Evidence.\\" Globe and Mail (Toronto) 8 June 1985: E16. Kerwin had a printmaking studio on Monteith St in Toronto where she practiced her mixed media prints. She acquired her materials, consisting of old copper and lead, from parking lots and gutters. She made mixed-media prints through copper and lead collages against etched Masonite or fine Japanese paper. She pleated the lead, hammered it, then fluted it to mould it into what she desired. Her appreciation for lead goes back to her childhood in Belgium where she saw many lead works in galleries and liked the lead pots and pans in her house. She began working with metals in her prints in 1974. Since then, she has garnered increased attention in Canada and around the world. Her visits to Sudan and Morocco brought different colours to her works that can be noticed in the coppers and lead that she used. She credits the environment around her for giving her all these different materials saying, \\"Nature has done all the work for me\\". Kerwin also bought some materials when needed. She enjoyed the possibilities that exist with the combination of the metals and the papers. Kerwin displays the prints over a landscape to create a new visual aesthetic that is reminiscent of her inspirations from Morocco.Kritzwiser, Kay. \\"Castoffs Hold Special Charm for Resourceful Print-Maker.\\" Globe and Mail (Toronto) 29 March 1988: A21.

Alfred was renowned for her hand-woven cedar-root and cedar-bark baskets, and also practiced the art of storytelling. Alfred was keen on relaying her knowledge and her people's way of life using classic oral tradition. In 1922, Agnes Alfred was imprisoned by the Canadian government for participating in a potlatch ritual, which was outlawed at the time. In 2004, her memoirs were published in \\"Paddling to Where I Stand: Agnes Alfred, Qwiqwasutinuxw Noblewoman.\\"  Early life and family  As a child, Alfred attended missionary school for a short time.

Alfred was already married to her husband, Morris, at this point.Clifford, James. Routes: Travel and Translation in the Late Twentieth Century. Harvard University Press, 1997. All of Alfred's thirteen children were named 'by the book', meaning Alfred chose all thirteen names with biblical reference.Blew, Mary C. Paddling to Where I Stand: Agnes Alfred, Qwiqwasutinuxw Noblewoman (Review). Vol. Volume 75. Number 1. University of Toronto Press, 2006. Accessed March 10, 2018. Throughout her life as a Christian, Alfred worked to keep alive her Indigenous traditions of potlatches and winter dancing while transitioning her career into a money economy and experiencing the changes of white technology and culture.  Career  Born in about 1890, Alfred grew up one generation behind the practice of slavery among the Qwiqwasutinuxw people. She also lived two generations before oral storytelling began to give way to literature. This gave her unique talent for the art of storytelling extraordinary precedents during the time she was alive. For the entirety of her adult life and career, Alfred was a respected, nonliterate woman who had experienced unthinkable shifts to the state of her people. Throughout this time of her life she maintained her position in the Kwakwaka'wakw nobility, and continued to hone her crafts as a storyteller and cedar basket weaver. Majority of the documentation of Alfred's story-telling career was done in her later life. Alfred experienced practically no western education and spoke no English.Blew, Mary C. . Paddling to Where I Stand: Agnes Alfred, Qwiqwasutinuxw Noblewoman (Review). Vol. Volume 75. Number 1. University of Toronto Press, 2006. Accessed March 10, 2018. Throughout her career as a storyteller, Alfred managed to keep the Kwakwala language alive in both its classical and everyday forms.Reid, Martine J., and Daisy Sewid-Smith. Paddling to Where I Stand: Agnes Alfred, Qwiqwasutinuxw Noblewoman. UBC Press, 2007. Some of Alfred's stories were recorded in her later life by ethnographic recordings that collected the Kwakwakewak view of the sea.Reid, Martine J., and Daisy Sewid- Smith. Paddling to Where I Stand: Agnes Alfred, Qwiqwasutinuxw Noblewoman. UBC Press, 2007. These recordings of stories told by Alfred related to myths and beliefs pertaining to aquatic mythical creatures, as well as the sea itself. Alfred's career exemplifies the type of knowledge that quickly disappears when language is not in everyday use.  Imprisonment  Alfred's career was storytelling and basket weaving. However, she also worked to protest her peoples' right to potlatch ritual practice. Both Alfred and her husband Moses Alfred were arrested by the Canadian government for participating in potlatch ritual, an outlawed practice, in 1922.Canadian Women Artists History Initiative. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://cwahi.concordia.ca/sources/artists/displayArtist.php?ID_artist=5607 Fortunately, Alfred lived to see the return of potlatch ritual in 1978 in the Qwiqwasutinuxw ceremonial paraphernalia in the National Museum of Man in Ottawa.Clifford, James. Routes: Travel and Translation in the Late Twentieth Century. Harvard University Press, 1997.  Major works and contributions  Paddling to Where I Stand (titled from the name meaning 'Many guests are paddling towards me;' i.e., to attend her family's potlatch) is Alfred's most significant piece of work.Converse, Cathy. Mainstays: Women who Shaped BC. TouchWood Editions, 1998. Alfred documents through imagination and historical accounts the basis of surviving Indigenous life during the turbulent time she lived. Paddling to Where I Stand tells the role of First Nations women as noble matriarchs in a changing society, in context with her own life and personal experiences. Alfred also uses this book to offer a deeper understanding of traditions and practices such as prearranged marriage and potlatches.Converse, Cathy. Mainstays: Women who Shaped BC. TouchWood Editions, 1998. Alfred includes the significance of knowledge portrayed through songs, storytelling, and chants.Converse, Cathy. Mainstays: Women who Shaped BC. TouchWood Editions, 1998. Arranged in a lax sequence of events, this book is a raw representation of Alfred's voice, occasionally interrupted by editor Sewid-Smith to enhance the meaning of Alfred's portrayals.Converse, Cathy. Mainstays: Women who Shaped BC. TouchWood Editions, 1998. Paddling to Where I Stand goes beyond a Kwakwaka'wakw culture interpretation piece. With this work, Alfred contributes her first-hand experience, as a woman, to one of the most influential moments in Canadian history. While it was not the bulk of Alfred's career, she was an extremely talented and successful cedar basket weaver. The cedar baskets are woven with green and cream twine. Alfred created functional, West Coast open multi-purpose baskets. These are bowl shaped with flat bottoms. The handle ties in this example are worn, implying signs of use.Karp, Ivan.

He founded Arbinet in 1996 as a commodity exchange for telecommunication companies to trade unused long-distance minutes. Mashinsky's other company, VoiceSmart, was one of the first firms to offer telecommunications switches to handle ordinary voice as well as Voice over IP call routing. Mashinsky later founded GroundLink in 2004 as a service to book on-demand limousine and car services from a computer or smartphone. He was also the founder of Q-Wireless, which later became part of Transit Wireless. From 2014 to 2015, Mashinsky served as CEO of Novatel. He currently serves as CEO of the Celsius Network which is an Ethereum-based lending platform operated by use of blockchain technologies.  Early life  Mashinsky was born in Ukraine and grew up in Israel. From an early age, he was a tinkerer, like his father, and would tap into and use public phone lines in Israel. Mashinsky attended a few different universities where he majored in electrical engineering but did not graduate. He later served in the Israeli Army. At the end of the 1980s, he left Israel and moved to the United States.  Career  After relocating to New York City, Mashinsky ran a business trading contracts for delivery of chemicals such as urea, gold, and sodium cyanide. However, after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the business slowed as exports of sodium cyanide from China fizzled. Mashinsky then worked at A+ Systems, a computer-based voicemail software company for phone carriers. He was also an early developer of Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP). In the early 1990s, he founded VoiceSmart, one of the first companies to offer computer-based VOIP phone service. By 1993, Mashinsky had realized the potential for a commodity market for international telephone capacity. So, in 1996, Mashinsky founded Arbinet, a marketplace for VOIP telephone service. The platform was one of the first to allow telecommunication companies to trade minutes. In November 1997, Arbinet began offering a similar service for data connectivity, allowing the more than 400 T1 lines connected to its New York hub to exchange their unused bandwidth. In 2005, he sold his stake in Arbinet and used part of the profits from the sale to start GroundLink. The company allowed people to book limousine and car service from a smartphone or computer. Mashinsky was inspired to start the company after a car he had reserved for him and his wife failed to pick them up and a business associate he was trying to impress from the airport. In 2010, Mashinsky organized a joint venture between GroundLink and several limousine and car service companies. These companies with LimoRes Car & Limo Service, a company Mashinsky also founded, installed free Wi-Fi service funded solely by sales of advertising. He also partnered with Gogo Inflight Internet to offer the free service on US flights. Mashinsky's company Q-Wireless is one of the four companies that made up Transit Wireless, a joint venture to install wireless cellphone and free Wi-Fi internet service in the New York City Subway system. It took Mashinsky three years to convince Metropolitan Transportation Authority to initiate a survey to determine if there was a demand for cell phone service inside the subway system and two more years for the authority to request a proposal. By 2010, his company had received a contract to install the service at 277 below-ground subway stations in New York City. In April 2014, Mashinsky was named to the board of directors of Novatel which is a provider of Wi-Fi hotspot products. He was appointed CEO in June of that year. In October 2015, Mashinsky left his position at Novatel after a year and a half as CEO of the company. Mashinsky started a company called Celsius Network, a borrowing and lending platform based on the blockchain technology Ethereum. Mashinsky serves as CEO of the company. In 2018, Celsius raised $50 million through an initial coin offering. In June 2020, Celsius Network began a Series A round of funding through BnkToTheFuture to raise another $15 million.

In the United States, he became a person of interest in multiple investigations regarding Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, particularly due to his ties with Paul Manafort, an American political consultant, who was a campaign chairman for Donald Trump. Kilimnik is believed by CNN and The New York Times to be \\"Person A\\" listed in court documents filed by the Special Counsel against Manafort. He is also believed to be Person A in court documents filed in the criminal indictment of Alex van der Zwaan. The April 2019 Mueller Report concluded Kilimnik was connected to Russian intelligence agencies, while the August 2020 final report on 2016 election interference from the Senate Intelligence Committee characterized him as a \\"Russian intelligence officer.\\" In 2017, Kilimnik denied having ties to Russian intelligence agencies. Kilimnik was indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's grand jury on 8 June 2018 on charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice by attempting to tamper with a witness on behalf of Manafort. Early life Kilimnik was born on 27 April 1970 at Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine, Soviet Union. Fluent in Russian and Ukrainian before his service in the Soviet Army, he became fluent in Swedish and English as a linguist at the Military University of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation,\\"The Absolute Soviet Man\\" at Proyekt (22 August 2018). which trained interpreters for the Soviet Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). He was a translator in the Soviet Army and worked closely with its GRU. He took Russian citizenship after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. He worked in Sweden as an interpreter for a Russian arms dealer. In Moscow, Kilimnik then worked for the International Republican Institute (IRI) from 1995 to early 2005, an organisation which receives funding from the United States government to support democracy. According to anonymous sources, when applying for his position with the IRI, he responded to the question about how he learned English by stating that the \\"Russian military intelligence\\" taught him and he became known among Moscow political operatives as \\"Kostya, the guy from the GRU\\". In 1997, he traveled to the United States using a Russian diplomatic passport. He was dismissed in the early 2000s after the Federal Security Service's chief gave a speech discussing internal private meetings at the Institute. Kilimnik himself told The New York Times that he had been dismissed for having freelanced as an interpreter for Manafort, which was effectively confirmed by a spokesman for the IRI who said such an action ran counter to the organizations code of ethics. In the Mueller Report, a former colleague is reported to have told the FBI that Kilimnik was fired because of his strong links to Russian intelligence services. Employment by Manafort Recruited by Philip M. Griffin as a translator for oligarch Rinat Akhmetov and seeking a better income than available at IRI, Kilimnik met Paul Manafort in 2005 and became an employee of Manafort's consulting firm. After leaving IRI in April 2005, he lived and worked in Kyiv and Moscow while his wife and two children remained in Moscow living in a modest house near the Sheremetyevo International Airport. Some reports say Kilimnik ran the Kyiv office of Manafort's firm, Davis Manafort International, and was Manafort's right-hand man in Kyiv. They began working for Viktor Yanukovych after the 2004 Orange Revolution cost him the Presidency. With help from Manafort and Kilimnik, Yanukovych became President in 2010. Kilimnik then spent 90% of his time inside the Presidential administration. From 2011 to 2013 with liaison to Viktor Yanukovych's chief of staff Serhiy Lyovochkin, Kilimnik, Manafort, Alan Friedman, Eckart Sager, who was a one time CNN producer, and Rick Gates advised on an international public relations strategy. This effort supported the administration of President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych hired Manafort's company Global Endeavour, a St. Vincent and Grenadines based consulting and lobbying company, which during the end of Yanukovych's presidency transferred $750,000 out of Ukraine and also paid Kilimnik $53,000 during November and December 2013. When Yanukovych fled the country, Manafort and Kilimnik gained employment with the Ukrainian party Opposition Bloc which is backed by the same oligarchs who backed Yanukovych. At some point, Opposition Bloc stopped paying Manafort's firm but even though the non-payment forced Manafort's firm to shut down their Kyiv office, Kilimnik continued to advise the party while working to collect unpaid fees for Manafort's firm. Around 2010, Kilimnik collaborated with Rinat Akhmetshin when the Washington- based lobbyist was trying to sell a book disparaging one of Yanukovych's opponents. Kilimnik and Manafort actively assisted Ukrainian oligarchs and Russian oligarchs that are close to the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin. Also, they worked to ensure that Viktor Yanukovych and his Party of Regions would reduce and eventually sever Ukraine's ties to the United States and Europe so that Ukraine would become much closer to Russia, the Kremlin, and Vladimir Putin. In 2017, Kilimnik helped Manafort write an op-ed for a Kyiv newspaper. A journalist in Ukraine, Oleg Voloshyn, has disputed this assertion stating that he and Manafort wrote the op-ed and that he e-mailed the rough draft to Kilimnik. The op-ed may have violated a gag order issued against Manafort by a US court and may have been a breach of Manafort's bail conditions. In 2018, media reported Kilimnik to be variously \\"described as a fixer, translator or office manager to President Donald Trump‚Äôs ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. In June 2019, John Solomon claimed in an opinion piece for The Hill that he had reviewed State Department e-mails and conducted two interviews that established Kilimnik had worked as an intel source for the United States Department of State since at least 2013. Prosecutor General of Ukraine investigation of Kilimnik From August until December 2016, Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuriy Lutsenko conducted an investigation into Konstantin Kilimnik but did not arrest him. Kilimnik managed Davis Manafort International in Kyiv. Kilimnik left Ukraine for Russia in June 2016. Davis Manafort International in Kyiv had been accused of money laundering by Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investigation. Mueller considered Kilimnik a vital witness in the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau informed the United States Department of State that Lutsenko had both thwarted Ukraine's investigation into Kilimink and allowed Kilimnik to leave Ukraine for Russia. Mentions in court filings Kilimnik has been reported by The New York Times to be the \\"Person A\\" in Court filings in December 2017 against Manafort and Rick Gates. Court filings in late March 2018 allege that he knew that Kilimnik was a former officer with the Russian military intelligence service. These came after Gates reached a plea deal in exchange for cooperation in the investigation. The sentencing memo for Alex van der Zwaan filed by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller states that Gates told van der Zwaan that Person A, believed to be Kilimnik, was a former intelligence officer with the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). Kilimnik also featured in the documents filed by Mueller in early December 2018 that explained why he believed Manafort had lied to investigators during the investigation conducted by Mueller's team. =Indictment= On 8 June 2018, Kilimnik was indicted by Mueller on charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice, in conjunction with Manafort, regarding unregistered lobbying work. Connection to the Trump campaign Through numerous regular email exchanges, Kilimnik conferred with Manafort after Manafort became Donald Trump's campaign manager in April 2016 and requested that Manafort give \\"private briefings\\" about the Trump campaign to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire and close ally to Vladimir Putin. On 2 August 2016, Kilimnik met with Manafort and Rick Gates at the Grand Havana Room at 666 Fifth Avenue. The encounter which, according to prosecutor Andrew Weissmann goes ‚Äúvery much to the heart of what the special counsel‚Äôs office is investigating,‚Äù included a handoff by Manafort of internal polling data from Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign to Kilimnik. Gates later testified the three left the premises separately, each using different exits. According Mueller's court filings, Kilimnik was still working with Russian intelligence when, during September and October 2016, he was known to be communicating with the Trump campaign. Both Rick Gates and Paul Manafort were in contact with him at the time. Manafort has said that he and Kilimnik discussed the Democratic National Committee cyber attack and release of emails, now known to be undertaken by Russian hacker groups known as Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear. Kilimnik and Manafort had been involved in the Pericles Fund together, an unsuccessful business venture financed by Oleg Deripaska. In July 2016, Manafort told Kilimnik to offer Deripaska private information in exchange for resolving multimillion-dollar disputes about the venture. Per a 2018 classified State Department assessment Ukraine‚Äôs former Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko allowed Kilimnik to escape from Ukraine to Russia after the US federal grand jury charged Kilimnik with obstruction of justice. The New York Times reported on 31 August 2018 that an unnamed Russian political operative and a Ukrainian businessman had illegally purchased four tickets to the inauguration of Donald Trump on behalf of Kilimnik. The tickets, valued at $50,000, were purchased with funds that had flowed through a Cypriot bank account. The transaction was facilitated by Sam Patten, an American lobbyist who had related work with Paul Manafort and pleaded guilty to failing to register as a foreign agent. Kilimnik attended Trump's inauguration. In January 2019, Manafort's lawyers submitted a filing to the court, in response to the Special Counsel's accusation that he had lied to investigators while supposedly co-operating with them. Through an error in redacting, the document accidentally revealed that while he was campaign chairman, Manafort met with Kilimnik, gave him polling data related to the 2016 campaign, and discussed a Ukrainian peace plan with him. Most of the polling data was reportedly public, although some was private Trump campaign polling data. Manafort asked Kilimnik to pass the data to Ukrainians Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov. Manafort also asked Kilimnik to pass polling data to Oleg Deripaska who is close to Putin. In its August 2020 final report on the 2016 election interference, the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee characterized Kilimnik as a \\"Russian intelligence officer\\" who worked with Manafort while he was Trump campaign manager to deflect suspicions of interference away from Russia and onto Ukraine. This effort became a major element of conspiracy theories related to the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal promoted by President Trump and his associates. Russian residence Since at least August 2018, Kilimnik and his wife have been living in a $2 million home located at a heavily guarded elite gated community northwest of the Moscow Region outside the Moscow Ring Road (MKAD).

Personal life It is believed that Anna M. Mangin was born in October of 1854 in the state of Louisiana. A 1900 census noted that she was married to A.F. Mangin, a coal dealer, and that the couple had two sons, only one of which was still living. All of the family members were noted as being literate. Major contributions Anna M. Mangin made major contributions to everyday domesticated household needs early on in the 19th century. Her invention was the pastry fork. Mangin got the patent for the pastry fork on March 1, 1892, in Queens, New York. The pastry fork is an attachment that electrically mixes without the need for arm work. This tool had many uses, including beating eggs, thickening foods, making drawn butter, mashing potatoes, making salad dressings, and most importantly, kneading pastry dough. This improved the lives of many people, and eventually lead to more electric mixing inventions that are used to this day. Kneading pastry dough by hand is a gruelling process that can cause arm cramping and other pains. Also, the dough often does not get fully incorporated when mixed by hand. If the dough does not fully incorporate during the kneading process, then it will not rise, resulting in a dense, and in most cases, underbaked consistency. Exhibition Mangin's pastry fork was displayed at the New York Afro- American Exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. The exhibit was located in the women's exhibit building on the second floor, where Mangin had a corner area to showcase the invention. References US470005A - Pastry- fork. (n.d.).

It is located close to the east bank of the lower reaches of the Mataura River. Despite its name, it is no longer an island. Mataura Island is located some east of the region's main city of Invercargill, and south of the town of Edendale, on the Awarua Plains and close to the western edge of The Catlins. At the time of first settlement in the mid 19th century, the Mataura River flowed to the east of the locality. Early settler Thomas Ayson extended a creek which ran to the west into an irrigation channel linking with the Mataura at both ends. Flooding in 1878 resulted in the Mataura River diverting down the channel and scouring a new bed, and the locality became a genuine island, with parts of the river flowing on either side of it. The old course of the river has now been blocked by stopbanks at the northern (upstream) end. Today, Mataura Island is a small, dairy and sheep farming community. Until the 1990s, it was the site of a school (Mataura Island School), which had operated since 1890, and a Presbyterian church, which was established in 1900.

It is a broad field, with workers fulfilling a variety of roles ranging from design of food processing equipment to genetic modification of organisms. In some respects it is a combined field, drawing from the disciplines of food science and biological engineering to improve the earth's food supply. Creating, processing, and storing food to support the world's population requires extensive interdisciplinary knowledge. Notably, there are many biological engineering processes within food engineering to manipulate the multitude of organisms involved in our complex food chain. Food safety in particular requires biological study to understand the microorganisms involved and how they affect humans. However, other aspects of food engineering, such as food storage and processing, also require extensive biological knowledge of both the food and the microorganisms that inhabit it. This food microbiology and biology knowledge becomes biological engineering when systems and processes are created to maintain desirable food properties and microorganisms while providing mechanisms for eliminating the unfavorable or dangerous ones.  Concepts  Many different concepts are involved in the field of food and biological process engineering. Below are listed several major ones. = Food science = The science behind food and food production involves studying how food behaves and how it can be improved. Researchers analyze longevity and composition (i.e., ingredients, vitamins, minerals, etc.) of foods, as well as how to ensure food safety. = Genetic engineering#food production... = Modern food and biological process engineering relies heavily on applications of genetic manipulation. By understanding plants and animals on the molecular level, scientists are able to engineer them with specific goals in mind. Among the most notable applications of such genetic engineering is the creation of disease or insect resistant plants, such as those modified to produce Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterium that kills strain-specific varieties of insect upon consumption. However, insects are able to adapt to Bacillus thuringiensis strains, necessitating continued research to maintain disease-resistance.  Food safety  This figure illustrates the pathway of food preservation followed by lactic acid bacteria involving Nisin, as well as the pathway of food preservation followed by salt. Additionally, the hurdle effect of food preservation, such as by adding lactic acid bacteria and salt to a food product, is illustrated and described. An important task within the realm of food safety is the elimination of microorganisms responsible for food-borne illness. Food and waterborne diseases still pose a serious health concern, with hundreds of outbreaks reported per year since 1971 in the United States alone. The risk of these diseases has risen throughout the years, mainly due to the mishandling of raw food, poor sanitation, and poor socioeconomic conditions. In addition to diseases caused by direct infection by pathogens, some food borne diseases are caused by the presence of toxins produced by microorganisms in food. There are five main types of microbial pathogens which contaminate food and water: viruses, bacteria, fungi, pathogenic protozoa and helminths. Several bacteria, such as E. coli, Clostridium botulinum, and Salmonella enterica, are well-known and are targeted for elimination via various industrial processes. Though bacteria are often the focus of food safety processes, viruses, protozoa, and molds are also known to cause food- borne illness and are of concern when designing processes to ensure food safety. Although the goal of food safety is to eliminate harmful organisms from food and prevent food-borne illness, detecting said organisms is another important function of food safety mechanisms. = Monitoring and detection = The goal of most monitoring and detection processes is the rapid detection of harmful microorganisms with minimal interruption to the processing of food products. An example of a detection mechanism that relies heavily on biological processes is usage of chromogenic microbiological media.  Chromogenic Microbiological Media  Chromogenic microbiological media use colored enzymes to detect the presence of certain bacteria. In conventional bacteria culturing, bacteria are allowed to grow on a medium that supports many strains. Since it is hard to isolate bacteria, many cultures of different bacteria are able to form. To identify a particular bacteria culture, scientists must identify it using only its physical characteristics. Then further tests can be performed to confirm the presence of the bacteria, such as serology tests that find antibodies formed in organisms as a response to infection. In contrast, chromogenic microbiological media use particular color-producing enzymes that are targeted for metabolism by a certain strain of bacteria. Thus, if the given cultures are present, the media will become colored accordingly as the bacteria metabolize the color-producing enzyme. This greatly facilitates the identification of certain bacteria cultures and can eliminate need for further testing. To guard against misidentification of bacteria, the chromogenic plates typically incorporate additional enzymes that will be processed by other bacteria. Now, as the non-target bacteria interact with the additional enzymes, they will produce colors that distinguish them from the target bacteria. = Mechanisms = Food safety has been practiced for thousands of years, but with the rise of heavily industrial agriculture, the demand for food safety has steadily increased, prompting more research into the ways to achieve greater food safety. A primary mechanism that will be discussed in this article is heating of food products to kill microorganisms, as this has a millennia-long history and is still extensively used. However, more recent mechanisms have been created such as application of ultraviolet light, high pressure, electric field, cold plasma, usage of ozone, and irradiation of food.  Heating  A report given to the Food and Drug Administration by the Institute of Food Technologists thoroughly discusses the thermal processing of food. A notable step in development of heat application to food processing is pasteurization, developed by Louis Pasteur in the nineteenth century. Pasteurization is used to kill microorganisms that could pose risks to consumers or shorten the shelf life of food products. Primarily applied to liquid food products, pasteurization is regularly applied to fruit juice, beer, milk, and ice cream. Heat applied during pasteurization varies from around 60 ¬∞C to kill bacteria to around 80 ¬∞C to kill yeasts. Most pasteurization processes have been optimized recently to involve several steps of heating at various temperatures and minimize the time needed for the process. Basic drawing of an ammonia compressor. Ammonia compressors are used in many factories to cool food products.A more severe food heating mechanism is thermal sterilization. While pasteurization destroys most bacteria and yeast growing in food products, the goal of sterilization is to kill almost all viable organisms found in food products including yeast, mold, bacteria, and spore forming organisms. Done properly, this process will greatly extend the shelf life of food products and can allow them to be stored at room temperature. As detailed in The Handbook of Food Preservation, thermal sterilization typically involves four steps. First, food products are heated to between 110-125 ¬∞C, and the products are given time for the heat to travel through the material completely. After this, the temperature must be maintained long enough to kill microorganisms before the food product is cooled to prevent cooking. In practice, though complete sterility of food products could be achieved, the intense and extended heating needed to accomplish this could reduce the nutritive value of the food products, thus, only a partial sterilization is performed.  Low-Temperature Process  Low-temperature processing also plays an essential role in food processing and storage. During this process, microorganisms and enzymes are subjected to low temperatures. Unlike heating, chilling does not destroy the enzymes and microorganisms but simply reduces their activity, which is effective as long as the temperature is maintained. As the temperature is raised, activity will rise again accordingly. It follows that, unlike heating, the effect of preservation by cold is not permanent; hence the importance of maintaining the cold chain throughout the shelf life of the food product. (Chapter 16 pg, 396) It is important to note that there are two distinct low temperature processes: chilling and freezing. Chilling is the application of temperatures within the range of 0-8 ¬∞C, while freezing is usually below 18 ¬∞C. Refrigeration does slow spoilage in food and reduce the risk of bacterial growth, however, it does not improve the quality of the product.  Irradiation  Food irradiation is another notable biological engineering process to achieve food safety. Research into the potential utilization of ionizing irradiation for food preservation started in the 1940s as an extension of studies on the effect of radiation on living cells. The FDA approved usage of ionizing radiation on food products in 1990. This radiation removes electrons from atoms, and these electrons go on to damage the DNA of microorganisms living in the food, killing the microorganisms. Irradiation can be used to pasteurize food products, such as seafood, poultry, and red meat, thus making these food products safer for consumers. Some irradiation is also used to delay fruit ripening processes, which can kill microorganisms that accelerate the ripening and spoilage of produce. Low dosages of radiation can also be used to kill insects living in harvested crops, as the radiation will stunt the insects' development at various stages and damage their ability to reproduce.  Food storage and preservation  Meat that has been gas flushed; a technique used for modified atmosphere packaging.Food storage and preservation is a key component of food engineering processes and relies heavily on biological engineering to understand and manipulate the organisms involved. Note that the above food safety processes such as pasteurization and sterilization destroy the microorganisms that also contribute to deterioration of food products while not necessarily posing a risk to people. Understanding of these processes, their effects, and the microorganisms at play in various food processing techniques is a very important biological engineering task within food engineering. Factories and processes must be created to ensure that food products can be processed in an efficient and effective manner, which again relies heavily on biological engineering expertise. = Produce = Preservation and processing of fresh produce poses many biological engineering challenges. Understanding of biology is particularly important to processing produce because most fruits and vegetables are living organisms from the time of harvest to the time of consumption. Before harvesting, understanding of plant ontogeny, or origin and development, and the manipulation of these developmental processes are key components of the industrial agriculture process. Understanding of plant developmental cycles governs how and when plants are harvested, impacts storage environments, and contributes to creating intervention processes. Even after harvesting, fruits and vegetables undergo the biological processes of respiration, transpiration, and ripening. Control over these natural plant processes should be achieved to prevent food spoilage, sprouting or growth of produce during storage, and reduction in quality or desirability, such as through wilting or loss of desirable texture. = Technology = When considering food storage and preservation, the technologies of modified atmosphere and controlled atmosphere are widely used for the storage and packing of several types of foods. They offer several advantages such as delay of ripening and senescence of horticultural commodities, control of some biological processes such as rancidity, insects, bacteria and decay, among others. Controlled atmosphere (CA) storage refers to atmospheres that are different than normal air and strictly controlled at all times. This type of storage manipulates the CO2 and O2 levels within airtight stores of containers. Modified atmosphere (MA) storage refers to any atmosphere different from normal air, typically made by mixing CO2, O2, and N2.  Waste management  Another biological engineering process within food engineering involves the processing of agricultural waste. Though it may fall more within the realm of environmental engineering, understanding how organisms in the environment will respond to the waste products is important for assessing the impact of the processes and comparing waste processing strategies. It is also important to understand which organisms are involved in the decomposition of the waste products, and the byproducts that will be produced as a result of their activity. To discuss direct application of biological engineering, biological waste processing techniques are used to process organic waste and sometimes create useful byproducts. There are two main processes by which organic matter is processed via microbes: aerobic processes and anaerobic processes. These processes convert organic matter to cell mass through synthesis processes of microorganisms. Aerobic processes occur in the presence of oxygen, take organic matter as input, and produce water, carbon dioxide, nitrate, and new cell mass. Anaerobic processes occur in the absence of oxygen and produce less cell mass than aerobic processes. An additional benefit of anaerobic processes is that they also generate methane, which can be burned as a fuel source. Design of both aerobic and anaerobic biological waste processing plants requires careful control of temperature, humidity, oxygen concentration, and the waste products involved. Understanding of all aspects of the system and how they interact with one another is important for developing efficient waste management plants and falls within the realm of biological engineering.

Liu Zhibai studied in Suzhou in 1933, in China's best Art school at the time: the Suzhou Fine Arts College (this school had exhibited in the 1920s more than 500 famous plaster sculptures, and brought from France nearly ten thousand albums of Western art). He studied under Mr. Gu Yanping, director of the Chinese painting department of Suzhou Fine Arts College. The Gu family is a large family of well-known Chinese collectors. The \\"Guoyun Pavilion\\" established by this family has been collecting the works of many great artists in the history of Chinese art for nearly a century, dating from the Tang Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty. Starting from 1935, Liu Zhibai lived for a long time at the Guoyun Pavilion. There he studied and explored, under Professor Gu Yanping's guidance, the works of the great Chinese painters and learned ancient art history. During the Second World War, Japan invaded China. Liu Zhibai then embarked on a journey of exile that lasted eight years. He finally returned to his home county of Fengyang in 1946 to teach art in a college. In 1948, during the Chinese Civil War, Liu Zhibai fled the war and traveled to Guangxi Province. In December of the same year, he proposed his first theory of painting, External Learning Focused on the Ego, in Quanzhou County, birth country of Shi Tao, a great Chinese painter. Throughout his 50 years of artistic creation, Liu Zhibai has studied all the landscapes of the Yunnan- Guizhou Plateau while continuing to nurture his passion for ancient Chinese art. The artist, who has always been independent and meticulously explored the journey to artistic creation, finally reached the peak of his own artistic creation towards the end of his life. He created a new artistic style, different from the Millennium ink painting of Chinese art, expressing his choice of lifestyle and artistic expression, breaking from secular society. Because of his unique and self-artistic expression, Liu Zhibai wasn't recognized by the Chinese artistic community until his death. Fifteen years after his death, his explorations of art with Chinese ink and his great contribution to the artistic mind have come to be more and more appreciated. Art historians discovered him and devoted research trials to him. The first historian claimed that the roots of Zhibai's art strongly owed to the Song and Yuan dynasties, to which was added a hint of the artistic style of the Ming and Qing dynasties. He affirmed that the artist had been inspired by both the essence of traditional Chinese arts and the innovation of artistic language. His 60 years of careful study of ancient art techniques and the pursuit of artistic and coherent innovation have helped him to create new ink painting techniques with which he unveiled Chinese landscapes only from the age of 80. Liu Zhibai became the last guardian of Chinese painting and a pioneer of innovation in the new century: the art of ink painting, which he fathered in the last years of his life, marked a turning point between Chinese tradition and modernity. It puts forth the historical trend of abstract art and the performance of Chinese ink painting in the 21st century. After Liu Zhibai's death, a number of publishing houses have released a total of 15 monographs and over 20 research journals with titles such as Book of Famous Artists of Modern and Contemporary Chinese Paintings - Liu Zhibai, Book of Paintings by Liu Zhibai, Qian Mountain Characters - Liu Zhibai's Art, Freshness of Painting, Ink Traces and Poetic Drunkenness - Ink Landscape Paintings, Defending Black by Appreciating White - The Art of Liu Zhibai. More than 90 of his works are now part of collections owned by multiple art institutions, including the National Art Museum of China, the National Chinese Academy of Painting, the Guizhou Provincial Museum, the Provincial Institute of History and Guizhou Culture, Anhui Provincial Museum of History and Culture, and Anhui Provincial Museum of Art.  Artistic Background  In the early 1970s, Liu Zhibai lived in a mountain village near the Xima River in Longli County, Guizhou Province. In the late 1970s, he began a new period of artistic creation, which has for main theme the landscape of the Qian Mountain, painted in ink. In 1984, the Guizhou Provincial Museum collected four pieces of landscape paintings and a piece of flower painting. * In 1985, Liu Zhibai organized his own solo exhibition in Guiyang. In the same year, the Guiyang Art Publishing House published the book Compilation of Paintings by Liu Zhibai and Jiang Menggu. In 1988, his new works were exhibited at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. * In 1987, Liu Zhibai was hired as a librarian at the Guizhou Provincial Museum of Cultural History. In December 1999, Liu Zhibai's Compilation of Works was published by the Guizhou People's Publishing House. * In 2000, the artist created more than 100 works using a completely new technique of ink painting, and exhibited them at the Guizhou Provincial Museum. This exhibition is welcomed by experts. At the same time, the Federation of Literary Circles and the association of Chinese artists of Guiyang City are organizing a \\"Liu Zhibai Chinese Painting Symposium\\" in Guiyang. Many of his works are acquired by the Museum of Cultural History, as well as other museums and individuals in Guizhou Province and elsewhere. * In 2013, \\"Liu Zhibai Chinese Painting Exhibition\\" finally takes place. The Liu Zhibai Chinese Painting Exhibition and the Liu Zhibai Art Symposium, both sponsored by the Chinese National Academy of Arts, the Creative Research Department of the Chinese National Academy of Painting and the Art Museum, are inaugurated on July 1, 2013 at the National Art Museum of China. The exhibition brings together more than 100 works on landscapes and flowers made by Liu Zhibai from 1938 to 2003. The exhibition presents the history of Mr. Liu Zhibai's art, an artist who studied and explored Chinese painting while bringing innovation for almost a century. * In February 2018, more than 12 masterpieces by Liu Zhibai are exhibited for the first time in France. * In April 2018, more than 12 masterpieces by Liu Zhibai are exhibited for the seconde time in Annonay France.  Social Assessment  In Investment Value Analysis of 30 Contemporary Chinese Painters, Liu Zhibai was named one of the 30 Most Academic and Most Valued Painters of the Contemporary Age, including Master Wu Guanzhong. Mr. Feng Qiyong, former vice president and scholar of the China Academy of Arts, amazed by Mr. Liu Zhibai's paintaings, volunteered to write a preface to the compilation of his paintings. His appreciation of Liu Zhibai's art is evident in the following quote: \\"Liu Lao's painting embodies authentic Chinese style and unique Chinese charm. We know how rich is the Chinese artistic tradition, particularly the pictorial tradition, and how much pictorial arts develop under the brush of the literati. Under Liu Zhibai‚Äôs brush, the semantic fields remains diverse, no term predominates. Since the origins of landscape painting, Master Liu's paintings show or exceed the charm of Shi Tao and Shi Xi. The landscapes he depicts seem born from the real mountains and rivers of Guizhou, sparkling with natural freshness. His works reveal the greatest enjoyment of nature ‚Äì there is not the slightest feeling of obsolescence remains, on the contrary, every single detail is refreshing. We find the authentic charm of the real water of Guizhou! To me, Liu's painting was personalized, and he found himself confused with the world, including landscapes and their natural environment. He knew how to reach the ideal state pursued by all painters! \\" For Chen Lvsheng, a famous Chinese literary critic, Liu Zhibai's paintings reveal a wild temperament. His works show not only the ups and downs of his life, but also the changing and indefinable life chapters, as well as his wild artistic style, created by his accommodating lifestyle philosophy.

Reign  Baddega was a son of his predecessor Yuddhamalla II, and served as a vassal of the Rashtrakuta king Krishna II. He is said to have fought 42 battles, and acquired the title Solada-ga·πá·∏ça (\\"the unvanquished hero\\"). The Vemulavada Chalukyas were old rivals of the Vengi Chalukyas, and had participated in Rashtrakuta campaigns against them. The Vengi Chalukya ruler Gunaga Vijayaditya III inflicted a humiliating defeat on Krishna. According to the Vengi Chalukya inscriptions, Vijayaditya captured Baddega, and offered him protection. After Vijayaditya's death in 892, the succession of the next king Bhima I was contested by some rebels. Taking advantage of this, Krishna invaded Vengi once again, and captured the frontier region administered by the Ranamardadaka family. However, he was forced to retreat by the Vengi general Kusuma-yudha. This is attested by the Kuravi (or Koravi) inscription of Kusuma-yudha's subordinate Peddana. Krishna appears to have launched another invasion of Vengi, as attested by Bhima's Vedataluru grant inscription. This time, the Rashtrakuta army led by Gundyana penetrated deeper into the Vengi Chalukya kingdom, before being forced to retreat. Baddega appears to have participated in both of Krishna's campaigns against Bhima. According to his family's Parbhani inscription and the court poet Pampa, he captured Bhima as if \\"he seized a crocodile in water.\\" The simile suggests that Baddega captured Bhima in his natural environment, that is, within the Vengi kingdom, possibly in the capital. Therefore, this event probably happened during the second Rashtrakuta invasion of Vengi, when the invaders penetrated deeper into the kingdom. Bhima appears to have escaped the captivity in a short time, and continued to rule Vengi. His son Iramarti Ganda defeated the Rashtrakuta forces at Peruvanguru and Niravadyapura. Both Iramarti and the Rashtrakuta general Gundyana were killed in this war. Nothing is known about Bhima's other military achievements. He appears to have died around 895, and was succeeded by his son Yuddhamalla III.  Cultural contributions  An inscription of Baddega's descendant Arisimha II mentions the Baddegeshvara (\\"Ishvara of Baddega\\") temple; the name suggests that it was built by Baddega. This temple is identified with the modern Bheemeshvara temple at Vemulavada.

Life Tjoflot was born at the Ytrab√∏dn farm in Tjoflot, the son of Elling Nilsson Tjoflot (1819‚Äì1870) and Barbro Endresdatter Folkedal from Trones (1837‚Äì1905). Nils was an only child, and his father died when he was five years old. There had not been any previous violinists in the family, but there were many violinists in Tjoflot and Nils was motivated to perform alongside them. He received a violin from his mother when he was seven years old. The instrument was probably made by Hans Eikanes, and it was probably Eikanes that also taught Tjoflot to play the Hardanger fiddle. Tjoflot was later taught by Olav H√•stab√∏ from L√∏flaten in Kvanndal, and then by Ola Mosafinn. Nils Tjoflot was a talented player that was known throughout Hardanger and participated in folk music competitions held by the Western Norwegian Association (); the first such competition was held in 1896, and the second in 1897. Tjoflot often played for dances at weddings and at other events around the Hardanger Fjord. He played at his first wedding at the age of 10, and he also played for tourists visiting the Hardanger Fjord. The folklorist Rikard Berge mentioned Nils Tjoflot as one of the most talented folk musicians in Hardanger in his article \\"Spelemenner\\" (Folk Musicians). Together with several other folk musicians from the area, Tjoflot was a member of the Western Norwegian Association. Death Tjoflot died in a shipwreck in 1898 when he was only 32 years old. On Sunday, July 10, 1898, he traveled with his custom-built sailboat to Granvin. He was frequently in Granvin, where he had many friends and acquaintances from his confirmation, including many that played fiddle. Both Severin Kjerland and Nils Nilsson Eida were admirers of Nils. This Sunday there were two men with him in the boat, Endre Sjurson Kvammen and Jon Tjoflot. In Granvin, Nils Tjoflot played at a barn dance, and the dance lasted until late in the night. It was already morning when the three had to travel back on the sailboat to Tjoflot. Nils sat in the bow with his fiddle and Endre was at the helm. Nils is reported to have stated, \\"We're sailing under the Norwegian flag.\\" He played the folk dance tune \\"Bl√•mannen,\\" which he had learned from H√•stab√∏. Soon they were far out in the fjord, and the music could no longer heard by those on the land. Suddenly, they turned against the wind so that the boat was sailing close-hauled near R√∏ynstrand. The boat went over and took on water. It had heavy ballast, stone covered with a latticework, and it sank in the blink of an eye. It all happened so fast that no one on land fully understood what had happened. People quickly rowed out to the scene, but there was nothing to see when they arrived. Soon afterward, Nils's fiddle and hat floated up, and that was all. This caused much sadness because Nils was a popular man known for his hard work, artistic sense, and forthrightness. Tjoflot's fiddles Tjoflot owned several fiddles in his work as a folk musician. He also made his own Hardanger fiddles, and at one time he owned a Samnanger fiddle. The article \\"Felene hans Nils Tjoflot\\" (Nils Tjoflot's Fiddles) is dedicated to Tjoflot's instruments. The fiddle that floated to the surface after Tjoflot drowned on the morning of June 11, 1898 was repaired by the violin maker Knut Eilevsson Steintj√∏nndalen, who had also made the instrument. The fiddle was restored to its original condition, but perhaps not as good as when it was owned by Tjoflot, who considered it a top-quality instrument. The fiddle is now displayed at the Hardanger Folk Museum in Utne, which lies across the Hardanger Fjord from the village of Tjoflot. Musical work Tjoflot composed Hardanger fiddle pieces (sl√•tter), schottisches, waltzes, and other pieces. He was especially fond of playing pieces for turning dances (runddans). He established his own Tjoflot version of tunes for turning dances. Tjoflot had a distinctive style of playing and way of performing material that was well-liked by people. He also taught several folk musicians in Hardanger, and he taught them the Hardanger fiddle pieces that he had learned from others as well as his own compositions. Tjoflot's Hardanger fiddle pieces and waltzes are also performed today, and recordings of them have been played on the folk music program on Norwegian radio. About 20 waltzes are known based on the work of Nils Tjoflot. Many of these waltzes were recorded by the folk musician Anders S. Kjerland from Granvin. In 2008, the diatonic button accordion player Rannveig Dj√∏nne released a CD called Spelferd heim ‚Äì sl√•tter fr√• Hardanger og Voss p√• durspel (Spelferd Heim: Tunes from Hardanger and Voss for Button Accordion) on which she performs three pieces by Nils Tjoflot: \\"Hamborgar etter Nils Tjoflot\\" (Hamburg Melody by Nils Tjoflot), \\"Reinlender etter Nils Tjoflot\\" (Rhineland Melody by Nils Tjoflot), and the well-known \\"Ginavalsen\\" (Gina Waltz), which he wrote in heartbreak when he learned that the girl he loved had become engaged to another.

Mukherji has released 12 music albums with HMV Saregama, one of the leading music labels in India. As of 2018, she has performed concerts in India, the USA, Canada, and Bangladesh. She has also performed for film and television. Mukherji currently lives in and works out of San Francisco, USA and Kolkata, India.  Early life  Born into a Bengali family, Mukherji grew up in Kolkata, India where she studied at South Point School. She received her musical training at Dakshinee, a prominent Rabindra Sangeet academy in Kolkata, and obtained a degree in English literature from Jadavpur University, where she also won a Gates Cambridge Scholarship. She pursued post graduate studies in English literature from St. John‚Äôs College in the UK and Collegio Ghislieri, at the University of Pavia, Italy.  Career  Mukherji performed her debut solo concert in Kolkata in September, 2009. She has since performed extensively in India and abroad, including at the North American Bengali Conferences on three occasions ‚Äì in 2012 (Las Vegas), 2013 (Toronto), and 2016 (New York City). Mukherji has attempted to introduce innovation to her Rabindra Sangeet performances. In 2011, she performed a concert titled Nutan Juger Bhore (English:The Dawning of a New Era), accompanied by an 11-piece orchestra, which is unusual for the genre. In 2012 Mukherji sang for a music album Romancing Tagore, that was a collaborative effort between Indian and Pakistani artists, Shubha Mudgal, Najam Sheraz, Debojyoti Mishra, and Indira Varma to present Tagore‚Äôs songs in Urdu. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh released the album in February 2012. In April 2012, Mukherji visited Mauritius as part of a joint initiative between UNESCO and the Ministry of Culture of the Government of Mauritius on the occasion of Rabindranath Tagore's 150th birth anniversary. The purpose of the trip was to introduce the musical work of Tagore to school children in that country. In 2015, Mukherji presented a solo concert for the President of India, to celebrate the 154th Birth Anniversary of Tagore, at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, New Delhi. = Film and Television = Mukherji was a regular guest on a weekly music show Chirantani (), that aired on Tara Muzik from 2008 to 2011.

In 2016 HMV Saregama released a compilation album Best of Kamalini Mukherjee.  Reviews  Mukherji has been critically appreciated both for her rendition of traditional Rabindra Sangeet as well as for her more interpretative work in the genre. Reviewing one of her earliest concerts, organized by Dakshinee in May 2006, The Telegraph wrote: > Recital of the day came from Kamalini Mukhopadhyay. Here is one young > soprano who has lived up to the great expectations of early years. Her Ki > ragini bajale () came at the end of the Prem segment. Soaked in the > ambiguous melancholy of Kanada, she embellished the number with undulating > glides alternating with brisk melodic phrases. In September 2007, The Telegraph praised her performance at another Dakshinee concert, writing \\"Yet a musical and humane understanding of the whole life and shape of a song came unmistakably through in the controlled devastation of Kamalini Mukherjee‚Äôs Tori amar hothat dubey jai ()\\". Mukherji‚Äôs 2009 debut solo concert was also positively reviewed. The Telegraph wrote: > [T]he most remarkable element of her gayaki is the precise and powerful > scansion ‚Äî never an inadvertent splitting of a word, or a breather in the > wrong place ‚Äî- that puts her in the tiny club of cerebral Rabindrasangeet > singers. Reviewing the same concert, The Statesman wrote \\"Kamalini Mukherji holds in her singing a promise to succeed in popularizing Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs song among the present generation\\", while Anandabazar Patrika praised her arrangement of Tagore‚Äôs Devotional Songs and Love Songs, and the way that she was able to draw out diverse moods such as happiness, wonderment, separation, and earnestness. In November 2010, The Telegraph reviewed her experimental concert Nutan juger bhore (‡¶®‡ßÇ‡¶§‡¶® ‡¶Ø‡ßÅ‡¶ó‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶≠‡ßã‡¶∞‡ßá), > Thanks to Mukherji‚Äôs powerful singing that never allowed a note to waver or > an emotional resonance to overstep its suggestion, the music remained as > embellishment and never took an iota away from her performance.

In later years he was secretary of the State Civil Service Association. But he was best known for having conducted the earliest wireless experiments in the State of Western Australia. Early life and family Stevens was born 24 June 1861 at Keynsham, Somerset, England and was the youngest of a family who arrived in Western Australia on 5 August 1868 on board the Palestine. Stevens married Ann Elizabeth Graham (born 8 June 1863) on 23 December 1884 at South Australia. They had three sons and five daughters.Martin & Associated Families in Australia 1830 - 2017 Professional career At the age of 13 years he entered the telegraph service as a messenger at Toodyay. Twenty years of Mr. Stevens's life were passed on the south coast as telegraph stationmaster at Bremer Bay, Israelite Bay and Eucla. From the latter station he controlled the traffic during the boom days of the goldfields. From there he was recalled to Perth in 1896 to assume the management of the telegraph department from the central office, and after its transfer to the Commonwealth service in 1901 he was appointed electrical engineer. He retired from the service in 1906. In 1908 Mr. Stevens became secretary of the Civil Service Association, and held the position until he retired in November, 1932. =Wireless experiments= George Phillip Stevens Western Australia, was slow to engage in wireless telegraphy experiments, but there was public outcry in response to a number of marine disasters on the Western Australian coast in 1898. A need for communication between the Rottnest Island lighthouse and Fremantle Port (16 miles) was identified. In January 1899, W. J. Hancock (Government electrician) suggested that wireless telegraphy could be employed for the task at much lower cost than submarine cable and noted that greater distances had already been achieved in England. In May 1899, George Phillip Stevens (Manager and Electrician, General Post-office) announced that preliminary tests had just been completed in a workshop environment and provided a comprehensive description of the equipment which was described as simple. Two further marine disasters of the W.A. coast in July 1899, forced the Government to act immediately and an order for submarine cables was placed. Nevertheless, wireless experiments continued. Various difficulties were encountered in extending transmission distance, but in September 1899, Stevens announced that reliable transmissions were now being achieved across 5 rooms in the basement of the Telegraph Office. It was further announced that attempts would now be made between the General Post-office, Perth and the Windsor Hotel, South Perth (about 1 mile). In October 1899, successful tests were conducted between the Perth Yacht Club and a police launch, out to a distance of 3/4 mile. Stevens was limited by local workshop facilities and his coherer was not able to be evacuated, resulting in loss of sensitivity. He recommended acquisition of Marconi apparatus, but this in turn led to excessive establishment costs and experiments ceased at this point. The submarine cable between Rottnest Island and the mainland was officially opened in March 1900. Stevens continued to promote wireless telegraphy through public education activities, including practical demonstrations. As part of the Federal Government proposals in 1906, Stevens made enquiries of the Fremantle Harbour Trust as to their attitude to establishment of a station on Rottnest Island, which was supported. Personal life Stevens was a member of the Claremont Municipal Council for upwards of a quarter of a century, and held the office of Mayor during the four years of the 1914-18 war.

Completed in 1985, the mall specialised in electronics and IT-related goods. It was a more upmarket competitor of Sim Lim Square, the latter of which catered more to those seeking more budget purchases. It was closed and demolished in 2016. History The mall opened in January 1985 as Funan Centre as a general shopping centre, which provided more options for shoppers to shop at other than Orchard Road. In the early 90s, the mall began to attract a critical mass of electronic and IT retailers over the years. Its main and long-time anchor tenant is Challenger Superstore, a major homegrown IT store established in 1984. In 1992, the mall was refurbished. It later adopted the name Funan The IT Mall in 1997 to reflect its current focus on IT related outlets. In 2005, the mall received minor upgrades, and was again renamed to Funan DigitaLife Mall. There were a total of 178 outlets spread over six floors. Challenger Superstore occupied almost the entirety of the sixth floor, and was accompanied by another anchor tenants such as Harvey Norman in the other floors. =Decline and revamp= Due to the popularity of online shopping, business at the mall had been declining over the past few years, forcing tenants to close down. The mall was initially planned to be renovated in 2014. However, it was later slated for demolition. The last day of mall operation was 30 June 2016. All tenants have since relocated and the building was later demolished. The new commercial building known as Funan was being built on its former site. Originally slated to be reopened in 2020, the building was re-opened in June 2019. The new commercial building will have a 24-hour drive-thru, underground walkway to City Hall MRT station, The Adelphi Lifestyle Mall and Capitol Theatre.

He was involved in the fur trade for over thirty years, during which time he served in York Factory and the Severn House. During his fifty years of service with the Hudson Bay Company, Tomison worked his way through the ranks.  Early life  Tomison was born in the Orkney Islands in 1739.  Career  William Tomison's career with the Hudson Bay Company started in 1760. There was a lack of trading posts in particular areas, when Tomison started there was not one in the Western interior. This was vital information that helped William Tomison progress within the Hudson Bay Company, giving him insight. He progressed within the Hudson Bay Company and moved through the ranks and became the Governor Inland Master and later helped them as a company to expand. Whilst the smallpox epidemic occurred Tomison's journals showcased the sheer work that had and the employees at Cumberland House to be put in to try and help the Aboriginal people. It displayed a compassionate side to Tomison despite many regarding him as a man that was not pleasant, but the journal suggests that he was not entirely cold-hearted. William Tomison was selected to lead the Hudson Bay Company's expansion and this one could suggest he was partly the reason for the Hudson Bay Company compete throughout Saskatchewan River with other Canadian traders. After the outbreak of the smallpox disease in 1730 the pursuit and conquest to gain control of fur production was important.Cavanaugh, Catherine Anne, Michael Payne, and Donald Grant Wetherell. Alberta Formed, Alberta Transformed. Edmonton: University of Alberta Press, 2006. William gained hands on experience in a somewhat unconventional manner. For the duration of two years Tomison was at the Lake Winnipeg and gained invaluable education that helped set him apart from other Hudson Bay Traders. During that period he learned and he understood the Aboriginal customs, language and their general community. In 1767 Tomison became one of Hudson Bay's inland travellers from York Factory He was one of the earliest employees that were sent to network and create vital connection with the First Nations. Tomison's personality hindered him from progressing any further in the company. Many Indians refused to trade and directly make deals with him which was arguably, one of the reasons that jeopardised Tomison moving higher. He delegated with authority and recorded his thoughts in his journal, although he protected his men and tried to ensure they were safe in the process he stated that \\"its dangerous to send out men with the Natives at present, as several of them is of a very savage Nature.\\"Daschuk, James W. Clearing the Plains: Disease, Politics of Starvation, and the Loss of Aboriginal Life. Regina, Saskatchewan: U of R Press, 2014. However due to his observation there were new strategies put in place, the traders made the decision to avoid the Natives from seeing them so they shipped furs during the night. There was great hunger during this time and there were extreme measures put in place  Smallpox epidemic  At the beginning of the 1780s there was an outbreak of smallpox in the Western Canada, the Northern Great Plains which severely affected the villages and the population reduced drastically in size by about 70-80%.Hodge, A. R. \\"\\"In Want of Nourishment for to Keep Them Alive\\": Climate Fluctuations, Bison Scarcity, and the Smallpox Epidemic of 1780-82 on the Northern Great Plains.\\" Environmental History 17, no. 2 (2012): 365-403. doi:10.1093/envhis/emr153. p 366 William Tomison is greatly known for the records that he made of this epidemic, he recorded in his diary in great detail concerning this. Giving thorough detail and updates regarding Cree Indians who were struck by smallpox, he also journalled about those that came to him to seek help.Huck, Barbara. Kisiskatchewan: The Great River Road. Winnipeg: Heartland, 2013 p 55 His journal contained great detail about this outbreak and it brought clarity about the epidemic. From records and accounts from the time it is clear that the British employees did not suffer from smallpox as they were in contact with it or had smallpox or a similar disease when they were infants. The British employees of HBC did not contract or catch this disease because they had smallpox, cowpox or chicken pox when they were infants.Cavanaugh, Catherine Anne, Michael Payne, and Donald Grant Wetherell. Alberta Formed, Alberta Transformed. Edmonton: University of Alberta Press, 2006.p.126 This led to them being immune to the disease when it spread in Western Canada Employees that were Hudson Bay Company and Canadians (despite sexual activity between Indigenous women and employees being banned)Daschuk, James W.

P33 were sensitive to the disease, however some individuals did not contract the disease. Unfortunately, there is no concrete evidence to show that the Aboriginal people blamed the British or French traders for this incident.Cavanaugh, Catherine Anne, Michael Payne, and Donald Grant Wetherell. Alberta Formed, Alberta Transformed. Edmonton: University of Alberta Press, 2006.p.126  Edmonton House  Edmonton House, built in October 1795. Tomison was the founder of Edmonton House and the Officer, Chief from 1795-98. After him succeeded James Curtis. Buckingham House, Cumberland House and Hudson House were properties that were a part of the Hudson Bay Company.  Food shortages  In 1880 there were severe food shortages and some of the workers decided to stay with Indigenous peoples so that they could survive through the winter. Changes in climate essentially led to starvation due to food shortages in the area. The primary cause of large loss of life due to smallpox was not solely due to the shortage of food, however, the lack did not help strengthen the individuals in any way. It hindered them and correlated with the lack of wild animals to kill, which connected with the change in climate.  Journal  The journals Tomison wrote not only shed light from a personal perspective onto the events that had occurred. But there was a constant entries into the journal with his private thoughts regarding the epidemic and how it had affected the land, the people and the business. This journal gives great insight into one's life during the spread of smallpox in the 1780. This enables Historians and other fields such as sociologists, biologists in their quest to understand when a particular epidemic occurred, where it spanned geographically. The personal account also shows the impact it had on people that knew those that died and the effect it had on their lives, or the extent it affected both communities. There were many observations and accounts that were made by Tomison, daily reflections that covered the fluctuations in daily life and the way the smallpox affected those in his surrounding area. In his entries it gav insight into what was going on during that time but it also brought forth parts of his character and his perspective on particular matters. In one journal entry on December 25, 1781 it states \\"in the Evening Traded with the Indians & made them presents as usual, but never expect to see them again.\\"Daschuk, James W.

Sea Ice Microbial Communities (SIMCO) refer to groups of microorganisms living within and at the interfaces of sea ice at the poles. The ice matrix they inhabit has strong vertical gradients of salinity, light, temperature and nutrients. Sea ice chemistry is most influenced by the salinity of the brine which affects the pH and the concentration of dissolved nutrients and gases. The brine formed during the melting sea ice creates pores and channels in the sea ice in which these microbes can live. As a result of these gradients and dynamic conditions, a higher abundance of microbes are found in the lower layer of the ice, although some are found in the middle and upper layers. Despite this extreme variability in environmental conditions, the taxonomical community composition tends to remain consistent throughout the year, until the ice melts. Much of the knowledge concerning the community diversity of the sea ice is known through genetic analyses and next-generation sequencing. In both the Arctic and Antarctic, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Flavobacteriia are the common bacterial classes found. Most sea ice Archaea belong to the phylum Thaumarchaeota while most of the protists belong to one of 3 supergroups: Alveolata, Stramenopile and Rhizaria. The abundance of living cells within and on sea ice ranges from 104-108 cells/mL. These microbial communities play a significant role in the microbial loop as well as in global biogeochemical cycles. Sea ice communities are important because they provide an energy source for higher trophic levels, they contribute to primary production and they provide a net influx of Carbon in the oceans at the poles.  Habitat  = Sea ice matrix: chemical and physical properties = Algal and bacterial community beneath Antarctic sea ice.  Sea ice formation and physical properties  The autumnal decrease in atmospheric temperatures in the Arctic and Antarctic leads to the formation of a surface layer of ice crystals called frazil ice. A mixture of salts, nutrients and dissolved organic matter (DOM) known as brine is expelled when frazil ice solidifies to form sea ice. Brine permeates through the ice cover and creates a network of channels and pores. This process forms an initial semisolid matrix of approximately 1 meter in thickness with strong temperature, salinity, light and nutrient gradients. Since thickening of the sea ice during winter months results in more salts being expelled from the frazil ice, atmospheric temperatures are strongly and negatively correlated to brine salinity. The sea ice-seawater interface temperature is maintained at the freezing point of seawater (~1.8 ¬∞C) while the sea ice-air interface reflects more the current atmospheric temperature. Brine salinity can increase to as much as 100 PSU when sea ice temperature reaches ~3 ¬∞C below the freezing point of seawater. Brine temperature typically ranges from -1.9 to -6.7 ¬∞C in the winter. Sea ice temperatures fluctuate in response to irradiance and atmospheric temperatures, but also change in response to the volume of snowfall. Accumulating snow on the ice cover combined with harsh atmospheric conditions can lead to the formation of a snowpack layer that absorbs UV radiations and provides insulation to the bottom ice layer. The fraction of irradiance reaching the sea ice matrix is thus also controlled by the amount of snowfall and varies from <0.01% to 5% depending on the thickness and density of the snowpack. Frost flowers growing on sea ice in the Arctic. The surface of sea ice also allows the formation of frost flowers, which have their own unique microbial communities.  Carbon species, nutrients and gases  The fluctuation of brine salinity, which is controlled by atmospheric temperatures, is the single-most influential factor on the chemistry of the sea ice matrix. The solubility of carbon dioxide and oxygen, two biologically essential gases, decreases in higher salinity solutions. This can result in hypoxia within high heterotrophic activity regions of the sea ice matrix. Regions of high photosynthetic activity often exhibit internal depletion of inorganic carbon compound and hyperoxia. These conditions have the potential to elevate brine pH and to further contribute to the creation of an extreme environment. In these conditions, high concentrations of DOM and ammonia and low concentrations of nutrients often characterize the ice matrix. High brine salinity combined with an elevated pH reduces the rate at which gases and inorganic nutrients diffuse into the ice matrix. The concentration of nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and silicate inside the sea ice matrix relies largely on the diffusive influx from the sea ice-water interface and to some extent on the atmospheric deposits on the sea ice-air interface. Iron concentrations in the Southern Ocean ice cover are thought to be regulated by the amount of new iron supply at the time of ice formation and were shown to be reduced during late winter. The chemical properties of the sea ice matrix are highly complex and depend on the interaction between the internal sea ice biological assemblage as well as external physical factors. Winters are typically characterized by moderate oxygen levels that are accompanied by nutrient and inorganic carbon concentrations that are not growth limiting to phytoplankton. Summers are typically characterized by high oxygen levels that are accompanied by a depletion of nutrients and inorganic carbon. Because of its diffusive interaction with seawater, the lower part of the sea ice matrix is typically characterized by higher nutrient concentrations.  Colonization  Microorganisms present in the surface seawater during fall are integrated in the brine solution during ice formation. A small proportion of the initial microbial population colonizes the ice matrix while the rest is expelled with brine. Studies have shown that sea ice microbial retention can be enhanced by the presence of extracellular polymeric substance/polysaccharides (EPS) on the walls of the brine channels. EPS are proteins expressed on the cell walls of microorganism such as algae. They improve the cell adherence to surfaces and when found in sufficient concentration, are thought to play a role in recruiting other organisms such as microbes. Airborne microorganisms make up a significant proportion of the microbial input to the ice matrix. Microorganisms located in the sea or in the ice matrix brine can be incorporated in falling snow or in aerosols, and subsequently transported by strong winds such as the West Wind Drift that causes the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. These airborne microorganisms can originate from terrestrial environment and marine environment, thus contributing to the diversity of the SIMCO.  Distribution  Polar sea ice matrix covered in algae community showing a typical environment for sea ice microbial communities. = Spatial Distribution = Microbes colonizing the Antarctic sea ice are eventually incorporated in the pore spaces and brine channels of the ice matrix, but can also inhabit the ice-seawater interface. Pore spaces in the matrix lose their ability to exchange nutrients, DOM and microorganisms with brine at approximately -5 ¬∞C. This suggests that the Antarctic microbial community is fluid along the ice matrix during fall and spring and that it is restricted during winter. In the Arctic, brine channels are also inhabited by bacteria. Channels as small as ‚â§200 Œºm offer a spatial refuge with microbial community concentrations of 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than in the remaining channel network. Both the Antarctic and Arctic sea ice environments present strong vertical gradients of salinity, temperature, light, nutrients and DOM. These gradients were shown to induce strong vertical stratification in bacterial communities throughout the ice layer. Microbial abundance declines significantly with depth in the upper and middle ice, but not in the lowest, suggesting that much of the prokaryotic bacterial community is resistant to extreme environmental conditions. Heterotrophic bacteria were also shown to be more abundant at the bottom of the ice layer in zones of greater algae concentration, which characterized by higher DOM and nutrient concentrations. = Temporal Distribution = The temporal distribution of microbial community composition in the Antarctic and Arctic sea ice does not present significant seasonal variability, despite extremes in environmental conditions. Previous studies of sea ice habitats have shown that the composition of SIMCO in early fall is identical to the source seawater community. The microbial community composition does not seem to change significantly in fall and winter, despite the extreme variability in irradiance, temperature, salinity and nutrient concentrations. In contrast, the abundance within the SIMCO is reduced throughout the winter as resources become limiting. Studies have shown that sea ice microalgae provide a platform and organic nutrient source for bacterial growth, therefore increasing community diversity and abundance. It has also been proven that microbes produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to help retain nutrients and survive under high salinity and low temperature conditions. The increase in irradiance levels in late spring promotes ice algal photosynthesis which in turn affects the microbial community abundance and composition. While most of the sea ice cover melts in late spring in the Antarctic and Arctic, multiyear sea ice occasionally persists when late spring and summer temperatures are lower than average. This suggests that certain microbial lineages may have adapted more efficiently to the extreme conditions of sea ice environments. Temporal abundance can also be affected by the thickness of the annual ice cover and seasonal temperature variations. The ice cover thickness was shown to regulate microbial production and the temperature of the ice matrix through layer insulation.  Community composition  A majority of the information on sea ice microbial community composition comes from 16S ribosomal RNA taxonomic marker genes and metagenomic analyses. Next-generation sequencing has allowed researcher to identify and quantify microbial communities, and to gain a more complete understanding of its structure. = Bacteria =  Arctic  Metagenomic studies of Arctic sea ice show classes Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria. Within the Flavobacteriia class the genera Polaribacter, Psychrobacter, Psychroflexus, and Flavobacterium are the most common. Within Gammaproteobacteria the genera Glaciecola and Colwellia are the most common. Also found in Arctic sea ice samples were bacteria of the following classes and phyla: Opitutae, Bacilli, Cyanobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Sphingobacteria, and Aquificae.  Antarctic  Metagenomic studies of the Ross Sea illustrate the high abundance of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria in sea ice environments. These specialists were shown to mostly belong to the Alphaproteobacteria class. Genera of the Alphaproteobacteria class were shown to include Loktanella, Octadecabacter, Roseobacter, Sulfitobacter and Methylobacterium and to agree with previous phylogenetic analyses of sea ice around the Antarctic. A study of the SIMCO 16S ribosomal RNA at Cape Hallett in the Antarctic has shown that aerobic oxygenic phototrophic bacteria may be equally abundant. Members of the Gammaproteobacteria and Flaviobacteria classes were also shown to be abundant within the ice matrix, and thus to be adapted to the sea ice conditions. Genera of the Gammaproteobacteria class found in the Ross Sea and around the Antarctic waters include Colwellia, Marionomonas, Pseudoalteromonas and Psychrobacter. The orders Chlamydiales and Verrucomicrobiales were also found in the sea ice microbial assemblage of these locations. The predominance of Gammaproteobacteria in sea ice around the globe have been reported by many studies. A large proportion of the identified SIMCO in these studies were shown to belong to phylotypes associated with heterotrophic taxa While this gives researchers an insight into the microbial community composition of the Antarctic sea ice, there are clear shifts between locations in the Southern Ocean. These shifts are attributed to biological and physical forcing factors. These factors include the composition of the microbial communities in place at the moment of sea ice formation, and the regional weather and wind patterns affecting the transport of snow and aerosols. = Archaea = Studies of the 16s ribosomal RNA subunits found in the sea ice cover of Terra Nova Bay have shown that archaea consist of ‚â§ 6.6% of the total prokaryotic community in this environment. 90.8% of this archaeal community belonged to the phylum Thaumarchaeota, a close parent to marine ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, while Euryarchaeota made up the rest of the community. Other molecular phylogenetic analyses of the SIMCO have detected no trace of the archaeal domain. = Protists = Metagenomic studies of Arctic sea ice using 454 sequencing of 18S rDNA and 18S rRNA. These studies showed dominance of three supergroups: Alveolata, Stramenophile, and Rhizaria. Within the Alveolates most common were Ciliates, and Dinoflagellates. Within the Stramenophile group most organisms were classified as Bacillariophyceae. Finally most of the Rhizarians were classified as from Thecofilosea.  Adaptation  Studies have shown that high concentrations of microbial cryoprotective exopolymer (EPS) were found in the sea ice brine. These EPS were shown to correlate with a stable microbial community composition throughout the winter season. They are thought to play an important role in sea ice environments where they act as a buffer and cryoprotectant against high salinity and ice-crystal damage. These exopolymers are believed to constitute a microbial adaptation to low temperatures in extreme environments. Sea ice microbes have also developed anti-freeze proteins, which prevent the formation of ice crystals that could damage bacterial membranes. It is common for these proteins to be rich in beta-sheets as they prevent the formation of ice crystals/  Metabolic diversity  The microbial loop is a marine trophic pathway in which microbes re-incorporate dissolved organic carbon into the food chain and remineralize nutrients. = Role in the Microbial Loop = Bacteria in all environments contribute to the microbial loop, but the roles of sea ice microbial communities in the microbial loop differ due to the rapidly changing environmental conditions found in the Arctic and Antarctic. Sea ice algae contribute 10%‚Äì28% of the total primary production in ice-covered regions of the Antarctic. Microalgae provide a vital source of nutrition for juvenile zooplankton such as the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in the winter. DOM derived from phototrophic microalgae is crucial to the microbial loop, by serving as a growth substrate for heterotrophic bacteria. The microbial loop functions differently in sea ice, as compared to oligotrophic or temperate waters. Animals found in the extreme polar environments depend on the high bacterial production as a food source, despite the slow turnover of DOM. The microbial production of ammonium in nitrate-rich Antarctic waters may provide the necessary reductants for nitrogen fixation, increasing primary productivity of light-limited phytoplankton. Phytoflagellates and diatoms found in the Antarctic pelagic environment are directly digestible by metozoan herbivores.

In 1867, William Rose, a railroad contractor, and William Cody founded the townsite to take advantage of the recent relocation of Fort Hays adjacent to the planned crossing of Big Creek by the Kansas Pacific Railway. It soon became a recreation center for 1200 railroad construction workers. However, the railway's selection of Hays City for the station combined with the cholera outbreak in Rome the same summer resulted in the wholesale abandonment of the town in favor of Hays City. In 1868, the Clarkson Brothers, Charlie, Matthew, and George, set their buffalo hunting headquarters at the abandoned Rome site. By 1872, they had completed the requirements for their homestead claim on the land Rome had occupied. Although the town had quickly failed, Cody maintained an interest in the location. At the 1876 Centennial Exposition, Cody convinced I. M. Yost (the husband of a cousin) to build a water-powered grain mill at Rome. With assistance from soldiers from Fort Hays, Yost built a wooden dam there on Big Creek to power the mill and provide ice to the fort. While the dam was soon destroyed by animals and flooding and the mill by fire, Yost was committed to the locality and built more mills in and around Hays, and later founded nearby Yocemento. A map of Rome was reconstructed in the 1930s as a WPA project. This map was compiled by H. R. Pollock from newspaper articles, interviews, and correspondence with people with historical connection with the town, including I. M. Yost, the miller, C. L. Henderson, who had a farm adjoining Rome, and Simon Motz, an early settler in Rome. The historic townsite north of Noose Road is presently a private gated facility, managed by Rome Corporation. = Hangman's Bridge = In late-1867, the Kansas Pacific Railway completed a wooden through-truss bridge across Big Creek. Vigilantes active in early treeless Hays City used the bridge for hangings, and so it is known locally as Hangman's Bridge. Although the bridge was a full mile west from the early Hays City, it adjoined Rome; the Clarkson brothers noted seeing a body hanging on the bridge (probably Jack McGee who had stabbed a police constable, Frank Sheperd). The bridge site is particularly associated with the 1869 lynching of three black soldiers of the 38th United States Colored Infantry Regiment.  Transportation  The Kansas Pacific track defined the southern edge of the Rome townsite. Here, the railroad was constructed at a significantly elevated grade justified by the potential for flooding on Big Creek. However, town residents suspected that the excessively elevated tracks were built intentionally to interfere with commerce of the town. The combination of the high track with the deeply cut ravine of Big Creek surrounding the remaining boundaries of Rome resulted in the derisive nickname \\"The Walled City\\". Today, the track is operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. In 1867, the Ellis Trail passed along the north side of the town, crossing Big Creek at the east and west ends. The Butterfield Overland Despatch briefly operated a station in Rome, before relocating to Hays City. Present day Noose Road passes through the townsite east and west, crossing Big Creek just north of Hangman's Bridge. This was the original U.S. Route 40 alignment (locally \\"Highway 40\\"). The United States Highway system vacated this alignment in 1947 when the highway and railroad tracks were realigned at Yocemento, moving the highway to the south of the tracks between Yocemento and Hays. This newer alignment lost the U.S. Route 40 designation when Interstate 70 was completed and the road was renamed Old Hwy 40. Rome Road makes a short connection across the track between Noose Road and Old Hwy 40.

It is widespread in the tundras and highlands of the Holarctic. It has large, furry caterpillars which seem to eat mostly saxifrages. Taxonomy This moth was first described in 1835 by John Curtis as Laria rossii, who placed it in the genus Laria described by Franz von Paula Schrank in 1802; the genus Laria, however, had already been used in 1763 for a genus of beetles by Scolipi (now Pria), so the species required moving to another genus. Heinrich Benno M√∂schler first moved it to the genus Dasychira in his 1870 work on the moths of Labrador. Otto Staudinger also classified it in the genus Dasychira in 1901, but in 1927 William Schaus moved it to the genus Byrdia. Also in 1927 Otto Bang-Haas described the subspecies Dasychira rossii relictus from the eastern Sayan Mountains. A year later, in 1928, Sh≈çnen Matsumura described Konokareha daisetsuzana from a single specimen from the Daisetsu mountains in Hokkaido, but in 1932 Max Gaede synonymised Konokareha daisetsuzana to Dasychira rossii relictus. In 1956 Hiroshi Inoue subsumed Konokareha daisetsuzana as an independent subspecies under Byrdia rossii instead, and moved the relictus subspecies to the Byrdia genus as well, giving three subspecies including the nominate. Inoue states, however, that although he finds the type of Konokareha daisetsuzana distinctive enough, his own just collected specimen, in his time only the second moth of this species ever found in Japan, was almost identical to the nominate form, and that he found the validity of the taxon potentially untenable. Gynaephora lugens was described by Igor Vasilii Kozhanchikov in 1948 from northern Siberia in eastern Russia. Dubatolov published an article in 1997 in which he mentioned doubting the taxonomic distinctiveness of G. lugens from G. rossii, based on the identical wing pattern and the morphology of the genitalia. In 2015 Lukhtanov and Khruleva subsumed it under G. rossii as a subspecies based on DNA and morphological research. It has been placed in the subfamily Lymantriinae (the tussock moths) and the tribe Orgyiini. =Etymology= According to one website the generic epithet Gynaephora means 'women-seeker', which refers to the behaviour of the males. However, the word gynaephora in fact means 'women-bringer' or 'bringer-of-woman'; it is compounded from the Greek Œ≥œÖŒΩŒÆ (gun√≠), meaning \\"woman\\", and œÜŒøœÅŒ¨ (phor√°), usually meaning \\"bringer\\" (along with some other related meanings). The specific epithet commemorates John Ross who lead the Arctic expedition for which John Curtis served as an entomologist. =Subspecies= There are two subspecies recorded as accepted in The Global Lepidoptera Names Index (LepIndex) belonging to the species Gynaephora rossii as of 2011: * Gynaephora rossii rossii: From North America. * Gynaephora rossii relictus (O.Bang-Haas, 1927): From Asia. It is sometimes recognised as an independent species. These subspecies are not necessarily recognised: * Gynaephora rossii daisetsuzana (Matsumura, 1928): A subjective subspecies according to the LepIndex. Native to Hokkaido. * Gynaephora rossii lugens (Kozhanchikov, 1948) Lukhtanov & Khruleva, 2015: As of 2019, this subspecies is too new to have been added to the LepIndex database. From throughout northern Russia east of the Urals to the Bering Sea. Description The females have a forewing length of 17 mm, the males slightly smaller. The hindwings of the males are a light ochre yellow, with a dark gray band along the edge of the wing, and a light amount of hairs extending from that edge (fringe). The hindwings of the females are dark brownish grey and also have a band. Both sexes have mottled grey forewings with jagged black lines across them. There is further a small black disc-shaped dot surrounded by paler grey, and a black and pale grey mark near the end similar to the mark in other Orgyiini. The antenna has teeth- or comb- like structures on both sides, these are larger in males. The eggs are around 1.4 mm. The caterpillars are densely covered in soft grey hairs and have seven pairs of tufts of yellow hair on their back, while most other Lymantriinae have five pairs of tufts. The cocoon is made of silk, incorporating the hairs of the caterpillars on the outside, and is about the size of the cocoon of a common silkworm, oval-shaped and coloured grey. =Similar species= It is most likely to be confused in British Columbia with Polia richardsoni, which has wings of a similar colour and is in flight at the same month as this moth. That species has a different wing pattern, hair on its eyes and a much thinner antenna. They can be distinguished from their congener Gynaephora groenlandica in the larvae by the form of their hairs, which are finer and feather-like (plumose) in contrast to stiffer and un-branched (spinulose) hairs. G. rossii imagos (adults) have more patterned wings than G. groenlandica and G. groenlandica lack the broad, dark band along the edge of their hind wings characteristic of G. rossii. The two species are sympatric in Arctic areas in northern Canada and the Canadian archipelago, and on Wrangel Island in Russia. The eggs are somewhat smaller and the cocoons of this species are single- layered, as opposed to the double-layered cocoons of G. groenlandica. Distribution =Gynaephora rossii rossii= The nominate subspecies occurs in the United States and Canada, In the United States it occurs in Alaska, and isolated populations occur on mountaintops in the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians. Alpine populations occur in Maine (at the top of Mount Katahdin), in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, Wyoming and Colorado. There is also a specimen from Michigan. In Canada it is known from Labrador, Yukon (far northern coast and the Richardson Mountains), Northwest Territories (North Slave Region, Fort Smith, Ulukhaktok), Mackenzie County in far northern Alberta, northern Manitoba (outside the town of Churchill), British Columbia (Pink Mountain and the north) and Nunavut (Somerset Island, Bylot Island, north to coasts on central Ellesmere Island). It has been recorded from northernmost Alaska in Point Barrow, along the Meade River and elsewhere in Alaska North Slope, and southwards in Lake and Peninsula, the Darby Mountains, the city of Fairbanks, and alpine areas in Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. In Colorado it has been recorded in Clear Creek County, Teller County (Florissant) and Rocky Mountain National Park. In New Hampshire it has been found in Co√∂s County in the village of Jefferson and on Mount Washington. =Gynaephora rossii relictus= This taxon was originally described from the eastern Sayan Mountains, while the taxon daisetsuzana, now considered a synonym, was only known from the mountains of Hokkaido in Japan. It has also been recorded from the mountains of Buryatia and at low elevations in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. G. rossii lugens, sometimes considered a synonym of the previous subspecies, occurs in Russia from the Siberian Arctic from the northern Urals and the Yamal Peninsula eastwards to the Chukchi Peninsula, north to the Arctic Ocean and on Wrangel Island. Southwards it is only found in mountainous areas such as in the Suntar-Khayata Range (eastern Yakutia), the mountains of southern Yakutia and southwest Irkutsk Oblast, the Yablonoi Mountains of Chita Oblast, and mountains in the northern regions of Amur Oblast, in Kamchatka and in northern Magadan Oblast along the upper reaches of the Kolyma River. Ecology =Habitat= This day-flying moth is found in tundras in Arctic and Subarctic areas. It also occurs in rocky alpine tundra habitats on top of high mountains, and has been caught flying in muskeg habitat with trees growing in it in Canada. It is able to survive in extreme environments such as at 2200m above sea level in the Suntar-Khayata Range or at 2400m in Buryatia. It has been recorded at altitudes of 1561m in Co√∂s County, New Hampshire, at 800m in the Richardson Mountains, Yukon, Canada, and at 300m in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia. =Behaviour= Saxifraga oppositifolia is a primary host plant of the caterpillars in Nunavut. The females have fully developed wings and can fly, although they usually do not, but are said to \\"call out\\" to the males. This allows the female to save energy. The males are slightly smaller than the females. Males fly rapidly searching for the females during daylight, and are difficult to catch unless waiting near a \\"calling\\" female. They are usually on the wing in July in northern British Columbia, although this can depend on the weather and if the snow has melted. On Somerset Island in Nunavut the moths and their caterpillars would appear in large numbers for one or two days in June. In North America as a whole adults have been collected from May to August. In the mountains of Hokkaido females of this species do fly; in this area they lay eggs on upright, woody plant stems. On Ellesmere Island the females typically lay their eggs in a mass on or in their cocoon, although they sometimes lay their eggs on the ground or on vegetation around the cocoon. Females can produce fertile eggs without mating (parthenogenesis). Vladimir Dubatolov was able to rear a female from eastern Yakutia, and subsequently from northwestern Chukotka, without a male present from its emergence from its cocoon, and both times the moths laid eggs which hatched into viable caterpillars. Despite the large distance between these two localities, on Ellesmere Island in Canada Morewood did not observe the same. The caterpillars may take many years to metamorphose, seven to eleven years. In the Suntar-Khayata Range a cocoon was recovered on the end of a branch of a shrub of Pinus pumila. In northwestern Chukotka Autonomous Okrug the caterpillars begin making their cocoons in August. The caterpillars can be exposed to subzero temperatures, in which they freeze solid, but when brought back indoors, many start moving around again as soon as they thaw. John Ross, when after being trapped in the ice of northern Canada for a number of years during his expedition seeking the Northwest Passage, kept and fed a number in the ship hold. These were repeatedly frozen and thawed through the winter; after four such cycles two survived to pupate, and of those one cocoon was full of flies whilst the other developed into a fully formed adult moth. =Species interactions= The caterpillars feed on Saxifraga tricuspidata, S. oppositifolia, Salix arctica, Dryas and possibly also Potentilla. It has also been found on Rubus acaulis, and caterpillars have been raised in laboratory settings on raspberry, Rubus idaeus, leaves. In Russia the caterpillars were successfully raised no a diet of Rosa, Rubus and Taraxacum in the laboratory. On Somerset Island their main food plants were recorded to be Saxifraga tricuspidata and S. oppositifolia. Ross observed many of the caterpillars parasitised by a species of ichneumonid wasp and a type of fly in the Canadian archipelago. Up to six flies can inhabit one caterpillar. The flies emerge from the cocoons or hibernaculae in the spring. These animals are parasitoids. The flies Ross saw were likely the tachinid fly Chetogena gelida, which appears to be host specific to Gynaephora rossii. On Ellesmere Island, where this moth was found to be sympatric with the closely related G. groenlandica, Chetogena gelida only attacked G. rossii, whereas the new species Exorista thula was only hosted by G. groenlandica. Despite living in areas free of bats, they still show avoidance responses to their sounds. In the High Arctic these moths are preyed upon by birds. The eggs are also eaten by small foraging birds; on Ellesmere Island such birds may tear open the cocoons to feed on the egg mass usually laid inside. Uses This species is numbered as 8290 in the List of moths of North America (the MONA or Hodges number). Conservation In 1832 is was recorded as common on the beach of Fury Bay of Somerset Island, Nunavut, with about a hundred specimens of caterpillars and moths collected on 16 June. In Hokkaido it would appear rarer, with only two specimens collected between the 1920s to the 1950s.

History The history of the institution dates back to 1935, when a military department was created on the basis of the department of the orchestra faculty of the Moscow State Conservatory.https://spasstower.ru/participants/orkestr-kursantov-voennogo- instituta-voennykh-dirizherov/–û—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏–µ –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–¥–∏—Ä–∏–∂–µ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ñ–∞–∫—É–ª—å—Ç–µ—Ç–∞. In 1938, the faculty was expanded, organizing full-time post-graduate studies in the specialties of conducting and instrumentation. In 1944, the military department became a separate military musical university and in August 1945, the university was solemnly awarded Battle Banner. In November 1946, the university was renamed to the Higher School of Military Conductors of the Soviet Army. In 1960, during a campaign to reduce the size of the Soviet Armed Forces, the Institute of Military Conductors was reorganized into the Military Conducting Department at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory On 4 April 2001, the Government of Russia renamed the department as the Moscow Military Conservatory.

History Isaacs was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, the eldest son of itinerant jeweller Solomon Isaacs (c. 1830 ‚Äì 30 August 1917) and his wife Pauline (c. 1830 ‚Äì 14 July 1923), and came to South Australia with his parents and their family around 1865 and settled at 4 Tavistock Street, Adelaide. He was educated at the Pulteney Street School and at Adelaide Educational Institution. His father opened a jeweller's and watchmaker's shop in Rundle Street, where by 1875 Isaacs was being employed. By 1884 his father had a tobacconist's shop on Rundle Street east between Pulteney Street and Synagogue Place. He also ran a tailor's establishment. Isaacs was a serious young man, and showed great interest in religion and literature. He became a leading lay member of Adelaide synagogue's congregation: *committee member Jewish Benefit Society *foundation member of the Adelaide Literary Society *member of the first Union Parliament *for seven years he was president of the Adelaide Hebrew Congregation *founded the Adelaide Jewish Literary Society in 1891 *for four years honorary secretary of the Hebrew Sabbath School Fire at Stump's premises above Isaacs' shop, NW corner Hindley and King William streets, Adelaide He travelled extensively throughout South Australia, particularly the north as far as Oodnadatta, where he founded a literary society. Isaacs ran the well- known tobacconist's business at \\"Isaacs' Corner\\" on the north corner of King William and Hindley streets 1891‚Äì1904, and was charter president of the South Australian Retail Tobacconists' Association 1894‚Äì1897. This was at a time when the retail tobacco shops were being used by many as a front for illegal \\"tote\\" bookmakers. Citing health reasons, Isaacs left for Melbourne in May 1904, where his reputation had preceded him and was soon just as immersed in the Jewish community there as he had been in Adelaide. He took over John Lipshut's tobacconist's shop on the corner of Swanston and Little Collins streets. His son Eric took \\"The White Florist\\" shop next door. He became president of the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation, serving for three years, and was also president of the Melbourne Jewish Philanthropic Society, United Jewish Educational Board, and the Melbourne Tobacconists' Association.

The episode was written by Jim Krieg & Jeremy Adams and directed in live-action by Robert Singer and in animation by Spike Brandt. It was first broadcast on March 29, 2018, on The CW. In the episode, Sam, Dean, and Castiel are sucked into the animated world of Scooby-Doo and must help the Scooby Gang solve a mystery when a real ghost crashes the events of the Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! episode \\"A Night of Fright Is No Delight\\". The four current voice actors who appear in current Scooby-Doo media reprise their roles for the episode: Frank Welker as Scooby-Doo and Fred Jones, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy Rogers, Grey Griffin as Daphne Blake, and Kate Micucci as Velma Dinkley. The episode received critical acclaim for its humor, meta references, sense of nostalgia, and the natural fit between the two series. Plot After stopping a plush dinosaur that comes to life in a pawn shop and attacks, the grateful owner gives Dean a new TV for free. While testing out the TV, the Winchesters are sucked into Dean's favorite episode (\\"A Night of Fright Is No Delight\\") of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, followed soon after by Castiel. To the group's shock, they discover an actual ghost that begins killing people and the Winchesters and the Scooby Gang are forced to team up together to stop it. Working together, the Winchesters and the Scooby Gang trap the ghost, who reveals himself to be a young boy who is being used by a greedy real estate developer in the real world to scare away reluctant shop owners. The ghost helps the Winchesters and Castiel fool the Scooby Gang into thinking that it was a human villain before returning the Winchesters and Castiel to the real world. There, the three put the ghost to rest and get the criminal arrested for tax evasion. Before getting sucked into Scooby-Doo, Castiel is shown to have gotten the fruit from the Tree of Life, bringing the Winchesters one step closer to their goal of opening a portal to Apocalypse World. Production The idea of a crossover episode with Scooby-Doo had been discussed by the writers and producers of Supernatural for several years. The ability to do a crossover was made possible because the rights to both shows are owned by Warner Bros. Reception The episode received critical acclaim. In her review for Den of Geek!, Bridget LaMonica gave the episode a score of 5/5, calling it a \\"milestone\\" and \\"a shameless dose of humor and nostalgia that found a way to blend two tonally different series.\\" Samantha Highfill of EW echoed the sentiment and gave the episode an \\"A\\" grade, adding that \\"No other show could do this and do it so well.\\" Kaitlin Thomas of TVGuide compared the episode favorably to past meta-installments \\"Changing Channels\\" and \\"The French Mistake\\" and said that it \\"is destined to become an instant classic.\\" References External links * Category:Supernatural (season 13) episodes Category:2018 American television episodes Category:Scooby-Doo mass media Category:Crossover television Category:Crossover animation Category:Metafictional television episodes Category:Television episodes with live action and animation ","title":"Scoobynatural"},{"id":"56980988","text":"The Zbrojovka Z 9 was a car produced by ƒåeskoslovensk√° Zbrojovka in the 1930s.

It has been proposed that the galaxy contains little or no dark matter, the first such discovery. On 20 March 2019, a follow-up study announcing the discovery of a second UDG lacking dark matter, DF4, was published. Distance The distance to the galaxy from Earth, derived by surface brightness fluctuation, is 19¬±1.7 Mpc. Due to close proximity, it is assumed to be associated with the elliptical galaxy NGC 1052 and to lie at a distance of about from NGC 1052.. On 3 June 2019, however, a separate team used a full observing dataset on the same object to review this claim, and found out that the actual distance of the galaxy was different, and that it may contain dark matter after all. A more recent study on NGC 1052-DF2 suggests the previously reported distance of the galaxy was greatly exaggerated. Consequently, the galaxy now looks \\"normal\\" in every way. Using five independent methods to estimate distances of heavenly bodies, a team of researchers from the Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias (IAC) found the correct distance of NGC 1052-DF2 to be 42 million light years (13 MPc), not some 64 million light years (19 MPc) from the Earth. The total mass of the galaxy is around one-half of the mass estimated previously, but the mass of its stars is only about one-quarter of the previously estimated mass. This implies a significant part of NGC 1052-DF2 could be made up of dark matter, like any other galaxies. Dark matter The apparent lack of dark matter in NGC 1052-DF2 may help prove that dark matter is real: If what appears to be dark matter is really just a currently unknown effect of the gravity of ordinary matter then this apparent dark matter should also appear in this galaxy. Further study will be needed before this and any other possible implications can be confirmed. If confirmed, the absence of dark matter may also have implications for theories of galaxy formation, as dark matter has been thought to be needed for galaxy formation. A later study purports to show that the galaxy may contain more dark matter than initially reported. It may have a mass-to-light ratio towards the low end of expected values for a dwarf galaxy. However, a follow-up study on 20 March 2018 and a new discovery of a second ultra diffuse galaxy, NGC 1052-DF4, also apparently lacking dark matter, challenges the prior study's conclusion. Other similar galaxies Astronomers discovered a second Galaxy with no dark matter, NGC 1052-DF4, which is another ultra diffuse galaxy - quite large, spread-out, and faint to observe. Discovering another galaxy with very little to no dark matter means the chances of finding more of these galaxies are now higher than cosmologists previously thought.

Tirupati. A.P. Vol.XXII. pp 15-21 Early life and education Ramaraya Kavi's earlier name was Rama Rao. He was born to Bellamkonda Mohan Rao and Hanumamba on 27 December 1875, in Pamidipadu in Andhra Pradesh. Though they were 6000 Niyogi Brahmins, they paradoxically embraced the Vaishnava cult headed by Sri Ramanuja Acharya.. As such, Rama Rao's family was also deeply religious and devoted to Lord Vishnu and pursuing Vishishtadvaita.Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavindrda Jeevitam. Lanka Sundararama Sastri. 1952. Andhra Grandhalaya Mudra Sala. Vijayawada. Rama Rao lost his father at the age of 7 years. He had homeschooling and could not pursue higher education due to poor health. Sankaramanchi Lakshminarayana Sastri and Sankaramanchi Seetaramaiah taught him the Upanishads, Namaka Chamakam or Sri Rudra Chamakam, Vedas, etc. Rama Rao later continued his studies in Mahabhashyam, Vyakaranam (Grammar), and Tarkam (logic) under Purighatla Rama Sastri, Bhagavatula Hari Sastri and Purighatla Subrahmanya Sastri. He learnt Manorama, Sabdendu Sekharamu, Patanjali Bhashyam, etc. under Purighatla Rama Sastri. Initially, Rama Rao learnt up to Siddhanta Kaumudi to Sandhi Panchakam under Purighatla Rama Sastri. Based on this simple instruction, he ventured into writing a simplified commentary on Siddhanta Kaumudi entitled as Saradratri, and Kuvalayanandamu.Vigyana Sarswamu. 1959. Telugu Samskriti.Vol. 3. p.no.1027. Telugu Bhasha Samiti, Hyderabad. His biographer and first disciple Lanka Sundararama Sastri had written that Rama Rao was initiated into spirituality at the age of 14.Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavindrda Jeevitam. Lanka Sundararama Sastri.1952. Andhra Grandhalaya Mudra Sala. Vijayawada. As a consequence of his initiation into spiritual realm, Rama Rao has changed his name from 'Rao' to 'Raya'. Subsequently, in praise of the Lord Hayagreeva, he has written Srimad Hayavadana Satakam, Hayagreeva Ashtottara Satanamavali, Sri Hayagreeva Sahasranamavali, Hayagreeva Navaratnastuti which are said to be rare and very difficult compositions in Sanskrit. Perhaps that is the reason, scholars argued, why Ramaraya Kavi himself had given commentaries to these poetic works.Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavindrda Jeevitam. Lanka Sundararama Sastri.1952.

Refuting Visishtadvaita Ramaraya Kavi's contribution to Advaita Siddhanta, refuting Visishtadvaita, is said to be central to the Indian vaidic literature and spirituality. Though Ramaraya Kavi's family embraced the Vaishnava cult , his critical studies of Sri Bhashyam of Ramanuja and the commentary of Adi Shankara on the Bhagavad Gita had lent him deep insights into the gaping holes in the dialectics of Vishistadviata. Ever since he turned into a complete Smartaby adopting Advaita of Adi Shankara. He did not stop there. In his commentaries on Advaita, especially in his work Sankaraasankara Bhasya Vimarsaha, he has proved wrong ten most important interpretations of Ramanuja's Sri Bhashyam. Similar efforts of blasting Visishtadvaita continued in his later works such as Siddhanta Sindhuhu. and Vendanta Sangrahaha.The Rukminiparinaya of Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavi. K.S.R.Datta. S.V.University Oriental Journal. 1980. S.V.University Press. Tirupati. A.P. Vol.XXII. pp 15-21 Uniqueness of Ramaraya Kavi's Literature According to Professor R.Balasubramanian and Revathy, Ramaraya Kavi's Vedanta-Sangraha is one of the fundamental and important texts on Advaita philosophy. It describes the basic theories and concepts of Vedanta. The interpretation and explanation of the text give us an insight into concepts like -Tat-tvam-Asi- of Advaita. It is also significant to note that Ramaraya Kavi has explained in detail the different technical terminologies of Vedanta used by the philosophers of that period, while establishing his own doctrines.Vedanta Sangrahaha of Ramaraya Kavi. Essentials of Vedanta. 2012. R.Balasubramanian and S.Revathy. Chinmaya International Foundation Shodhana Sansthan, Adi Sankara Nilayam, Veliyanad, Ernakulam, Kerala. They further added that Ramaraya Kavi belongs to the group of illustrious commentators on the basic texts and commentaries on Advaita Vedanta. Professor K.S.R.Datta has written in his article Ramaraya Kavi: A Modern Literary Giant published in Bhavan‚Äôs Journal in 1977 : > He was not only an original writer but also a commentator par excellence. > His writings are marked by easy style, clarity of expression and vigour. His > contributions to Advaita in particular and Sanskrit in general is > immeasurable but this is not recognized by the scholars due to non- > availability of his works, many of which were unfortunately lost or > unpublished. Mellacheruvu Subrahmanya Saastri who rendered a number of Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavi's works into Telugu has opined in his introduction to these books that Ramaraya Kavi is a poet whose depth of knowledge appears to be equal to a repository of millions of books. His ability to quickly grasp any given literary nuance of a spiritual text by offering new evidences and interpretations to the earlier texts is beyond anybody's imagination. Subrahmanya Saastri has not only extensively studied the works of Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavi but also has written commentaries on Paramatma Sahasranamavali, Dasasloki, SankarasankaraBhasya Vimarsanam, Advaita Vijayamu, of Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavi.Siddhanta Sindhuhu by Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavi. 2010.

After log construction and timber framing, bundwerk is one of the most widespread forms of timber building techniques. It involved using wooden beams that were arranged partly in a lattice or diagonally over a cross. It often decorated the front and gable sides of agricultural buildings, frequently the grain barn or Stadel of quadrangular farms (Vierseith√∂fen). In northeastern Upper Bavaria bundwerk is especially varied and colourful. By contrast, in the Werdenfelser Land and the region around Innsbruck only a few places exhibit this type of timber building throughout. Bundwerk had its heyday between 1830 and 1860 when artists and woodcarvers, as well as carpenters, decorated the bundwerk with paintings and carvings, often with mythical creatures or Christian symbols.

History The abbey was founded by Queen Brunhilda and the bishop of Autun, Saint Syagrius, in or around 589. Brunhilda was later buried there.BNF: Abbaye Saint-Martin, Autun, Sa√¥ne-et-Loire The new foundation was richly decorated and furnished, largely with marbles, mosaics and other items which Brunhilde took from neighbouring Gallo-Roman buildings. The abbey was however largely destroyed in 731 by invading Saracens. It was not rebuilt until 870, and then destroyed again in 880, doubtless by the Normans. It was rebuilt again in 885 by Charles the Fat. From 1058 it answered directly to the pope rather than to a bishop. At the latest from the time of this rebuilding, the abbey was also fortified. In 1570, it was pillaged by the troops of Admiral de Coligny, the fortifications having fallen into disrepair. In 1589 the √âtats de Bourgogne refused financial help to Nicolas Brulard, the then commendatory abbot, for the repair of the fortifications. The abbey was deserted soon afterwards and occupied by bandits: once they were expelled the fortifications were dismantled and the abbey left empty. The vacant and dilapidated premises were taken over by the reformist Congregation of St Maur in 1635 (or 1654), who repaired them, but not the fortifications. The abbey was entirely rebuilt between 1740 and 1752. It was suppressed in the French Revolution and sold off as national property in 1793, to be used as an armaments factory. A few years later it was almost entirely demolished apart from a few service buildings. The city authorities of Autun eventually acquired what remained and undertook restoration in 1976‚Äì77.

Recent history  Since 2005, the city hall has shut down bars and hotels associated with drug distribution and prostitution, displaced homeless people, and increased police presence with the intent to inhibit drug use in Cracol√¢ndia. Hundreds of building were designated as public utility in a 1.1 million square feet area, and were expropriated. The objective of the project was to increase the attractiveness of the region to private businesses. In 2007, the S√£o Paulo city hall launched a program named Nova Luz (New Light in Portuguese, referring to the broader region around Luz Station) in order to promote the execution of the planned changes to the region. Among the proposed measures were tax breaks, especially on real estate taxes, to stimulate the renewal of the facades of buildings, which are generally poorly maintained. Critics of this program, however, claimed it to have a basis on social hygiene movements, highlighting that the renovations in buildings, parks, and streets were not accompanied by assistance towards the vulnerable groups who inhabit or work in the region, who are being effectively removed. The homeless are displaced, trash collectors have their job put in jeopardy, and crack users and dependents are left without a place to gather, being left to wander adjacent and otherwise nearby neighborhoods.

Chap:V; pp.73-86. who is considered patron saint of the right bank\\"Histoire\\", saintmerri.org (in French)] of the river Seine in central Paris. Early life Born into an illustrious family in the Morvan near Autun, he was offered at the age of 13 as an oblate at the Abbey of St. Martin, Autun. He receives an education of prayer, obedience and chastity. The oblate crowned with flowers, double symbol of innocence and sacrifice, was led to the church surrounded by his relatives and their friends. The religious assembled in the choir prayed for the one whom their adoption would initiate to the labors and the joys of a new family. The celebrant began the divine service and called on his head the grace of Christ. After the gospel, the oblate approached the altar carrying a host and a chalice with a little wine which the priest received as a deposit to the Lord.D. Pitra, Histoire de Saint-L√©ger. His father or his parents wrapped his hand and offering in the altar cloth, which was spread over him as a sign of adoption by the Church.Michelet, Origines du Droit, p.11. After warning the child of the austerities of the monastic life, he read to him the rule of St. Benedict and the parents pledged for him. His hair was shaved and he put on the monks' cucula. He was no longer entitled to the paternal inheritance. Around the age of 15, he was allowed to make a profession. Wealthy parents made an offering to the monastery. Career Mederic astonished the fifty of his classmates by the observance of a rigorous discipline. Barley bread dipped in water was his only food, which he only took twice a week. His eyes still fixed on the Crucifix, he was wearing a hair shirt under his coat. He lived thus for several years, hiding from the other monks. But his reputation for holiness passed the doors of the convent, and celebrity came to fetch him at the end of the cloister. Herald, abbot of Saint-Martin, having died about 680, it is quite naturally that the brothers elected him, following the advice of the bishop of Autun, Hermenarius, who recommended them to choose a pastor able to save the flock of the Christ of the Wolf Tooth.Vita S. M√©deric, cit√© par Bulliot in: Essai historique sur l'abbaye de Saint-Martin d'Autun , p. 78. After three days of fasting the monks assembled at the church, sang the Mass of the Holy Ghost, intoned the Veni Creator, and proceeded to the election of their abbot by designating Mederic unanimously. The crowd ran to the monastery. The bishop, hearing him proclaimed from the top of the ambo, addressed the new abbot: > \\"Flambeau du Christ, vase d'√©lection du tr√©sor divin, re√ßois la mesure > dispensatoire du Dieu √©ternel pour nourrir les troupeaux du cr√©ateur. > Instruis-les par tes conseils et tes pr√©ceptes et m√©rites d'entendre ces > paroles du juge mis√©ricordieux : O bon fid√®le serviteur, parce que tu as √©t√© > fid√®le en peu de choses, je t'√©tablirai sur beaucoup d'autres, entre dans la > joie de ton Seigneur\\" (Math.25.11) The more he was raised, the more he faded away. This new life soon weighed on him. His many miracles attracted the crowds. No longer finding in this place peace and deep communion with God, Mederic decided to withdraw into the solitude of the forest of Morvan to finally be alone with God. He built a cell there some distance from Autun but this secret was quickly broken because the monks, plunged in sadness by his disappearance, went in search of him. Mederic not wanting to follow them, they asked the bishop who, threatening excommunication, managed to get him back to the monastery. Later life Among his clergy the young monk Frodulphe, also known as Saint Frou, was close to the master who had held him on the baptismal font and had educated himself to raise him to the highest degrees of perfection. Frodulphe, enamored of solitude like his master, proposed to him a pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint Denis and Saint Germain, their compatriot, abbot of the Abbey of St. Symphorian, Autun, before becoming bishop of Paris. The two monks took the road to Paris and on the way they multiplied the miracles. The aging Mederic had great difficulty in making this journey on foot, and fell ill on arriving at the Collegiate Church of Saint-Martin de Champeaux, near Melun, where they stopped for several months. The two men spent long hours praying in the church. Sometimes they went to Melun to exercise charity; hearing some of the prisoners moaning from the depths of their cell, Mederic moved his heart and asked God for their deliverance. The doors of the prison opened on their own. His cure delayed, he left the monastery of Champeaux. The people came to make him many gifts which he hastened to distribute to the poor. Halfway to Paris, he cures a poor man's fever answering to the name of Ursus. A woman named B√©n√©dicte recovered health through her intercession. Arrived at Bonneuil-sur- Marne where he learns that two thieves were in chains, he asks God for his intercession and obtains the release of the two men. On the side of Charenton- le-Pont, he delivered another criminal who had broken the bridge. He was again forced to stop by fatigue. It was in this uninhabited place that a chapel was erectedAbb√© Jean Lebeuf, \\" Histoire du Dioc√®se de Paris\\". On honorait saint Merry √† Linas pr√®s de Paris, o√π Louis IV d'Outremer fonda l'abbaye Saint-Merry de Linas en 936. to honor its memory, and that some houses were grouped around the building which was at the origin of the village of Saint-M√©ry, in the diocese of Paris. They decided to make a detour to go to the tomb of Saint Denis and stopped at Thomery. Mederic arrived in Paris. It was near the church of Saint-Pierre-des-Bois that he found refuge in a cell open day and night to the prayers of passers-by. He rested his body broken by fatigue and illness.Dom Lobineau et F√©libien, \\"Histoire de Paris\\" t.I. p.62. There, living in recluse, he served God for two years and nine months after having accomplished with joy the purpose of his pilgrimage and kneeling in the church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s at the tomb of the illustrious abbot of the Abbey of St. Symphorian of Autun. Feeling his coming end, the 18th of the calends of September, he died in peace surrounded by many of his disciples. He was buried in St. Peter's Chapel. His tomb was the object of true veneration as miracles took place and Charles the Bald established a cult in his honor. This church was later too small and, falling into ruins, it was rebuilt and transformed into a basilica by Odon the Falconer. Thibert, priest in 884, solicited Gozlin, bishop of Paris, to translate it. The bones of the saint were raised and placed above the altar in a silver shrine enriched with precious stones and supported by two angels. Adalard, former Count of Autun, made for the occasion rich gifts to the new church which was placed under the name of St. Peter and St. Merry. The Abbey of Champeaux, formerly illustrated by its presence, received a portion of its relics; the abbey of St. Martin in Autun founded a solemn Mass in his honor. Left alone, Frodulphe returned to St. Martin. Veneration The Church of Saint-Merri in Paris is named after him.

It is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, it is a quarry for fisheries in the Mediterranean. Description The thickback sole has the typical slender, elongated, oval body shape of soles but which is thick from side to side. It has a smoothly rounded snout. small head with a strongly curved mouth on its underside. They have large eyes which have a diameter which is greater than the length of the snout. The dorsal fin has its origin near the front of its upper eye and has a smooth profile with 63-80 fin rays, the anal fin is shorter with 47-64 fin rays. The caudal fin is separate from last rays of the dorsal and anal fins. The lateral line has 65-98 pored scales. It has small pectoral fins with the one on the blind side being minute. The eyed side is brown in colour with five transverse black bands which reach to the dorsal and anal fins creating dark patches on these fins. The largest fish recorded had a standard length of 35 cm, they are more normally recorded with a total length of 14 cm. Distribution The thickback sole occurs in the northeast Atlantic, from Great Britain and Ireland south to the Baie du L√©vrier in Senegal, they are also found around Madeira. In the Mediterranean Sea, this species can be found throughout the basin except for the coasts of the Levantine Sea. Habitat and biology This species is benthic on sea beds consisting of sand and mud, preferring coarse sand. on the continental shelf and slope, at depths between 80‚Äì400 m. It feeds on a wide range of small benthic organisms, largely crustaceans such as amphipods and shrimp, also polychaetes and bivalves. The spawning season runs from early March to early summer in the English Channel but from late winter and spring to early autumn off Ireland. They can live for up to 14 year. The young thickback sole develop in open-sea nurseriesand settle into a benthic mode at a relatively young age compared to common sole and this may be why they are rarely recorded in coastal waters. FMIB 47584 Solea variegata - Larva of Thickback Newly hatched, April 24, 1889 Pigment as seen by reflected light yk- yolk (1); Solea Fisheries The thickback sole is not utilized in fisheries in the central eastern Atlantic but in the Mediterranean it is a commercially exploited species and is regularly observed in markets in Morocco, the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Adriatic Sea. Elsewhere it is not common in markets. The flesh is highly esteemed and is marketed both fresh and frozen. The average depth of commercial trawls in the Atlantic is between 35m and 200m and this could mean that thickback soles are caught in a significant amount as bycatch and that most are discarded, the effects of this bycatch on the population is not known. The commercial fisheries for thickback sole in the Mediterranean uses trawls, gill and trammel nets.

It was under his abbacy that Saint Mederic made him his disciple and his friend; he had kept it on the baptismal font and devoted himself to his education. When St. Merry left the monastery to take refuge in the solitude of the great woods of the Morvan, surely he was one of those who went in search of him and found him, begged him to return to take care of them. Not having succeeded, he was surely brothers who went to fetch the bishop of Autun, Ansbert, to bring him back to the heart of his monastery [ref. necessary]. Once back home, life resumed. Frodulphe de Barjon accompanied his master on his journey to Paris, about 696, on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint Denis, and met their compatriot Germain de Paris, who was formerly abbot of the abbey of Saint-Symphorien d'Autun. On the way, he stopped at the Collegiate Church of Saint-Martin de Champeaux in Brie, near Melun, Merry being sick. They had made this long journey on foot. Having left for Paris, the two men stopped at Bonneuil-sur-Marne and Charenton-le-Pont, the Abbe Merry multiplying the number of miracles on his way. Having settled again in a solitary place, some faithful grouped themselves and thus was born in the hamlet of Saint-M√©ry. Deciding to collect themselves also on the tomb of Saint Denis, they made a stop at Thomery. Arriving in Paris, they discovered, in a small wood, on what was formerly the island Saint-Martin, in the marsh, a small chapel near the church of Saint- Pierre-des-Bois, where they decided to stay. They stayed there for two years and nine months. It is in this hermitage that his companion died on August 29, 700.Joris-Karl Huysmans, Trois √©glises et trois primitifs, Paris, Plon, 1908.

Barron (born 20 May 1962) is a British chemist, academic, and entrepreneur. He is the S√™r Cymru Chair of Low Carbon Energy and Environment at Swansea University, and the Charles W. Duncan Jr.-Welch Foundation Chair in Chemistry at Rice University. He is the founder and director of Energy Safety Research Institute (ESRI) at Swansea University, which consolidates the energy research at the University with a focus on environmental impact and future security. At Rice University, he leads a Research Group and has served as Associate Dean for Industry Interactions and Technology Transfer. Most of Barron's work has revolved around the study of nanoparticles and their applications. Early on, he studied how the structure of a molecule could overcome thermodynamic control and create new solid state structures. Some of his early work also dealt with alumoxanes and ceramic nanomaterials. In the early 2000s, his research began to focus on carbon nanomaterials, the functionalization of fullerenes and single walled carbon nanotubes. Later, application of nanotechnology to energy problems became the focal point of his work. He has authored over 440 papers and 6 books, including a book co- authored with his wife, Merrie Barron, entitled Project Management for Scientists and Engineers. Barron is the co-founder of Oxane Materials and Natcore Technology. He was a co-founder of the Rice Alliance. Barron has received several awards for his research and work. He received the Humboldt Senior Scientist Research Award in 1997, the Welch Foundation Norman Hackerman Award in Chemical Research in 2002 and the Lifetime Achievement Award by Houston Technology Center in Nanotechnology in 2011. He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry.  Early life and education  Barron was born in Welwyn Garden City, and brought up in Farnham, Surrey. In 1983, Barron completed his BSc in Chemistry from Imperial College. Subsequently he received his PhD degree in 1986 from Imperial College under the supervision of Geoffrey Wilkinson. After completing his PhD, Barron moved to the United States and joined University of Texas at Austin for his post-doctoral research, which dealt with the chemistry of multiple bonds to phosphorus and carbon. He published the first structural characterization of a C‚âÖP triple bond in 1988 in a paper he co-authored with Alan Cowley. In 1987, he joined Harvard University as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1991. Barron founded Gallia inc. in 1992 and became Chairman of its Scientific Advisory board.  Later career  Barron left Harvard University in 1995, when he joined Rice University as professor of Chemistry and Materials Science. He stepped down from his position at Gallia in 1997. In 1998, he was appointed as the Charles W. Duncan Jr.-Welch Foundation Chair in Chemistry at Rice University. Following his studies on ceramic nanoparticles and the discovery of their applications, he founded Oxane Materials in 2002. The company developed nanoproducts with applications in the field of energy. Building on his research with nanoparticles, Barron founded Natcore Technology in 2004 and joined the scientific advisory board of the company. The company manufactures nanoparticles and technology with applications in the solar sectors. From 2006 to 2008, he served as the Associate Dean of Industry Interactions and Technology Transfer at the institute. In 2013 he was appointed as the S√™r Cymru Chair of Low Carbon Energy and Environment, College of Engineering, Swansea University. He taught as a visiting professor for one year at University of Wales in 2009. Barron has served as a board member of the Houston Clean Energy Park. His research in the field of energy resulted in the foundation of Energy Safety Research Institute, which he leads, at Swansea University. The vision of the Energy Research Safety Institute (ESRI)and Swansea University is \\"building the bridge to a sustainable, affordable and secure energy future.\\" Barron is the editor of Journal of Nanomaterials since 2013 and Scientific Reports since 2014. He is also part of the editorial boards of Main Group Chemistry and Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing. Barron has served on the advisory board of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Zhu Zhou International Research Institute China, and Yellow River Delta Efficient Eco-economic Development.  Research  = Molecular control over solid state structure = In the early 1990s, Barron developed interest in studying how the structure of a molecule could overcome thermodynamic control and create new solid state structures. As such, he synthesized a class of cubic Gallium chalcogenide compounds and showed that a new meta-stable phase could be synthesized. = Alumoxanes = Following from his work on the chalcogenides, Barron was the first person to crystallographically characterise an alumoxane in 1993. These structures were spectroscopically consistent with methylalumoxane and he showed that despite being octet molecules they had significant Lewis acidity, he termed this as ‚ÄúLatent Lewis acidity‚Äù, and showed that this mechanism applied to a number of MAO style polymerization systems. Barron‚Äôs model has been evolved by others but is essentially the same as now widely accepted. = Ceramic nanomaterials = While investigating MAO- like structures, Barron noticed the relationship between clusters and minerals, at the same time he became interested in metalloxane polymers. He determined that these \\"polymers\\" were actually nanoparticles. Furthermore, he showed that these metal oxide nanoparticles could be chemically made by a top- down approach from mineral with which they shared their structures. With the ability to make a range of nanoparticles with different functional groups and control over size, Barron found that the structure and physical properties of macroscopic materials could be controlled by alterations at the nanometer scale. Barron was the first to discover that nanoparticle derived ceramics could be designed to have intra-granular porosity, meaning that the pores are within the crystal grain rather than between the crystal grains as normally observed. This had implications in composites and in membranes and separation processes. Through his research, Barron developed a process that forms hollow spheres of ceramic with exceptional crush strength. Barron rationalized that if hollow ceramic spheres could be made on a large scale they could replace dense ceramics being used in oil extraction and minimize waste. He created a spin-of company to commercialize this technology. In 2010, Barron and his team, on the request of U.S. Navy, developed a ceramic membrane with microscale pores that could filter out contaminants from waters and protect divers' wet suits without getting blocked. = Carbon nanomaterials = Barron investigated the impact of a fullerene on wide range of systems. Initial work was concerned with the toxicity on various cell types. The results of this work demonstrated that inclusion of C60 into a peptide structure drastically lowered any toxicity effects. In his latest work, Barron has studied catalysis with growth of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). He pioneered the concept of amplification of a CNT. = Environmental research = In mid 2010s, Barron returned to the issue of water purification. He has investigated the nano control over the surface of a material that allows for the creation of both super hydrophilic surfaces that allow for separation of oil and water without fouling. In this area, his research has been focused on energy problems including sustainable resources and waste recovery, reducing the impact of hydrocarbon energy sources, carbon dioxide valorisation and long- term sequestration and the next generation of the energy distribution.  Personal life  Barron lives with his wife, Merrie Barron, in both Swansea (Wales) and Houston (Texas). Since he moved to Texas in 1990s, he has participated in motor racing as a sport. In 1999 American Lemans Series, he was team principle for team in the GTS class. He participated in the final season of USRRC under Ross Racing. Barron has previously raced Lotus Seven, Caterham Seven, and Lotus Type 61 Formula Ford. He has been SW Division SCCA E-Production Champion, 2013 Monoposto Formula Ford Champion, 2013 SVRA Group 2 Sprint Series Champion and 2014 Monoposto Formula Ford Champion. In 2018, he raced FIA Formula Opel Racing with a Formula Vauxhall Lotus.

The name \\"Bloody Christmas Eve\\" refers to Eve of the Christmas, that previously was celebrated on 23rd of December.  The course of pacification  On December 22, 1944, Germans arrived in Ochotnica Dolna, who within the so-called the food campaign robbed the village. Despite the opposition of the local residents, a group of Soviet partisans attacked German soldiers, killing two of them, including non - commissioned SS-Unterscharf√ºhrer Bruno Koch. The next day, about 200 SS men came from Kro≈õcienko with six cars. The Germans ran into the homes, demanding money first and then murdering people. Children were thrown alive in the fire or brutally murdered. The Germans wanted to burn and plunge the next village Ochotnica G√≥rna, but the snow was too heavy and their cars were not able to travel up the hill.  Executioners  The crime in Ochotnica Dolna was made on December 23 by the SS (SS-Kampfgruppe Jagdkommando Matingen) criminal special order under the command of SS-Untersturmf√ºhrer der Waffen-SS Albrecht C. Matingen (number SS 338 969). This division consisted of soldiers of various nationalities. It was created in mid-1944 from members of the Waffen-SS and police in Montelupich prison in Krakow. Most of them were SS men from the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division, volksdeutsche from Poland, Russia and Ukraine. The company was stationed from the autumn of 1944 at the school in Kro≈õcienko. Albrecht C. Matingen (born June 3, 1920, died October 23, 1974) lived in West Germany after the war. Neither he nor any of his unit members was ever convicted of crimes committed in Poland.  Victims  According to the list of deaths registered by the Civil Registry Office (Parish Office) in Ochotnica Dolna on December 23, 1944, 56 people were murdered, including 19 children, 21 women. In almost two hours, almost all members of the families of Chlipa≈Ç√≥w, Rusnak√≥w, Brze≈∫ne and Karczewski were murdered. A fire station, a folk house and 32 farms burned down . thumb The funeral of the victims of Bloody Christmas Eve The pacification of Ochotnica was one of the bloodiest German repressive actions in Podhale.  Memory  The martyrdom of the village was commemorated by the memorial designed by Henryk Burzec, erected in 1964 in the center of Ochotnica Dolna, showing 20-year old Maria Kawalec, who is holding her small child next to her chest. After shooting her husband, Maria jumped out of the window with her son in her arms. The first bullet hit the child in the forehead and the other pierced the mother's shovel and jaw. Maria sat under the willow tree and not letting go of the child, she froze in this position. You can see she was trying to protect the child from the bullets holding her hand up in the air. The commemorative cross dedicated to these events also stood, among other crosses, at the Sanctuary of the Martyrdom of the Polish Countryside located in Michni√≥w, where one of the largest pacification of villages in Polish territories during the occupation took place.

It is also used in veterinary medicine as Incurin to treat urinary incontinence due to estrogen deficiency in dogs. The medication is taken by mouth in the form of tablets, as a cream that is applied to the skin, as a cream or pessary that is applied in the vagina, and by injection into muscle. Estriol is well-tolerated and produces relatively few adverse effects. Side effects may include breast tenderness, vaginal discomfort and discharge, and endometrial hyperplasia. Estriol is a naturally occurring and bioidentical estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like endogenous estradiol. It is an atypical and relatively weak estrogen, with much lower potency than estradiol. When present continuously however, estriol produces full estrogenic effects similarly to estradiol. Estriol was first discovered in 1930, and was introduced for medical use shortly thereafter. Estriol esters such as estriol succinate are also used. Although it is less commonly employed than other estrogens like estradiol and conjugated estrogens, estriol is widely available for medical use in Europe and elsewhere throughout the world. Medical uses Estriol is used in menopausal hormone therapy to treat menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes, vulvovaginal atrophy, and dyspareunia (difficult or painful sexual intercourse). The benefits of estriol on bone mineral density and osteoporosis prevention have been inconsistent and are less clear. Estriol has been found to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections and other urogenital symptoms. A combination of estriol and lactobacilli as a dual estrogen and probiotic has been marketed for the treatment of vaginal atrophy and urinary tract infections.https://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800050964 =Available forms= Estriol is available in oral tablet, vaginal cream, and vaginal suppository forms. It is also available over-the-counter or from compounding pharmacies in the form of topical creams. The medication is available both as estriol and in the form of estriol ester prodrugs such as estriol succinate, estriol acetate benzoate, and estriol tripropionate, as well as the polymeric ester prodrug polyestriol phosphate. Estriol was originally marketed in the 1930s in the form of oral capsules containing 0.06, 0.12, or 0.24 mg estriol under the brand names Theelol (Parke-Davis) and Estriol (Lilly, Abbott). Subsequently, many decades later, oral tablets containing 0.35, 1, or 2 mg estriol were introduced under brand names such as Gyn√§san, Hormomed, Ovestin, and Ovo-Vinces. Contraindications General contraindications of estrogens include breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and others. In animals, estriol is contraindicated during pregnancy and in ferrets. Side effects Estriol is well-tolerated and produces relatively few adverse effects. Breast tenderness may sometimes occur as a side effect of estriol. Local reactions with vaginal estriol such as discomfort (irritation, burning, itching) and discharge may occur. Estriol may produce endometrial hyperplasia similarly to estradiol and other estrogens, and hence should be combined with a progestogen in women with intact uteruses to prevent this risk. However, it appears that typical clinical dosages of vaginal estriol are not associated with an important risk of endometrial proliferation or hyperplasia. As such, combination with a progestogen may not be needed in the case of vaginal estriol. Some studies suggest that this may also be true for oral estriol. However, dosage and frequency of administration, as well as meal consumption, may be determining factors as to whether or not estriol produces endometrial proliferation. Overdose Estrogens and other steroids are relatively safe in acute overdose. Estriol has been assessed in single oral doses of up to 75 mg. General symptoms of estrogen overdose in humans may include nausea, vomiting, vaginal bleeding, and reversible feminization. While there are no known studies describing the acute toxicity of estrogen overdose in dogs, this species is known to be more sensitive to the toxic effects of estrogens than humans and other animals. The most serious short-term adverse effect of estrogens in dogs is bone marrow suppression and consequent pancytopenia, which can be life-threatening. Interactions Interactions with estriol might be expected to be similar to those of estradiol. No interactions with estriol have been reported in animals. However, it should not be used in combination with other drugs that suppress bone marrow production in dogs. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Estriol is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs), ERŒ± and ERŒ≤. In terms of relative binding affinities (RBA) for the ERs compared to estradiol, it was found in one study to possess 11 to 14% of the RBA for the human ERŒ± and 18 to 21% of the RBA for the human ERŒ≤. Its relative transactivational capacities at the ERs compared to estradiol were 11% at ERŒ± and 17% at ERŒ≤. In addition to being a ligand of the classical nuclear ERs, estriol is an antagonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), a membrane estrogen receptor (mER), at high concentrations (~1,000‚Äì10,000 ŒºM). This is in contrast to estradiol, which is an agonist of this receptor. Like other estrogens, estriol does not importantly interact with other steroid hormone receptors. Estriol is a much less potent estrogen than is estradiol, and is somewhat weak and atypical in its properties. Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. With clinical use, estriol is said to be weakly estrogenic in certain tissues, such as the liver and endometrium, but produces pronounced and full estrogenic responses in the vaginal epithelium. The medication has been found to reduce hot flashes, improve vaginal atrophy, reverse the postmenopausal decline in skin thickness and collagen content, suppress gonadotropin secretion, and produce proliferation of breast epithelium. Conversely, estriol does not consistently affect bone resorption or fracture risk, does not seem to increase breast density, and, at oral doses of 2 to 4 mg/day, does not affect liver proteins, lipid metabolism, or hemostatic parameters. Additionally, vaginal estriol does not appear to produce endometrial proliferation or increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, and some studies have found this to be the case for oral estriol as well. On the other hand, it appears that estriol may be able to stimulate the growth of active breast cancer. In rodents, estriol induces mammary gland development similar to that with estrone. By the oral route in women, estriol has approximately 30% of the potency of estradiol in terms of hot flashes relief and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone secretion, and about 20% of the potency of estradiol on stimulation of liver production of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. A study of ovulation inhibition by estrogens in women found that prevention of ovulation occurred with 5 mg/day oral estriol in only 1 of 7 cycles. Due to its differing effects from those of estradiol, estriol may be considered a safer estrogen in certain regards. Nuclear retention of the receptor estrogen complex in the uterus with a single short-acting subcutaneous injection of 0.1 Œºg estradiol (E2), 1.0 Œºg estriol (E3), or a combination of 0.1 Œºg estradiol and 1.0 Œºg estriol in aqueous solution in rats. Estriol displaces estradiol from the estrogen receptors and, due to the shorter nuclear retention of estriol, it thereby antagonizes overall nuclear retention. No antagonism occurs when long-acting subcutaneous pellets of estriol are used instead. The weak and atypical estrogenicity of estriol is thought to be related to its short duration in the body and hence the fact that it stays bound to the ER for a relatively short amount of time. Whereas estradiol remains bound to the ER for 6 to 24 hours with a single short-acting injection, estriol dissociates from the receptor much more rapidly and stays bound for only 1 to 6 hours. As a result, estriol can only induce estrogenic effects which require short-term interaction with the ERs. Induction of endometrial mitoses requires the ligand to remain bound for at least 9 to 12 hours, and this is thought to be responsible for the lack of endometrial proliferation with estriol in many studies. If estriol is delivered more continuously than a single administration per day however, for instance if it is given as a subcutaneous pellet, as a depot injection, or in multiple doses two or three times per day, this results in more sustained exposure to estriol and full estrogenic responses equivalent to those of estradiol occur. For these reasons, estriol has been described as a \\"short-acting\\" estrogen and it has been said that descriptors like \\"weak\\" and \\"impeded\\" are inaccurate. Consumption of food after oral administration of estriol also results in more prolonged exposure to estriol, due to enterohepatic recycling and resurgences in estriol levels. As such, if avoidance of endometrial hyperplasia or other full estrogenic effects is intended, it may be preferable to take estriol in a single dose, as low as possible, once per day at night before bedtime. Although estriol is an estrogen, it has also been reported to have mixed agonist‚Äìantagonist or partial agonist activity at the ERs. On its own, it is said to be weakly estrogenic, but in the presence of estradiol, it has been found to be antiestrogenic. However, this is again due to the fact that estriol is a \\"short-acting\\" estrogen. If estriol is present continuously with estradiol, it shows no antagonism of estradiol. The co-administration of estriol with estradiol has been found not to influence the effects of the latter in women, including neither enhancing nor antagonizing the effects of estradiol. =Pharmacokinetics= Estriol (E3) levels after a single dose during continuous daily administration of 8 mg oral estriol (with or without a meal at 4 hours) or 0.5 mg vaginal estriol. Note the second peak with oral estriol caused by consumption of a meal at 4 hours, which is due to enterohepatic recycling of the compound and a consequent resurgence in levels. Absorption Estriol has significant bioavailability, but its potency is limited by rapid metabolism and excretion and its relatively weak estrogenic activity. With oral administration, during first-pass metabolism, a considerable portion of estriol is conjugated via sulfation into estriol sulfate and rapidly excreted. Only about 10 to 20% of a dose of estriol remains in the circulation, and of this, only about 1 to 2% is present in its active, unconjugated form. Peak levels of estriol occur about 1 to 3 hours after an oral dose. Similarly to the case of progesterone, taking oral estriol with food greatly enhances its absorption. In addition, due to enterohepatic recycling, consuming a meal 4 hours after taking oral estriol can produce a second peak in estriol levels. Dosages of oral estriol of 4 to 10 mg have been found to result in a fairly large range of maximal estriol levels of 80 to 340 pg/mL. After a single oral dose of 8 mg estriol in postmenopausal women, maximal levels of 65 pg/mL estriol and 60 ng/mL estriol conjugates were produced within an hour. With continued daily administration, this increased to peak levels of 130 pg/mL estriol, whereas maximal levels of estriol conjugates remained at 60 ng/mL. Levels of estriol rapidly decreased to low levels following occurrence of peak levels. Consumption of a meal 4 hours after taking an oral dose of 8 mg estriol during continuous daily administration resulted in a second estriol peak 2 hours later of 120 pg/mL, with estriol levels declining slowly thereafter to about 25 pg/mL after 24 hours. The bioavailability of estriol is markedly increased with vaginal administration compared to oral administration. The relative bioavailability of oral estriol was found to be about 10% of that of vaginal estriol. In accordance, a single dose of 8 mg oral estriol and of 0.5 mg vaginal estriol have been found to produce similar circulating concentrations of estriol. It has been said that 0.5 to 1 mg vaginal estriol may be equivalent in clinical effect to 8 to 12 mg oral estriol. The high bioavailability of vaginal estriol is due to rapid absorption and low metabolism in atrophic vaginal mucosa. Vaginal estriol at typical clinical dosages results both in high local concentrations of estriol in the vagina and in systemic action. Vaginal administration of low doses of 30 ¬µg estriol and of higher doses of 0.5 and 1 mg estriol have been found to produce equivalent local effects in the vagina and improvement of vaginal symptoms, suggesting that a saturation of estrogenic effect of vaginal estriol has been reached in the vagina by a dose of only 30 ¬µg estriol. In contrast to higher doses of vaginal estriol however, 30 ¬µg/day estriol is not associated with systemic effects. Similarly, the use of 0.5 mg vaginal estriol twice a week instead of daily has been said to largely attenuate the systemic effects of estriol. Whereas oral estriol results in high levels of estriol conjugates which greatly exceed those of unconjugated estriol, vaginal estriol has been found to produce levels of unconjugated estriol and estriol conjugates that are similar. The absorption of estrogens by the skin is described as low for estriol, moderate for estradiol, and high for estrone. This is related to the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecules; the more hydroxyl groups, the lower the skin permeability. This may account for the relative lack of use of transdermal or topical estriol. Rectal administration of estriol has been assessed in one study. Administration of a rectal suppository containing 100 mg estriol resulted in estriol levels in pregnant women at term increasing by about 53%. Estriol levels at term are normally between 5,000 and 20,000 pg/mL, which suggests that estriol levels may have increased following the suppository by about 5,000 to 10,000 pg/mL (precise levels were not provided). Estriol succinate is an ester prodrug of estriol which is used medically via oral and vaginal routes similarly. In estriol succinate, two of the hydroxyl groups of estriol, those at the C16Œ± and C17Œ≤ positions, are esterified with succinic acid. As such, when adjusted for differences in molecular weight, a dose of 2 mg estriol succinate is equivalent to 1.18 mg unconjugated estriol. Unlike other estrogen esters, such as estradiol valerate, estriol succinate is hydrolyzed almost not at all in the intestinal mucosa when taken orally, and in relation to this, is absorbed more slowly than is estriol. Consequently, oral estriol succinate is a longer-acting form of estriol than oral estriol. Instead of in the gastrointestinal tract, oral estriol succinate is cleaved into estriol mainly in the liver. After a single 8 mg oral dose of estriol succinate, maximum levels of circulating estriol of 40 pg/mL are attained within 12 hours, and this increases up to 80 pg/mL with continued daily administration. Distribution Similarly to estradiol, but unlike estrone, estriol is accumulated in target tissues. The plasma protein binding of estriol is approximately 92%, with about 91% bound to albumin, 1% bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and 8% free or unbound. Estriol has very low affinity for SHBG, with only about 0.3% of the affinity of testosterone for this protein (or about 0.6% of that of estradiol). Relative to estradiol, which is about 98% plasma protein-bound, a significantly greater fraction of estriol is unbound in the circulation and hence available for biological activity (2% relative to 8%, respectively). This appears to account for the greater than expected biological activity of estriol relative to estradiol when considering its affinities for the estrogen receptors. Metabolism Estriol is metabolized extensively via conjugation, including glucuronidation and sulfation. Glucuronidation of estriol takes place mainly in the intestinal mucosa, while sulfation occurs in the liver. More minor amounts of estriol can be oxidized and hydroxylated at various positions. One such reaction is transformation into 16Œ±-hydroxyestrone. Estriol is an end-product of phase I estrogen metabolism and cannot be converted into estradiol or estrone. The main metabolites of estriol are estrogen conjugates, including estriol sulfates, estriol glucuronides, and mixed estriol sulfate/glucuronide conjugates. 16Œ±-Hydroxyestrone is known to occur as a metabolite of estriol as well. The biological half-life of oral estriol has been reported to be in the range of 5 to 10 hours. The elimination half-life of estriol following an intramuscular injection of 1 mg estriol has been found to be 1.5 to 5.3 hours. The blood half-life of unconjugated estriol has been reported to be 20 minutes. The metabolic clearance rate of estriol is approximately 1,110 L/day/m2, which is about twice that of estradiol. Hence, estriol is eliminated from the body more rapidly than is estradiol. Enterohepatic recycling may extend the duration of oral estriol. A single 1 to 2 mg dose of estriol in oil solution by intramuscular injection has a duration of about 3 or 4 days. Estriol esters such as estriol dipropionate and estriol dihexanoate, when administered via intramuscular injection in an oil solution, have been found to maintain elevated levels of estriol for much longer amounts of time than oral or vaginal estriol, in the range of days to months. These two estriol esters have not been marketed, but estriol acetate benzoate and estriol tripropionate are medically used estriol esters which are given via depot intramuscular injection and are long-acting similarly. Polyestriol phosphate is an ester of estriol in the form of a polymer, and has a very long duration of action. Excretion Estriol is excreted more than 95% in urine. This is due to the fact that estriol conjugates in the colon are completely hydrolyzed via bacterial enzymes and in turn estriol in this part of the body is reabsorbed into the body. The main urinary metabolites of exogenous estriol administered via intravenous injection in baboons have been found to be estriol 16Œ±-glucuronide (65.8%), estriol 3-glucuronide (14.2%), estriol 3-sulfate (13.4%), and estriol 3-sulfate 16Œ±-glucuronide (5.1%). The metabolism and excretion of estriol in these animals closely resembled that which has been observed in humans. Chemistry Estriol, also known as 16Œ±-hydroxyestradiol or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,16Œ±,17Œ≤-triol, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid with double bonds between the C1 and C2, C3 and C4, and C5 and C10 positions and hydroxyl groups at the C3, C16Œ±, and C17Œ≤ positions. The name estriol and the abbreviation E3 were derived from the chemical terms estrin (estra-1,3,5(10)-triene) and triol (three hydroxyl groups). =Analogues= A variety of analogues of estriol are known, including both naturally occurring isomers and synthetic substituted derivatives and esters. 16Œ≤-Epiestriol (epiestriol), 17Œ±-epiestriol, and 16Œ≤,17Œ±-epiestriol are isomers of estriol that are endogenous weak estrogens. Mytatrienediol (16Œ±-methyl-16Œ≤-epiestriol 3-methyl ether) is a synthetic derivative of 16Œ≤-epiestriol that was never marketed. Estriol acetate benzoate, estriol succinate, and estriol tripropionate are synthetic estriol esters that have been marketed for medical use, whereas estriol dihexanoate, estriol dipropionate, and estriol triacetate have not been introduced. Quinestradol is the 3-cyclopentyl ether of estriol and has also been marketed. Polyestriol phosphate, an ester of estriol in the form of a polymer, has been marketed previously as well. These esters, ethers, and polymers are prodrugs of estriol. Ethinylestriol and nilestriol are synthetic C17Œ± ethynylated derivatives of estriol. Ethinylestriol has not been marketed, but nilestriol, which is the 3-cyclopentyl ether of ethinylestriol and a prodrug of it, has been. Estetrol (E4), also known as 15Œ±-hydroxyestriol, is a naturally occurring analogue of estriol with an additional hydroxyl group, at the C15Œ± position. It is closely related to estriol and has similar but non-identical pharmacological properties. Like estriol, estetrol is a relatively weak and atypical estrogen. Estetrol is under development for potential clinical use for a variety of indications, such as menopausal hormone therapy and hormonal birth control.http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800044874https://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800034634 History Estriol was discovered in 1930. Subsequently, it was introduced for medical use in oral and transdermal formulations under brand names such as Estriol, Oestrosalve, Theelol, and Tridestrin. In addition, conjugated estriol, containing mainly estriol glucuronide, was marketed in the 1930s, under the brand names Emmenin and Progynon. They were the first orally active estrogen preparations to be introduced in medicine. In contrast to estrone, free estriol was never introduced for use by intramuscular injection. Estriol continues to be used medically today, widely throughout the world and in a variety of different formulations and brand names. Society and culture =Generic names= Estriol is the generic name of estriol in American English and its , , , , and .https://www.drugs.com/international/estriol.html It is pronounced . Estriolo is the name of estriol in Italian and estriolum is its name in Latin, whereas its name remains unchanged as estriol in Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German. Oestriol, in which the \\"O\\" is silent, was the former of estriol and its name in British English, but the spelling was eventually changed to estriol. =Brand names= Estriol is or has been marketed under a variety of brand names throughout the world, including Aacifemine, Colpogyn, Elinol, Estriel, Estriol, Estriosalbe, Estrokad, Evalon, Gydrelle, Gyn√§san, Gynest, Gynoflor (in combination with lactobacilli), Incurin (veterinary), Klimax-E, OeKolp, Oestro-Gynaedron, Orgestriol, Ortho- Gynest, Ovesterin, Ovestin, Ovestinon, Ovestrion, Ovo-Vinces, Pausanol, Physiogine, Sinapause, Synapause, Synapause-E, Trophicr√®me, Vago-Med, Vacidox, and Xapro. Estriol succinate has been marketed under the brand names Blissel, Evalon, Gelistrol, Hemostyptanon, Orgastyptin, Ovestin, Pausan, Sinapause, Styptanon, Synapsa, Synapasa, Synapausa, and Synapause. Estriol diacetate benzoate has been marketed under the brand name Holin-Depot and estriol tripropionate has been marketed under the brand name Estriel. Polyestriol phosphate has been marketed under the brand names Gyn√§san, Klimadurin, and Triodurin. Emmenin and Progynon were estriol products marketed in the 1930s which were manufactured from the urine of pregnant women and contained estriol conjugates, primarily estriol glucuronide. Estriol for multiple sclerosis had the tentative brand name Trimesta but did not complete development and was never marketed. =Availability= Estriol is marketed widely throughout the world, including in Europe, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere. The medication is also available in some countries in the form of estriol succinate, an ester prodrug of estriol. Estriol and its esters are not approved for use in the United States or Canada, although estriol has been produced and sold by compounding pharmacies in North America for use as a component of bioidentical hormone therapy. In addition, topical creams containing estriol are not regulated in the United States and are available over-the-counter in this country. Research Estriol may have immunomodulatory effects and has been of investigational interest in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and a number of other conditions. Estriol succinate was under development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis in the United States and worldwide, and reached phase II clinical trials for this indication, but development was discontinued due to insufficient effectiveness.https://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800026520 It had the tentative brand name Trimesta. Veterinary use Estriol is used in veterinary medicine, under the brand name Incurin, in the treatment of urinary incontinence due to estrogen deficiency in dogs. Certain estrogens, like estradiol, can cause bone marrow suppression in dogs, which can be fatal, but estriol appears to pose less or possibly no risk.

It has been provided as an aqueous suspension or oil solution given by injection into muscle and as a vaginal cream applied inside of the vagina. It can also be taken by mouth as estradiol/estrone/estriol (brand name Hormonin) and in the form of prodrugs like estropipate (estrone sulfate; brand name Ogen) and conjugated estrogens (mostly estrone sulfate; brand name Premarin). Side effects of estrogens like estrone include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, headache, nausea, fluid retention, and edema, among others. Estrone is a naturally occurring and bioidentical estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like endogenous estradiol. It is a relatively weak estrogen, with much lower activity than estradiol. However, estrone is converted in the body into estradiol, which provides most or all of its estrogenic potency. As such, estrone is a prodrug of estradiol. Estrone was first discovered in 1929, and was introduced for medical use shortly thereafter. Although it has been used clinically in the past, estrone has largely been discontinued and is mostly no longer marketed. Medical uses Estrone has been marketed in intramuscular and vaginal formulations and was used as an estrogen in the treatment of symptoms of low estrogen levels such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal or ovariectomized women. Estrone has also been used as an antigonadotropin and form of high-dose estrogen to treat prostate cancer in men as well as a form of high-dose estrogen to treat breast cancer in women. It has since largely been discontinued and is mostly no longer available, having been superseded by other estrogens with better potency and pharmacokinetics (namely oral bioavailability and duration).http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&varApplNo;=003977 Regardless of route of administration, if estrone is taken by a woman with an intact uterus, it should be combined with a progestogen such as progesterone to offset the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Estrone has been used by intramuscular injection at a dosage of 0.1 to 2 mg per week, or 0.1 to 0.5 mg given 2 or 3 times per week, for the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy, and at a dosage of 0.1 to 1.0 mg weekly in single or divided doses for the treatment of female hypogonadism, surgical castration, and primary ovarian failure. The range of single doses of estrone by intramuscular injection that are typically used clinically in women is 0.1 to 5 mg. High doses of intramuscular estrone have been used for prostate cancer in men and for breast cancer in women.https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/anda/pre96/85239_Estrone%20Suspension_Medr.pdf =Available forms= Estrone for intramuscular injection was provided as 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 mg/mL aqueous suspensions and/or oil solutions.https://www.micromedexsolutions.com/micromedex2/ It has also been available in the form of vaginal creams (1 mg/g (0.1%)) and suppositories (0.2 mg, 0.25 mg) as well as subcutaneous pellet implants and oral tablets (1.25 mg). A combined oral tablet formulation containing estradiol (0.3 mg, 0.6 mg), estrone (0.7 mg, 1.4 mg), and estriol (0.135 mg, 0.27 mg) has been marketed under the brand name Hormonin as well. In addition, a combined injectable preparation containing estrone (1 mg) and progesterone (10 mg) is available in the form of ampoules under the brand name Synergon.https://serp.mc/wp- content/uploads/2018/05/synergon.pdf Although estrone by intramuscular injection was originally formulated as an oil solution, it was soon replaced by formulations of estrone as an aqueous suspension due to a longer duration of action of these formulations. Side effects Side effects of estrogens like estrone include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, headache, nausea, fluid retention, and edema, among others. It can also cause endometrial hyperplasia. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Mechanism of action Estrone is an estrogen, specifically an agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs) ERŒ± and ERŒ≤. It is a far less potent estrogen than is estradiol, and as such is a relatively weak estrogen. Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. According to one study, the relative binding affinities of estrone for the human ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ were 4.0% and 3.5% of those estradiol, respectively, and the relative transactivational capacities of estrone at the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ were 2.6% and 4.3% of those of estradiol, respectively. In accordance, the estrogenic activity of estrone has been reported to be approximately 4% of that of estradiol. Other studies have reported that estrone has about one-tenth of the potency of estradiol in activating the ERs in vitro. Because estrone can be transformed into estradiol, which is far more potent as an estrogen in comparison, most or all of the estrogenic potency of estrone in vivo is actually due to conversion into estradiol. As such, similarly to the case of estrone sulfate, estrone is considered to be a prodrug of estradiol. Some in vitro research has suggested that estrone might be able to partially antagonize the actions of estradiol, but this does not appear to be of clinical significance. In contrast to estradiol and estriol, estrone is not a ligand of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (affinity >10,000 nM). Effects in the body and brain In clinical research in the 1930s, estrone was given via intramuscular injection to ovariectomized women in order to study its effects and to elucidate the biological properties of estrogens in humans. In these studies, prior to administration of estrone, amenorrhea, atrophy of the breasts (as well as flaccidity and small and non-erectile nipples), vagina, and endometrium, vaginal dryness, and subjective symptoms of ovariectomy (e.g., hot flashes, mood changes) were all present in the women. Treatment with estrone was found to dose- and time-dependently produce a variety of effects, including breast changes, reproductive tract changes of the vagina, cervix, and endometrium/uterus, and relief from the subjective symptoms of ovariectomy, as well as increased libido. Breast changes specifically included enlargement and a sense of fullness, increased sensitivity and pigmentation of the nipples as well as nipple erection, tingling within the breast mammary glandular tissue, and aching and soreness of the breasts. Reproductive tract changes included increased growth, thickness, and differentiation of the endometrium, and reversal of vaginal and cervical atrophy, which were accompanied by increased congestion of the cervix and mucous discharge from the cervix, uterine cramps and needle-like pains, pelvic fullness, a \\"bearing- down\\" sensation, and increased vaginal lubrication, as well as uterine bleeding both during treatment and in the days following cessation of injections. Endometrial hyperplasia also occurred with sufficiently high doses of estrone. Clinical research has confirmed the nature of estrone as an inactive prodrug of estradiol. With oral administration of estradiol, the ratio of estradiol levels to estrone levels is about 5 times higher on average than under normal physiological circumstances in premenopausal women and with parenteral (non-oral) routes of estradiol. Oral administration of menopausal replacement dosages of estradiol results in low, follicular phase levels of estradiol, whereas estrone levels resemble the high levels seen during the first trimester of pregnancy. In spite of markedly elevated levels of estrone with oral estradiol but not with transdermal estradiol, clinical studies have shown that doses of oral and transdermal estradiol achieving similar levels of estradiol possess equivalent and non-significantly different potency in terms of measures including suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle- stimulating hormone levels, inhibition of bone resorption, and relief of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. In addition, estradiol levels were found to correlate with these effects, while estrone levels did not. These findings confirm that estrone has very low estrogenic activity, and also indicate that estrone does not diminish the estrogenic activity of estradiol. This contradicts some cell-free in-vitro research suggesting that high concentrations of estrone might be able to partially antagonize the actions of estradiol. =Pharmacokinetics= Absorption Like estradiol, estrone has poor oral bioavailability. It has been said that, taken by mouth in non- micronized form, a dose of 25 mg estrone is approximately equivalent to 2.5 mg conjugated estrogens, 50 ¬µg ethinylestradiol, or 1 mg diethylstilbestrol in terms of estrogenic potency. Due to its weak oral activity, estrone has been used parenterally instead, for instance by intramuscular injection or vaginal administration. The pharmacokinetics of vaginal estrone have been studied. Estrone in oil solution by intramuscular injection has a shorter duration than estrone in aqueous suspension by intramuscular injection. Estrone in oil solution by intramuscular injection is rapidly absorbed, while estrone in aqueous suspension has a prolonged period of absorption. Upon intramuscular injection of estrone in aqueous solution, the water from the preparation is absorbed and a microcrystalline depot of estrone that is slowly absorbed by the body is formed. This is responsible for the prolonged duration of estrone in aqueous suspension compared to oil solution. Distribution Unlike estradiol and estriol, estrone is not accumulated in target tissues. In terms of plasma protein binding, estrone is bound approximately 16% to sex hormone- binding globulin (SHBG) and 80% to albumin, with the remainder (2.0 to 4.0%) circulating free or unbound. Estrone has about 24% of the relative binding affinity of estradiol for SHBG, and hence is relatively poorly bound to SHBG. Metabolism Estrone is conjugated into estrogen conjugates such as estrone sulfate and estrone glucuronide by sulfotransferases and glucuronidases, and can also be hydroxylated by cytochrome P450 enzymes into catechol estrogens such as 2-hydroxyestrone and 4-hydroxyestrone or into estriol. Both of these transformations take place predominantly in the liver. Estrone can also be reversibly converted into estradiol by 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17Œ≤-HSDs), and this accounts for most or all of its estrogenic activity. 17Œ≤-HSD isoforms that are involved in the conversion of estrone into estradiol include 17Œ≤-HSD1, 17Œ≤-HSD3, 17Œ≤-HSD4, 17Œ≤-HSD7, 17Œ≤-HSD8, and 17Œ≤-HSD12, although the relative contributions of the different isoforms is unknown. The biological half-lives of estrone and estradiol in the circulation are both about 10 to 70 minutes, whereas the biological half-life of estrone sulfate in the circulation is about 10 to 12 hours. The metabolic clearance rate of estrone is 1,050 L/day/m2 and of estradiol is 580 L/day/m2, while that of estrone sulfate is 80 L/day/m2. For comparison, the metabolic clearance rate of estriol is 1,110 L/day/m2. A single 1 to 2 mg dose of estrone in oil solution by intramuscular injection has a duration of about 2 or 3 days. As an aqueous suspension by intramuscular injection, estrone was used at a dose of 0.1 to 0.5 mg 2 to 3 times per week, or at a dose of 0.1 to 2 mg once a week or in divided doses. In one rodent study, exogenous estrone was administered and increased circulating estradiol levels by about 10-fold; co-administration of a selective 17Œ≤-HSD1 inhibitor decreased estradiol levels by about 50%. The ratio of circulating estrone to circulating estradiol is the same at about 5:1 with both oral estradiol and oral estrone sulfate. An investigational estrone vaginal ring was found to result in a ratio of estrone to estradiol of 4:1 or 5:1 initially, but this decreased to about 1:1 with continuous therapy. Excretion Estrone is excreted in urine in the form of estrogen conjugates such as estrone sulfate and estrone glucuronide. Following an intravenous injection of labeled estrone in women, almost 90% is excreted in urine and feces within 4 to 5 days. Enterohepatic recirculation causes a delay in excretion of estrone. Chemistry Estrone, also known as estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-3-ol-17-one, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid with double bonds at the C1, C3, and C5 positions, a hydroxyl group at the C3 position, and a ketone group at the C17 position. The name estrone was derived from the chemical terms estrin (estra-1,3,5(10)-triene) and ketone. A variety of estrone esters have been synthesized and described. These include the marketed esters estrone acetate, estrone sulfate, estrone tetraacetylglucoside, and estropipate (piperazine estrone sulfate), and the never-marketed esters estrone benzoate, estrone cyanate, estrone glucuronide, and estrone sulfamate. History In 1927, Bernhard Zondek and Selmar Aschheim discovered that large amounts of estrogens were excreted in the urine of pregnant women. This rich source of estrogens allowed the development of potent estrogenic formulations for scientific and clinical use. In 1929, pure crystalline estrone was isolated from the urine of pregnant women by various researchers. By 1929, pharmaceutical preparations including Amniotin (Squibb), Progynon (Schering), and Theelin (Parke-Davis), purified from pregnancy urine, placentas, and/or amniotic fluid and containing purified estrone or mixtures of estrogens that included estrone, were being sold commercially for use by intramuscular injection. Other products and brand names of estrone marketed in the 1930s included Estrone (Abbott, Lilly), Oestroform (British Drug Houses), Folliculin (Organon), Menformon (Organon), and Ketodestrin (Paines & Byrne), among others. These formulations included ampoules of oil or aqueous solution for intramuscular injection, oral tablets, and vaginal suppositories. Estrone in aqueous suspension for use by intramuscular injection was first described in 1941 and was introduced for medical use under the brand name Theelin Aqueous Suspension by 1944.

These countries reportedly include Canada, Georgia, Monaco, and Taiwan. However, estrone remains widely available throughout the world in the form of estrone sulfate, which can be found in estropipate (piperazine estrone sulfate), conjugated estrogens (Premarin), and esterified estrogens (Estratab, Menest). Research An estrone vaginal ring was developed and studied for use in menopausal hormone therapy. It increased estrogen levels, suppressed gonadotropin levels, and relieved menopausal symptoms.

He spent his youth at the court of Burgundy, and won the tournament organized by John of Luxembourg for the feast day of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1472, in Valenciennes. In 1477, after the death of Charles the Bold, he remained in the service of Charles' widow Margaret of York and became master of the petitions of the Duke of Austria. He obtained a prebend in 1482 at the Collegiate Church of Our Lady, Beaune, and the position of dean of the Collegiate Church of Our Lady, Semur-en-Auxois. Antoine de Chalon, bishop of Autun, gave him his support in obtaining the position of dean of Autun Cathedral in 1484. The Estates of Burgundy named him ambassador to Charles VIII of France, of whom he quickly became the counsellor. He entered the Parlement of Paris and rose through the various levels. He was bishop of Autun from June 8, 1500, to the date of his death on April 4, 1501, some considerable time after receiving the pallium, a position obtained with difficulty, because the previous bishop, Antoine de Chalon, had resigned to make way for Olivier de Vienne, a canon of Lyon, and Pope Alexander VI, had already granted the appropriate bulls. The canons of Autun protested and with the support of King Louis XII of France pressed their claim freely to elect their bishop, in this instance in the person of their dean, Jean Rolin. The Pope revoked the provision already made and transferred the bishopric to Rolin, but not until after the death of Olivier de Vienne.Dejussieu, Histoire de l'√©glise d'Autun et son chapitre, √âcole Sainte-Genevi√®ve, chez P.P. Dejussieu, 1774, Book III, p.389 In his will Jean Rolin asked for a modest funeral and to be buried in Autun Cathedral, in the chapel of the Holy Cross, located in the eastern side, which he had put under the patronage of St. Martin. According to his wishes his body was accompanied during the funeral ceremony by thirty paupers, six foundlings and prayers of the Friars Minor, recently established in the city.

The difference in level over the seven miles was , an average of 6 per cent. Eighty tons of ore were handled by each train.Street Railway Review, Vol XIV, No. 7, 20 July 1904, p. 484.  Track  The White Knob Copper Co., Ltd., of Mackay, Idaho, built a long single track railroad for the purpose of hauling ore in 1903. The railroad was put into operation in fall 1903 and was used entirely for freight trains, eight or ten cars being operated in one train.Street Railway Review, Vol XIV, No. 7, 20 July 1904, p. 811-812. The entire line was on a grade of about 6 per cent and the roadbed was laid with 60 lb/yard (30 kg/m) T-rails on rough cedar ties, between centers. Angle-bar joints were used and the railroad was rock ballasted.  Operation  The railroad, was used exclusively as an industrial railway. There were two trains in regular service each of which carried about 80 tons of ore and each train made three to four trips daily. The rolling stock included two Baldwin- Westinghouse electric locomotives long and wide over all. The locomotives had chilled castiron solid wheels with journals. They were equipped with Weslinghonse automatic air brakes. The rolling stock included 40 ore cars of 8 tons capacity, of the gondola type, each weighing , also two flat cars and two side dump ore cars, all of which were made by the American Steel & Foundry Co.

The snow plow equipment consisted of two home-made pilot plows which were attached to locomotives.  Electrification  The overhead line consisted of a No. 00 trolley wire and two aluminum feeders of seven-strand No. 4 wires, each of which was four miles long. The overhead material was furnished by the Ohio Brass Co. The railroad wound up through the hills and the feeders cut across ridges at times and in other places followed the track in order to give lapping points at a distance of every . The poles were long, of pine, and were in diameter at the top. The power plant operated both the smelter and the railroad so that individual data are difficult to obtain. Water power has been acquired by the company and steps were being taken in 1904 to construct a new power house, lo supply both the smelter and the railroad from this water power instead of by the steam plant initially used. The steam power house was and was a wooden building. It contained six 60-h.p. flue tubular boilers and three 155-h.p. McEwen engines directly connected to Westinghousc 500-Volt direct current generators. The boilers were fed with hot water from the blast furnaces. The switchboard was of marble, having six panels. It contained Weston ammeters and voltmeters and Westinghouse circuit breakers. Repair shop There was a car-house and a repair shop owned by the company, located at the smelter terminal of the road. The car-house was in dimensions and was used for storing the locomotives and for repairing cars. The building was of wood and had a diameter fire line for fire protection. Two repair men were constantly employed at this shop, and it was equipped with a lathe, shaper, drill press, bolt machine, pipe machine, emery grinder and also a complete outfit for rewinding the motors of the locomotives and a blacksmith shop.

He was appointed bishop of Saint-Malo on December 11, 1785, and crowned on January 15, 1786 by the bishops of Langres, Dijon and Chalons. He had chosen as vicar general Jacques Julien Mesle Grandclos, who was first archdeacon and, since 1782, abbot commendatory of the Abbey of Notre-Dame de la Chaume Machecoul. On October 14, 1790, he was served the civil constitution of the French clergy and the abolition of his bishopric decreed by the National Assembly. Refusing to take an oath, he finds himself forced into exile, first in Chamb√©ry, then in Switzerland and Bavaria. Returning to France after the signing of the 1801 Concordat, he played no role under the First Empire. He offered his resignation to the pope only in 1816, a typical attitude of the survivors of the episcopate of the Ancien R√©gime, ultra-royalist and Gallican. Charged in August 1814 by Louis XVIII to negotiate a new concordat with the Holy See, he was recalled in the spring of 1816, and was named peer of France and then archbishop of Besan√ßon on September 20, 1817. But he did not officially take possession of his seat until November 1, 1819. Very often absent from the diocese, he died in Paris on May 2, 1823.

The game has 32 cars including the W Motors Lykan Hypersport, the Acura NSX, the McLaren P1, the Pagani Huayra Roadster, the Ford Mustang GT, the AC 378 GT Zagato and more.  Development  The game started development in late 2014 when Eden Games became an independent games studio free of Atari. In June 2017, publisher Micro√Øds announced a line-up of games they were releasing for the Nintendo Switch, one of which was believed as a port of the mobile game Gear.Club. In early August 2017, Micro√Øds revealed via Nintendo Life that the title is in fact Gear.Club Unlimited, which is an expansion to the free-to-play mobile game with additional cars and modes. Later that month, Micro√Øds confirmed a 1 December 2017 release date, although they later clarified in October the December release date only applies to Europe, and announced the game will release in North America on 24 November 2017, with a limited physical release exclusive to GameStop.

In an interview with Red Bull, developer Eden Games clarified that Gear.Club Unlimited, unlike its free-to-play mobile predecessor Gear.Club, is a full premium title and has no microtransactions. They added that the game capitalises on the Nintendo Switch's power and attributes, stating the graphical fidelity will be 1080p at a steady 30 fps in docked mode, and that the game supports splitscreen local multiplayer with up to four players using a single Joy-Con controller. There are also plans for future downloadable content.  Reception  The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on Metacritic with a score of 64. It was consistently praised for its graphics, gameplay and lack of microtransactions, but criticised for its short and repetitive races and its weak AI.

The current CDF is General Tan Sri Affendi Buang ‚Äì having succeeded his predecessor, General Tan Sri Zulkifli Zainal Abidin on 2 January 2020.  History  The United Kingdom governed Malaysia in its pre-independence days. Most of its military forces at that time is from Commonwealth nations. There is local military force such as the Penang and Province Wellesley Volunteer Corps, and other similar units created in Singapore and the other Malay States, however, it is more as a territorial army than as a federal army. The Federal Council of the Federated Malay States passed the Malay Regiment Bill on 23 January 1933. With that, the first local federal military forces, the Malay Regiment (now known as the Royal Malay Regiment) formed. After World War II, with the Malayan Emergency conflict emerges, the Malay Regiment increased to seven battalions. One multiracial regiment and one armoured vehicle squadron also formed. With this, the regiments merged into one single federal army, thus forming the Malayan Federation Army, the Malaysian Army predecessor. At that time, even with combinations with other branches (Navy and Air Force), the Malayan Armed Forces were relatively small. As the chief of the biggest branch of the armed forces, the Chief of Army was at the same time elected as the chief of the entire armed forces. With Malaysia formation on 16 September 1963, North Borneo (now known as Sabah), Crown Colony of Sarawak (now known as Sarawak) and Singapore military forces merged with the Malayan Armed Forces into one single force. Because of this, the Chief of Armed Forces separated from the Chief of Army for ease of administration of the larger army.

He mutilated the corpses of his victims, leading to his nickname of the \\"Chinese Jack the Ripper\\" in Chinese media. He is thought to have killed eleven women between 1988 and 2002.  Murders  Over the course of 14 years, Gao raped, killed and mutilated eleven women: nine in Baiyin, Gansu province, and two in Baotou, Inner Mongolia. All his victims were dressed in red. The youngest victim was eight years old. The first murder is thought to have originated in a grocery store he managed with his wife in Baiyin. He would normally operate in daytime and follow his victims home, where he would strike. Gao raped his victims sometimes while they were alive and sometimes after having stabbed them to death. He removed the reproductive organs of some women after killing them and cut the hands and breasts off of at least one of his victims.  Arrest and sentencing  Police linked the eleven murders for the first time in 2004 and offered a reward of 200,000 yuan. Gao avoided being arrested until a close relative was taken in for an unrelated, minor offence. During a routine DNA test, a close familial relationship to the serial killer was established. On the basis of this, Gao was arrested at the grocery store where he worked in Baiyin on 26 August 2016. According to the Ministry of Public Security, he confessed to the eleven murders. Gao was sentenced to death and stripped of all his assets on 30 March 2018, and was executed by lethal injection on 3 January 2019.  Personal life  Gao was married and had two children. He was from Qingcheng Town, Yuzhong County, Lanzhou, Gansu.

S. Lewis. He appears as a minor character in Prince Caspian and as a major character in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and also briefly at the end of The Last Battle. Reepicheep is a Talking Mouse, the leader of the Talking Mice of Narnia; he is irascible yet imperturbably courteous, utterly without fear, and motivated by a deep concern for honour. Description Reepicheep is a \\"gay and martial mouse\\",Prince Caspian p. 73 about two feet high when standing on his hind legs,The Voyage of the Dawn Treader p. 16 with ears \\"nearly as long as (though broader than) a rabbit's\\"; small Talking Beasts in Narnia are very much larger than their \\"dumb\\" counterparts.The Magician's Nephew p. 107 He speaks with a shrill, piping voice. His fur is very dark, almost black. He wears a thin circlet of gold on his head, with a crimson feather.The Last Battle p. 165 His weapon is a rapier. Biographical summary =In Prince Caspian= Reepicheep leads the Talking Mice in battle against the Telmarines under Caspian's command. He is badly wounded, losing his tail, in the climactic conflict. Lucy heals his wounds with her magic cordial, but he finds when he rises to address Aslan that his tail has not regrown, and he apologizes for appearing in such a dishonourable state. Aslan counters that he is perhaps too concerned about his honour. Reepicheep, in a key speech, replies to the effect that Talking Mice, being very small, would be at a constant disadvantage if they did not zealously guard their honour. The other Talking Mice prepare to cut their own tails off if their Chief is not allowed to retain his, at which Aslan relents and miraculously restores Reepicheep's tail. =In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader= The only Talking Beast amongst the eponymous ship's crew, Reepicheep reveals that he has been driven since infancy by a vision of finding Aslan's Country across the sea in the far east of the Narnian world. His aspirations and code of honour bring him into conflict early with the egregious Eustace, but when the latter is turned into a dragon by a curse, Reepicheep becomes his chief friend and comforter. It is Reepicheep who urges the Dawn Treader to sail into the mysterious Island of Darkness, thus facilitating the rescue of Lord Rhoop, the fourth of the Seven Lords of Narnia whom it is their mission to find. The final three are found in a cursed sleep on Ramandu's Island, which can only be broken, the party are told, if they sail to the End of the World and there leave at least one of their number never to return; Reepicheep volunteers for this role and, at the end of the book, carries through with it, thereby both breaking the curse and fulfilling his vision. =In The Last Battle= When the main characters reach the gates of the Garden in Aslan's Country at the end of The Last Battle, it is Reepicheep who greets them. Thematic significance =Christian elements= Whilst The Chronicles of Narnia are often described as an allegory for Christianity, Lewis (himself an expert on allegory in literature) disputed this description on technical grounds, since most of the characters and plot elements do not \\"stand for\\" figures or events in Christian doctrine in any simple way. When a class of American fifth-graders wrote asking what the characters in Prince Caspian represented, Lewis replied :You are mistaken when you think that everything in the books \\"represents\\" something in this world. Things do that in The Pilgrim's Progress but I'm not writing in that way... So the answer to your first two questions is that Reepicheep and Nick-i-Brick [sic] don't, in that sense, represent anyone. But of course anyone in our world who devotes his whole life to seeking Heaven will be like R, and anyone who wants some worldly thing so badly that he is ready to use wicked means to get it will be likely to behave like N.Letter to a fifth-grade class in Maryland, 29 May 1954, in In a letter to one reader, Lewis laid out the plan of the Narnia series: \\"The whole Narnian story is about Christ.\\" Each book, he said, was intended to showcase a different aspect of Christianity, and for The Voyage of the Dawn Treader it was \\"the spiritual life (specially in Reepicheep)\\".Letter to Anne Jenkins, 5 March 1961, in =Chivalry= As a model both of ferocity on the battlefield and of courtesy in polite society, Reepicheep embodies the knightly ideal Lewis prescribes for manhood in his 1940 essay The Necessity of Chivalry. Portrayals *In the 1989 television serial produced by the BBC, Prince Caspian and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader, Reepicheep was portrayed by Warwick Davis. *In the Walden Media Narnia films, Reepicheep was voiced by Eddie Izzard in Prince Caspian and by Simon Pegg in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.

Biography  Von Bonde was born in Cape Town and matriculated at the Normal College Boys' High School, Cape Town, in 1912 before going on to the University of Cape Town where he attained his Master of Arts degree and was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in Zoology in 1918. He gained his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in zoology from the University of Cape Town in 1923, his thesis was \\"The zoogeographical distribution of the Heterosomata [flat fishes]\\". Between 1924 and 1925 he studied oceanography at the University of Liverpool, also serving as a lecturer in Zoology there. He returned to Cape Town in 1926 where he wa appointed as acting head of the Zoology Department following the death of Professor J.D.F. Gilchrist. He was appointed as Director of Fisheries and Government Marine Biologist in South Africa in 1928 when he was also seconded to the Conference of East African Governors to conduct fisheries and marine biological surveys in Kenya and Zanzibar. The following year, he attended the International Conference on Oceanography and Continental Hydrography in Seville, Spain as a representative of the government of the Union of South Africa. In 1932 he travelled to the United States and Canada, following the award of a Carnegie Research Grant, where he visited the various marine biological and fisheries laboratories. In traveling to Europe in 1937 where he visited Germany, France and the United Kingdom as well as travelling to the United States and Canada again to broaden his experience of fisheries research and technology. He was a delegate of the Union Government to the second Conference of the F.A.O. in Copenhagen in 1946, becoming a member of the Fisheries Committee and being appointed to the Standing Advisory Committee of Fisheries of F.A.O. von Bonde was appointed as an International Whaling Commissioner in 1949 and later was appointed Chairman of the Whaling Technical Committee. During von Bonde's tenure as Director of Fisheries, which ended in 1952, he had an important role in the development of the South African fishing industry, particularly the fishery of pelagic shoaling fishes, and in the research on Southern African marine resources. He was the author of numerous papers and articles on a number of marine biology and fisheries topics. He was also the author of textbooks, the last being 1956's \\"So Great Thy Sea\\". He was appointed as Managing Director of the Fisheries Development Corporation of South Africa in 1952 the position he remained in until his retirement in 1960. On retirement he went to live in Knysna, he remained an actively interested in all fisheries matters up until his death in 1983, following the developments and growth of the South African fishing industry and the resource research that he had helped to develop through its difficult early years. He married Marjorie Leibrandt in 1922. He was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Royal Society of South Africa, as well as being a member of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science, for which organisation he served as president of Section D in 1931. His presidential address dealt with \\"The correlation between marine biology and the problems of the fishing industry\\". He was also a member of the South African Biological Society, the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, and a Fellow of the International Biographical Association (London).

The development of the Ocean Grazer platform has been carried out by the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. The concept of the platform is currently on its version 3.0 centering on the modular design as opposed to the massiveness of the platform, as in the previous concepts. The majority of the harvested energy for all concepts is to be delivered by a wave energy converter that uses the motion of ocean surface waves to generate electrical energy  Wave energy converter operation  The operating principle of the Ocean Grazer wave energy converter is to store potential energy by creating a hydraulic head, due to the differences in pressure between two reservoirs. All three concepts rely on this principle to function. The hydraulic head is created by circulating internal fluid from the lower to the upper reservoir via a novel hydro-mechanical power take off system, composed of distributed and coupled floaters. Each floater is linked to a separate multi-piston pumping system, consisting of differently sized pistons that regulate the amount of pumped fluid and that can be adapted to the surface wave conditions. Check valve systems are needed to minimize the back flow when the pistons return to their resting position. Lastly, similar to a hydroelectric plant, once enough fluid has been stored in the upper reservoir it can be circulated through a turbine system to generate electrical energy.  Potential  There are advantages in using a device like the Ocean Grazer wave energy converter, such as: * Renewable, clean energy production from ocean surface waves. * The adaptability of the device with respect to the incoming wave conditions, granted by the different pumping settings in the power take off system. * The storage capabilities offered by the device, allowing to generate electrical energy with a controllable output as in hydroelectric plants. * The modular design and scalability (concept 2.0 onward).  Challenges  There are also disadvantages in using a device like the Ocean Grazer wave energy converter, namely: * The installation, manufacture and production are difficult and expensive. * The connection to the electricity grid is still an open problem, a suitable solution to deliver the generated electrical energy needs to be developed. * The moving parts, pumping systems and turbine systems in the device can create noise pollution and disrupt the habitat of different marine species.

Steroid ring system. The structure‚Äìactivity relationships (SAR) of anabolic steroids (AAS) have been extensively studied. List of modifications * Addition of a methyl or ethyl group at the C17Œ± position confers dramatically improved metabolic stability during first-pass metabolism, allowing for oral administration. However, it also confers hepatotoxicity. Examples: methyltestosterone, metandienone, norethandrolone, mestanolone. * Addition of a methyl or ethyl group at the C17Œ± position can confer increased estrogenicity due to the aromatized metabolite having much greater metabolic stability. Examples: methyltestosterone, norethandrolone. * Addition of a methyl or ethyl group at the C17Œ± position to 19-nortestosterone derivatives can greatly increase progestogenic activity. Examples: normethandrone. * An extended or bulkier group at the C17Œ± position reduces AR agonist activity or changes the steroid into an antiandrogen. An ethynyl group (e.g., ethisterone, norethisterone), allyl group (e.g., allylestrenol), or vinyl group (e.g., norvinisterone) all dramatically reduce AR agonist activity. A propyl group (e.g., topterone, rosterolone) or cyanomethyl group (e.g., dienogest) produces AR antagonist activity. * Addition of substituents at the C16 position can convert the steroid into an antiandrogen. Examples: oxendolone, metogest. * Attachment of esters at the C3 and/or C17Œ≤ hydroxyl groups confers increased lipophilicity and hence depot activity when administered in oil via intramuscular injection. Examples: testosterone enanthate, nandrolone decanoate, drostanolone propionate, boldenone undecylenate. * Attachment of a very long-chain ester such as undecanoate at the C17Œ≤ position can confer some oral activity via absorption by the lymphatic system. Examples: testosterone undecanoate. * Introduction of a double bond between the C4 and C5 positions in testosterone, otherwise known as 5Œ±-reduction, confers several-fold increased AR agonist activity to testosterone. The same is not true in the case of 19-nortestosterone derivatives, in which the opposite is the case. Examples: increased: testosterone to dihydrotestosterone; decreased: nandrolone to 5Œ±-dihydronandrolone. * Removal of the C19 methyl group from testosterone (but not from dihydrotestosterone) confers increased anabolic activity but decreased androgenic activity, resulting in a much greater ratio of anabolic to androgenic effect. The decreased androgenic activity is thought to be related to the 5Œ±-reduced metabolite of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, having greater AR potency than testosterone, but the 5Œ±-reduced metabolites of 19-nortestosterone derivatives having diminished AR agonist potency relative to their parent steroids. Removal of the C19 methyl group can also decrease aromatization and estrogenicity as well as confer progestogenic activity. Examples: nandrolone, trenbolone, normethandrone, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol. * Introduction of a double bond between the C1 and C2 positions can confer increased metabolic stability against enzymes such as 5Œ±-reductase and aromatase. This can result in a greater ratio of anabolic to androgenic effect and reduced estrogenicity. Examples: metandienone, boldenone undecylenate, chlorodehydromethyltestosterone. * Introduction of a substituent such as a hydroxyl group or chlorine atom at the C4 position can reduce or prevent 5Œ±-reduction and aromatization, resulting in a greater ratio of anabolic to androgenic effect and reduced estrogenicity. Examples: clostebol, enestebol, chlorodehydromethyltestosterone, oxabolone. * Introduction of double bonds between the C9 and C10 positions and between the C11 and C12 positions can confer greatly increased potency. Examples: trenbolone, metribolone, dimethyltrienolone, tetrahydrogestrinone. * Introduction of a methyl group at the C7Œ± position can increase potency and prevent 5Œ±-reduction. Examples: bolasterone, trestolone, mibolerone, dimethyltrienolone, tibolone. * Introduction of a methyl group at the C1 or C1Œ± position can confer some oral activity. Examples: metenolone acetate, mesterolone. * Replacement of the C2 carbon atom with an oxygen atom in 17Œ±-alkylated AAS can improve metabolic stability and decrease hepatotoxicity. Examples: oxandrolone. * Substitutions at the C2 or C2Œ± position such as methyl, hydroxymethylene, or a fused ring can improve metabolic stability. Examples: drostanolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol, danazol. * A hydroxyl group (instead of a ketone) at the C3 position and/or a ketone (instead of a hydroxyl group) at the C17Œ≤ can dramatically decrease AR agonist activity but render the steroid into an androgen prohormone. Examples: dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, androstenediol, bolandiol, bolandione. * Removal of the ketone at the C3 position can dramatically decrease AR agonist activity but render the steroid into an androgen prohormone. Examples: ethylestrenol, bolenol, desoxymethyltestosterone. * Aromatization of the A ring abolishes AR affinity and produces estrogenicity.

It was released on 1 August 2016. Episode One is the first game of the Lethe series of planned video games that take place in the same universe but as of March 2018, no other episodes were published, which is why Episode One is also referred to as Lethe. Episode One tells the story of Robert Dawn, a man on an adventure to fill in gaps in his memory. It received mixed reviews from critics.  Synopsis  After his father died, protagonist Robert Dawn finds documents that reveal that he has forgotten a significant part of his past, prompting him to go on a quest for discovery. The game starts with Dawn washing up at the shore of an unknown mining town. In the course of the game, he has to navigate different environments and avoid enemies as he tries to piece together his forgotten past.  Gameplay  Players take control of Robert Dawn from a first-person perspective. Unlike other adventure games, there are no weapons or combat. Instead, players have to rely on stealthily navigating the landscape, avoiding various hazards such as acid lakes and chasm. The player has three statistics, health, stamina and (psychic) energy, the latter of which allows them to use Dawn's telekinetic powers which the character develops mid-game. The game has no inventory system, allowing players to only carry five health and energy packs but nothing else.  Development  Episode One was built using the Unreal Engine and first posted to Steam Greenlight on 31 August 2012. Two teaser trailers were released in March 2014, prompting comparisons to Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy and Amnesia. In November 2014, an alpha gameplay trailer was released. While the protagonist originally was supposed to wield multiple magic-like powers like shooting fireballs and lightning, the character's powers were reduced to telekinesis to emphasize the stealth approach.  Reception  Reviewers praised the visual and audio design, highlighting that the immersive graphics and sounds will create a feeling for players as if they are actually in the game. Critics also emphasized that the game actually manages to scare players. Conversely, the slow pace, forcing players to go slow even if they preferred faster travel, and the save system, forcing players to replay major parts of a level when the protagonist died, were criticized.

Michael Straczynski for Netflix. The production companies behind Sense8 include the Wachowskis' Anarchos Productions (replaced by Lana and her wife's Venus Castina Productions in the second season), Straczynski's Studio JMS, and Georgeville Television, with Unpronounceable Productions having been set up specifically for this show. The show's first season introduced a multinational ensemble cast, with Aml Ameen, Doona Bae, Jamie Clayton, Tina Desai, Tuppence Middleton, Max Riemelt, Miguel √Ångel Silvestre, and Brian J. Smith portraying eight strangers from different parts of the world who suddenly become \\"sensates\\"; human beings who are mentally and emotionally linked. Freema Agyeman, Terrence Mann, Anupam Kher, Naveen Andrews, and Daryl Hannah also star. In the second season Toby Onwumere replaces Ameen. The show aims to explore subjects that its creators feel have not been emphasized in many science fiction shows to date, such as politics, identity, sexuality, gender, and religion. All episodes of the first season of Sense8 were written by the Wachowskis and Straczynski; in the second season, Lilly Wachowski took a break from the show, and the episodes were written by just Lana Wachowski and Straczynski, with the exception of the series finale which was written by Lana, David Mitchell, and Aleksandar Hemon. Most of the episodes of the two seasons were directed by the Wachowskis (or just Lana, in the second season), with the remainder being divided between their frequent collaborators James McTeigue, Tom Tykwer, and Dan Glass. Lilly's break during the second season marked the first time in the sisters' career that they did not work together as a writing and directing unit. Sense8 was filmed almost entirely on location in a multitude of cities around the world.  Conception  According to the Wachowskis, the origins of Sense8 date back several years before the announcement of the show to \\"a late-night conversation about the ways technology simultaneously unites and divides us\\". Straczynski recalls that when the Wachowskis decided to create their first series, because of Straczynski's extensive experience working with the format, Lana chose to invite him to her house in San Francisco to brainstorm ideas together. Both the Wachowskis and Straczynski agreed that if they were to do a television series, they wanted to attempt something that \\"nobody had done before\\", and change the \\"vocabulary for television production\\" the same way The Matrix became a major influence for action movies. After several days of discussion they decided on creating a show that would explore the relationship between empathy and evolution in the human race, and whose story would be told in a global scale, necessitating filming on location in several countries over the world, in contrast to the standard production model for television which attempts to limit or fake that as much as possible. A source of inspiration for Straczynski was his own experience concerning friends of his who live in different parts of the world but coordinate to watch a movie at the same time and comment to each other online about it. The title of the show was thought up by Lana on their second day of brainstorming, during a time when they hadn't yet decided how many characters they were going to have. Lana appeared to Straczynski with a notebook with the word \\"Sense8\\" written in it, as a play on the word sensate and the notion of eight main characters, telling him \\"The hard part is over now!\\".  Development  The trio became so excited with the concept they came up with, they decided to do initial development on their own instead of pitching it to someone else. The Wachowskis wrote three hour-long spec scripts, and together with Straczynski attempted to shop them around, such as at Warner Bros. and HBO, but when they saw that nobody could understand the concept they decided to shelve it. A few years later, when they felt that the landscape of television had become friendlier towards more experimental concepts, they decided to pitch it a second time. On October 2, 2012, Variety first reported the existence of the show, by writing that the Wachowskis, with the help of Straczynski's Studio JMS and Georgeville Television, would be shopping Sense8 around Los Angeles the week to follow. If the series was picked up, the sisters and Straczynski would be sharing showrunner duties. Additionally, the Wachowskis were planning to direct a few episodes of the show if their schedule permitted it. According to Straczynski, the first meeting with potential buyers was with Netflix. The Wachowskis and Straczynski talked to them about subjects such as gender, identity, secrecy and privacy. According to Lana they pitched shooting on location all over the globe to which Netflix responded favorably, which was in contrast to the \\"clearly impossible\\" response they had received by other outlets during their earlier abortive attempt. They also told Netflix they were only interested if they had the freedom to \\"do anything\\", like \\"crazy psychic orgies with all sorts of different bodies\\" and \\"live births even\\" to which Netflix also responded positively. After the end of the meeting, despite it having seemingly gone well, they worried they had made a mistake because they had not pitched any action or otherwise commercial aspects. By noon, and before they had the chance to pitch it to other outlets, such as HBO, Netflix called them to preemptively offer to buy and produce the first season. Netflix announced that they had ordered a 10-episode first season for the series on March 27, 2013. Later, during filming, because of the density of the scripts and the extended length of the first cut of the first episode, the showrunners and Netflix came to an agreement to extend the season to 12 episodes. The Wachowskis and Straczynski's production company that was set up to run the show was named Unpronounceable Productions. The name was suggested by Straczynski, as a joke that references the difficulty of pronouncing the showrunners' long last names. Before filming began, Straczynski and the Wachowskis mapped out five seasons worth of stories for the series, including the series' final episode, similarly to what Straczynski had previously done on his Babylon 5 series. The actors cast were signed for five seasons. \\"We pitched it as a five-year story. We've mapped out five seasons of this thing, our actor deals are being made for five seasons, five or six depending on the breaks\\", said Straczynski. The first season acts as the origin story for the characters. When asked how long their story bible is, Straczynski replied \\"It's in our heads\\". However, Straczynski did compile a 30-page document detailing the key points of a hypothetical second season should the first season become a success. Comic book artist Steve Skroce, who has been collaborating with the Wachowskis since The Matrix on both film and comic book media, has created storyboards for the show. Julie Wachowski, sister to the Wachowskis, is given the credit of \\"story researcher\\" in the closing credits of each episode of the first season. Karin Winslow Wachowski, Lana's wife, is credited for researching the story starting with the second episode of the second season. Lilly Wachowski, after completing her gender transition, decided to take some time off and did not return as writer or director for the second season, although she remained active as co-creator. Straczynski, who had a very active role during season 1 from pre-production to post-production in order to assist the Wachowskis with their first foray into TV, said his primary involvement in season 2 finished with the completion of the writing phase, as Lana felt this time she had the required experience to tackle the filmmaking aspect of the show on her own. He also said that the second season was designed to explore the mythology of sensates, introduce other clusters, and provide answers to many of the questions viewers had after the first season. Lana came up with the idea of making the first episode of the second season a two-hour Christmas special, because of her love for such programming in the television shows that she watched as a kid, such as Hill Street Blues, Mork & Mindy, and All My Children. Lana explained she enjoyed watching the lives of the characters in specials intersect with her own and considered birthdays, holidays and celebrations unique events for their ability to make one feel connected but also isolated and alone. Producer Roberto Malerba has disclosed that the first season had an average budget of about $15 million per episode, and the second season $9 million per episode.  Writing  Initial writing for the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said a good portion of the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski believes writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best. Earlier versions of the story featured a sensate from Iraq and more about Whispers, the villain of the show. The show was transformed when the writers decided to limit the storytelling, with the exception of the opening scene of the first episode, to the perspective of the eight characters. This means that every scene set in San Francisco must be about Nomi, in Chicago about Will and so on. Since the show begins with the characters not knowing what is happening to them and without being able to cut e.g. to the villains like a traditional show, the audience starts with the same questions and confusion as the characters do. As the characters slowly begin to understand more about what's happening to them over the course of several episodes, the audience does as well, at the same pace. Straczynski notes this type of writing wouldn't work if they were writing for a traditional network. \\"The first episode is written in a way that you could never do a pilot. With pilots you have to set up all the rules and explain everything to hook people in,\\" said Stranczynski. Instead, taking advantage of the binge-watching model Netflix promotes, the series was written as a continuous 12-hour movie, making it possible to tell the story at a different pace. Lana Wachowski, a trans woman, has written her first transgender character in her career in the series: Nomi Marks. For that she partly used her own experiences. \\"It has some very intense, autobiographical scenes, and that was very difficult and surreal,\\" said Lana. Jamie Clayton, who plays Nomi, has provided the example of a scene where a young Nomi is bullied by boys in a gym shower, as a scene that was based on experiences from Lana's life. Freema Agyeman, who plays Nomi's girlfriend Amanita, has shared that her character was based heavily on Lana's wife, Karin Winslow. Straczynski has stated that (much like Lana's fondness towards the Nomi character) he felt close to Wolfgang Bogdanow, because both him and Wolfgang had a bad relationship with their respective fathers. \\"Wolfgang was my true north in the storytelling,\\" said Straczynski. Straczynski did not reveal who was the character Lilly Wachowski felt the closest to during the writing process, saying it's up to her to do that. Since then, Lilly has come out as transgender too. The beginning of her transitioning process preceded the release of the first season, and Clayton had known about it early on. Unlike the first season, where the Wachowskis and Straczynski split the number of scripts in half and worked remotely from each other (but with frequent meetings), writing for the second season was performed by Lana and Straczynski by collaborating inside a shared writers' room. The author of Cloud Atlas David Mitchell and the novelist and columnist Aleksandar Hemon worked as additional writers on the second season and were credited as \\"consultants\\"; they also made a cameo appearance in an episode as themselves. Both writers came to know and work with the Wachowskis prior to Sense8. Lana became friends with Mitchell after adapting Cloud Atlas to film with her sister and Tom Tykwer, and was very surprised to read Mitchell's The Bone Clocks shortly before shooting the first season of Sense8 to find it strongly resembled \\"Sense8 and Jupiter Ascending [put] together\\", even though they each wrote their works separately. Hemon first met the Wachowskis in 2009, when they interviewed him looking for inspiration to write a movie script they wanted, and in turn he profiled them and wrote about the making of Cloud Atlas for The New Yorker in 2012. For the second season of Sense8, Mitchell and Hemon were brought in to spend a week in September 2015 with Lana, Straczynski, and script supervisor Julie Brown, proposing to them situations, twists and turns, to be further developed by Lana and Straczynski. Afterwards and for the rest of the year, Mitchell and Hemon were regularly being tasked by Lana to write from distance select scenes on short deadlines, that she and Straczynski would further develop or reject. Hemon estimates he delivered around 120 pages, of which none made it to the second season's 700-paged script without changes. Later, once filming began, Lana did a lot of rewrites on a daily basis as she got inspired by the locations, actors, and so on, even on the set. After completing writing for the second season, Straczynski moved on to other projects as a writer, while Mitchell and Hemon signed contracts to write for the third season over the summer of 2017. When the season was canceled by Netflix and later replaced by a special, Lana, Mitchell and Hemon returned as writers. Working 12‚Äì14 hours a day for six days per week, the three of them developed an outline within a week, and a 160-paged \\"writers' cut\\" of the completed script within three. Another week later they had it cut down to 130 pages and sent to the crew to begin pre-production, and some time later the actors received the final version, further revised and shortened, but with the ending omitted. The final 15 pages were delivered to each of them in a sealed envelope during the table read for the episode, with instructions to not open it before they are told to, so that they all get to read it for the first time together. The script during the table read bear the title \\"Amor Vincit Omnia\\", named after a famous Caravaggio painting, which translates to \\"Love Conquers All\\".  Casting  Sense8 marks the third collaboration of South Korean actress Doona Bae with the Wachowskis, following Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending. On June 20, 2014, Deadline Hollywood announced the cast of the eight lead characters, along with Freema Agyeman, Naveen Andrews, Daryl Hannah, Alfonso Herrera and Er√©ndira Ibarra. For the roles of those characters living outside of America, the filmmakers wanted to assemble a cast of international actors that matched the nationality of their respective characters, if possible. For example, Doona Bae, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt are from Seoul, Mumbai, and Berlin like their respective characters. Because the eight leads share the same birthday, the actors selected were all somewhere between mid-20s and mid-30s. The filmmakers wanted to write a Chinese, Japanese or Korean character and since the Wachowskis had worked with Bae on Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending before, they decided on creating a Korean character for her. Bae expressed worry to them on signing on Sense8 because the proposed five-season plan could mean she would have to be able to film action scenes for the next 10 years, which would be difficult if she ever decided to get married and got pregnant. She joined the cast after the showrunners told her not to worry as they would kill off her character for her if that ever happened. Jamie Clayton is a trans woman like the character she plays. She was attracted to Sense8 because of the opportunity to play a transgender character that was written and directed by a transgender filmmaker, and because she was a fan of science fiction and Straczynski. Tuppence Middleton knew the Wachowskis were writing Sense8 while working with them on Jupiter Ascending but she did not think they would ask her to play a role. Max Riemelt was cast at the recommendation of director Tom Tykwer, who had been wanting to work with the actor for a long time. Daryl Hannah was brought in to read for Whispers, because they were thinking of making him an androgynous character at the time, but when she arrived she was told they'd like her to read for the role of Angelica. In November, Deadline Hollywood wrote than Christian Oliver had joined the cast as a recurring villain. Oliver said he was excited to play a villain for the Wachowskis for a second time, after Speed Racer. Joe Pantoliano, who previously played in the Wachowskis' Bound and The Matrix, was cast in a small uncredited role as Will's father. On April 26, 2016, Deadline Hollywood reported that Aml Ameen abruptly left production a couple of episodes into filming of the second season over a conflict with Lana Wachowski that started during the table read for the season and progressively got worse. Both the Deadline article and Ameen's co-star on Sense8, Tuppence Middleton, suggested the conflict was over creative differences. When asked about it, Straczynski commented he was not there to know what happened between Ameen and Lana but he respects the choices of both. Subsequent to Ameen's departure, the role of Capheus was recast to Toby Onwumere after a seven-day auditioning process. Onwumere watched a few episodes of the show to prepare for his audition, as he had not seen it before. The actor said about his approach to the character: \\"My duty [was] not to emulate exactly what [Ameen] has done, ... but just to give it my own spin, and kind of do my own thing, and just give this character the same essence, but ... maybe a different life and a different take on it.\\" Lana described the unexpected change of the actors as \\"beautiful\\" and \\"perfect\\", commenting that it complimented her effort to explore the nature of identity in the series. She elaborated that in her opinion Ameen was an actor that was \\"quite good at being innocent and boyish\\" and Onwumere had similar qualities but was also someone that was \\"ready to ... become a political leader ... and also fall in love and be sort of sensual with another body\\", storylines that are explored in the second season of the show. Earlier in April, Kick Gurry, who had played parts in the Wachowskis' Speed Racer and Jupiter Ascending in the past, revealed he had been cast in the second season, after Lana called to inform him that they had a written a role specifically for him. In May, Deadline Hollywood reported Ben Cole had been cast as Todd, a sensate who would rather be \\"normal\\". In September, Sylvester McCoy reportedly revealed he filmed three or four episodes of the second season of a Netflix show, later identified to be Sense8, and has signed to appear in further seasons if he is wanted. Martin Wuttke, who had minor roles in Cloud Atlas, also joined the cast in the second season. Carmen Cuba served as the casting director on the series.  Filming and locations  To properly tell the international aspects of the story, filming for Sense8 took place almost entirely on location around the globe. In the first season they filmed in nine cities located in eight countries: Berlin, Chicago, London, Mexico City, Mumbai, Nairobi, Reykjav√≠k, San Francisco, and Seoul. Production began on June 18, 2014 in San Francisco. The filmmakers successfully negotiated with the organizers of the Clarion Alley Mural Project and select artists to feature their artwork in the show. Shooting in Chicago began on July 9 and wrapped up on August 8, with filming taking place both on location and at the Cinespace Film Studios. They shot some scenes in the Superdawg drive-through restaurant, while customers were being asked not to stare at the filming. Lana and Lilly Wachowski are frequent customers of the place. During location scouting, the producers found the City Methodist Church in Gary, Indiana which is nearby Chicago, and changed one site's description in the scripts to a church accordingly in order to fit that particular site into the filming. They filmed in the church from July 25 to 28. Filming proceeded to London for a short shoot and then to Iceland, where between August 26 and September 6 they shot in Reykjavik and nearby places such as Akranes. Filming then started in Nairobi, where a sequence required a crowd of 700 extras, 200 cars and a helicopter. Also available at: epaper.peopledaily.co.ke In Seoul they filmed from September 18 to 30. Next they moved to Mexico City and later to Germany, where they filmed in Berlin and inside Babelsberg Studio. Last place they visited was Mumbai where they also shot a Bollywood dance number that was choreographed by Slumdog Millionaires Longinus Fernandes. The writers wanted to feature an event in each city. They were able to schedule the Pride scenes with its Dykes on Bikes on the Dyke March in San Francisco, the Fourth of July fireworks celebration in Chicago, and the Ganesha Chaturthi Hindu festival in Mumbai. Additionally they recorded footage from the Fresh Meat Festival of transgender and queer performance in San Francisco, a club event taking place at the KOKO in London, and a real lucha libre (Mexican professional wrestling) event with the fighters wearing wrestling masks in Arena Naucalpan, in Mexico City. Lastly the scenes where characters are flying on an airplane were recorded during the real flights the cast and crew had to do to get from London to Iceland. On November 17, 2014 Straczynski wrote that the main unit shooting had wrapped, with only a few winter shots in Iceland remaining to be captured the next month. These scenes were further delayed to mid-January 2015, until Iceland had the necessary amount of snow, with the wrap party taking place in Reykjav√≠k's Harpa Music and Concert hall on January 21, 2015. By the end of the shooting, the filmmakers had completed 100,000 miles of flight time, or four times around the globe. For the second season, production credited 16 cities located in 11 countries for having been part of the filming. The major locations they filmed in, include all of the first season's except Reykjav√≠k, and the following new ones: Amsterdam, Argyll, Chippenham, Los Angeles, Malta, Positano, Redwoods, and S√£o Paulo. Production start for the main unit of the second season was given an expected date of March 2016, but a separate shoot involving the principal actors began on December 30, 2015, in Berlin, to capture footage during the Christmas holidays. This was followed by a short two-day shoot in Chicago, on January 23 and 24, 2016. Filming resumed in Berlin in the middle of March 2016, and proceeded to Mumbai on March 25, for a 10-day shoot. On April 7, filming started in Positano. Aml Ameen did not participated in the filming, as he had decided to depart from the production. Later in April, filming moved to Mexico, with Toby Onwumere replacing the departed Ameen, and specifically to Mexico City, and for one day in Metepec. Filming in California, San Francisco, began around May 5, and lasted up to May 20. Location manager Matthew Riutta was fined by the Department of Parks and Recreation when \\"someone accidentally got naked\\", during a romantic scene set at the tree swing in Billy Goat Hill. A short two-day shoot in Los Angeles, Malibu followed, starting May 24. Filming in S√£o Paulo took place in late May, and specifically in its 20th Gay Pride Parade on May 29. Participating in the event was a late decision taken by Lana two days before the Parade began, as the production had previously abandoned their plans for the location due to scheduling conflicts. When Lana realized she could make it fit, they flew to S√£o Paulo and filmed in the event in front of a crowd of millions, unrehearsed. Filming in Chicago began on June 5, and wrapped up on June 15, then moved to the United Kingdom, in London, Cambridge (Chippenham Park), and Scotland (Ardkinglas Estate and Castle Stalker, for 9 days), and wrapped on July 4. Then, filming moved to the Netherlands, in Amsterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht, for about two weeks, up to July 19. In Amsterdam, they were the first production to film in the Rijksmuseum, with the real paintings of Rembrandt featured prominently in the scenes. Lana was told that insurance would never allow her to film there, but after writing an eight-page letter about what The Night Watch means to her and the importance of bringing art to the homes of those that are unable to go to Rijksmuseum, she eventually managed to get a permit. In Amsterdam's club Paradiso, they filmed Tuppence Middleton DJing with a real audience, and the rest of the cast dancing. Also available here. After the Netherlands, filming proceeded to Nairobi as early as July 22, and later to South Korea, in Seoul and Bucheon, for the production's longest shoot, lasting about three weeks. Afterwards, filming moved to Berlin, until September 14, and during the same period, they also briefly returned to London to shoot outside the Houses of Parliament for two days. Filming then moved to Malta on September 18, for a two-day shoot, where they used the water tanks in Kalkara. On September 19, 2016, with the completion of the Malta shoot, filming for the second season came to an end. Overall, the cast and crew flew in excess of 250,000 miles to complete the season, while some directors and producers who also did location scouting flew as much as 370,000 miles. Filming for the second special took place in Berlin, Brussels, Naples, and Paris. Production began in Berlin on October 2, 2017, and moved to Brussels on October 12, where they filmed in Villers Abbey in Villers-la-Ville. The next day filming began in Paris, where they remained up to October 24. Around midnight of October 22, they filmed a four-minute fireworks show near the Eiffel Tower. Due to insufficient notices posted by the Paris City Hall, reportedly some Parisians were taken by surprise and mistook the sound of the fireworks for a terrorist attack. On October 25 production moved to Naples where it remained up to November 4. They donated ‚Ç¨7,000 to the local community to thank them for the hospitality, and to fund the construction of a pedestrian plaza. Filming resumed in Berlin later in November, and wrapped on November 12, 2017. A picture of the clapperboard used by the production shows that they consider the special as the twelfth episode of season 2.  Directing  The show's directors were attached to locations instead of episodes and with several countries appearing in every episode, in reality none of them has a singular director. During the first season the Wachowskis were responsible for directorial duties in scenes shot in Chicago and San Francisco along with London and Iceland, two places which were initially announced to be helmed by Straczynski. Straczynski eventually opted to offer them to the siblings because of the extensive action scenes involved in those locations and instead focused his energy on post-production. James McTeigue (V for Vendetta, Ninja Assassin) worked on the Mexico City and Mumbai parts along with some in Reykjav√≠k and German director Tom Tykwer (Cloud Atlas), whose Nairobi Half Life production impressed the Wachowskis, helmed Berlin and Nairobi. Dan Glass, who had been the visual effects supervisor for every Wachowski film since The Matrix Reloaded, reprised his role in Sense8 while also making his directorial debut in the Seoul part of the story. Even though there were times that units located in different countries were simultaneously shooting, the Wachowskis would travel to the various locations and have collaborations with the attached directors. Reportedly the Wachowskis directed such segments in locations where a different director was otherwise attached as the stunts the character of Silvestre performed for his action movie in Mexico City and in Nairobi car chase scenes with the \\"Van Damn\\" bus along with a fight scene involving machetes. In total, the Wachowskis were credited for directing seven episodes, McTeigue and Tykwer two each, and Glass one. During filming of the first season of Sense8 the Wachowskis were shooting ten to fifteen pages a day, which was much faster than the two to three pages a day pace they were used to on the typical large budget film. They commented it put a lot of pressure on them, but Lilly also called it exciting learning how to adapt to it. Tykwer said he had to be moving at a pace of completing seven minutes per day, which he similarly found highly unusual coming from the world of film. In the second season, Lana Wachowski took over many of the filmmaking aspects of the show, which combined with her sister's break, made her responsibilities as director shoot up. Production sound mixer Stevie Haywood recounted Lana's directing style was to use two cameras as the default setup, and develop the shot over \\"enormously long takes\\" which could last up to fifteen to twenty minutes. Additionally, the cast and crew under Lana did not use any rehearsals. \\"We rehearse on camera effectively\\", said Haywood. If there were any technical issues Lana expected the cast to improvise and keep the shoot going instead of calling \\"cut\\". Smith, Desai and Silvestre corroborated Lana's style of developing the shots on the set, her dislike for rehearsals, and the use of long takes, with the actors told to try different variations on how they play their parts. McTeigue returned as director for Mexico City. Tykwer returned as director for the Nairobi parts but not for the Berlin ones, as he was busy working on his own TV series, Babylon Berlin. According to Glass, in the second season he directed the second unit in Seoul, and he also did some directing in Berlin. Overall, six episodes of the second season, including the Christmas special, credit Lana as director, three credit McTeigue, and Tykwer and Glass get credited each in one. Lana returned as the main director of the series' second special, and Tykwer collaborated with her in Berlin.  Cinematography  Netflix required the production to shoot with 4K cameras to make the look of the show future-proof and John Toll who is credited as the main director of photography for overseeing the distinct look of the nine featured locations, made the decision to shoot by using mostly Sony's CineAlta PMW-F55 cameras, paired with Carl Zeiss Ultra Prime and Cooke Optics S4 lenses. During the first season, Toll, once again collaborating with the Wachowskis and Glass after Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending, personally handled the cinematography in San Francisco, Chicago, London, Iceland, and Seoul. Toll's approach to shooting was to use a lot of Steadicam and hand-held partly out of the necessity to follow the faster schedule of a television production compared to the feature films he was used to working on. Additional cinematographers worked with the rest of the directors in the remaining locations and they used a similar shooting style because they were facing the same scheduling challenges. McTeigue's cinematographer of choice for shooting in Mexico City and Mumbai was Danny Ruhlmann, who previously shot The Raven and Survivor for him. Tykwer worked with Frank Griebe and Christian Almesberger for the Berlin and Nairobi scenes respectively. Griebe had previously shot seven feature films of Tykwer's including Cloud Atlas and Almesberger was the cinematographer of two films Tykwer had produced in Nairobi: Soul Boy and Nairobi Half Life. In the second season, production used again mostly F55 cameras, paired with Panavision Primo 11:1 zoom, Carl Zeiss Ultra Prime, and Fujinon 19-90mm Cabrio Premier lenses. Ruhlmann returned to work with McTeigue in Mexico City, Almesberger with Tykwer in Nairobi, and Toll with Lana Wachowski in all the remaining locations. They used a two camera setup (A and B), with the first being nearly all of the time Steadicam, and the second being hand-held all the time. Toll explained this setup was necessitated by both their tight schedule and large volume of the material, but also by Lana's commitment to stay with the A camera operator, Daniele Massaccesi, and make choices as they were filming. Toll further commented on their approach: \\"We adopted a system of shooting traditional wide master shots and, during the course of the shot, gracefully moving into other angles and even close-ups at times. Essentially, we were often doing masters and coverage within the same take.\\" Toll's cinematography in the third episode of the second season, \\"Obligate Mutualisms\\", was recognized with a nomination for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series (One Hour) during the 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. Toll returned as cinematographer for the series' second special, teaming up again with Lana.  Effects and post- production  Seoul unit director Dan Glass and Jim Mitchell were the visual effects supervisors of the first season. The season had a total VFX shot count of about 1200. An in-house VFX team was established in Chicago which completed over 700 shots. The major external VFX vendors were Locktix VFX (160-180 shots), Technicolor VFX (over 100 shots) and Encore VFX. Additional work was done by Studio 8 FX, Trace VFX and Almost Gold. Because of the series' tight budget and timeline the production made the decision to do most of the effects in-camera and only enhance them digitally where appropriate. In fact for a great number of shots which involved the sensates communicating and visiting each other telepathically the cast were simply moving in and out of the frame in timely fashion requiring no additional work. According to Glass, most of the VFX work that was done is invisible in the final show and consisted mostly of split-screens, crew and rig removal, weather augmentation and screen inserts. Executive producer Grant Hill commented he would be impressed if one would be able to recognize as many as 150 of the 1200 VFX shots, because most of them consisted of small things used to help the narrative, and they do not call attention to themselves. Of the more visible work done, Glass provided the examples of age manipulation of actors, dramatic enhancement of the weather in the car scenes in Iceland, a few greenscreens, and computer generated blades, blood and wounds. Technicolor provided dailies and worked with cinematographer John Toll and the Wachowskis to color grade the show giving it a look which colorist Tony Dustin describes as \\"both real and surreal, with a slightly elevated color-saturation\\". The Wachowskis made the mandate for production to not \\"lock reels\\", as it is typically done on TV shows, but instead be able to tinker editorially with the series' narrative, look and tone up to two weeks before release. They also wanted the color grading of the series to be done in the da Vinci Resolve software and be of theatrical feature film quality. Technicolor finished the show in 4K and delivered both 2K and 4K resolution masters. In the second season, the visual effects supervisors were Dan Glass and Ryan Urban, the latter of whom held the title of digital effects supervisor during the first season. Technicolor were again responsible for managing dailies and color grading the show, while their VFX department delivered over 600 shots this time around. Sense8 was edited in the Wachowskis' headquarters in Chicago, Kinowerks, by Joe Hobeck and Joseph Jett Sally in the first season and by Sally and Fiona Colbeck in the second. Sally previously worked with the Wachowskis as first assistant editor on Speed Racer and editor on Ninja Assassin. The Wachowskis found editing a TV show to be a challenging process because of the required fast turnaround times. Lilly commented that for a feature film they get a minimum of ten weeks for editing as mandated by the Directors Guild of America, while for the first season of Sense8 they had to be moving at a pace of completing two 1-hour episodes (roughly the equivalent of a feature film) every two weeks.  Music  The score of Sense8 was composed by Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer; the two had previously co-composed the score for Cloud Atlas and had a minor contribution in the soundtrack of The Matrix Revolutions as part of Pale 3. Responsible for the orchestration was their fellow Cloud Atlas collaborator Gene Pritsker, and the recording was done by the MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra. Each season's score was written up to a year and a half before filming began, enabling the production to play it back to the actors before shooting a scene. Tykwer, who has made the music for all of his movies this way, introduced to the Wachowskis the concept of first writing the music during pre-production of Cloud Atlas and the sisters have since commented they are not making a movie again a different way. Once a first cut is completed by the editors, the composers do further developing of their tracks. \\"We flesh things out; both expand and refine, write new material and even change direction if it is prudent\\", the composers have explained. The theme music of Sense8 was picked by the Wachowskis from the two hours of original music Tykwer and Klimek had written. It was shortened from its original seven or eight minutes and a choir and electronic elements were added to it at the wish of the Wachowskis. The show received a nomination for Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music during the 68th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. Ethan Stoller, frequent collaborator of the Wachowskis is credited with composing additional music and also being the series' music editor. Long time Klimek and Tykwer collaborator Gabriel Isaac Mounsey is credited as additional score composer for the series and as one of the score mixers in the second season. The title of the first season's fourth episode, \\"What's Going On?\\", refers to lyrics in the song \\"What's Up?\\" by the 4 Non Blondes, which was played in the episode during the main characters' first shared experience together. A soundtrack album for the first season was released digitally by WaterTower Music on May 5, 2017. It includes 10 tracks by Klimek and Tykwer, and the licensed songs \\"What's Up?\\", \\"Kettering\\" by The Antlers, \\"Keep It Close\\" by Seven Lions and featuring Kerli, and \\"Dau√∞alogn\\" by Sigur R√≥s. Klimek and Tykwer's compositions alone, are also available on WaterTower's YouTube channel. Klimek commented on his and Tykwer's collaboration with the Wachowskis for the first season's score: \\"We would often just do a one-week mad writing session. It's a very collaborative process, and there's no ego involved.\\" Lana Wachowski called the score \\"its own unique script and it transports the viewer into the world of Sense8 in ways neither words nor images can\\". For the second season, Klimek and Tykwer provided to the editorial about 10 \\"mother\\" themes, each with a length of over five minutes, before filming began. This time around, Lana experimented more with combining original and source music while working with Mounsey, who in the last episode of the season was credited as composer, along with Klimek and Tykwer. In the Christmas special episode \\"Happy F*cking New Year\\", a cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" is featured, which was arranged by Gary Fry and recorded by the Apollo Chorus of Chicago, with the lead vocalist being Daniel Martin Moore. The sequence, which depicts the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus singing, was originally cut to a different cover of the song, but days before the deadline of completion the licensing deal fell through, and Stoller had to order a custom version to be conducted to match their completed cut. The song was ready in five days, and the producers were happy with the end result, including Netflix, which made the song a prominent feature of the special's marketing campaign. For the fifth episode of the season, \\"Fear Never Fixed Anything\\", Mounsey created a remix of \\"What's Up?\\" to be played by Riley in a club, recalling the first season's appearance of the song.  Title sequence  For the series almost two-minute long title sequence, Karin Winslow rented a car and with the help of a camera assistant traveled in the eight featured countries of the first season and captured over a hundred shots. \\"My directive from Lana was to go out and describe each country by what you see; find the nuances, find the food, find what people are doing, get a feel for the place,\\" said Winslow. For the second season, and again for the finale, some of the footage was replaced by new shots, including a shot of the Wachowskis' parents. The closing credits of each episode credit Winslow for the \\"main title design\\".  Cancellation and revival  Sense8 fans marching during the Gay Pride of Nantes, France, with signs about reverting the show's cancellation. On March 2, 2017, Deadline Hollywood reported that Netflix was in the process of renewing the lapsed contracts of the series' eight leading actors, to keep them available until June of the same year, suggesting that a positive decision to renew Sense8 for a third season before that time passed was highly possible. In early May 2017, producer Malerba said that not all eight regulars of the cast had renewed yet, but the process was still going. Furthermore, he added that a potential third season would likely be the series' last, because of the complicated nature of the series' production, and the fact that starting with the second season Lana Wachowski worked as a filmmaker on it almost alone. On June 1, 2017, Netflix announced they had cancelled the series after two seasons. Shortly later within the month, Chief Content Officer of Netflix Ted Sarandos during his talk on Produced By Conference, commented that the show was cancelled because its audience, despite being very passionate, wasn't large enough to support the high production costs to travel and film around the globe. As a response to the cancellation, fans created online petitions, called Netflix, and tweeted #RenewSense8 and other hashtags, in an attempt to bring back the show. On June 8, 2017, the show's social media accounts acknowledged the fans' efforts, and wrote that Netflix looked into the renewal of Sense8 a second time, however they concluded it wasn't possible. The next day, actor Brian J. Smith released a letter to the fans reiterating the reason for the cancellation was low viewership and thanking Netflix and the fans for their support. Despite Netflix confirming multiple times within the month that there was nothing they could do for the show to return, fans continued to heavily campaign for it. On June 29, 2017, the official social media accounts of the show posted a letter by Lana Wachowski which announced the release of a two- hour special targeting 2018. In her letter, Lana confessed the show's cancellation had made her fall into depression, and thanked the fans, writing that it's only thanks to their strong collective voice that the show's revival was made possible. She also acknowledged the logistics of the show have always been challenging for Netflix. In August 2017, Sarandos said that at first Lana had rejected Netflix's offer of a two-hour special, as her preference was to continue with a new season. She eventually agreed to it, having been influenced by the fans asking for more. A final running time of 151 minutes was reported later.  Future  Netflix billed the second special in their announcement as the series finale, but Lana left open the future of Sense8 past the special's release, writing about it, \\"if this experience has taught me anything, you NEVER know.\\" On August 5, 2017, during a Facebook Live with Lana and the cast about the show's revival, Lana joked that because she believed that the fans of the show would go and create more fans, she was writing the entire third season. Few days later, Smith said during an interview that he believed if \\"a truly eyebrow-raising amount of people\\" watched the special, they would make more. In October, actor Alfonso Herrera said both Lana and the cast want to make more so he's hopeful that the special won't be the end of the series. In mid-August 2017, porn site xHamster wrote an open letter to the Wachowskis, offering to produce the third season, and a few days later received a call from Lana to whom they proposed to be the distribution platform. Screen Rant has criticized Xhamster's move as one of the many publicity stunts that porn companies set out to do to advertise themselves, while Inverse wrote the Wachowskis would never take their show to a platform that uses pejoratives to refer to transgender people.

Few members of this gens are mentioned in history, but a number are known from inscriptions. Origin The nomen Safinius belongs to a class of gentilicia formed from cognomina ending in -inus. The root of the name is Safineis, cognate with the Latin Sabinus, the Oscan name for the Sabellic peoples, including the Sabines and Samnites.Chase, p. 126. Praenomina The chief praenomina of the Safinii were Lucius, Gaius, and Marcus, the three most common names throughout all periods of Roman history. Other common praenomina were occasionally used, including Publius, Quintus, and Titus. Septimus appears in a filiation. It was quite rare as a praenomen, but a fairly common surname, in which form might have been used in the filiation instead of a praenomen. Branches and cognomina The Safinii of imperial times used a wide variety of personal cognomina, but a number of this gens bore the surname Rufus, or its diminutive, Rufinus, originally given to someone with red hair. At least some of these probably constituted a distinct family of the Safinii. Other surnames that might have represented stirpes of the Safinii include Sabellio, belonging to a class of surnames derived from the names of peoples and places, undoubtedly alluding to the Sabellic origin of the gens, and the meaning of its nomen gentilicium; and perhaps Primus, together with its diminutive, Primilla, a name usually signifying the eldest son in a family, although this name might have belonged to otherwise unrelated Safinii, as at least some bearing this name appear to have been freedmen.Chase, pp. 110, 111, 113, 114.

His disagreement with Lord Lytton's Afghan policy led to him being passed over for an expected promotion to be Governor of North West Province. He took early retirement and on his return to Edinburgh, he founded, jointly with his daughter Elsie Inglis, the Scottish Association for the Medical Education of Women. That association established the Edinburgh Medical College for Women at a time that women were not accepted into British university medical schools.  Early life  He was born on 5 August 1820, second youngest son of David Inglis and his wife Martha (n√©e Money). David Inglis had spent most of his life in India as writer, or solicitor, for the East India Company. His father Alexander Inglis, who originated from Kingsmills, Inverness-shire, emigrated to Charleston, South Carolina leaving his son David to be brought up in Scotland by an uncle. John Inglis was tutored by Rev Dr Joseph Niblock, a well known Greek scholar and educator. He then won a place at the East India College at Haileybury, moving to study there in 1839. An incident at the school gives an interesting insight into the adolescence of a young man, described in later life as 'dedicated, pious, godly and 'honest'. On 29 May 1839 the Principal of the East India College at Haileybury, Charles Le Bas, wrote to Inglis' father: 'It is with unfeigned grief that I have to announce to you, that we have been under the afflicting necessity of rusticating your son for the remainder of the present term. You will doubtless recollect that, on a former occasion (Nov. 1838), I had the painful duty of inflicting on him ... a solemn Reprimand & Admonition, for joining a late, and very turbulent party, by which much mischief was done, and several students greatly annoyed and molested. His recent offence is, that ... he dined at an Inn at Hoddesdon, and returned to College in a state of very questionable sobriety ... '.British Library. East India College papers of John Forbes David Inglis. IOR/J/1/57 ff.213-230 From Haileybury College he went to Calcutta where he spent two years learning local languages before being posted as assistant magistrate to Agra.  Career in India  In 1847 he was transferred to Sealcote (now Sialcot) in the Punjab. By 1856 he was married with a young family and returned with them to Britain for prolonged leave. He returned alone to India in 1858 and, working under Sir John Lawrence, Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, was involved in some of the conflicts in the Indian Rebellion, at Najibabad, Bareilly and Rohilkhand. He was made Commissioner of Rohilkhand and became a member of the Legislative Council of India in which capacity he moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1873. In 1875 he was made Chief Commissioner of Oudh State. As Inglis progressed up the ranks of the Indian Civil Service he could count among his personal friends Sir William Muir, foreign secretary to the Indian Government and lieutenant- governor of the North Western Provinces. Muir would later prove an influential friend in his role as Principal of the University of Edinburgh. He remained close to his former mentor Sir John Lawrence and agreed with his ideal that India should become a land 'thickly cultivated by a fat contented yeomanry, each riding his own horse, sitting under his own fig tree and enjoying his rude family comforts.' Lawrence had become Viceroy of India in 1863. With such friends in high places and an unblemished record in India it was anticipated that Inglis would be promoted to be Governor of North Western Provinces. Yet with the change in Viceroy came a change in policy. The appointment of Lord Lytton in 1875 resulted in a harsher Imperial policy. Lytton ordered the invasion of Afghanistan which sparked the Second Anglo-Afghan War. This proved to be a brutal guerrilla war with much loss of life, and Inglis, regarded as a liberal by his superiors, found himself in disagreement with the policy and out of favour with the higher ranks of the Raj. He was passed over for this anticipated promotion and decided to retire, aged 56, and return with his family to Edinburgh, where his married daughter Amy had now settled. They sailed first to Tasmania to spend time with sons George, Hugh and Cecil who had settled there and in 1878 embarked on the journey to Edinburgh.  Personal life  On 7 February 1846 he married Harriet Lowes Thompson, one of nine daughters of George Thompson, an East India Company administrator. She was eighteen at the time of their marriage. They had six children in their 'first family' George David (b 1847), Amy (b 1848), Cecil (b 1849), Hugh (b 1851), Herbert (b 1853) and Ernest (b 1856). In 1856 John Inglis arranged to take the family home to Britain for a period of leave of three years. This proved to be a prolonged journey which took 4 months to reach Bombay and a further 4 moths by sailing ship round Cape Hope to reach England. He was recalled early to India in 1858 because of the Indian Rebellion and returned leaving his family in Southampton. George, Hugh and Herbert were sent to school at Eton, Cecil to Uppingham and Ernest to Rugby, while Amy was looked after by relatives. Once they were settled and events in India were back to 'normal', Harriet Inglis returned to India in 1863 and they had the 'second family' of three further children, Eliza Maude (known as Elsie) (b 1864), Eva Helen (b 1866) and Horace (born 1868). Elsie Inglis, who would become the most famous of his children, was born in the Himalayan hill station town of Naini Tal, in the state of Uttarakhand, When the Inglis family moved to Tasmania the Inglis girls were tutored by Miss Knott, a disciple of Dorothea Beale, a pioneer of education for women.  Edinburgh and medical education for women  In Edinburgh John Inglis arranged for Elsie to attend the new Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women which Sophia Jex-Blake had started in 1886.Roberts, Shirley (1993). Sophia Jex-Blake : a woman pioneer in nineteenth century medical reform. London: Routledge. pp. 174‚Äì179. . OCLC 27770044. When Elsie Inglis emerged as the leader of a group of students who rebelled against what they perceived as Jex-Blake's over severe discipline, John Inglis with his daughter, formed the Scottish Association for the Medical Education of Women. Supporters included his former colleague Sir William Muir, now returned from India as Principal of the University of Edinburgh. The Association established the Edinburgh Medical College for Women, which opened in 1889. The influence of the Association was such that within two years they were able to endow two wards for the teaching of women medical students at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, which had previously refused to allow the teaching of female students. Elsie Inglis went on to become a surgeon, a prominent figure in the suffrage movement and founded the Scottish Women's Hospitals which saw service behind front lines in the First World War. Inglis continued to write almost daily letters, full of encouragement and support, to his daughter Elsie, until his death in 1894. Over 20 years later speaking at a large meeting at the Criterion Theatre in London in April 1916, she acknowledged the importance of his role in her life. 'If I have been able to do anything -whatever I am, whatever I have done - I owe it all to my father.'

The goal of argument mining is the automatic extraction and identification of argumentative structures from natural language text with the aid of computer programs. Such argumentative structures include the premise, conclusions, the argument scheme and the relationship between the main and subsidiary argument, or the main and counter-argument within discourse. The Argument Mining workshop series is the main research forum for argument mining related research.  Applications  Argument mining has been applied in many different genres including the qualitative assessment of social media content (e.g. Twitter, Facebook), where it provides a powerful tool for policy-makers and researchers in social and political sciences. Other domains include legal documents, product reviews, scientific articles, online debates, newspaper articles and dialogical domains. Transfer learning approaches have been successfully used to combine the different domains into a domain agnostic argumentation model. Argument mining has been used to provide students individual writing support by accessing and visualizing the argumentation discourse in their texts. The application of argument mining in a user-centered learning tool helped students to improve their argumentation skills significantly compared to traditional argumentation learning applications.  Challenges  Given the wide variety of text genres and the different research perspectives and approaches, it has been difficult to reach a common and objective evaluation scheme. Many annotated data sets have been proposed, with some gaining popularity, but a consensual data set is yet to be found. Annotating argumentative structures is a highly demanding task. There have been successful attempts to delegate such annotation tasks to the crowd but the process still requires a lot of effort and carries significant cost. Initial attempts to bypass this hurdle were made using the weak supervision approach.

In 534, Dugu Xin followed Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei to the west to join the warlord Yuwen Tai, and in the ensuing years led Western Wei forces against their archnemesis, the Eastern Wei. Despite an early debacle (after which he fled to and stayed for 3 years in the southern Liang dynasty before returning to the northwest), he captured the former Northern Wei capital Luoyang from Eastern Wei in 537. He rose to high ranks under Yuwen Tai, and his eldest daughter married Yuwen Tai's son Yuwen Yu. When the Northern Zhou dynasty replaced Western Wei, Dugu Xin was created Duke of Wei (Ë°õÂúãÂÖ¨), but was soon forced by the powerful regent Yuwen Hu to commit suicide for challenging him. Dugu Xin was described as an extremely handsome man and was fond of wearing strange clothes, he is best remembered today by his 3 daughters: it is because of their marriages that 2 sons-in-law, 1 grandson-in-law and 2 grandsons of his became emperors of 3 Chinese dynasties, all after his death.

Campaigning for women's suffrage and arrest  Frances (Florence) Graves adopted the alias Frances Gordon while campaigning for women's suffrage. Adopting an alias was not uncommon for campaigners, either to avoid their families being condemned by association or to evade capture by police. Gordon and Arabella Scott were prominent in the militant wing of the Scottish women's suffrage movement. The pair were arrested after breaking into Springhall House, a mansion house in Lanarkshire, with the intention of setting it on fire on 3 April 1914. The house was not occupied but a caretaker was awoken by a noise at 2:30am and was astonished to find Gordon in the parlour. The caretaker fired two shots with his revolver to alert the local constable on the beat.The noise of which caused the other suffragettes accompanying Gordon to flee the house. Frightened by the shots, the caretaker was able to lock Gordon in the kitchen and telephone the police. On arrival, the police found three-quarter gallon flasks of paraffin oil, matches and suffrage literature. Gordon was arrested and taken away.  Trial  Gordon was described as a small woman of about forty years of age with a pronounced English accent. The lady owner of Springhall House declined to prosecute Gordon but the public prosecutor decided to proceed with the trial date fixed for 22 June 1914. At the High Court of Glasgow, Gordon was charged with attempting to set fire to Springhall House. Gordon pleaded not guilty and her counsel attempted to have the case thrown out on a technicality - that housebreaking with intent to set a fire was not a crime in Scotland - but the attempt was unsuccessful and the guilty verdict was returned by the jury. She was sentenced to one year's imprisonment. The Glasgow Evening Times covering the trial described \\"Miss Gordon's Remarkable Speech\\" as she left the court. Shouting to the gallery, she cried \\"Trust in God, constant war and fight on.\\" While the Evening Times made no mention of any disturbances, the High Court's own records mention three women being charged with contempt of court \\"in respect that they interrupted the proceedings of the Court by shouting and yelling (or by throwing missiles in the direction of the bench)\\". The three women refused to give their names to court officials.  Imprisonment  While imprisoned in Perth prison, Arabella Scott, Gordon and fellow militant suffragette Fanny Parker were subjected to force-feeding. Dr Hugh Ferguson Watson had already subjected Ethel Moorhead to the treatment at Calton Prison in February 1914. The prisoners' mouths were held open by a metal device so that they could be fed by a funnel connected to a Vaseline-coated rubber tube pushed down their throats into their stomachs. The mixture contained eggs, sweetened milk, and meat juice. Aware of Moorhead's earlier treatment, the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) organised a series of protest meetings in Perth to support the women; picketing the prison, singing hymns and shouting support through a megaphone. In Arabella Scott's autobiography, she describes the experience of being forcibly fed as bits of her broken teeth washed around with blood in her mouth. When she vomited after the tube was removed, \\"He [Watson] shouted at me 'you did that on purpose'.\\" Parker and Gordon also alleged that this force-feeding involved attempts to feed through the rectum and the vagina which resulted in serious damage. Gordon's force- feeding was to last ten days. She was fed with the nasal tube and had injections into her bowel three times a day. Christabel Pankhurst reacted strongly to condemn to this news, \\"To subject her to it without her consent was an act of violence and indecency on the part of the authorities which cannot and will not be tolerated.\\" On 26 June 1914, Dr. Watson, described as an \\"ambitious medical officer who had volunteered to force feed women on hunger strike\\", informed the governor of Perth prison that Gordon was of \\"a highly neurotic and hysterical temperament. There has been more or less nervous prostration since I told her that I had orders to feed her.\\" Even during her sleep, Gordon \\"talked much about tubes and feeding\\". She had a very narrow phalanx and nasal passage and had \\"great difficulty breathing after the tube is passed.\\" Watson recorded that as Gordon vomited so much, he decided to feed her rectally through nutrient enemas in addition to food from the nasal tube from 30 June onwards. At first he was satisfied with the results but then he notes that on 3 July \\"the prisoner's condition now begins to cause anxiety\\". Gordon's temperature fell to 96.4 Fahrenheit and her pulse could sometimes barely be felt at all.  Reaction to news of the force-feeding  The knowledge that new feeding tubes would not always have been available and that used tubes may have been dirty inside or previously used on diseased or mentally inmates may have increased Gordon's distress and the vociferous condemnations by her fellow suffragettes. When Gordon's 'treatment' was revealed, Dr. Watson was stunned by the furore it provoked in others. Lord Hugh Cecil, for one, told the Scottish Office that he intended to ask a question about Gordon's treatment in the House of Commons. On 26 June 1914, Janie Allan, a leading Scottish activist in the militant suffragette movement, wrote to the Chairman of the Prison Commission that the burning down of Whitekirk Church in East Lothian, one of Scotland's most beautiful medieval churches, was the direct result of the force-feeding of Ethel Moorhead in Calton Prison and that the Scottish suffragettes would take strong action if the same was proved to have been inflicted on Arabella Scott and Frances Gordon. Allan also wrote a similar letter to Dr. James Drevon stating that \\"there are many women who, 6 months ago, were not prepared to do anything violently militant, but who today would not hesitate.\\" As a consequence, the planned tour of Scotland by the King and Queen in mid-July would see protests which \\"would be regrettable but to those who know how high feeling runs against forcible feeding, such incidents would cause no surprise.\\" The Scottish Office questioned whether any action could be taken against Janie Allan because of her veiled threats, but the Director of Public Prosecutions advised not. Christabel Pankhurst went further in her condemnation: > \\"This women-torturing government composed, not of men, but surely of devils! > [Forcible feeding represented] all the barbarity, all the blind, brute force > upon which the subjection of women depends... it is the opposition to Votes > for Women.\\" .  Release from prison  On 3 July 1914, Gordon was released from prison under the Cat and Mouse Act and taken to Glasgow. It was there she was examined by Dr. Mabel Jones M.D. The socialist Tom Anderson wrote to the Glasgow Evening Times about the case which quoted from the medical assessment Dr. Mabel Jones conducted on Gordon on her release: > \\"I saw her (Miss. Gordon) at midnight on July 3. Her appearance was > appalling, like a famine victim: the skin brown, her face bones standing > out, her eyes half shut, her voice a whisper, her hands quite cold, her > pulse a thread, her wrist joints slightly swollen, stiff, and painful, the > breath most offensive, and the contents of the bowel beyond control.\\" > Reduced to the nearest point of death possible. Such treatment is barbarous > and it is performed by civilised men because of a political offence, on > women. Is it possible for the race to fall any lower? I don't think so. On 16 July 1914, Lord Hugh Cecil, John Pratt and Maurice Healy all raised the question of Frances Gordon's treatment in the House of Commons. The then Secretary for Scotland (Mr. Mckinnon Wood) replied that: > \\"On admission she was at once put to bed and treated as a sick prisoner. Her > condition required the administration of enemata, and I have no reason to > doubt that in the circumstances the doctor treated her case properly and > humanely.

Launched in 2017, the ship entered service with the RFA in 2019. Construction Tideforce, along with her three sister ships, was built by DSME in South Korea. As the fourth and final Tide-class vessel, her steel was first cut on 2 December 2015 prior to being laid down on 24 December 2015. Around nine months later, the ship was fully assembled and floated out by 12 September 2016. A series of builder's sea trials subsequently commenced and, in June 2018, the ship left South Korea for delivery to the United Kingdom via San Diego and the Panama Canal. The ship arrived in Falmouth for fitting out on 22 August 2018. This involved the installation of communications equipment, defensive systems, a floating helipad and refueling rigs. Following fitting out, the ship carried out capability assessment trials, replenishment at sea (RAS) trials and first-of-class flying trials. Her first RAS was carried out with off the Isle of Portland and a RAS with her sistership occurred shortly thereafter. In July 2019, she achieved further milestones, carrying out her first RAS with the aircraft carrier , as well as her first RAS with a foreign vessel, of the Royal Netherlands Navy.

Tideforce entered service with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary on 30 July 2019, the last of her class to do so following sister ships Tidespring, Tiderace and Tidesurge. In September, the ship joined the UK Carrier Strike Group on its three-month Westlant 19 deployment to the United States. In August 2020, Tideforce rendezvoused with Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 to provide replenishment. In March, whilst conducting aviation training off the Devon and Dorset coast, Tideforce responded to an emergency call from a Dutch-flagged ship and provided assistance to an injured sailor. During the same month, the ship joined eight UK naval ships in responding to seven Russian vessels near British waters. In June, the ship carried out the first night time replenishment at sea with a Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier.

It was inaugurated by the Everett Railway & Electric Co. of Everett, on December 1, 1903.  Lease  The electric cars replaced steam trains on the track formerly used by the Northern Pacific Railway for its local trains, as a branch of its trans-continental system. The Electric Company has negotiated a lease of the track from the Northern Pacific for a term of several years, undertaking to make connections with all Northern Pacific trains at Snohomish, and handle all its passenger, regular baggage and express business between Everett and Snohomish. Transcontinental passengers, baggage and express over the Northern Pacific were handled by the Electric company between Everett and Snohomish, using Electric company pasters on all through tickets.Street Railway Review, Vol. XIV, No. 2, Feb 20, 1904, p. 79-81.  Stations  The interurban served two terminals at Everett and Snohomish and six intermediate stops in various towns and neighborhoods. Each stop had an estimated population of about 200 people.  Electrification  Straight track and pole construction, double deck trestle high and typical curve and overhead work The overhead trolley system consisted of No. 0000 Fig. 8 trolley wire supported every by flexible brackets on side pole construction. The Ohio Brass Co's. material was used exclusively for trolley construction. The long poles were of cedar, at the top, and were set in the ground and placed from the rail. The trolley wire was from the top of the rail, on account of danger to brakemen on steam freight trains if lower construction was used. On account of the distance of the poles from the track, a bracket was used. A 350,000 c.m. (177 mm¬≤) feeder cable was used to within a mile (1.6 km) of the end of the line, taps being made every , while another 350,000 c.m. (177 mm¬≤) cable was used to a point from the power house, at the point of heaviest grade. Drawbridge with pivot pole for overhead lines Two draw bridges were crossed by this railroad, necessitating a pivot pole in the center of the draw span carrying the trolley, feeder, and return current cables up over this pole high enough to allow the passage of vessels up the river. Taps are made off of these cables at the pivot pole to the trolley and track on the bridge. The entire construction of this railroad had to be done, while the Northern Pacific was operating an average of ten steam trains a day over it, making the work extremely difficult and hazardous. On account of the danger involved and the novel construction, the work was done under the personal supervision of the company's general superintendent, Mr. R. P. Stevens. The track was bonded with Ohio Brass Co's. flexible No. 0000 bonds, with compressed terminals, which were expanded into holes in the rails. This bond was long and placed under the angle bars. No. 0000 cross bonds of the same type were used every . Power for the operation of this railroad was furnished from the Everett power house of the Everett Railway & Electric Co., about from the further end of the line, and 1 mile (1.6 km) from the Everett terminal.A complete description of this power house was given in the Street Railway Review of May 20, 1903, p. 267-271.  Rolling stock  The rolling stock used on this line consisted of two passenger cars and one combination passenger and baggage car. The passenger cars were long and wide. They provided seats for 48 people. The slightly longer combination cars were overall long and wide. It seated 40 people and had a long baggage compartment. The cars had cross seats, and windows with double sash, the upper sash being stationary and the lower sash dropping down. They were heated with the Consolidated Car Heater Co's eight-heater equipments and were mounted on Brill No. 27-E-1 trucks with and spoke wheels, made by St. Louis Car Co. Westinghouse No. 68 motors, four to a car, hung inside. Westinghouse K-6 controllers, and Westinghouse air brakes were used on all three cars.  Operation  The operation laid under telegraphic train orders from the chief dispatcher of the Northern Pacific at Seattle, the card system being used on this block on account of the frequency of the service, and the Northern Pacific still operating its freight trains on this line. The fare from Everett to Snohomish one way was 25 cents. Round trip tickets were sold for 40 cents, including transfer from or to any part of the city. Tickets were sold at stations at each end of the line and on the cars, cash fare receipts being given by the conductors. Five cents were charged between any two stations.  Closure  The interurban's trestle between Lowell and Snohomish was destroyed during a major flood in December 1921. The interurban was not rebuilt and soon abandoned. A section of the interurban's right of way in northern Snohomish is preserved as a gravel pedestrian trail.

His position of choice is loosehead prop. He has previously represented the Chiefs in Super Rugby, Narbonne in the French Rugby Pro Division 2 and has also earned 13 test caps for New Zealand since his international debut in 2018. Tu'inukuafe was also a nominee for World Rugby's Breakthrough Player of the Year award in 2018. Early life Tu'inukuafe is an ex-pupil of Wesley College and played for their 1st XV Rugby team alongside current Blues teammate Nepo Laulala, as well as former All Blacks Malakai Fekitoa and Augustine Pulu. Tu'inukuafe worked as a Security Guard prior to signing to play for the North Harbour Rugby Union in 2015. Playing career =Early career= Tu'inukuafe rose to prominence in the 2018 Super Rugby season when he was selected for the Chiefs as injury cover after season-ending injuries to rookies Aidan Ross and Atunaisa Moli. Tu'inukuafe became a regular starter for the Chiefs almost immediately and made 16 appearances for the club during 2018. Tu'inukuafe was later selected for the All Blacks after Tim Perry was ruled out of the first two mid-year tests against France. Tu'inukuafe made his debut against France in their first June test match, which took place on 9 June 2018. Tu'inukuafe replaced Joe Moody off the bench, early in the second- half and was one of the best performing substitute players as the All Blacks won 52‚Äì11. Tu'inukuafe replaced Moody off the bench in the next two tests of the series, including the final, which the All Blacks won by 49‚Äì14, making the series a 3‚Äì0 win for New Zealand. After starting for the Chiefs in their Super Rugby quarter-final against the Hurricanes on 20 July 2018, the Super Rugby season ended for Tu'inukuafe, with the Chiefs losing 31-32. Following the match, it was announced that Tu'inukuafe had committed to New Zealand Rugby until 2021. Tu'inukuafe is scheduled to move to the Blues for the 2019 Super Rugby season as part of his three-year deal. Tu'inukuafe made his first start for the All Blacks during the 2018 Rugby Championship, starring in a 46-24 victory over Argentina's Los Pumas on 8 September. Tu'inukuafe was replaced by Tim Perry in the 59th minute and was one of the best-performing All Blacks against Los Pumas. Tu'inukuafe started again the following week, against South Africa's Springboks, after Joe Moody was ruled out with injury for the rest of the competition. New Zealand had a shock loss to South Africa, losing 34-36, despite Tu'inukuafe's 59-minute dominance over South African counterpart props, Frans Malherbe and Wilco Louw. Tu'inukuafe started in the last two tests against both Argentina and South Africa, both of which were wins for the All Blacks, winning them the competition and cementing his own place as a regular starter for his country. Although Joe Moody returned from injury for the All Blacks' 2018 end-of-year tour, he was injured once again, with a cut eye, leaving Tu'inukuafe as the first-choice loosehead prop for the rest of the tour. Tu'inukuafe started against England, who had not played the All Blacks in four years, contributing 57 minutes of play towards the All Blacks' narrow 16-15 win over England. The following week, Tu'inukuafe then started against Ireland, who the All Blacks lost to, 9-16. Tu'inukuafe was unsurprisingly out-classed by his opposite, Irish prop Tadhg Furlong, with New Zealand's whole front-row only lasting for 46 minutes in the loss to Ireland. He finished his year off, replacing Ofa Tu'ungafasi against Italy, in a 66-3 win. =2019-present= Although he established himself as a key member of the Blues' front row during the 2019 Super Rugby season, Tu'inukuafe failed to make the field for New Zealand in the 2019 Rugby Championship, with his former Chiefs teammate, Atu Moli, returning from long-term leg injuries. Having missed two months of rugby due to illness, Tu'inukuafe was dropped prior to the 2019 Rugby World Cup.

He is known for his role in moving towards a peaceful extension of French influence in Morocco. Early years (1856‚Äì95) Am√©d√©e Marie Joseph Paul R√©voil was born on 3 May 1856 in N√Æmes, Gard. His parents were Henri Antoine R√©voil (1822‚Äì1900), Chief Architect in the Monuments Historiques, and Louise Henriette Ana√Øs Baragnon (1829‚Äì1870). He studied law and published his thesis for a license, De l'Usufruit, in Paris on 30 May 1877. He was a member of the Conf√©rence Mol√©-Tocqueville, where on 13 March 1877 his proposal to limit the Legion of Honour decoration to military services was examined. Paul R√©voil was Chief of Staff of Jules Develle at the Ministry of Agriculture from 1890 to 1893 before following Deville to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, again as Chief of Staff. On 30 October 1893 he was appointed Deputy Director of Commercial Affairs at the Consulates department. He was promoted to Directeur du cabinet on 12 January 1895. On 31 October 1895 Revoil was named Minister Plenipotentiary to Rio de Janeiro. Morocco (1896‚Äì1901) On 10 January 1896 R√©voil became deputy to the Resident General in Tunis. He was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Tangier, Morocco. The French were profoundly suspicious of English motives in Morocco, and thought they wanted to bring Morocco under their influence. R√©voil even told Abel Combarieu(fr), secretary-general of the √âlys√©e Palace, that if persuasion, bribery and intimidation did not work, it was expected that the wives of English diplomats would sacrifice their honour for the sake of England. In April 1900 Alfred Le Chatelier wrote and printed the brochure Lettre √† un Alg√©rien sur la politique saharienne, which he sent to leading politicians. The brochure showed the risks of rash action on the Moroccan border and called for a cautious but firm policy. Eug√®ne √âtienne and R√©voil both supported the brochure, and Le Chatelier was established as a force to be considered in setting North African policy. In 1900 Th√©ophile Delcass√©, Minister of Foreign Affairs, named Revoil, one of √âtienne's closest friends, as head of the Tangier legation. This signalled the growing importance of Morocco to French policy. Algeria (1901‚Äì03) Paul R√©voil by Eug√®ne Pirou In June 1901 R√©voil left Tangier to become Governor General of Algeria in place of Jonnart. He was replaced in Tangier by Georges Saint-Ren√© Taillandier. He accepted the job in Algeria after some resistance, pleading poor health and the need to settle important issues in Morocco. He was persuaded by Delcass√©, Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau, Minister of the Interior and President of the Council, and his friend Alexandre Millerand. Delcass√© thought that R√©voil would prevent any military adventures. In July 1901 R√©voil wrote that after 70 years of French rule in Algeria it was finally becoming possible to exploit the Sahara commercially and strategically, linking France's West African territories to Mauritania and French Sudan. At this time the status of the territories to the south of the traditional Algerian provinces was unclear. Stephen Pichon considered that a distinction should be made between Algeria and \\"territories annexed to Algeria\\". This would allow the authorities to determine the date from which the inhabitants were French subjects. Revoil was impatient with this question and wrote, \\"there can be no question of a distinction, in my view, between 'Algeria' and 'territories annexed to Algeria. He admitted that there had been no real annexation, but only \\"a police action in regions that we had always regarded as having belonged to French territory. He could not delimit the physical boundaries of the southern territories, but thought any person from a place under nominal French authority must be considered French. During the two years he spent in Algeria R√©voil followed a policy of cooperation with Morocco with the goal of avoiding military incidents in the border. In the summer of 1901 he went with the Moroccan envoy to Paris for talks about the frontier question, and acted as the main negotiator for France. On 20 July 1901 Revoil and representatives of Sultan Abdelaziz of Morocco signed the Protocol of Paris to define the border between Algeria and Morocco. The protocol of 20 July 1901 was confirmed by a protocol of 20 April 1902. Morocco recognized that Tuat was French territory, and agreed that in future when marauding tribesmen caused border incidents the agents of the two government should settle the issue on the spot through joint consultations. Under the 1901 protocol two commissioners, Mohammed Guebbas of Morocco and General Auguste Constant Cauchemez of France, would go to the Guir-Zousfana region to implement the agreements. They would inform the people of the oases of the way the protocol affected them, would appoint local commissioners to regulate tribal disputes, and would choose places for the Moroccan police and customs posts and the police posts in the ksour of Figuig. This last was the most important to Revoil, since many of the tribesmen who had attacked French supply lines had taken refuge in the oasis of Figuig. The railway from Dj√©niane Bourzeg had already extended to about from Figuig, and was to be extended towards Igli. It was essential that French troops have control of all the areas around the Oued Zouzfana valley so they could protect the line. R√©voil created the position of \\"director of economic services\\" for Henri de Peyerimhoff, who settled with his wife in Algiers in April 1902. R√©voil later resigned due to political disputes and was replaced by Charles Jonnart. He left office on 11 April 1903. Peyerimhoff prepared a huge survey of the results of colonization that was published in 1906. Last years (1903‚Äì14) Opening session of the Algeciras Conference On 6 June 1903 R√©voil was assigned to study the potential for developing indigenous societies of agricultural insurance in Tunisia along the lines of existing institutions in Algeria. R√©voil led the French delegation at the Algeciras Conference from 16 January 1906 to 7 April 1906, which aimed to resolve the First Moroccan Crisis. R√©voil collaborated closely with his British counterpart, Sir Arthur Nicholson. He consulted with Nicholson before taking any important step, and was kept informed by Nicholson of the views of the other delegates. R√©voil gave credit to the Archives marocaines of the Mission scientifique du Maroc (MSM, Scientific Mission of Morocco) for providing the French delegates with the advantage of accurate information on subjects such as the legitimacy of expropriation under Sharia law. R√©voil said, \\"The MSM is thus one of the most justified institutions of our Moroccan policy. One can say that it has imposed itself even upon our most informed experts. R√©voil was detached on 15 June 1906 by order of Maurice Rouvier, Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of the Council. On 26 September 1906 in Bern Revoil signed for France the International Convention Respecting the Prohibition of Night Work for Women in Industrial Employment. He was appointed ambassador to Bern, Switzerland, on 28 November 1906. He was appointed ambassador to Madrid, Spain, on 28 January 1907. He held office until 1909. He retired on 29 July 1910. He spent the last years of his life as director of the Ottoman Bank in Paris. It was through R√©voil's influence that the Baux Valley Canal was built in 1914 near his home at Mouri√®s, Bouches du Rh√¥ne, to cope with periods of drought. He helped provide a supply of drinking water to Mouri√®s. R√©voil died on 28 April 1914 in Mouri√®s. The center of Mouri√®s is named the Cours Paul Revoil. The village of Revoil Beni Ounif, by the Beni Ounif oasis in the department of Oran near Saoura, was founded in 1916 and named in his honour.

She went to high- school at Pax Christi College in Druten, Netherlands and after this she studied art at the Utrecht School of the Arts, graduating in 1988. =Early career= After art school, Airco went to work as an art director and freelance designer for several years. In 2006 she attended a screen printing course at MK24 in Amsterdam. Slowly she started going back to her first love: painting. In 2011, she went to the Art Students League of New York, where she perfected her oil painting skills. She still calls painting an eternal struggle. =Exhibitions and major projects= Airco is a women's rights and human rights activist. In 2013, Airco asked 16 different Chinese artists to paint a different part of the face of the Dalai Lama. The artists made a painting of a nose, ear or a peace of skin, while they thought they were painting a mango, curtain or other object. It had to be done this way, because the image of the Dalai Lama is forbidden in China. They sent the pieces to the Netherlands where Airco assembled everything to a portrait. It was offered to the Dalai Lama by the International Campaign for Tibet on his birthday on July 6 2014. In 2017, she took part in several Nasty Women exhibitions and co- organized the one in Amsterdam at Josilda da Concei√ß√£o Gallery.

It has been introduced to many other areas, notably including southern Australia where it became widespread, and several parts of Europe. Description Panicum hillmannii is a perennial grass that resembles the related P. capillare (hairy panic) in habitat and appearance. It is distinguished by slightly stiffer panicles, firmer foliage, the rachilla shortly developed between the upper and lower glumes, the sterile floret which has the palea developed; and larger darker fertile lemma (up to 2mm long) with a prominent crescent-shaped scar at its base. Distribution and habitat Panicum hillmannii is native to Southwest United States. It was introduced to Australia in the early 1900s, and has spread across South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania, sharing the habitat with related native witchgrass (P. effusum). It was also introduced to Europe, and specimens have been found in France, Belgium, Austria and Germany, although it remains relatively rare there and confined to agricultural weed in maize fields and habitats such as roadsides. Like several other Panicum species (P. capillare and P. effusum), Hillman's panicgrass can become a tumbleweed under extremely dry conditions, and can become a nuisance in residential areas due to the accumulation of grass stalks. Dry tumbleweed poses a serious fire danger. The plant is potentially harmful for grazing livestock, as it contains saponins causing liver damage in animals.

He played at the tackle position for Yale's 1891, 1892, and 1893 championship teams, coached the 1894 Centre football team, and was the player-coach on the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club professional football teams from 1895 to 1897. He was the general superintendent of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company's Pittsburgh coke ovens and blast furnaces from approximately 1899 to 1911 and the president of the Eureka Fire Brick Company for many years commencing in 1907. Early years Born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (now part of Pittsburgh) in 1873, Messler was the son of Thomas D. Messler (1834‚Äì1893), an executive with the Pennsylvania Railroad, and Maria Remsen (Varick) Messler. He was educated in the Allegheny schools and later at the Shady Side Academy. Messler enrolled at the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University in 1891. He played college football on Yale's freshman and varsity football team in 1891. He played at the tackle position under Yale's head coach Walter Camp and was a member of Camp's undefeated 1892 Yale team. In his final year at Yale, he played for the 1893 Yale team. In the three years that Messler played football for Yale, the teams were recognized as national champion each year, compiled an overall record of 36‚Äì1, and outscored opponents by a total of 1,247 to 12. Messer also competed on the Yale crew, served as class president for two years, and graduated in 1894 with a degree in mechanical engineering. Coaching career He served as the head football coach at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky in 1894. Messler arrived in Danville in mid-September and was greeted at the railroad depot with \\"ringing cheers\\" by a delegation of students. Messler promptly initiated daily training for the football candidates and was credited with implementing \\"a course of systematic work and active training.\\" He led the 1894 Centre football team to a 3‚Äì1 record, including a 110‚Äì0 victory over Bethel College and a 67‚Äì0 victory over Kentucky State (now known as the University of Kentucky). The team's only loss was by a 6‚Äì0 score to a Vanderbilt team that compiled a 7‚Äì1 record. Messler was also the coach and a player for the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, an early professional football team, from 1895 to 1897. The team was the champion of Western Pennsylvania Independent Football in 1895. Business career and later years Messler began a career in business with the Carnegie Steel Company at the Edger Thompson Works and later worked for Jones & Laughlin Steel Co. In May 1895, Messler served as engineer overseeing the construction of the Duquesne blast furnaces and later became the general superintendent of labor. He favored an induced draft that could vary the pressure in furnaces so they would not have to depend entirely on a stack, noting that excessive temperatures were an unnecessary test on the brick linings. He was the general superintendent of Jones & Laughlin's coke ovens and blast furnaces from approximately 1899 to 1911. From 1912 to 1915 he was assistant to the president at the Riter-Conley Manufacturing Company, and from 1916 to 1918 was vice president of the Witherow Steel Company. He also served as president of the Eureka Fire Brick Company for many years commencing in 1907. Messler also served as the director of the Fisher Scientific Company and the Scientific Materials Company. At one time he was also the director of the Third National Bank of Pittsburgh. He was a member of several societies, including the National Geographic Society, the Engineer's Society of Western Pennsylvania, the Iron and Steel Institute, and the Pittsburgh Athletic Association. He was an avid big-game hunter and was an amateur tennis player. Messler also served in the United States Army during World War I, after being commissioned captain of engineers on May 20, 1918. He served in France with the American Expeditionary Forces and attaining the rank of major in the Army reserves. He participated in the Meuse‚ÄìArgonne offensive and became friends with Gen. John J. Pershing. He received the Victory Medal with two battle clasps for his service. Messler remained active in Army reserve organizations, retiring as a colonel in 1947. In 1898, Messler married Elizabeth Verner Long. They had two sons: Thomas Doremus Messler and Eugene Lawrence Messler Jr. Messler was the victim of a hit-and-run driver in approximately 1945, which significantly impacted his health. He died in 1950 at age 76 at Pittsburgh's West Penn Hospital. The cause of death was intestinal obstruction, and he is buried in Homewood Cemetery.

It was released worldwide on October 9, 2018 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It is the twentieth game made in the WWE game series (sixth under the WWE 2K banner), and the successor to WWE 2K18. WWE 2K19 was the last WWE game to be developed by Yuke's after 18 years of being in development within the franchise. A sequel, WWE 2K20, was released on October 22, 2019, this time being developed by Visual Concepts. Gameplay In an interview with Hardcore Gamer, WWE 2K creative director Lynell Jinks stated that WWE 2K19 would be moving away from the simulation- styled gameplay of the last four WWE games, in favor of faster, more fluid gameplay, saying \\"[The fans] kind of got turned off by the product we were giving them and we had to think outside the box and they never thought that we‚Äôd do it. The core was simulation, and people got turned off by that and we were hearing loud and clear that they weren‚Äôt buying it anymore and that was the driving force behind all of that.\\" He added \\"We were hearing from the fanbase that it was too slow, too sluggish and it wasn‚Äôt any fun anymore.\\" =Game modes= WWE 2K19 features many different returning and new game modes, including the 2K Showcase Mode, focusing on the career of Daniel Bryan. This is the first Showcase to be featured in the series since WWE 2K17's Hall of Fame Showcase DLC. Players take control of 11 different unique models of Daniel Bryan, in 11 matches, including his Velocity match against John Cena. Two new \\"Tower\\" modes are present in 2K19. In MyPlayer Towers mode, wrestlers or created superstars can participate in challenges online or offline. Daily, Weekly and Pay-Per-View challenge towers are also introduced. In WWE Towers, There are two types of Towers including the Gauntlet Tower, where players must complete the Tower entirely in one session. Losing a match or quitting resets the progress to square one. In the Steps Tower, the players' progress is saved after each match, so they can play at their own pace. MyCareer mode has been reinvented with the focus of a more linear storyline that centers the player's created character as an aspiring wrestler, working his or her way up from independent wrestling promotions to the WWE. Barron Blade, a fictional character featured in previous MyCareer modes, also returns and acts as the created player's guide. The Road to Glory mode returns from previous entries, with the ability to now join one of eight different factions.  Release  On June 15, 2018, 2K announced WWE 2K19.

Polar Star was an all-metal Northrop Gamma, which had a low- wing, reducing the effects of winds and wide skis that could be swapped with wheels or pontoons and a cruising range of . Polar Star shipped to the Antarctic in 1934 on HMAS Wyatt Earp, based in Norway. Australian explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins was the advisor and Norwegian-American explorer Bernt Balchen served as the first pilot. The expedition reached the Bay of Whales by ship on 6 January 1934, and Ellsworth intended to make a round-trip flight with Balchen between the Bay of Whales and the Weddell Sea. However, the skis broke on the ice. Polar Star loading on HMAS Wyatt Earp In September 1934 a second attempt to fly Polar Star in the Antarctic was unsuccessful as well. Finally, in late 1935, Ellsworth's third attempt with a new pilot, Herbert Hollick- Kenyon, was successful. The aircraft flew for 14 hours and, although the fuselage was damaged on landing, the aircraft was able to fly again. For this achievement, Ellsworth was awarded the National Geographic Society‚Äôs Hubbard Medal by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in April 1936 for distinction within exploration, discovery and research. Also in 1936 he was declared an honorary member of the Norwegian Geographical Society. In 1936, Ellsworth donated Polar Star to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. It is now housed at the National Air and Space Museum.

History The farm was founded in the 1820s for William H. Murray, a corn and livestock farmer who owned 20 slaves by 1850. It was passed on to his son Hiram in 1851, who owned 39 slaves prior to the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì1865. Hiram served in the Confederate States Army, and some of his slaves became tenant farmers in the postbellum era. By 1874, the farm was inherited by his Hiram's son, Davis, who lived here with his wife and their six children. Architectural significance The house was designed in the I-house style. A portico designed in the Greek Revival architectural style was added in 1851. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since July 31, 1991.
